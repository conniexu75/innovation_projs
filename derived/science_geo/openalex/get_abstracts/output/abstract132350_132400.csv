https://openalex.org/W2143070723,"The potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans is an integral membrane protein with sequence similarity to all known K + channels, particularly in the pore region. X-ray analysis with data to 3.2 angstroms reveals that four identical subunits create an inverted teepee, or cone, cradling the selectivity filter of the pore in its outer end. The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K + channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K + ions but not smaller Na + ions. The selectivity filter contains two K + ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K + ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K + conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2090936658,"Many plants, including Arabidopsis , show increased resistance to freezing after they have been exposed to low nonfreezing temperatures. This response, termed cold acclimation, is associated with the induction of COR (cold-regulated) genes mediated by the C-repeat/drought-responsive element (CRT/DRE) DNA regulatory element. Increased expression of Arabidopsis CBF1, a transcriptional activator that binds to the CRT/DRE sequence, induced COR gene expression and increased the freezing tolerance of nonacclimated Arabidopsis plants. We conclude that CBF1 is a likely regulator of the cold acclimation response, controlling the level of COR gene expression, which in turn promotes tolerance to freezing."

The coverage of any one engine is significantly limited: No single engine indexes more than about one-third of the “indexable Web,” the coverage of the six engines investigated varies by an order of magnitude, and combining the results of the six engines yields about 3.5 times as many documents on average as compared with the results from only one engine. Analysis of the overlap between pairs of engines gives an estimated lower bound on the size of the indexable Web of 320 million pages."
https://openalex.org/W2089192108,"One of the most common modes of accessing information in the World Wide Web is surfing from one document to another along hyperlinks. Several large empirical studies have revealed common patterns of surfing behavior. A model that assumes that users make a sequence of decisions to proceed to another page, continuing as long as the value of the current page exceeds some threshold, yields the probability distribution for the number of pages that a user visits within a given Web site. This model was verified by comparing its predictions with detailed measurements of surfing patterns. The model also explains the observed Zipf-like distributions in page hits observed at Web sites."
https://openalex.org/W2068109231,"An ultrasound method based on radiation force is presented for imaging the acoustic response of a material to mechanical excitation. Acoustic energy was emitted from solids and tissues in response to an oscillatory radiation force produced by interfering focused beams of ultrasound. Frequency spectra of ultrasound-stimulated acoustic emission exhibited object resonances. Raster-scanning the radiation force over the object and recording the amplitude and phase of the emitted sound resulted in data from which images related to the elastic compositions of the acoustically emitting objects could be computed. Acoustic emission signals distinguished tuning-fork resonances, submillimeter glass spheres, and calcification in excised arteries and detected object motions on the order of nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W2045114648,"The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved family of homologous proteins that suppress apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli. Some IAP family proteins, including XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, can bind and directly inhibit selected caspases, a group of intracellular cell death proteases. These caspase-inhibiting IAP family proteins all contain three tandem BIR domains followed by a RING zinc finger domain. To determine the structural basis for caspase inhibition by XIAP, we analyzed the effects of various fragments of this IAP family protein on caspase activity in vitro and on apoptosis suppression in intact cells. The RING domain of XIAP failed to inhibit the activity of recombinant caspases-3 or -7, whereas a fragment of XIAP encompassing the three tandem BIR domains potently inhibited these caspases in vitro and blocked Fas (CD95)-induced apoptosis when expressed in cells. Further dissection of the XIAP protein demonstrated that only the second of the three BIR domains (BIR2) was capable of binding and inhibiting these caspases. The apparent inhibition constants (Ki) for BIR2-mediated inhibition of caspases-3 and -7 were 2–5 nm, indicating that this single BIR domain possesses potent anti-caspase activity. Expression of the BIR2 domain in cells also partially suppressed Fas-induced apoptosis and blocked cytochrome c-induced processing of caspase-9 in cytosolic extracts, whereas BIR1 and BIR3 did not. These findings identify BIR2 as the minimal caspase-inhibitory domain of XIAP and indicate that a single BIR domain can be sufficient for binding and inhibiting caspases.

In all cases examined thus far, apoptosis has been shown to depend upon the activation of a group of intracellular cysteine proteases with specificity for aspartic acid in the P1 position of substrates, called caspases (reviewed in Ref. 20Salvesen G.S.

The human XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 proteins can bind to and directly inhibit selected caspases. The caspases identified as targets of these IAP family proteins thus far include caspases-3, -7, and -9 but not caspases-1, 2, 8, or 10 (9Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 all contain three tandem copies of a ∼70-amino acid motif termed the BIR (baculovirusIAP repeat) domain, reflecting the historical discovery of IAP family proteins originally in baculoviruses by Miller and colleagues (1Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 11Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These IAP family proteins also contain a RING zinc finger domain near their C termini. The IAP family protein NAIP, in contrast, contains three tandem BIRs but lacks the RING domain (3Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M. Shutler G. Yaraghi Z. Farahani R. Baird S. Besner-Johnson A. Lefebvre C. Kang X. Salih M. Aubry H. Tamai K. Guan X. Ioannou P. Crawford T.O. de Jong P.J. Surh L. Ikeda J.-E.

An additional member of the human IAP family, survivin, contains only a single BIR domain but nevertheless can suppress apoptosis in cells (8Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). The IAP family proteins of Drosophila and the insect-infecting baculoviruses all contain two or three tandem copies of the BIR domain followed by a RING domain (1Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Deletional analyses of the Drosophila and baculovirus IAP family proteins have produced conflicting results, with some studies suggesting a critical role for both the BIR and RING domains and others implying that BIRs are directly involved in apoptosis suppression with the RING motif functioning possibly as a negative regulatory domain (2Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar,12Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The structural similarities and differences among IAP family proteins prompted us to address the question of what constitutes the minimal domain necessary for inhibition of caspases and suppression of apoptosis. Using the human XIAP protein as a model, we determined that only one of the three BIR domains present within this protein was clearly capable of inhibiting caspases-3 and -7, as well as suppressing apoptosis when expressed in cells. These observations demonstrated that a single BIR domain can be sufficient for binding and inhibiting caspases and imply that all BIR domains may not be functionally equivalent, despite their extensive amino acid sequence identity. Plasmids encoding fragments of the XIAP protein, including BIR1+2+3 (residues 1–336), RING (residues 337–497), BIR1 (residues 1–123), BIR2 (residues 124–260), BIR3 (residues 261–336), BIR2+3 (residues 124–336), and BIR1+2 (residues 1–260) were created by a one-step polymerase chain reaction method employing a plasmid encoding a full-length XIAP as the template (10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) and using 5′-GGAATTCATGACTTTTAACAGTTTTGAAG-3′ (BIR1+2+3, BIR1 and BIR1+2), 5′-GGAATTCCAGCTGCAAGAGGAGAAGCTTTG-3′ (RING), 5′-GGAATTCAGAGATCATTTTGCCTTAGACA-3′ (BIR2 and BIR2+3), or 5′-GGATTCTCCATGGCAGATTATGAAGC-3′ (BIR3) as the forward primer and 5′-CTCTCGAGCATGCCTACTATAGAGTTAGA-3′ (RING), 5′-CTCTCGAGCTACTTGTCCCTTCTGTTCTAACAG-3′ (BIR1+2+3, BIR3 and BIR2+3), 5′-CTCTCGAGCTATGGATTTCTTGGAAGATTTGTTG-3′ (BIR2 and BIR1+2(, or 5′-CTCTCGAGTTACCCCATGGATCCCAGATAGTTTTCAACT-3′ (BIR1) as the reverse primer. The BIR1+3 mutant protein (see Fig. 1) was prepared by ligating the BIR1 and BIR3 polymerase chain reaction fragments digested with EcoRI+NcoI and NcoI+XhoI, respectively. All the fragments were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and/or pcDNA3-myc (10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. The proper construction of all the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For production of BIR1+2+3 and RING, pGEX4T-1-XIAP mutant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) containing the plasmid pT-Trx (13Yamakawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). BIR1, BIR2, and BIR3 were produced in XL-1 blue cells (Stratagene, Inc). The GST fusion proteins were prepared from the soluble fraction upon induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 12 h, affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Coomassie staining analysis of GST fusion proteins following SDS-PAGE revealed ≥80% intact protein in all cases except BIR3 (see text). His6-tagged caspase-3 and -7 recombinant proteins are prepared as described (14Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Caspase-3 and -7 activities were assayed by release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (AFC) from Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD)-AFC using continuous reading instruments as described (15Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Apparent Ki values were determined using 0.1–0.3 nm caspases and a range of concentrations of recombinant XIAP or XIAP deletion mutants, as described previously (9Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar,10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). 2 μg of His6-tagged caspases-3 and -7 were immobilized on 4 μl of Ni2+-Sepharose and incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated, [35S]l-methionine-labeled BIR1, BIR2, BIR2+3, BIR1+2, or BIR1+3 proteins that were prepared from pcDNA3-myc (XIAP mutants) templates using a coupled transcription/translation system involving rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TNT-lysate, Promega, Inc.) and T7 RNA polymerase. Incubations were performed in 0.1 ml of caspase buffer, consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with 1 ml of caspase buffer three times before resuspending samples in boiling Laemmli buffer and analyzing by SDS-PAGE using 750 mmTris/15% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. Cytosolic extracts were prepared using 293 cells as described (10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled in vitro translated pro-caspase-9 (1 μl) was added to 5 μl of extracts, and caspase activation was initiated by addition of 10 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) and 1 mm dATP at 30 °C. Subconfluent 293 cells were transfected in 3-cm-diameter wells using a calcium phosphate method with 0.5 μg of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker plasmid pEGFP (CLONTECH), 1 μg of pCMV-Fas expression plasmid (16Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of either pcDNA3-myc-XIAP mutant plasmids or the control plasmid pcDNA3-myc tag. After culturing ∼1 day, both floating and attached cells were collected, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and stained with 10 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The percentage of apoptotic cells revealed by DAPI staining was counted among the GFP-positive cells by fluorescence microscopy. Transfected 293 cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 142 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and used for immunoblot analysis (9Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Samples were normalized for total protein content (25 μg), and immunoblot analysis was performed using 750 mmTris/12–15% polyacrylamide gels and anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz, Inc.) with emission chemiluminescence-based detection (9Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 depicts the fragments of XIAP that were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria and affinity purified. The roles of the BIR and RING domains in inhibition of caspases were examined using a C-terminal truncation mutant of XIAP that contained the three tandem BIRs but lacked the downstream linker region and RING domain (BIR1+2+3) and a XIAP fragment lacking the N-terminal BIR domain but retaining the linker and RING regions (RING). Comparison were made of the effects of the BIR1+2+3 (residues 1–336) and RING (residues 337–497) fragments on recombinant caspase-3- or caspase-7-mediated cleavage of a fluorigenic tetrapeptide substrate, DEVD-AFC, in vitro. As shown in Fig.2 (A and B), the BIR1+2+3 fragment of XIAP inhibited DEVD-AFC substrate cleavage by caspases-3 and -7, whereas the C-terminal fragment of XIAP containing the RING domain did not. Next, fragments of XIAP containing each of the individual BIR domains (Fig. 1) were expressed in bacteria, purified, and tested for inhibition of recombinant caspases-3 and -7 in vitro. Of the three recombinant BIR domains, only BIR2 prevented DEVD-AFC substrate hydrolysis by caspases-3 and -7 (Fig. 2, C and D). However, because less than half of the purified BIR3 domain appeared to be intact, an additional BIR3-containing fragment of XIAP, which proved to be more stable and which combined BIR1 and BIR3 (Fig. 1), was also produced and tested. This BIR1+3 fragment of XIAP was ineffective at inhibiting caspases-3 or -7 in vitro, whereas BIR1+2 and BIR2+3 fragments that contained BIR2 completely suppressed hydrolysis of DEVD-AFC under the conditions of these in vitro protease assays (not shown). Determination of the apparent Ki for inhibition of recombinant caspases-3 and -7 by the BIR2 fragment of XIAP (residues 124–260) produced values of 1–5 nm, thus demonstrating potent suppression of these proteases (TableI). Similarly, the BIR1+2 and BIR2+3 fragments of XIAP that contained the BIR2 domain also inhibited caspases-3 and -7 with Ki values of 1–3 nm. Thus, although not as potent as the full-length XIAP molecule that has been reported to inhibit these proteases with Ki values of 0.2–0.7 nm (10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), the BIR2 domain nevertheless retains substantial anti-caspase activity. By comparison, the commonly used tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-aldehyde has been reported to inhibit caspases-3 and -7 with Kivalues of 0.5–3.5 nm (17Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R.

All BIR2-containing fragments of XIAP, including BIR2, BIR1+2, and BIR2+3, bound to immobilized caspases-3 and -7 (Fig.3 A). In contrast, fragments of XIAP lacking BIR2, including BIR1 and BIR1+3, failed to bind these caspases. Note that under these in vitro conditions where high concentrations of proteases are involved, caspase-3 cleaved the BIR2-containing fragments of XIAP, causing slightly faster migration of the 35S-labeled XIAP protein fragments in gels, whereas caspase-7 did not cleave these same XIAP fragments (Fig.3 A). Thus, cleavage does not necessarily correlate with enzyme inhibition. Moreover, no evidence has been obtained to date indicating that XIAP cleavage by caspases occurs under physiological circumstances in intact cells. The specificity of the in vitro binding results was confirmed by experiments in which other His6-tagged, recombinant proteins, including caspase-6, caspase-8, and TRAF-3 were tested and found not to bind the BIR2-containing fragment of XIAP (Fig. 3 B). Recently, it has been demonstrated that release of cytochrome c from mitochondria occurs during apoptosis and results in caspase activation by inducing formation of a protein complex containing Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 (reviewed in Ref. 21Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 can bind and inhibit pro-caspase-9, preventing it from becoming processed when exposed to cytochrome c and Apaf-1 (24Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether BIR2 was sufficient for preventing cytochrome c-induced processing of pro-caspase-9 in cytosolic extracts. As shown in Fig.4, full-length XIAP and the BIR2-containing fragment of XIAP completely blocked cytochrome c-induced processing of 35S-labeled in vitro translated pro-caspase-9 in cytosolic extracts, whereas BIR1, BIR3, and RING-containing fragments of XIAP were ineffective. Thus, the BIR2 domain of XIAP appears to be sufficient for blocking the earliest step in the apoptotic pathway triggered by cytochrome c, i.e. processing of pro-caspase-9. The effects of the BIR2 portion of XIAP on apoptosis in cells were examined by expressing this or other regions of XIAP in 293 cells, which were induced to undergo apoptosis by overexpression of Fas. Transient transfection of 293 cells typically resulted in over half the cells becoming apoptotic, as determined by DAPI staining and UV microscopic analysis (Fig.5 A). In contrast, co-expressing Fas with plasmids producing Myc-tagged full-length XIAP, BIR1+2+3, or BIR2 alone significantly reduced the percentage of transfected cells undergoing Fas-induced apoptosis. Although the BIR2 fragment was less potent at suppressing Fas-induced apoptosis than full-length XIAP or the BIR1+2+3 fragment of XIAP, it also may have been produced at lower levels in 293 cells (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, co-expression of Fas with plasmids producing Myc-tagged fragments of XIAP that lacked BIR2, including myc-BIR1 and myc-BIR1+3, failed to suppress apoptosis (not shown). These BIR2-lacking XIAP mutants, however, were produced at levels comparable with or greater than those of myc-BIR2, based on control transfections experiments using 293 cells that were not induced to undergo apoptosis by Fas (data not presented). Taken together, these findings support the idea that the BIR2 region of XIAP is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting caspases and cellular apoptosis. Although most IAP family proteins contain two or three copies of the BIR domain, the data provided here suggest that not all BIRs are equivalent in their ability to bind and inhibit caspases. In XIAP, it appears that only the second BIR domain is capable of inhibiting active caspases-3 and -7. Despite their extensive amino acid sequence similarity to BIR2, the BIR1 and BIR3 domains did not inhibit these caspases. Although the issue of protein folding when dealing with mutants is always a potential concern, these findings nevertheless suggest that different BIR domains within IAP family protein may play unique roles in the suppression of cell death. An intriguing idea is that different BIRs may target different subsets of caspases, although no direct evidence for this is yet available. Alternatively, it has been suggested that BIR domains represent a novel type of protein interaction domain. Miller and colleague have noted interactions of the baculovirus IAP family proteins with the Drosophila cell death proteins reaper and doom (22Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl.

Efforts to identify the targets of each of the individual BIR domains within IAP family proteins and to understand the structural basis for their differential inhibition of caspases will provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which IAPs suppress apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1977733200,"The recent identification of the Vzg-1/Edg2 protein as a functional G protein-coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has allowed a sequence-based search for new genes that may encode novel subtypes of LPA receptors. A human cDNA encoding a G protein-coupled receptor, designated Edg4, was identified by searching the GenBank™ for homologs of the human Edg2 LPA receptor. The Edg4 protein is 46% identical and 72% similar in amino acid sequence to human Edg2. When overexpressed in Jurkat T cells, the Edg4 protein mediated LPA-induced activation of a serum response element reporter gene with LPA concentration dependence (EC50 of 10 nm) and specificity. This LPA-induced reporter gene activation could be partially inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or C3 exoenzyme, suggesting requirements for both a Gi protein and Rho GTPase. Overexpression of Edg4 in Jurkat cells also led to increases in specific binding sites for [3H]LPA. Northern blots revealed that twoedg4 mRNA transcripts of 1.8 and 8 kilobases are distributed very differently from edg2 mRNAs in adult human tissues and several cancer cell lines. The existence and distinctive tissue expression of structurally different subtypes of LPA receptors may provide one basis for tissue-specific functions and permit independent regulation of each subtype of LPA receptor.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid (1-acyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate); PA, phosphatidic acid; SRE, serum response element; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; kb, kilobase(s). is a lipid mediator with diverse biological activities (1Moolenaar W.H.

LPA is generated by phospholipase cleavage of membrane phospholipids from stimulated cells, especially activated platelets (3Gaits F. Fourcade O. Le Belle F. Gueguen G. Gaige B. Gassama-Diagne A.

LPA is present at micromolar concentrations in serum and accounts for much of the cellular proliferative effect of serum (4Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). LPA elicits numerous biological functions in addition to proliferation, such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, inhibition of neuroblastoma cell differentiation, chemotaxis, tumor cell invasion, and antiproliferative effects on some cell types (1Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The intracellular biochemical signaling events that mediate the effects of LPA include stimulation of phospholipase C and increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase cascade, and Rho GTPases and Rho-dependent kinases (1Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and Rho pathways stimulate the transcription factors ternary complex factor and serum response factor, respectively. Ternary complex factors and serum response factors synergistically activate transcription of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, by binding to serum response element (SRE) in the promoters (7Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) present on many types of cells mediate the cellular activities of LPA (2Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag C.M.

Hechtet al. isolated a mouse cDNA termed ventricular zone gene-1 (vzg-1) encoding one such GPCR. When overexpressed in neocortical cells, the vzg-1 receptor mediated LPA-induced morphological changes, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and increases in [3H]LPA-binding sites (10Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Our laboratory identified human Edg2, a human homolog of vzg-1, as a functional receptor for LPA (11An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Expression of Edg2 in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells led to elevated responses of LPA-induced SRE transcriptional reporter gene activation and increases in [3H]LPA-binding sites. The amino acid sequences of mousevzg-1 and human Edg2 proteins are 96% identical, suggesting that they are the same LPA receptor in two different species. Guoet al. isolated a cDNA encoding a different GPCR fromXenopus oocytes (12Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this cDNA in oocytes potentiated oscillatory Cl− currents in response to LPA that could be attenuated by specific antisense oligonucleotides. This Xenopus LPA receptor shows little overall sequence similarity to the Vzg-1/Edg2 LPA receptors. Some functional studies have implied that multiple subtypes of LPA receptors with distinctive signaling properties mediate diverse cellular effects of LPA (13Liliom K. Bittman R. Swords B. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 616-623PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tigyi G. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1012-1908Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To fully define the biological functions of LPA, we sought to identify novel subtypes of LPA receptors at a molecular level. In this study, we discovered a human cDNA termed edg4 encoding a GPCR with an amino acid sequence similar but not identical to human Edg2. We demonstrated that Edg4 is a novel subtype of LPA receptor functionally analogous to Edg2, but with a different tissue distribution. Oleoyl-LPA, lysophosphatidyl-choline, lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine, lysophosphatidyl-serine, phosphatidic acid (PA), sphingosine 1-phosphate, fatty acid-free human serum albumin, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. The mammalian expression vector pCDEF3 (15Goldman L.A. Curone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A.

Lipofectin and DMRIE-C lipofection reagents for transfection and OPTI-MEM medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. Jurkat leukemic T cells were obtained from Dr. Arthur Weiss (UCSF). Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were from UCSF Cell Culture Facilities. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was purchased from CalBiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribotransferase (C3 exoenzyme), which specifically ADP-ribosylates Rho (16Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Human multiple tissue Northern blots were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid pGL3-basic and luciferase assay reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI). 1-Oleoyl [oleoyl-9,10-3H]LPA with a specific activity of 56.2 Ci/mmol was from NEN Life Science Products. The BLASTN program was used to search dbEST division of GenBank™ for sequences homologous to that of human edg2 (11An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number 755526) with its 5′ sequence (GenBank™ accession numberAA419064) similar but not identical to the 5′ region of edg2was identified and obtained from I.M.A.G.E. Consortium through Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). The entire 1.7-kb insert of clone 755526 was sequenced on both strands using an ABI automated DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Medical Institute DNA core facility, UCSF). The nucleotide sequence of 755526 was found to be highly homologous to that of humanedg2 and therefore was redesignated human edg4. The 1.7-kb insert was cut out by EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDEF3. The 1.1-kb cDNA of human edg2 coding region was cleaved from Edg2/RSV (11An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and also subcloned into pCDEF3. The resulting expression constructs were designated Edg4/EF3 and Edg2/EF3, respectively. The construction of an SRE luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing four copies of SRE (5′-AGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT) and a TATA box has been previously described (11An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with the SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid at a 1:10 ratio in combination with either Edg4/EF3, Edg2/EF3, or empty pCDEF3 vector using DMRIE-C reagent. After 4 h of transfection incubation in OPTI-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were washed and starved in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were then washed and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640, and aliquots of 1 × 105 cells were transferred into 96-well plates. LPA and other phospholipids dissolved in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1 mg/ml of human serum albumin were added to the cells followed by a 10-h incubation at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed by Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities were measured using a Turner Designs 20/20 luminometer. To assess a G protein requirement, some aliquots of cells were incubated in the presence of 50 ng/ml of PTX, 10 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme, or both toxins during serum starvation and LPA treatment. Jurkat T cells (1 × 107/ml in OPTI-MEM) were transfected with 2 μg of Edg4/EF3 or empty pCDEF3 vector for 4 h at 37 °C using Lipofectin. The transfected cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 12 h at 37 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before assessment of binding. Duplicate 0.2-ml aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were incubated with 200,000 cpm of [3H]LPA in 0.25% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline binding buffer for 45 min at 0 °C. The final concentration of [3H]LPA in the binding incubations was 10 nm. The binding cell suspensions were passed through GF/C filters that were washed with 12 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20, air-dried, and added to scintillation fluid for quantification of radioactivity bound to the cells. Total and nonspecific binding were evaluated in the absence and the presence of 10 μmnonradioactive LPA, respectively. Specific binding was calculated from the difference in cpm between total binding and nonspecific binding. The 1.7-kb insert of Edg4/EF3 and the 1.1-kb insert of Edg2/EF3 were labeled with 32P and used as probes in Northern blot analyses. Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues and cancer cells in each lane were hybridized and washed under high stringency conditions (17Sambrook J. Fritsh F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film for 24 h at −70 °C with one intensifying screen. Among several sequences identified from a search of dbEST, one human cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AA419064) was found to be highly similar but not identical to that of the humanedg2 cDNA in the 5′ region. The corresponding 1.7-kb cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number 755526) contains the sequence of the full-length coding region of a novel protein that is 46% identical and 72% similar to the human Edg2 LPA receptor (Fig.1). We designated this cDNA as humanedg4 and its protein product as human Edg4 protein. The Edg4 protein consists of 382 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 42,626. It has some of the common features of a GPCR, including seven hydrophobic segments, potential N-linked glycosylation sites at the N terminus, and phosphorylation sites for serine/threonine kinases in the intracellular regions. Edg4 also possesses unique characteristics distinct from most other GPCRs. In Edg4, an alanine replaces a proline that is usually conserved in the NPXXY sequence of the seventh transmembrane domain. As in Edg2, the first extracellular loop of Edg4 lacks a cysteine residue that may form a disulfide bond with another cysteine in the second extracellular loop in most other GPCRs. The Edg4 protein is related not only to Edg2 but also to several “orphan” GPCRs, with 34% identity to rat H218 (18MacLennan A.J. Browe C.S. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Shaw G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), 31% to human Edg1 (19Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 30% to human Edg3 (GenBank™ accession number X83864). Recently, the human gene locus of edg4 was sequenced and located on chromosome 19p12 (GenBank™ accession number AC002306). Given the high degree of sequence homology of Edg4 protein with previously characterized LPA receptors Edg2 and Vzg-1, we predicted that Edg4 was a receptor for LPA or a structurally similar lipid mediator. Edg4 protein was thus overexpressed in Jurkat T cells for studies of LPA-induced responses and of radioactive LPA binding. Jurkat cells were chosen because they lack background responses to LPA in the SRE reporter gene assay. When co-transfected with the SRE-luciferase reporter gene, Edg4, as Edg2, mediated increases in SRE-driven reporter gene expression induced by 1 μm LPA and, to lesser extent, PA (Fig.2). The structurally related lipids lysophosphatidyl-choline, lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine, lysophosphatidyl-serine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate at a concentration of 1 μm failed to generate significant increases in luciferase expression (Fig. 2). The control Jurkat cells transfected with empty pCDEF3 vector showed minimal changes in response to LPA or other phospholipids (Fig. 2). The activation of LPA-induced SRE-driven reporter gene in Edg4- and Edg2-transfected Jurkat cells was significant at 1 nm LPA, reached a maximum at 100 nm LPA, and exhibited an EC50 of approximately 10 nm (Fig.3 A). PA mimics the effect of LPA in both Edg4- and Edg2-transfected Jurkat cells but with much higher EC50 values of at least 500 nm (Fig.3 B). The magnitude of LPA- and PA-evoked SRE-driven reporter activation of Edg4 was approximately four times higher than that of Edg2 (Figs. 2 and 3). Pertussis bacterial toxin and botulinum C3 exoenzyme specifically inactivates Gαi and Rho, respectively. LPA-induced activation of the SRE reporter gene in both Edg2- and Edg4-transfected Jurkat cells was partially blocked by PTX or C3 exoenzyme pretreatment (Fig. 4). The two toxins added together further inhibited the effects of LPA. These results suggest that both α subunit of Gi and Rho GTPase are involved in transducing signals from the Edg2 and Edg4 receptors to the SRE reporter gene activation. [3H]LPA binding is generally characterized by a substantial nonspecific component due to its amphiphilic binding to cell membranes. Using intact Jurkat T cells, we were able to reduce nonspecific binding of [3H]LPA compared with that of membrane preparations. The background-specific [3H]LPA binding in the control vector-transfected Jurkat cells was 1409 ± 123 cpm (mean ± S.E., n = 3). In the same number of Edg4-transfected Jurkat cells, the specific binding was 3082 ± 298 cpm (mean ± S.E., n = 3), which was significantly higher than the controls (p < 0.01). When calculated in terms of receptor density, control Jurkat cells had 15,000 ± 1300 LPA-binding sites and Edg4 transfectants had 33,000 ± 3200 binding sites. Thus, Edg4 overexpression in Jurkat cells resulted in increases in the number of specific binding sites for LPA. The other lysophospholipids (lysophosphatidyl-choline, lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine, and lysophosphatidyl-serine) failed to competitively inhibit [3H]LPA binding to vector- or Edg4-transfected Jurkat cells (data not shown). The distribution of mRNA encoding edg2 and edg4 in a spectrum of human tissues and cancer cells was examined by Northern blot analyses (Fig.5). The edg2 transcripts were found in almost all human tissues with the highest abundance in brain and the lowest abundance in liver and peripheral blood leukocytes. the edg2 transcripts also were detected in HeLa carcinoma, SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and G361 melanoma but were undetectable in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia, K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia, MOLT-4 lymphoblastic leukemia, and Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, the two major edg4 transcripts of 8 and 1.8 kb were not represented in human tissues as widely as edg2transcripts and showed a pattern of distribution completely different from edg2 (Fig. 5). The 8-kb transcript was detected in peripheral blood leukocytes, thymus, and spleen, whereas the 1.8-kb transcript was in the leukocytes, testis, prostate, and pancreas. the edg4 transcripts were almost undetectable in brain, heart, placenta, and digestive tract where edg2 transcripts were abundant but were found in leukocytes where edg2 was undetectable. In cancer cells, the 8-kb transcript of edg4was found in all cell types, whereas the 1.8-kb transcript was only detected in HeLa, SW480, and A549 cells where edg2transcripts were also more abundant. In addition, a minor transcript of 2.8 kb was seen in G361 and SW480 cells (Fig. 5) The recent characterization of the Vzg-1/Edg2 proteins as functional LPA receptors has allowed a sequence-based search for new genes that may encode novel LPA receptors. A human cDNA, designatededg4, was identified by searching the dbEST and found to encode a GPCR that resembles the human Edg2 LPA receptor (Fig. 1). An SRE reporter gene assay demonstrated that Edg4 is a novel subtype of functional LPA receptor. Compared with Edg2, Edg4 was more active in stimulating SRE-driven transcription in transfected Jurkat T cells (Figs. 2 and 3). In several representative experiments, no major difference in the levels of Edg2 and Edg4 mRNAs was observed in the transfected cells by Northern blot analyses (data not shown). However, because the cell surface expression levels of Edg2 and Edg4 receptor proteins were not measured in the current study, the observed differences in activities could mean either that Edg4 protein was expressed at a higher level in these cells or that Edg4 had a higher intrinsic receptor activity than Edg2. That Edg4 is an LPA receptor was also substantiated by increases in binding sites of [3H]LPA to Edg4-transfected Jurkat cells. Due to extremely high nonspecific binding of amphiphilic LPA to cell membranes and the presence of background-specific binding in untransfected cells, reliable pharmacological binding parameters of Edg4 (e.g. Bmax and Kd) were not obtainable. Untransfected and vector-transfected Jurkat cells displayed a significant number of specific binding sites to [3H]LPA and a weak LPA-induced calcium mobilization response (data not shown), whereas they did not respond to LPA in the SRE reporter gene assay (Figs. 2 and 3). This discrepancy is probably attributable to the presence of LPA receptors of a human version of the XenopusLPA receptor (12Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or an as yet unidentified subtype in Jurkat cells. PA has been implicated in the activation of cellular kinases, phospholipases, and small GTPases in some cell types, including neutrophils (20English D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Waite K.A. Wallin R. Qualliotine-Mann D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15569-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although many of the reported effects of PA can be attributed to its metabolites, PA is clearly a messenger of intracellular and extracellular signaling (20English D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Waite K.A. Wallin R. Qualliotine-Mann D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15569-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that PA-induced activation of SRE-driven reporter gene was dependent on Edg2 and Edg4 transfection. However, the EC50 of PA was more than 100-fold high than that of LPA. This suggests that PA, if it acts directly on Edg2 and Edg4 receptors, is a much weaker agonist for these receptors. Very different human tissue distribution of edg4 and edg2 mRNAs was revealed by Northern blots analyses (Fig.5). In adult human brain, heart, placenta, and digestive tissues whereedg2 mRNAs are abundant, edg4 mRNAs are undetectable. In peripheral blood leukocytes where edg2mRNAs are undetectable, edg4 mRNAs are the most abundant among all tissues. The specific type(s) of leukocytes containing edg4 mRNAs and the physiological functions mediated by Edg4 in these cells remain to be discovered. The tissue-specific expression of edg2 and edg4was further extended to eight different cultured cancer cell lines. The two major transcripts of edg4 also exhibit tissue- and cancer cell-specific expression profiles. The sequences and their translated protein products of the edg4 transcripts remain unknown. Nevertheless, it is noted that the cultured cancer cells that express edg2 and the 1.8-kb transcript of edg4are adherent cells grown in culture, whereas those cells grown in suspension (HL60, K562, Molt, and Raji) do not express a significant level of edg2 or the 1.8-kb transcript of edg4. The correlation between the various edg2 and edg4transcripts, their translated receptor proteins, and their functions in cell adhesion and contact deserves further investigation. Nonetheless, the gene expression of edg2 and edg4 is likely to be regulated differently in different tissues and cells. LPA receptors in fibroblasts couple to at least three distinct G proteins, namely Gq, Gi, and G12/13(2Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Activation of Gq stimulates phospholipase C and a consequent mobilization of intracellular calcium. Activation of PTX-sensitive Gi inhibits adenylyl cyclase and stimulates the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway leading to transcriptional activation mediated by ternary complex factors. Activation of the PTX-resistant G12/13 stimulates Rho, which leads to actin-based cytoskeleton changes and transcriptional activation mediated by serum response factor. The Gi- and Rho-activated pathways synergistically stimulate transcription of many growth-related genes containing SRE in their promoters (7Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Hechtet al. demonstrated that mouse Edg2 (Vzg-1) mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a PTX-sensitive Giprotein and cell morphological changes via PTX-insensitive, presumably Rho-related GTPases (10Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Edg2- and Edg4-mediated activation of SRE-driven transcription in Jurkat cells involves a PTX-sensitive Gi protein and C3 exoenzyme-sensitive Rho GTPase (Fig. 4). We were unable to determine whether Edg2 and Edg4 also couple to Gq, which would lead to an increase in formation of inositol phosphates and intracellular calcium mobilization, because there were considerable background calcium responses to LPA in all untransfected cells tested. In conclusion, we have discovered a human cDNA encoding a novel GPCR, named Edg4, which has sequence similar to the previously identified human Edg2 LPA receptor. Using an SRE-driven reporter gene assay and a [3H]LPA binding assay, we have demonstrated that Edg4 is a novel functional receptor for LPA. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNAs for edg2 and edg4 have strikingly different tissue and cell distribution. The existence and distinctive tissue expression of structurally different LPA receptors may provide one basis for tissue-specific functions of LPA and permit independent regulation of each subtype of LPA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2042003522,"Nitrogen fertilization is a substantial source of nitrogen-containing trace gases that have both regional and global consequences. In the intensive wheat systems of Mexico, typical fertilization practices lead to extremely high fluxes of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO). In experiments, lower rates of nitrogen fertilizer, applied later in the crop cycle, reduced the loss of nitrogen without affecting yield and grain quality. Economic analyses projected this alternative practice to save 12 to 17 percent of after-tax profits. A knowledge-intensive approach to fertilizer management can substitute for higher levels of inputs, saving farmers money and reducing environmental costs."

By contrast, protein kinase C (PKC)–mediated activation of Raf-1 is thought to be Ras independent. Nevertheless, stimulation of PKC in COS cells led to activation of Ras and formation of Ras–Raf-1 complexes containing active Raf-1. Raf-1 mutations that prevent its association with Ras blocked activation of Raf-1 by PKC. However, the activation of Raf-1 by PKC was not blocked by dominant negative Ras, indicating that PKC activates Ras by a mechanism distinct from that initiated by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases."

Resin-attached, mutant K + channels from Streptomyces lividans were used to screen venom from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus , and the toxins that interacted with the channel were rapidly identified by mass spectrometry. One of the toxins, agitoxin2, was further studied by mutagenesis and radioligand binding. The results show that a prokaryotic K + channel has the same pore structure as eukaryotic K + channels. This structural conservation, through application of techniques presented here, offers a new approach for K + channel pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W1980473808,"After the vertebrate lens is induced from head ectoderm, lens-specific genes are expressed. Transcriptional regulation of the lens-specific alphaA-crystallin gene is controlled by an enhancer element, alphaCE2. A gene encoding an alphaCE2-binding protein, L-maf(lens-specific maf), was isolated. L-maf expression is initiated in the lens placode and is restricted to lens cells. The gene product L-Maf regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in the lens, and ectopic expression of this transcription factor converts chick embryonic ectodermal cells and cultured cells into lens fibers. Thus, vertebrate lens induction and differentiation can be triggered by the activation of L-Maf."
https://openalex.org/W1969917440,"Human CtBP attenuates transcriptional activation and tumorigenesis mediated by the adenovirus E1A protein. The E1A sequence motif that interacts with CtBP, Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser-X-Lys (P-DLS-K), is present in the repression domains of two unrelated short-range repressors in Drosophila , Knirps and Snail, and is essential for the interaction of these proteins with Drosophila CtBP (dCtBP). A P-element–induced mutation in dCtBP exhibits gene-dosage interactions with a null mutation in knirps , which is consistent with the occurrence of Knirps-dCtBP interactions in vivo. These observations suggest that CtBP and dCtBP are engaged in an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of transcriptional repression, which is used in both Drosophila and mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2109113345,"The heterodimeric complex ERCC1-XPF is a structure-specific endonuclease responsible for the 5′ incision during mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER). Additionally, ERCC1-XPF is thought to function in the repair of interstrand DNA cross-links and, by analogy to the homologous Rad1-Rad10 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in recombination between direct repeated DNA sequences. To gain insight into the role of ERCC1-XPF in such recombinational processes and in the NER reaction, we studied in detail the DNA structural elements required for ERCC1-XPF endonucleolytic activity. Recombinant ERCC1-XPF, purified from insect cells, was found to cleave stem-loop substrates at the DNA junction in the absence of other proteins like replication protein A, showing that the structure-specific endonuclease activity is intrinsic to the complex. Cleavage depended on the presence of divalent cations and was optimal in low Mn2+ concentrations (0.2 mm). A minimum of 4–8 unpaired nucleotides was required for incisions by ERCC1-XPF. Splayed arm and flap substrates were also cut by ERCC1-XPF, resulting in the removal of 3′ protruding single-stranded arms. All incisions occurred in one strand of duplex DNA at the 5′ side of a junction with single-stranded DNA. The exact cleavage position varied from 2 to 8 nucleotides away from the junction. One single-stranded arm, protruding either in the 3′ or 5′ direction, was necessary and sufficient for correct positioning of incisions by ERCC1-XPF.

During NER, the damaged DNA strand is incised asymmetrically around the lesion to allow release of the damage as part of a 24–32-nucleotide DNA fragment, followed by resynthesis and ligation (1Friedberg E.C.

Whereas the latter steps are accomplished by general replication factors such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, DNA polymerase δ, and/or ε and ligase, the incision stage of NER requires the action of XP factors (XPA-G) (4Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). XPA, and perhaps XPC complexed with hHR23B, are thought to be involved in damage recognition; XPB and XPD, two helicases present in the basal transcription factor complex TFIIH, and replication protein A (RPA) presumably demarcate the lesion by local opening of the DNA; XPG and the heterodimeric complex ERCC1-XPF perform the actual DNA cleavage. The role of XPE is, as yet, unclear. Mutations in either of the XP factors can cause the extreme UV-sensitive and cancer-prone phenotype observed with Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients. Some human XP genes cross-complement the NER defect of laboratory induced UV-sensitive Chinese hamster mutant cell lines, subdivided into 10 complementation groups. Human XPF, for example, corrects the repair-defect of rodent group 4 cell lines. The human excision repair cross-complementing gene ERCC1 corrects rodent group 1 cell lines, but no ERCC1-deficient patients are known. ERCC1 and XPF form an endonuclease that incises the damaged strand 15–24 nucleotides away at the 5′ side of the lesion (5Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Cleavage by ERCC1-XPF and XPG, which makes the 3′ incision during NER, presumably occurs in a structure-specific manner, as both NER nucleases cut artificial DNA substrates preferentially at duplex single-stranded junctions (6Sijbers A.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and protein-protein interactions with other NER factors are likely to determine the exact positioning of both nucleases. For ERCC1-XPF, interactions with XPA and RPA have been reported (9Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S. Legerski R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The counterpart of ERCC1-XPF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad10-Rad1, is required not only for NER but also for recombination between direct repeated DNA sequences, a process which is also called single strand annealing (13Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By analogy, ERCC1-XPF is expected to fulfil a similar role in mammalian cells, and the two homologous protein complexes have been proposed to remove 3′ protruding single-stranded arms from recombined duplex regions (13Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 15Davies A.A. Friedberg E.C. Tomkinson A.E. Wood R.D. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24638-24641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster mutant cell lines defective in either ERCC1 (group 1) or XPF (group 4) are unique among the other NER-deficient mutants in that they show an extreme sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C (16Busch D. Greiner C. Lewis K. Ford R. Adair G. Thompson L. Mutagenesis. 1989; 4: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Repair of interstrand cross-links probably also requires a recombinational event. To gain insight in the role of ERCC1-XPF in such recombinational processes and in the NER reaction, it is of importance to define its DNA substrate specificity. Similar studies with the FEN-1 family of structure-specific nucleases revealed interesting characteristics of individual members. Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), implicated in both in vitro replication (17Ishimi Y. Claude A. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19723-19733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro repair (18Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), was found to cleave branched DNA structures with 5′ protruding single-stranded arms (flaps, splayed arms), but not with closed single-stranded regions (loops, bubbles) (19Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). XPG, also a member of this family and as yet only known to be involved in NER, cleaves both stem-loop and bubble substrates as well as flaps and splayed arms (7O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar,8Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the S. cerevisiaehomolog of XPG, Rad2, and all three members of this nuclease family cleaved DNA with similar polarity, i.e. in one strand of duplex DNA at the 3′ side of the junction with single-stranded DNA (20Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar,21Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30194-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The differences in substrate specificity between XPG and Rad2 on the one hand and FEN-1 on the other, may point at their different roles in the cell. The well defined structural DNA requirements of FEN-1 have been the key to the recent disclosure of its role in vitroin a base excision repair subpathway (18Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). ERCC1-XPF, and its yeast homolog Rad1-Rad10, are not part of a larger family of structure-specific nucleases. Rad1-Rad10 was previously shown to cleave flaps, splayed arms, stem-loops, and bubbles at the 5′ side of duplex single-stranded junctions (22Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the sole domain shared between ERCC1 and FEN-1 nucleases, a presumed helix-hairpin-helix motif present twice at the C terminus of ERCC1, is lacking in Rad10 (23van Duin M. van den Tol J. Warmerdam P. Odijk H. Meijer D. Westerveld A. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5305-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Sijbers A.M. Van der Spek P.J. Odijk H.

This double motif, in total approximately 50 residues long, is assumed to be involved in non-sequence specific DNA binding (25Doherty A. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and might endow ERCC1-XPF with additional properties or altered substrate specificity compared with Rad1-Rad10. Here we report a detailed analysis of the DNA structural elements required for ERCC1-XPF cleavage. We found that ERCC1-XPF needs at least 4–8 unpaired nucleotides to cleave stem-loop substrates. Single-stranded arms protruding in the 3′ direction were efficiently removed by ERCC1-XPF from splayed arm and flap substrates. Incisions occurred in duplex DNA at the 5′ side of a junction with single-stranded DNA. Both 3′ and 5′ protruding arms could be used by ERCC1-XPF for correctly positioning its nuclease activity. These data provide a framework to envisage ERCC1-XPF activity in repair as well as in recombinational pathways. The construction of a cDNA encoding ERCC1 with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag was described previously (6Sijbers A.M. De Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. De Jong M.C. Rademakers S. De Rooij J. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The 3′ end (NcoI-BamHI) of this cDNA was used to replace the 3′ end (NcoI-BamHI) of wild-type ERCC1 cDNA in the vector pET3C-ERCC1 which contains a unique NdeI site at the translation initiation site. This NdeI site and aClaI site were used to isolate ERCC1His cDNA, recessive ends were filled in by Klenow fragment, and the cDNA was cloned into the blunt-ended BamHI site of the donor plasmid pFastBacI (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System, Life Technologies, Inc.), resulting in pFastBacI-ERCC1His. To introduce a 6xHis-HA epitope encoding DNA sequence at the 3′ end of XPF cDNA, first a (blunt) in-frame NruI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the XPF coding region by means of polymerase chain reaction using the antisense primer 5′-CGATCGATTCGGAAGCGCTGCCTCCCTTTTTCCCTTTTCCTTTTGAT-3′. Two primers (1, HIS-HA sense: 5′-CACCACCATCACCATCACGGAGGCAGCGCTTACCCATAGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTAGCTGAATCGATG-3′; and 2, HIS-HA antisense: 5′-GATCCATCGATTCAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGCGCTGCCTCCGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTG-3′) were annealed and cloned into the NruI site, resulting in construct pBL-XPFHisHA. This construct was sequenced to exclude the presence of cloning and polymerase chain reaction mistakes. AnNcoI (present on translation initiation site)-ClaI digest (both blunt-ended by Klenow fragment) released the XPF-HisHA cDNA, which was cloned into the BamHI site (also made blunt by Klenow fragment) of the donor plasmid pFastBacI (Life Technologies, Inc.), resulting in construct pFastBacI-XPFHisHA. pFastBacI-ERCC1His and pFastBacI-XPFHisHA plasmids were transfected separately into competent DH10Bac cells to allow site-specific transposition with the Bacmid bMON14272. The recombinant Bacmids (rBac-ERCC1His and rBac-XPFHisHA) were isolated and transfected into Sf21 cells, which resulted in the production of recombinant viruses, designated virBac-ERCC1His and virBacXPFHisHA, respectively. Virus amplification was performed as described (instruction manual BAC-TO-BAC system, Life Technologies, Inc.). For production of the proteins, seven 175-cm2 dishes with monolayers of Sf21 cells were co-infected with virBac-ERCC1His and virBacXPFHisHA, at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. Two days post-infection, cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were fractionated as described before (26Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, pellets were lysed in 8 times packed cell volume of NP-lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/mg leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant (S1), containing most of the ERCC1-XPF complex, was used for further purification. Prior to loading, NaCl concentration of S1 protein extracts was adjusted to 0.15m. Protein extracts were applied to a phosphocellulose column (1 ml of beads per 7 mg of protein, Whatman P-11), equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.15 m KCl. Bound proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 0.6 m KCl. After co-incubation of this fraction overnight at 4 °C with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen; 1 ml/5 mg of protein) in the presence of 1 mmimidazole, the protein-beads slurry was packed in a column, which was then washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole (0.6m KCl) and buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole (0.1 m KCl). ERCC1 and XPF were eluted in buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm KCl. Insulin (0.1 mg/ml) was added and this fraction was dialyzed twice for 1 h against buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2). Typically, 50–100 μg (20 ng/μl) of purified complex was obtained from 15 mg of S1 protein extract. To analyze complex formation between ERCC1 and XPF, 200 μl of the purified fraction was applied onto a 4.2-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in buffer B. The gradients were centrifuged for 20 h at 300,000 × g and 160-μl fractions were collected. To test repair-correcting activity in vitro, 60 ng of purified ERCC1-XPF complex was added to Manley-type cell extracts derived from the indicated mutant cell lines; the protein mixture was incubated with an undamaged and a N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene-damaged plasmid in the presence of 32P-labeled deoxynucleotides. Specific 32P incorporation into the damaged plasmid was used as a measure for DNA repair synthesis (for details, see Woodet al., Ref. 27Wood R.D. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Methods. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vivo repair activity was determined by micro-injection of purified ERCC1-XPF into the cytoplasm of XPF homopolykaryons (XP126LO fibroblasts) or into the cytoplasm of mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from ERCC1-deficient mice (28Weeda G. Donker I. de Wit J. Morreau H. Janssens R. Vissers C.J. Nigg A. van Steeg H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Repair activity was analyzed after 4 h by UV-induced (15 J/m2) incorporation of [3H]thymidine and autoradiography as described (29Vermeulen W. Scott R.J. Potger S. Muller H.J. Cole J. Arlett C.F. Kleijer W.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weeda G. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1994; 54: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar). The number of grains above the nuclei is a measure of unscheduled DNA synthesis and reflects the cellular repair capacity. DNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE and 100–150 ng of DNA substrate was32P-labeled using polynucleotide kinase or Klenow fragment, followed by phenol extraction in 100 μl and Sepharose G-50 column centrifugation. To allow self-annealing, oligonucleotides were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and put on ice. Labeled substrates were kept at 4 °C. For the construction of flap substrates, one of the oligonucleotides was labeled, a 2-fold molar excess of the unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides was added, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by stepwise cooling to allow annealing (30 min at 60 °C, 30 min at 37 °C, 30 min at 25 °C, and 30 min on ice). Nuclease reactions (15 μl) were carried out in optimized nuclease buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), containing 100 fmol of substrate DNA and 100 fmol of recombinant ERCC1-XPF complex. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 28 °C and either stopped by adding 15 μl of 90% formamide, heated at 95 °C, and loaded onto 10–20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, or 5% glycerol was added and samples were immediately loaded onto 15–20% non-denaturing polacrylamide gels. Reaction products were visualized by autoradiography or PhosphorImager. To reconstitute recombinant ERCC1-XPF protein complex, Sf21 insect cells were co-infected with ERCC1- and XPF-containing baculovirus expression constructs. Both ERCC1 and XPF cDNAs encoded C-terminal affinity tags, a 6xHis-tag and a 6xHis-HA-epitope double-tag, respectively, to facilitate purification of proteins. Neither of these tags interfered with the function of the proteins in vivo, as micro-injection of XPF-(6xHis-HA) cDNA into the nucleus of XPF-deficient human fibroblasts and transfection of ERCC1-(6xHis) cDNA into ERCC1-deficient Chinese hamster cells fully corrected the repair defects of these mutant cell types (data not shown). A three-step purification protocol, which included phosphocellulose, nickel affinity chromatography, and a glycerol gradient, resulted in highly purified fractions containing 2 major proteins on silver stain with apparent molecular weight of approximately 40,000 and 115,000 (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies confirmed these proteins to be ERCC1 and XPF (Fig. 1 B). On the glycerol gradient the majority of ERCC1 and XPF was found to co-migrate, which demonstrated that the proteins reconstitute a stable ERCC1-XPF protein complex in insect cells. As only little further purification was obtained with this gradient and no significant differences were detected between the enzymatic activities of Ni-purified versus glycerol gradient-purified protein fractions, most experiments were performed with Ni-purified proteins. During the progress of this work also, recombinant ERCC1-XPF was purified from Escherichia coli, which was used to confirm that the activities described below were intrinsic to the ERCC1-XPF complex (data not shown). The activity of recombinant ERCC1-XPF was tested in in vitro and in vivo repair assays. In vitro, ERCC1-XPF was found to correct the repair-deficient phenotype of cell extracts from human XP-F and Chinese hamster complementation groups 1 and 4, but not from XP-G (Fig. 1 C). Correction was also found with an extract from the Chinese hamster mutant cell line UVS1, formerly known as the sole representative of complementation group 11, but recently shown to be functionally deficient in XPF as well (6Sijbers A.M. De Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. De Jong M.C. Rademakers S. De Rooij J. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Wood R.D.

To test the activity of recombinant ERCC1-XPF in vivo, purified complex was micro-injected into primary fibroblasts derived from an XP-F patient. The injected cells showed a significant increase of unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV treatment, indicative for restored NER capacity (Fig. 1 D). Chinese hamster cells are not very suitable for micro-injection for technical reasons, but the establishment of MEFs from a repair-deficient ERCC1− mouse (28Weeda G. Donker I. de Wit J. Morreau H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) enabled us to analyze protein fractions for ERCC1-correcting activity in vivo. Micro-injection of purified ERCC1-XPF in these cells resulted in a significant increase in repair activity as well (Fig. 1 D). These data demonstrate that the purified recombinant ERCC1-XPF complex effectively supports NER both in vitro and in vivo. Previously, we have shown that a His-tagged ERCC1-XPF complex purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells efficiently incises artificial DNA substrates containing a duplex single-stranded DNA junction (6Sijbers A.M. De Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. De Jong M.C. Rademakers S. De Rooij J. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The observed ERCC1-XPF endonuclease activity was structure-specific and independent of other proteins like RPA. To test nuclease activity of our recombinant ERCC1-XPF, similar assays with such stem-loop substrates were performed. Rather than random DNA sequences, our artificial substrates exclusively contained thymine residues in the single-stranded regions to minimize formation of secondary DNA structures. Two major incisions were detected when recombinant ERCC1-XPF was applied to these substrates, being in one strand of the duplex region, two and three nucleotides (nt) away at the 5′ side of the junction (Fig. 2,A and B). This cleavage pattern was identical to that observed with endogenous ERCC1-XPF purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells (6Sijbers A.M. De Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. De Jong M.C. Rademakers S. De Rooij J. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To define optimal conditions for the nuclease activity we analyzed scissions at various concentrations of divalent metal ions. As also observed with the Chinese hamster ovary ERCC1-XPF complex, incision activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of divalent cations, as addition of EDTA completely blocked incisions (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ stimulated the endonuclease activity and, surprisingly, Mn2+ appeared to stimulate much better than Mg2+. Optimal activity was observed in low concentrations of Mn2+ (0.2 mm) (Fig. 2 C, lane 14) and was approximately 3 times higher than in the most optimal Mg2+ buffer (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). In contrast, incision activity was inhibited by increasing amounts of Ca2+ (lanes 9–12), showing that Ca2+ cannot substitute for Mg2+ and Mn2+ in these reactions. The reaction products appearing at 0.2 mm Mn2+ were similar to those observed in all Mg2+ buffers tested (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that low Mn2+ concentrations were suitable for studying ERCC1-XPF activity. A control reaction in 0.2 mmMnCl2 without ERCC1-XPF (but with a corresponding amount of ERCC1-XPF dilution buffer B) showed that the DNA substrate is not subject to aspecific degradation under these conditions (Fig. 2 D, lane 1); furthermore, when the same stem-loop substrate was labeled at the 3′ end, ERCC1-XPF cleavage at 0.2 mmMn2+ resulted in a relatively large incision product consisting of the complete single-stranded loop and one strand of the stem, which demonstrated the absence of single-stranded endonucleolytic degradation (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). In view of these results, all assays described below were performed in a standard buffer containing 0.2 mm MnCl2. Determination of the minimal size of the single-stranded loop in a stem-loop substrate can provide indications about the minimal degree of helix opening required for ERCC1-XPF incision, a relevant parameter for NER. To investigate this, stem-loops with varying loop and stem sizes but with a similar DNA context around the junction were constructed (see TableI). If possible, the total amount of nucleotides was kept the same among these substrates. Incisions were observed on stems with a loop of 12, 18, 22, and 40 nucleotides, whereas a loop of 8 nucleotides only gave minor cleavage products (Fig.3). All incisions were made at identical positions relative to the junction, 2 and 3 nucleotides away in the stem. Occasional incisions were seen in substrates with a loop size of 4 nucleotides (data not shown), but none were found in a 2-nucleotide loop and a fully paired hairpin structure (see also Fig.4). This demonstrated that DNA substrates with less than 4–8 unpaired bases become poor DNA substrates for ERCC1-XPF mediated incision. Comparison of equally large stems (12 base pair) with different loop sizes (22 versus 40 nt) showed that incision efficiency increased with the size of the single-stranded loop (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). We could not determine the minimal duplex size requirements for ERCC1-XPF activity as base pairing will be lost with very small stems, but apparently a 12-base pair stem is still sufficient for ERCC1-XPF mediated cleavage.Table IArtificial DNA substratesNucleotides denoted in small letter type were filled-in by DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, optionally with radioactive labeled dNTPs.

They also reveal a 150-million-year time scale for generating thermal heterogeneity in the mantle, comparable to the record of plate motion reconstructions, so that the problem of unknown initial conditions can be overcome. The pattern of lowermost mantle structure at the core-mantle boundary is controlled by subduction history, although seismic tomography reveals intense large-scale hot (low-velocity) upwelling features not explicitly predicted by the models."

The chemistry catalyzed by this enzyme is also highly specific. pMMO-catalyzed hydroxylation of cryptically chiral ethanes has implicated a reaction mechanism proceeding with complete retention of alkane substrate configuration (41Priestly N.D.

This extraordinary chemistry currently has no precedent in known model and biological systems. Accordingly, insights regarding the copper-containing active site of the pMMO can provide a new direction in the design of biominetic catalysts for methane activation and functionalization. The pMMO has been known to be very difficult to study. As noted earlier, one of the main obstacles in studying the pMMO is the unusual instability of the activity of the enzyme. Activity is frequently lost upon cell lysis, detergent solubilization, and freeze-thaw cycles. In several cultures, no activity was observed in cell-free extracts, or activity quickly disappeared within 6 h after cell lysis (24Nguyen H.-H.T. Shiemke A.K. Jacobs S.J. Hales B.J. Lidstrom M.E.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity is also known to be very sensitive to exogenous ligands as well as the choice of buffer. This highly unusual instability has hampered efforts in characterizing the pMMO. The addition of copper ions is known to enhance enzymatic activity under certain conditions (cells grown at low copper levels), but the effect of copper ions in the extension of pMMO activity is not known. No reagent is currently known to reactivate the enzyme once the protein becomes inactive. As a result, a highly active, stable, and purified preparation of the enzyme has been slow in forthcoming. Past efforts in isolating the pMMO have resulted in significant confusion regarding the nature of the enzyme. An early report of pMMO isolation from M. trichosporium OB3b indicates that this system can utilize ascorbate in addition to NADH as electron donors and was found to consist of three components: a 47-kDa polypeptide containing various amounts of copper, a smaller 9.4-kDa subunit, and a 13-kDa CO-binding cytochrome c (43Tonge G.M. Harrison D.E.F. Higgins I.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 161: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In later studies, the aforementioned ascorbate-linked activity was not observed, and attempts to solubilize the enzyme resulted in complete deactivation of the protein. Solubilization of pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) using a nonionic detergent was attempted, and upon detergent removal and lipid vesicle reconstitution, partial activity was observed (44Drummond D. Smith D. Dalton H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 1982: 667-671Google Scholar). According to the authors, any attempts to purify the enzyme further resulted in complete loss of activity. A few reports including a recent work (45Zahn J.A. DiSpirito A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Akent'eva N.F. Gvozdev R.I. Biochemistry (Engl. Transl. Biokhimiya). 1988; 53: 91-96Google Scholar) appear to support the notion that the active site of the pMMO may contain iron despite the overwhelming evidence accumulated to date suggesting that copper is the element responsible for catalysis within the enzyme active site. Thus, to advance the field, the presence of iron and copper in the pMMO must be resolved. This paper summarizes our efforts to isolate and purify the pMMO fromM. capsulatus (Bath) for biochemical and biophysical characterization. Toward the development of suitable protocols for pMMO isolation, we have embarked on an extensive investigation of factors contributing to enzymatic activity stability, including various methods of bacterial cultivation and membrane isolation, and various schemes of enzyme stabilization and purification. We find that the details of the bacterial cultivation and isolation methods significantly affect the quality of the membranes and the protein isolated from them. Methods of bacterial cultivation and pMMO isolation were optimized such that active and purified preparations of the enzyme could be recovered. Active membrane fractions, highly enriched in pMMO and exhibiting exceptionally stable activity, were subsequently isolated using various procedures, assayed for activity, solubilized with detergents, and fractionated using available methods of protein purification. For such preparations, activity can be maintained in the membrane-bound forms for an extended period of time, a minimum of 3–4 days and up to 10 days at 4 °C with stable or enhanced activity (stable with respect to repeated freeze-thaw cycles and prolonged storage at −80 °C). Aside from describing these procedures in this report, we will discuss several other critical issues relating to the nature of the pMMO, particularly whether or not the pMMO is a copper-containing enzyme only, the subunit composition of the enzyme, and whether or not there is more than one form of the protein as suggested by recent genetic data. M. capsulatus (Bath) used in the studies were maintained on Petri plates containing the nitrate mineral salts medium with added CuSO4 (20 μm) and solidified with 1.7% agar. Cultures were maintained under an atmosphere of 20% methane in air and streaked onto fresh plates every 4–6 weeks (47Whittenbury R. Dalton H. Starr M.P. Truper H.G. Balows A. Schlegel H.G. The Prokaryotes. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1981: 894-902Crossref Google Scholar). Chemostat cultures (9–10 liters) were grown according to the following procedure. The organisms were first transferred from Petri plates to 250-ml flasks and subsequently to 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 40 and 300 ml, respectively, of the nitrate mineral salts medium with added CuSO4 (10 μm), a 20% methane in air atmosphere, and continual shaking. The organisms were allowed to grow for 48 h in these small scale cultures. The 300-ml cultures were used to seed a fermentor containing 9 liters of the above described medium with added 20 μm CuSO4 and 20 μm CuEDTA. The methane feeding rate was controlled such that methane is growth-limiting (feeding rate ∼0.01–0.012 feet3/h·liter). The methane/air ratio was 1:4. A cell density of >10 g/liter of culture can be obtained at a higher methane feeding rate. However, the employed methane feeding rate, termed as methane stress condition (semistarvation growth condition), results in less biomass; typically only ∼5–6 g of wet cells/liter would be obtained. However, this condition was found to stimulate the overproduction of the intracytoplasmic membranes, which also contain exceptionally high levels of the pMMO (see below). Furthermore, it also stimulates copper uptake (high copper/protein ratio), resulting in exceptionally high pMMO specific activity. Approximately 24 h after inoculation and 6 h prior to cell harvest, additional CuSO4 (or CuEDTA) was added to bring the total added copper concentration to 50 and 60 μm, respectively. Six h and 3 h prior to cell harvest, the methane feeding rate was increased incrementally to 0.03–0.04 feet3/h·liter to relieve the starvation condition (partly to increase cell density). Without this step, the activity was not stable although the membranes contained unusually high levels of the pMMO. M. capsulatus (Bath) was grown at 42 °C. The pH must be maintained at 6.8–7.4 during growth. Cells were harvested in late log phase (typically 48–52 h after inoculation) by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min and washed twice with 50 mm Pipes (pH 7.2). Washed cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mmPipes, 4 mm ascorbate, 50 μg of catalase/ml of buffer, pH ∼7.2 (typically 60 g of wet cells and buffer to a volume of ∼75 ml of cell suspension). Cu(II) ions (100 μmCuSO4) can also be added to this buffer to improve the enzyme stability further. However, the addition of copper often caused the ascorbate-containing buffer to lose its effectiveness rather quickly and would complicate metal content analysis of the purified protein, so it was routinely omitted. Cell suspensions (∼0.8–1.0 g of cells/ml) were passed three times through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. to separate the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Less dense cell suspensions (<0.5 g of cells/ml) often result in low activity or completely inactive cell-free extract and membranes. It appeared that the dense cell suspensions used here (i) kept the dioxygen tension low, hence minimizing copper oxidation and (ii) resulted in highly viscous lysate, which helped to protect the integrity of the membrane-bound pMMO during the isolation process. Unlysed cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 220,000 × gfor 90 min to pellet the membrane fraction. The clear supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was used as the cytosolic fraction. The pelleted membranes often show distinct layers. The minor bottom layer containing bluish and black materials and the thin, white top layer were discarded. Only the middle layer, or the translucent intracytoplasmic membranes, constituting the bulk of the membrane fractions, were collected. These membranes can be separated further on the basis of their texture into “soft” and “hard” membranes, albeit with difficulty. The difference between these two types of membranes is not great although the hard membranes appear to have higher intact pMMO content. The translucent membranes were washed by suspending them in washing buffer containing 50 mm Pipes, 5 mm ascorbate, 25 μg of catalase/ml (pH 7.2) using a Dounce homogenizer, repelleted by ultracentrifugation, and resuspended in washing buffer of 2–3 times the volume of the original cell suspension. This process was repeated a few more times until the supernatant was virtually free of soluble proteins. Finally, the pelleted membranes were suspended in storage buffer (low ionic strength storage buffer, 20–25 mm Pipes, 5 mmascorbate, 25 μg of catalase/ml of buffer, pH ∼7.25; or high ionic strength storage buffer, 75–100 mm Pipes, 50 mm imidazole, 5 mm ascorbate, 25 μg of catalase/ml of buffer, pH ∼7.25) in a volume equal to the original cell suspension volume. Sucrose (200 mm) can also be added to the above buffers to improve stability further. The membrane suspensions then can be kept at 4 °C or frozen at liquid nitrogen temperature and stored at −80 °C for future use. It should be noted that"

Still, the biochemical mechanisms by which RSNO release ⋅NO in biological systems are not well defined, and in particular, the interactions between reactive oxygen species and RSNO have not been studied. In this work, we show that xanthine oxidase (XO), in the presence of purine (hypoxanthine, xanthine) or pteridine (lumazine) substrates, induces S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) decomposition under aerobic conditions. The decomposition of RSNO by XO was inhibitable by copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, in agreement with the participation of superoxide anion (O·̄2) in the process. However, while superoxide dismutase could totally inhibit aerobic decomposition of GSNO, it was only partially inhibitory for CysNO. Competition experiments indicated that O·̄2 reacted with GSNO with a rate constant of 1 × 104m−1·s−1 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. The decomposition of RSNO was accompanied by peroxynitrite formation as assessed by the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine and of cytochrome c 2+. The proposed mechanism involves the O·̄2-dependent reduction of RSNO to yield⋅NO, which in turn reacts fast with a second O·̄2molecule to yield peroxynitrite. Under anaerobic conditions, CysNO incubated with xanthine plus XO resulted in CysNO decomposition,⋅NO detection, and cysteine and uric acid formation. We found that CysNO is an electron acceptor substrate for XO with aKm of 0.7 mm. In agreement with this concept, the enzymatic reduction of CysNO by XO was inhibitable by oxypurinol and diphenyliodonium, inhibitors that interfere with the catalytic cycle at the molybdenum and flavin sites, respectively. In conclusion, XO decomposes RSNO by O·̄2-dependent and -independent pathways, and in the presence of oxygen it leads to peroxynitrite formation.

The biochemical pathways that lead to RSNO decomposition are under active investigation; nonenzymatic pathways including transnitrosation reactions in the presence of thiols (15Barnett D.J.

Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). However, the reactions of these species with RSNO have not been studied. This is of particular importance in the case of O·̄2, since it is a continuously formed free radical in aerobic cells that can also act as a reductant in many cases (E′0 O2/O·̄2 = −0.33V, Ref. 22Wood P.M. FEBS Lett. 1974; 44: 21-24Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar); thus, the question readily arises as to whether O·̄2 can promote RSNO decomposition, i.e. ⋅NO release. Since O·̄2 reacts with ⋅NO at almost diffusion-controlled rates (19Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res.

Peroxynitrite was synthesized in a quenched-flow reactor from sodium nitrite and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under acidic conditions and quantitated as described previously (23Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H2O2remaining from the synthesis was eliminated by treating the stock solutions of peroxynitrite with granular manganese dioxide (34Castro L. Alvarez M.N. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, plus 0.1 mm dtpa, at 25 °C. Xanthine oxidase activity was monitored by measuring uric acid production at 292 nm (ε292 = 11 mm−1·cm−1) (31Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 12. Academic Press, Inc., London1975: 299-419Google Scholar) with 150 μm xanthine or 150 μm hypoxanthine as substrates. It is important to note that xanthine and hypoxanthine oxidation to uric acid involves a 2- and 4-electron oxidation, respectively. Superoxide production was determined by SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c 3+ at 550 nm (Δεred-ox = 21 mm−1·cm−1)(35McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The univalent flux percentage was 32%, as described previously (37Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rubbo H. Radi R. Prodanov E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In some experiments, lumazine (100 μm) was used as a XO substrate. Violapterin formation from lumazine was followed at 328 nm (ε328 = 10.5 mm−1·cm−1) (39Nagano T. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 39-42Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the univalent flux percentage was 40%. Decomposition rates of GSNO and CysNO were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease of absorbance maxima at 334 nm. For experiments requiring anaerobic conditions, solutions were deoxygenated by extensive bubbling with argon for 10 min and then injected into reaction mixtures maintained in anaerobic cuvettes using Hamilton gas-tight syringes. The production of ⋅NO from GSNO or CysNO was determined electrochemically (Iso-NO, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Nitroxyl anion (NO−) generation was assessed by the reduction of methemoglobin to nitrosyl hemoglobin as previously (40Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 408-409Google Scholar). Thiols were quantitated spectrophotometrically using the DTNB assay (41Ellman F.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar), by adding aliquots (100 μl) from the samples to 1-ml tubes containing sodium pyrophosphate 100 mm, pH 9.2, 0.5 mm DTNB, and 0.1 mm oxypurinol at different times (0–15 min), and absorbance was read at 412 nm (ε = 13.6 mm−1·cm−1). At the concentrations of RSNO carried over to the DTNB assay, there was no interference with free thiol detection. Oxygen consumption studies were performed using a water-jacketed Clark electrode (YSI model 5300). Peroxynitrite formation was determined by two independent methods: 1) the rate of dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation to rhodamine (42Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and 2) the rate of cytochrome c 2+ oxidation (43Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) as follows. 1) For the DHR assay, stock solutions of DHR (28.9 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide were purged with argon and stored at −20 °C. DHR (100 μm) was exposed to GSNO or CysNO (1 mm) in the absence or presence of 150 μmhypoxanthine plus 5 milliunits/ml XO. When lumazine (100 μm), a low turnover substrate (39Nagano T. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 39-42Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was used instead of hypoxanthine as substrate for XO, the addition of 100 milliunits/ml XO was necessary in order obtain a similar O·̄2 flux. The oxidation of DHR to rhodamine was followed spectrophotometrically at 500 nm (ε500 = 78.8 mm−1·cm−1) (44Crow J. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). 2) Cytochrome c 3+ was reduced by sodium dithionite immediately before use, and excess dithionite was removed on Sephadex G-25 using 50 mm sodium phosphate plus 0.1 mm dtpa, pH 7.4, as elution buffer. cytochrome c 2+ (50 μm) was exposed to GSNO (1 mm) in the absence or presence of 150 μmhypoxanthine plus 5 milliunits/ml XO, and initial rates of cytochrome c 2+ oxidation were followed at 550 nm. The yields for methods 1 and 2 were calculated using authentic peroxynitrite as standard and were 45 and 49%, respectively, in agreement with previous reports (42Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 43Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric determinations were carried out either in a temperature-controlled Shimadzu UV-Vis 2401 or Milton Roy Spectronic 3000 array spectrophotometers. All experiments reported in this manuscript were repeated and revealed reproducible results. Results are expressed as mean values with the corresponding standard deviations. Graphics and data analysis were performed using Slide-Write (Advanced Graphics Software). Basal decomposition of GSNO (1 mm) and CysNO (1 mm) was consistently low (0.3 and 0.7 μm/min, respectively; Fig. 1 and Table I) and depended on thermal and photolytic homolysis (12Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Metal-catalyzed decomposition of RSNO,i.e. copper (14McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. Askew S.C. Butler A.R. Russell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1758-1759Crossref Google Scholar, 45Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), was avoided by using highly pure deionized water for preparing solutions and chelation of transition metal ions with 0.1 mm dtpa in buffers. The addition of 5 milliunits/ml XO (i.e. O·̄2, 6.4 μm/min) plus 150 μm hypoxanthine resulted in significantly increased RSNO decomposition rates (Fig.1, A and B). This increase in RSNO decomposition rates was larger for CysNO and proportional to XO concentration (Fig.2). Neither hypoxanthine nor XO alone accounted for these effects (Table I). The decomposition of GSNO induced by hypoxanthine plus XO was completely inhibited by the addition of 240 nm CuZn-SOD. Fig. 3 shows the inhibitory effect of increasing SOD concentrations on the decomposition of 1 mmGSNO mediated by hypoxanthine plus XO, from which an IC50of 10 nm SOD was obtained. Xanthine oxidase-mediated decomposition of CysNO, on the other hand, was only partially inhibited by high SOD concentrations (480 nm). The degree of inhibition by these high SOD concentrations was dependent on CysNO concentration and ranged from 50% inhibition for 0.25 mmCysNO to 0.4% inhibition for 2 mm CysNO (TableII). The addition of 0.4 μmcatalase or 100 μm neocuproine had no effect on XO-dependent decomposition of both RSNO (Table I). Additionally, up to 500 μm uric acid did not influence RSNO decomposition rates (data not shown).Table ICysNO and GSNO decomposition by hypoxanthine (Hx) plus xanthine oxidase under aerobic conditionsAdditions−d[RSNO]/dtμm/minCysNO (1 mm)0.7 ± 0.1 With Hx (150 μm)0.7 ± 0.01 With XO (5 milliunits/ml)1.1 ± 0.1 With Hx (150 μm) and XO (5 milliunits/ml)5.8 ± 0.7With SOD (0.48 μm)5.3 ± 0.4With catalase (0.4 μm)5.1 ± 0.3With neocuproine (0.1 mm)5.5 ± 0.5GSNO (1 mm)0.3 ± 0.1 With Hx (150 μm)0.2 ± 0.1 With XO (5 milliunits/ml)0.4 ± 0.2 With Hx (150 μm) and XO (5 milliunits/ml)2.2 ± 0.2With SOD (0.24 μm)0.5 ± 0.03With catalase (0.4 μm)2.3 ± 0.2With neocuproine (0.1 mm)2.0 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Dependence of S-nitrosothiol decomposition on XO activity.

Chumley P. Radi R. Rubbo H. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). When 150 μm xanthine plus 6 milliunits/ml XO were coincubated under anaerobic conditions, a very low flux of uric acid production (∼6% of that under aerobic conditions) was measured, due to low residual oxygen. The addition of 1 mm CysNO led to a 10-fold increase in the initial rate of uric acid formation (from 0.4 μm/min to 4.1 μm/min), whereas up to 2 mm GSNO had no effect. This increased uric acid formation was accompanied by CysNO decomposition that varied from undetectable to 8.5 ± 2 μm/min in the absence and presence of xanthine plus XO, respectively. Neither the addition of 1 mm NaNO2 nor the addition of 1 mmNaNO3 resulted in an increase in the rate of uric acid formation by xanthine plus XO under anaerobic conditions (TableIII). Since CysNO promoted the XO-dependent oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, it was evaluated whether CysNO could serve as a second substrate for XO in the presence of low oxygen concentrations. When xanthine plus XO was coincubated with different concentrations of CysNO and initial rates of uric acid formation were measured, a saturation curve was obtained (Fig. 4). The inset shows a secondary plot of vo againstvo/[S] (Woolf and Hofstee plot; Ref. 47Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 62Google Scholar) from which a Km of 0.7 ± 0.1 mm was obtained. The initial rates of CysNO decomposition were twice the initial rates of uric acid formation (Fig. 4).Table IIIUric acid formation by xanthine-xanthine oxidase under anaerobic conditionsConditionsd[uric acid]/dtμm/minX/XO with no additions0.4 ± 0.1 With GSNO (2 mm)0.6 ± 0.2 With NO2− (1 mm)0.5 ± 0.1 With NO3− (1 mm)0.5 ± 0.1 With CysNO (1 mm)4.1 ± 0.2With DPI (40 μm)0.8 ± 0.2With oxypurinol (30 μm)1.4 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab To further confirm the role of CysNO as a xanthine oxidase substrate, it was observed that oxypurinol, which forms an inactive complex with XO in its reduced form at the molybdenum site (48Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), strongly inhibited XO-dependent CysNO decomposition (Table III). In turn, diphenyliodonium, a flavoprotein inhibitor also gave a dose-dependent inhibition of the CysNO decomposition that with 40 μm diphenyliodonium was ∼80% inhibited (TableIII). In addition, when 1 mm CysNO was exposed to xanthine (150 μm) plus 5 milliunits/ml XO, either under anaerobic or aerobic conditions (i.e. 255 μmO2), CysNO decomposition rates were 8.5 μm/min (Fig. 4) and 2.5 μm/min, respectively, indicating that O2 was partially inhibitory toward the enzymatic decomposition of CysNO by XO. Conversely, CysNO (2 mm) inhibited O2 consumption by 5 milliunits/ml XO plus 150 μm hypoxanthine by ∼50%. Experiments were performed to characterize the decomposition products of CysNO and GSNO in the presence of xanthine plus XO. Under aerobic conditions, there was no ⋅NO detectable when 1 mm GSNO or 1 mmCysNO were coincubated with 150 μm xanthine plus 5 milliunits/ml XO. Under anaerobic conditions, 1 mm CysNO in buffer generated a low flux of ⋅NO, yielding a steady state NO concentration of <1 μm. The addition of 150 μm xanthine caused no effect on ⋅NO production until the addition of 5 milliunits/ml XO, which yielded an initial rate of 6 μm/min ⋅NO production, close to the CysNO decomposition rates reported in Fig. 4. The anaerobic production of⋅NO from CysNO in the presence of xanthine plus XO was completely inhibited by 150 μm oxypurinol (Fig.5). No nitrosyl hemoglobin formation (i.e. an indicator of NO−formation) was detected when 1 mm GSNO was incubated, either alone or in the presence of 150 μm hypoxanthine plus 5 milliunits/ml XO, with 140 μm methemoglobin under aerobic conditions. A thiol formation rate of 4 μm/min was measured when 1 mm CysNO was coincubated with xanthine plus XO (5 milliunits/ml) for 15 min under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, due to a lower CysNO decomposition rate, it was necessary to increase XO activity and to use hypoxanthine as substrate to have enough sensitivity for DTNB assay of free thiol detection. Indeed, when 1 mm CysNO was incubated in the presence of 150 μm hypoxanthine and 10 milliunits/ml XO, a rate of 3.2 ± 0.2 μm/min thiol formation was found (data not shown). Under anaerobic conditions, XO-mediated decomposition of CysNO led to the production of ⋅NO (Fig. 5). On the other hand, there was no production of ⋅NO from GSNO in the presence of xanthine plus XO under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, there was no detectable ⋅NO release during XO-dependent CysNO and GSNO decomposition. However, if⋅NO was produced under aerobic conditions, its facile reaction with XO-derived O·̄2 would preclude its detection, leading to the formation of ONOO−. Thus, experiments were performed to assess peroxynitrite generation in our system. The addition of 150 μm hypoxanthine, 5 milliunits/ml XO, and either 1 mm CysNO or GSNO to 100 μm DHR resulted in DHR oxidation rates of 0.9 μm/min (CysNO) and 1 μm/min (GSNO). Neither CysNO/GSNO nor hypoxanthine plus XO alone produced DHR oxidation. Initial rates were measured during 1.5 min, because the rate of oxidation significantly slowed down after that (Fig. 6, line a). Since O·̄2 formation and RSNO decomposition were linear for at least 20 min, the progressive decrease in rates of DHR oxidation could be due to uric acid accumulation, since uric acid efficiently inhibits peroxynitrite-mediated DHR oxidation (42Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). To further investigate this point, we exposed DHR to GSNO (1 mm) in the presence of an alternative substrate for XO, lumazine (100 μm), which is oxidized to violapterin, therefore avoiding uric acid formation. Since lumazine is a low turnover substrate for XO (39Nagano T. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 39-42Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and results in a higher per"
https://openalex.org/W2081926576,Pollinating insects played a decisive role in the origin and early evolution of the angiosperms. Pollinating orthorrhaphous Brachycera fossils (short-horned flies) collected from Late Jurassic rocks in Liaoning Province of northeast China provide evidence for a pre-Cretaceous origin of angiosperms. Functional morphology and comparison with modern confamilial taxa show that the orthorrhaphous Brachycera were some of the most ancient pollinators. These data thus imply that angiosperms originated during the Late Jurassic and were represented by at least two floral types.

In the present study, we have analyzed the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 surface envelope glycoproteins from distinct viral isolates with monolayers of various glycosphingolipids at the air-water interface. The penetration of the viral glycoproteins into glycosphingolipid monolayers was detected as an increase in the surface pressure. We found that HIV-1 recombinant gp120 (IIIB isolate) could penetrate into a monomolecular film of alpha-hydroxylated galactosylceramide (GalCer-HFA), while ceramides, GluCer, and nonhydroxylated GalCer were totally inactive. The glycoproteins isolated from HIV-1 isolates LAI and NDK and from HIV-2(ROD) could also interact with a GalCer-HFA monolayer, whereas gp120 from HIV-1(SEN) and HIV-1(89.6) did not react. These data correlated with the ability of the corresponding viruses to gain entry into the CD4(-)/GalCer+ cell line HT-29, demonstrating the determinant role of GalCer-HFA in this CD4-independent pathway of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. In contrast, all HIV-1 and HIV-2 glycoproteins tested were found to interact with a monolayer of GM3, a ganglioside abundantly expressed in the plasma membrane of CD4(+) lymphocytes and macrophages. A V3 loop-derived synthetic peptide inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in both CD4(-) and CD4(+) cells could penetrate into various glycosphingolipid monolayers, including GalCer-HFA and GM3. Taken together, these data suggest that the adsorption of human immunodeficiency viruses to the surface of target cells involves an interaction between the V3 domain of the surface envelope glycoprotein and specific glycosphingolipids, i.e. GalCer-HFA for CD4(-) cells and GM3 for CD4(+) cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103940811,"Chondrules are millimeter-sized rounded igneous rocks within chondritic meteorites. Their textures and fractionated mineral chemistries suggest that they formed by repeated, localized, brief (minutes to hours) melting of cold aggregates of mineral dust in the protoplanetary nebula. Astrophysical models of chondrule formation have been unable to explain the petrologically diverse nature of chondrites. However, a nebular shock wave model for chondrule formation agrees with many of the observed petrologic and geochemical properties of chondrules and shows how particles within the nebula are sorted by size and how rims around chondrules are formed. It also explains the volatile-rich nature of chondrule rims and the chondrite matrix."

The coupled in vitro transcription and translation kit (TNT Quick) was from Promega. Rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscle cDNA was purified from λ phage cDNA libraries (15Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K.

The rSkM1 rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel cDNA (17Trimmer J.S. et al.Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. P. Backx (University of Toronto). The full-length ryanodine receptor cDNA clone, pBS SRR10, was described previously (18Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The loops linking domains II and III were amplified and cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR): nucleotides 1990–2381 of the cDNA fragment encoding the rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR II-III loop with the skeletal muscle cDNA library as template; nucleotides 2374–2772 of the cardiac DHPR II-III loop with the cardiac muscle cDNA library as template; nucleotides 2389–3059 of the rat skeletal muscle Na+channel with rSkM1, the rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel cDNA (17Trimmer J.S. et al.Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) as template. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the cDNA sequence for the respective loops were designed with exteriorBamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites for in-frame cloning into the ptrcHisC vector (Invitrogen) or the pGEX 3X vector (Pharmacia). All cloned fragments were then verified by DNA sequence analysis. The oligonucleotide attgaattccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccaccacaagcttgaattcata and its complementary oligonucleotide were used to add 10 His residues to the C-terminal end of glutathione S-transferase (GST) by self-annealing of the two oligonucleotides, endonuclease restriction digestion at the EcoRI sites flanking the His10sequence, and ligation into the EcoRI site of pGEX3X. E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for expression. Proteins were purified following standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and protease inhibitors. His-peptide (Invitrogen) fusion proteins were purified with NiNTA resin, and GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After washing, the His-peptide fusion proteins were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, pH 7.0, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and dialyzed against PBS overnight. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and yield was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Fragments for in vitro transcription and translation were prepared from pBS SRR10 (18Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). pBS SRR10 was digested with EcoRI (2394) and XbaI (MCS), blunt ended with Klenow, and self-ligated to make pBS RYR1 F1. PstI restriction endonuclease fragments were subcloned into pBSKS+ ATG-PstI. pBSSK+ ATG-PstI was prepared from pBSSK+ (Stratagene) by ligation of the linker ataccaccatgggcctgcaggcccatggtggtat into the SmaI site, digestion with PstI, and religation to circularize the vector. The PstI site is downstream of a Kozak consensus start sequence (20Kozak M. Shatkin A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and an ATG for translation initiation. The PstI fragments were subcloned into the PstI site of pBSK+ ATG-PstI, in-frame with the initiator Met, following restriction endonuclease digestion of pBS RYR1 with PstI (see Fig. 1 A). The PstI fragments that were subcloned and expressed were: PstI (1902) to PstI (2769) to form pBS RYR1 F2; PstI (2769) to PstI (3660) to form pBS RYR1 F3; PstI (3578) to PstI (4842) to form pBS RYR1 F4; PstI (4980) to PstI (6285) to form pBS RYR1 F6; PstI (6285) to PstI (7425) to form pBS RYR1 F7; PstI (7425) to PstI (7860) to form pBS RYR1 F8. the PstI (4980) to BglII (5583) fragment from the PstI and BglII digest of pBS SRR10 was subcloned into pBSKS+ ATG-PstI, which had been digested with HindIII, blunt ended with Klenow, and then digested with PstI to form pBS RYR1 F5b. The PstI (4842) to PstI (4980) fragment was ligated to pBS RYR1 F5b, previously linearized with PstI, to form pBS RYR1 F5. pBSK+ ATG-ANS was prepared from pBSSK+ (Stratagene) by ligation of the linker ataccaccatggacgtctcatatggcatgccatatgagacgtccatggtggtat into the SmaI site, digestion with SphI, and ligation to circularize the vector. AatII and NdeI restriction endonuclease fragments of pBS RYR1, AatII(7806) to AatII(9468), and AatII(10523) to NdeI(11173) were ligated into pBSK+ ATG-ANS downstream of a Kozak consensus start sequence (20Kozak M. Shatkin A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in-frame with an initiator Met to form pBS RYR1 F9 and F10b. The AatII (9468)-AatII (10523) fragment from RYRI was cloned into the AatII site of pBS RYR1 F10b to form pBS RYR F10. pBS RYR1 F3a was made by digestion of pBS RYR1 F3 with AatII(3335) and EcoRI (MCS), blunt end formation with Klenow, and religation. The pBS RYR2 F3a fragment, from nucleotides 2797 to 3378, was amplified by PCR from RYR2 cDNA (16Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide primers ctgcagatgtcacttgagaccttgaag and atagaattcgatccggctgacaacctg, which include PstI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, for cloning into pBS-ATG-PstI. Chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2 were made using pBS RYR1 F3a and pBS RYR2 F3a through the introduction of restriction endonuclease sites by PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) (see Fig.2 A). A HindIII site was introduced into RYR1 at base pair 2860 to form pBS RYR1 F3aH. ABspEI site was introduced into RYR1 at nucleotide 3225 to form pBS RYR1 F3aB. A HindIII site was introduced into RYR2 at nucleotide 2894 to form pBS RYR1 F3aH. ABspEI site was introduced into RYR2 at nucleotide 3036 to form pBS RYR2 F3aB. The vector pBS RYR2 F3aB was digested with NotI (MCS) and BspEI (3036) to excise nucleotides 2797–3036 of RYR2, and RYR1 nucleotides 2769NotI (MCS) to BspEI (3225) were ligated into this site to form pBS RYR1(923–1075)-RYR2(1076–1112). The vector pBS RYR1 F3aB was digested with NotI (MCS) and HindIII (2860) to excise nucleotides 2769–2860 of RYR1 and nucleotides NotI (MCS) to HindIII (2894) of RYR2 were cloned into this site to form pBS RYR2(923–1075)-RYR1(1076–1112). The vector pBS RYR2 F3aH was digested with HindIII to excise the HindIII(2894) to HindIII (MCS) fragment of RYR2, and the HindIII (2860) to nucleotide 3335 HindIII (MCS) was ligated into this site to form pBS RYR2(922–953)-RYR1(954–1112). Numbering for the chimeric constructs is based on RYR1. Affinity matrices were prepared by eluting His-peptide fusion protein or GST-His10 from NiNTA resin and binding them to 40 μl of fresh NiNTA at a concentration of 0.5 mg of fusion protein/ml. Purified, dialyzed GST fusion proteins were bound to fresh glutathione-Sepharose to achieve the desired concentration of fusion protein (mg/ml of Sepharose). The amount of protein bound to affinity matrices was confirmed by eluting a sample of the protein-bound affinity matrix with SDS, separating the eluted protein by SDS-PAGE, and staining with Coomassie Blue. Each stained fusion protein band was quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). Resins to which fusion proteins were bound were washed with 1 ml of PBS, blocked with 1 mg of bovine serum albumin in 200 μl of column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 mKCl, 20 μm CaCl2, 0.25 mmMgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20), and then blocked with 0.4 mg of bovine serum albumin in 400 μl of column buffer. [35S]Methionine-labeled fragments of RyR, synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TNT Quick, Promega), were diluted 10-fold into 200 μl of column buffer and then passed three times through affinity columns by gravity flow. The columns were washed with 600 μl of column buffer. Proteins retained on the affinity columns were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE (15% gel) was used to analyze 1 μl of the in vitro translation product (5% of the total column input) and 20 μl of the eluate (20% of the total column eluate). The gels were fixed three times in 6 volumes of 10% methanol-12% acetic acid for 20 min each time. The radioactive signal was enhanced with Entensify (NEN Life Science Products), and the gels were dried and exposed to either autoradiogram film (BioMax AR, Kodak) or quantitated by a Molecular Imager (Bio-rad). Specific binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding to GST-His10 columns or GST columns. We immobilized the DHPR II-III loop on a Ni+column as a His-peptide fusion protein and passed35S-labeled in vitrotranslated fragments of RyR1 through it (Fig. 1). We found that 20 ± 2.7% of in vitro translated fragment 922–1220 was retained on the DHPR II-III loop affinity column compared with less than 5% retention for any of the other fragments of RyR1 lying between amino acids 1 and 3724. (Fig. 1, B and C). Reduction of the RyR1 fragment to 190 amino acids, spanning residues 922–1112, increased the proportion of the in vitrotranslated fragment retained on DHPR II-III loop columns to 32 ± 1.6% (Fig. 2). To test isoform specificity, we passed 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated fragments of RYR2 over the affinity column. We did not detect any specific binding of RyR2(933–1126) (corresponding to RYR1(922–1112)) to the skeletal DHPR II-III loop affinity column (Fig.2). Because further reduction of the size of the RyR1 fragment led to loss of synthesis of the in vitro translated product, we reduced the size of the RyR1 sequence that binds to the DHPR II-III loop by making chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2, as illustrated in Fig.2 A. The RyR1(922–1075)-RyR2(1076–1112) (C1) chimera did not bind to the II-III loop, but 24 ± 2.7% of the RyR2(922–953)-RyR1(954–1112) (C3) chimera and 28 ± 2.6% of the RyR2(922–1075)-RyR1(1076–1112) (C2) chimera were retained on a 0.5 mg/ml DHPR II-III loop affinity column (Fig. 2, B and C). We deduced that the 37-amino acid sequence between Arg1076 and Asp1112 of RyR1 is important for binding the DHPR II-III loop. The chimeric construct (C3), which binds to the skeletal muscle DHPR II-III loop His-peptide fusion protein, did not bind above background to either GST columns or to a GST fusion protein constructed from the II-III loop of the cardiac DHPR receptor (cdDHPR in Fig.3, A and B). A GST fusion protein affinity column with the II-III loop of the skeletal muscle DHPR II-III (skDHPR in Fig. 3, A and B) retained 12 ± 0.4% of the input of the in vitro translated C3 chimera (Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, 14 ± 0.4% of the input of in vitro translated C3 chimera bound to a GST fusion protein affinity column containing the loop between domains II and III of the homologous skeletal muscle voltage-gated Na+ channel (skNain Fig. 3, A and B). The region of the skeletal muscle DHPR II-III loop important for activation of RyR1 has been localized to the amino acid sequence between positions 671 and 690 (11El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A 14-amino acid sequence within the skeletal muscle DHPR activation region is KAKAEERKRRKMSR (Fig.3 C). The corresponding amino acid sequence in the skeletal muscle Na+ channel is RGKILSPKEIILSE and in the cardiac DHPR is KEEEEEKERKKLAR. The skeletal muscle DHPR and the Na+ channel II-III loop sequences contain positive charges at positions 1, 3, and 8 of the shared sequences, a small amino acid (Ala or Gly) at position 2, and Ser at position 13. By contrast, the cardiac DHPR sequence has negative charges at positions 2, 3, and 8 and an Ala at position 13. We made the double mutation K677E/K682E in the skeletal muscle DHPR II-III loop so that the mutated skeletal muscle DHPR sequence, KAEAEERERRKMSR, would more closely resemble the cardiac sequence in this region. This double mutation resulted in a 66 ± 7.1% decrease in binding of the C3 chimera, from 12 ± 0.4% binding to 4 ± 0.7% binding. In this study, we localized the binding site for the skeletal DHPR II-III loop to 190 amino acids between 922 and 1112 in in vitro transcribed and translated products of RyR1. Decreasing the size of the fragment resulted in loss of in vitrotranslation, and GST fusion proteins of fragments shorter than 190 amino acids were unstable, suggesting that this sequence might form a stable structural domain. RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3 contain four repeat sequences (15Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M.S. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The 922–1112 fragment of RyR1 contains part of repeat 1 and all of repeat 2. We made use of these repeat domain boundaries to create three RyR1-RyR2 chimeras (Fig. 2 A). The 37-amino acid sequence between Arg1076 and Asp1112 in RyR1, which was retained in chimera C2 (and in C3 but not in C1) was necessary for the binding of about 25% of the input in vitro translation product to the DHPR II-III loop column. This sequence begins virtually at the end of repeat 2. Because the binding site lies outside of the repeat sequences, the repeats are not likely to play a role in the RyR1-DHPR interaction but may form part of a structural domain that includes the DHPR binding site. Only 10 residues between Arg1076 and Asp1112 differ in RyR1 and RyR2, and several of these residues are likely to form part of the interaction site between the two proteins. The newly identified RyR1-DHPR interaction site is distinct from the D2 region (amino acids 1303–1406), which was shown to be important for E-C coupling in skeletal muscle (22Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by reconstituting E-C coupling in myotubes from RYR1 knockout mice. Takekura et al.(23Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Takeshima H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have reported that a functional ryanodine receptor must be provided for the formation of normal junctions between the transverse tubule and the sarcoplasmic reticulum in RYR1 knock-out mice. Thus, deletions in RyR1 may lead to the loss of E-C coupling because the interaction site between DHPR and RyR1 is missing or because RyR1 structure is so altered that proper junctions can no longer form, even though interaction sites are intact. The second possibility could explain the apparent discrepancy between the findings of Yamazawa et al. (22Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and our own results. In vivo studies have shown that RyR1, but not RyR2, can restore skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling (24Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Sakurai T. Endo M. Iino M. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 6172-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Peptides from II-III loops of the skeletal muscle DHPR that activate Ca2+currents in RyR1 reconstituted into lipid bilayers cannot activate RYR2 (9Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, RyR2 sequences did not bind to the DHPR II-III loop (Fig. 2). In contrast to previous in vitro studies in which peptides from either the skeletal or cardiac II-III loops were equally capable of activating RyR1 Ca2+ release channel function (9Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we have found that binding of the RyR1 954–1112 fragment is specific to the skeletal DHPR II-III loop (Fig. 3). Our results are also in agreement with in vivo studies showing that skeletal-type E-C coupling in dysgenic mice lacking DHPR could only be rescued with the skeletal muscle isoform of DHPR (7Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 8Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). An unexpected observation was that chimera C3 was bound to a GST fusion protein affinity column made up from the loop between domains II and III of the homologous skeletal muscle voltage-gated Na+channel (skNa in Fig. 3, A and B). We extended this observation by aligning sequences that include 14 highly charged amino acids in the II-III loop of skeletal and cardiac DHPRs, shown to be important for activation of RyR1 (11El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with the corresponding sequence in the skeletal Na+ channel sequences (Fig. 3 C). A comparison shows that net charge ranges from 0 to +6, that lysine occurs at positions 3 and 8 of the 14-amino acid sequence in the skeletal DHPR and the Na+channel (both of which bind to RyR1), and that glutamate occurs at positions 3 and 8 in the cardiac DHPR (which does not bind to RyR1). The double mutation K677E/K682E in the skeletal DHPR II-III loop decreased chimera C3 binding by two-thirds (from 13% to 4%). Thus, the presence of positive charges at positions 3 and 8 seems to be an important feature for binding of RyR1, but net charge does not. Because phosphorylation of Ser687 (found at position 13 in both the skeletal muscle DHPR and the Na+ channel) has been shown to inhibit the interaction of the skeletal DHPR II-III loop with RyR1 (10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), charged residues at the C-terminal end of this 14-amino acid sequence in the skeletal DHPR II-III loop may also be important. Although this study does not deal directly with the functional interaction between the RyR1 and DHPR, numerous studies have implicated the II-III loop of the DHPR in E-C coupling (25Meissner G. Lu X. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The loss of interaction that we observed when two residues were mutated in a region of the DHPR II-III loop, previously implicated in the triggering of Ca2+ release, makes it likely that this interaction site is functional. Monnier et al. (27Monnier N. Procaccio V. Stieglitz P. Lunardi J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that an Arg to His mutation in the loop linking DHPR domains III and IV in the α-subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR can cause susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). The physiological basis of MH is an abnormality in the regulation of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, and the RYR1 gene has been linked to MH in human and pigs (28MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The involvement of both RyR1 and DHPR in MH suggests that the pathology of MH is due to aberrant E-C coupling. These observations, together with the observations that a C-terminal peptide of the DHPR can inhibit the Ca2+ release function of RyR1 (14Slavik K.J. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that there is a retrograde signal by which RyR1 enhances slow Ca2+ channel function (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 29Chavis P. Fagni L. Lansman J.B. Bockaert J. Nature. 1996; 382: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suggest that interactions between the RyR1 and DHPR involve many sites in the two proteins. Protein affinity chromatography should be applicable to the study of interactions of other DHPR loops with RyR1. We thank Dr. S. R. W. Chen for support and advice, Dr. J. Greenblatt and M.

This protein, designated Blk, is structurally and functionally related to human Bik and localized to the mitochondrial membrane. Blk contains a conserved BH3 domain and can interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Ectopic expression of Blk in mammalian cells induces apoptosis, which can be inhibited by mutations in the BH3 domain and by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL but not by CrmA. The apoptotic activity of Blk is also inhibited by a dominant negative caspase-9, suggesting that Blk induces apoptosis through activation of the cytochrome c-Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway.

Bcl-2 is the first recognized component of programmed cell death or apoptosis (1Tsujimoto Y. Jaffe E. Cossman J. Croce C.M.

Various aspects of involvement of Bcl-2 in this process have been well documented at the molecular and physiological levels (for review see Ref. 3Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is a multifunctional 239-amino acid protein that has a hydrophobic C-terminal membrane anchor that is preceded by three well recognized domains designated BH1, BH2, and BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domains 1, 2, and 3) that are necessary for its function (3Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and its homolog Bcl-xL are death antagonists that associate mainly with the outer mitochondrial membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope and have well documented ion channel activity (3Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that they prevent apoptosis by regulating the electrical and osmotic homeostasis of the mitochondria, a process that is required to prevent mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, and cytochrome c release (4Vander Heiden M.G.

Except for Bad whose BH3 domain is within the putative BH1 domain, all of these proteins contain an independent BH3 domain (10Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Joekel J. Walksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It appears that only the BH3 domain is required for their proapoptotic activity (8Wang K. Yin X.-M.

This domain interacts with a hydrophobic cleft formed by the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 as evident from mutational and structural studies (15Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.N. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bik, Bid, and Hrk, which contain only a BH3 domain, seem to be more potent death effectors than those proteins with all the three domains of Bcl-2 (Bax and Bak) (Ref.8Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar and this report). However, the molecular determinants of the “BH3-only” proteins as opposed to those of “all BH domains” proteins that trigger the key components of the death pathway(s) leading to activation of the terminal caspases remain to be understood. It is also not clear whether binding of the BH3 domain of the death agonist inactivates Bcl-2/Bcl-xL by simple stoichiometric binding or whether it initiates a new activity that triggers apoptosis. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel mouse proapoptotic protein designated Blk. The protein, which has 43% homology with the human Bik/Nbk (12Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 16Han J. Sabbatini P. White E.

The death effector BH3 domain was confirmed by mutational studies. Furthermore, the involvement of caspases in Blk-induced apoptosis was tested by using a dominant negative inhibitor approach, which provides evidence that caspase-9 (Mch6/ICE-LAP6) (17Srinivasula S.M.

The full-length Blk cDNA was cloned from a mouse 14.5-day-old embryo λgt11 cDNA library (random primed) by PCR. 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescence protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This was done using primers corresponding to the 3′ region of mouse GenBank™ expressed sequence tag clone 694727 as antisense primers and vector specific primers (λgt11 forward or reverse) as sense primers. FLAG and T7 epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR-generated cDNAs of the respective genes into pFLAG CMV-2 and pcDNA-3-T7 vectors, respectively. To generate N-terminal GFP-tagged Blk, its cDNA was inserted in-frame into the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). For apoptosis assays, we used the mammalian double expression vector pRSC-LacZ (19MacFarlane M. Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Cohen G.M. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25417-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), which allows the expression of LacZ under the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, and the test cDNA (Blk, Bik, Bax, and Blk BH3 mutants) under the CMV promoter. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. 35S-Labeled proteins were expressed in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using a TNT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In vitro protein-protein interaction was carried out according to Boyd et al. (12Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the labeled proteins were precleared by mixing with glutathione-Sepharose beads and then removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with GST-Bcl-2, GST-Bcl-xL, or GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the interacting proteins were recovered by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. For in vivo interaction of T7-tagged Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with the death agonist (FLAG-tagged blk, Bik, and Bax), the corresponding proteins were co-expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the interacting proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated T7 antibody as described before (20Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Ottilie S. Bullrich F. Banks S. Wang Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Tomaselli K.J. Armstrong R.C. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18542-18545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The conserved amino acids in the BH3 domain of Blk were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping PCR as described before (17Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27099-27106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The generated PCR products were cloned in pFLAG CMV-2 and pRSC-double vector, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. To identify additional members of the BH3-only proteins that are involved in apoptosis, we searched the GenBank™ expressed sequence tag data base for sequences that encode conserved BH3 domain. A mouse partial cDNA clone was identified. Based on its 3′ sequence, PCR primers were generated and used to clone a full-length cDNA that encodes a new Bik-related protein of 150 amino acids (Fig.1 A). This protein shares an overall ∼43% identity with human Bik and a fully conserved BH3 domain of 12 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) that is also present in other Bcl-2 family members (12Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 16Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the two proteins are less conserved in the regions N-terminal and C-terminal to the BH3 domain. There are also five deletions in the new protein that make it 10 amino acids shorter than Bik. Based on these criteria and its apoptotic activity (see below), the new protein was designated Bik-like killer (Blk). To determine the distribution of Blk, various mouse tissue mRNA samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the Blk riboprobe detected a ∼0.85-kilobase transcript in the testes, kidney, liver, lung, and heart but not in skeletal muscle, spleen, and brain. The highest expression was seen in the liver and kidney. This restricted expression is different from that observed with human Bik, which is widely expressed in both adult tissues and established cell lines (12Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mRNA expression of murine Bid, another BH3-only apoptotic protein, has been shown to be relatively abundant in brain and spleen tissues (8Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of members of the Bcl-2 family is the presence of a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain. This domain might be responsible for the observed association of these proteins with subcellular membranes such as the outer mitochondrial, endoplasmic, and perinuclear membranes. Blk possesses such a domain at its C terminus (residues 130–149) (Fig. 1 A). This and its ability to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (see below) suggest that it could also associate with these subcellular membranes. To examine this possibility, Blk was expressed in MCF-7 cells as a fusion protein with GFP and then visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy 16 h post-transfection, before it can induce apoptosis. Cells were fixed and also stained with the mitochondrial specific stain MitoTracker™ Red (Fig. 2). Unlike the GFP non-fusion protein (Fig. 2, A–C), the GFP-Blk fusion protein exhibited a punctate fluorescence that colocalized with the MitoTracker™ Red stain (Fig. 2, D–F), suggesting that Blk is predominantly associated with the mitochondrial membranes. The apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bax) are believed to initiate the apoptotic process stoichiometrically, where the death or survival of the cell depends upon the ratio of the apoptotic to the anti-apoptotic proteins in the cell (21Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). To examine the apoptotic activity of Blk compared with Bik and Bax, increasing amounts of constructs expressing these proteins were transfected into MCF-7 cells, and the number of apoptotic cells were scored. Consistent with previous observations, the three proteins induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, where the apoptotic effect was dependent on the amount of DNA transfected (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, in all our experiments, murine Blk showed higher potency than Bik and Bax. Similar results were observed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cells (data not shown). Consistent with their ability to antagonize the death promoting activity of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, transfected Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were able to suppress the proapoptotic activity of Blk, Bik, and Bax (Fig. 3 B). Bcl-xL was a better inhibitor of apoptosis than Bcl-2 in all these cases. The extent of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-mediated inhibition of apoptosis induced by the three death agonists followed the order Blk < Bik < Bax. This is in correlation with the ability of Blk to induce more apoptosis than Bik and Bax (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the inhibition of apoptosis depends on the ratio of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to Blk, because increasing this ratio results in more inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 3 C). These data support earlier observations that the ratio of the pro- to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins determines whether cells die or survive. All the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members heterodimerize with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. To determine whether Blk can also bind to Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, in vivo and in vitro binding studies were performed. 35S-Labeled Blk, Bik, or Bax were precipitated with GST, GST-Bcl-2, or GST-Bcl-xL fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig.4 A). Like Bik and Bax, Blk specifically associated with GST-Bcl-2 and GST-Bcl-xL but not with the GST control. This suggests that Blk interacts directly with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Similarly, Blk, Bik, and Bax bound to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL when these proteins were co-expressed in vivo (Fig.4 B). In view of the importance of the BH3 domain in the death agonist activity of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (8Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar), we introduced mutations in the BH3 domain of Blk to identify critical residues that are essential for its function. The Leu55 and Gly59-Asp60 of Blk are conserved in the BH3 domains of the Bcl-2 family members (Fig. 1 A). Mutations in these three residues have been shown to affect both protein-protein interaction and apoptotic efficiency (8Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

To determine the positional importance of Gly59-Asp60 on the function of Blk, we generated two Blk mutants in which either Gly59 (Blk-ΔG59) or Gly59 and Asp60 (Blk-ΔG59-D60) were deleted. As shown in Fig. 4(C and D), Blk-ΔG59 showed drastic reduction in both binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and death agonist activity. Deletion of Gly59-Asp60 abrogated both activities which is consistent with that observed in the all BH domains protein Bak (11Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houston A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates the importance of these residues in keeping the overall geometry of the BH3 domain, and further confirms the critical role of the BH3 domain in the death agonist activity of Blk. Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and its binding to Apaf-1 triggers a dATP/ATP-dependent activation of caspase-9, the most upstream caspase in the cytochrome c-dependent apoptotic pathway (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). This pathway can be blocked by an active site dominant negative caspase-9 mutant (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can also block this pathway possibly by preventing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (6Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cytochrome c-Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway is involved in Blk-induced apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with Blk, Bik, or Bax and an inactive caspase-9 C287A mutant. Overexpression of Blk, Bik, and Bax induced apoptosis in nearly 97, 78, and 70% of the cells, respectively (Fig.5 A). The active site mutant of caspase-9 reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis to nearly 52, 20, and 10%, respectively. When caspase-9 mutant was substituted with caspase-8 or caspase-10 dominant negative mutants, which block death receptor-induced apoptosis (19MacFarlane M. Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M.

Furthermore, as shown recently for Bik and Bak (22Orth K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8841-8844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), CrmA, which inhibits caspase-8 but not caspase-9 (23Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Alnemri, unpublished observations. was also ineffective against Blk-, Bik-, and Bax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). Binding of the active site mutant of caspase-9 to the Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex inactivates this complex and blocks apoptosis by inhibiting activation of the downstream caspase-3, which is directly activated by caspase-9 (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have shown recently that the caspase-9 mutant can inhibit Bax-induced apoptosis and processing of caspase-3 (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Like Bax, transfection of 293 cells with Blk or Bik resulted in processing of caspase-3 (Fig. 5 B). This processing was almost completely blocked when a 4-fold excess of mutant caspase-9 was co-expressed with Blk or Bik (Fig. 5 B). Processing of caspase-7 was also inhibited in these cells (data not shown) by the caspase-9 mutant, suggesting that caspase-3 and -7 are downstream of caspase-9 in Blk-induced apoptosis. Taken together, caspase-9 appears to be the most upstream caspase in the apoptotic pathway triggered by the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. In conclusion, Blk was identified as a novel member of the Bcl-2 family of death regulatory proteins. Like Bik, Bid, and Hrk, Blk shares sequence homology with other family members in the BH3 domain but lacks the conserved BH1, BH2, and BH4 domains. The BH3 domain is essential for the death agonist activity of Blk and its ability to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, because deletions of conserved residues in this domain abolished both activities. This supports a model suggesting that direct interactions between the BH3 domain of Blk and Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL is required to suppress the protective activity of these proteins and induce apoptosis. Our data also suggest that Blk, Bik, and Bax induce apoptosis by triggering the formation of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex and activation of caspase-9, downstream of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The precise mechanism by which they trigger this process is not yet known. However, because cytochrome c is required for formation of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that they may trigger cytochrome c release from the mitochondria by inhibiting the channel forming activity of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (4Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), which may lead to disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We thank Dr. J. C. Reed for the GST-Bcl-2 and GST-Bcl-xL constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1990995529,"Flightless-I (fliI) is a novel member of the gelsolin family that is important for actin organization duringDrosophila embryogenesis and myogenesis.Drosophila fliI and the human homolog FLI both contain the classic gelsolin 6-fold segmental repeats and an amino-terminal extension of 16 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRR). LRR repeats form amphipathic β-α structural units that mediate protein-protein interactions. Although there are close to 100 known LRR domain-containing proteins, only a few binding pairs have been identified. In this paper, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify proteins that interact with human FLI. In vitrosynthesized FLI bound to actin-Sepharose and binding was reduced by competition with excess soluble actin. Actin binding was mediated through the gelsolin-like domain and not the LRR domain. Although the FLI LRR module is most closely related to the LRR domains of Ras-interactive proteins, FLI does not associate with Ras, selected Ras effectors, or other Ras-related small GTPases. Two-hybrid screens using FLI LRR as bait identified a novel LRR binding partner. The 0.65-kilobase pair (kb) clone from the screen survived additional rounds of stringent two-hybrid pairwise assays, establishing a specific interaction. Binding to FLI LRR was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation with FLI LRR. The translated sequence of the FLI LRR associated protein (FLAP) encodes a novel protein not represented in the data base. Northern blot analyses revealed four FLAP messages of approximately 2.7, 2.9, 3.3, and 5.1 kb, which are differentially expressed in the tissues tested. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are particularly rich in the 3.3-kb FLAP message, and the FLI message as well. Full-length FLAP clones were isolated from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. They have an open reading frame which encodes for a protein containing 626 amino acids. Sequence analyses predict that the FLAP protein is rich in α-helices and contains stretches of dimeric coiled coil in its middle region and COOH terminus. The identification of actin and FLAP as the binding ligands for the gelsolin-like domain and the LRR domain, respectively, suggests that FLI may link the actin cytoskeleton to other modules implicated in intermolecular recognition and structural organization. Flightless-I (fliI) is a novel member of the gelsolin family that is important for actin organization duringDrosophila embryogenesis and myogenesis.Drosophila fliI and the human homolog FLI both contain the classic gelsolin 6-fold segmental repeats and an amino-terminal extension of 16 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRR).

Two-hybrid screens using FLI LRR as bait identified a novel LRR binding partner. The 0.65-kilobase pair (kb) clone from the screen survived additional rounds of stringent two-hybrid pairwise assays, establishing a specific interaction. Binding to FLI LRR was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation with FLI LRR. The translated sequence of the FLI LRR associated protein (FLAP) encodes a novel protein not represented in the data base. Northern blot analyses revealed four FLAP messages of approximately 2.7, 2.9, 3.3, and 5.1 kb, which are differentially expressed in the tissues tested. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are particularly rich in the 3.3-kb FLAP message, and the FLI message as well. Full-length FLAP clones were isolated from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. They have an open reading frame which encodes for a protein containing 626 amino acids. Sequence analyses predict that the FLAP protein is rich in α-helices and contains stretches of dimeric coiled coil in its middle region and COOH terminus. The identification of actin and FLAP as the binding ligands for the gelsolin-like domain and the LRR domain, respectively, suggests that FLI may link the actin cytoskeleton to other modules implicated in intermolecular recognition and structural organization. Gelsolin is a Ca2+- and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-regulated actin-binding protein (1Liu Y.T. Rozelle A. Yin H.L. Aktories K. Kohama K. Maruta H. G Proteins, Cytoskeleton, and Cancer. Springer-Verlag & Lander Bio. Science, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). It has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the modulation of membrane-cytoskeletal cross-talks (2Sun H.-Q. Kwiatkowska K. Wooten D.C. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Lin K. Wenegieme E.F. Lu P. Chen C. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20443-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Sun H. Lin K. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Many gelsolin-like proteins have been identified and they appear to have evolved from an ancestral single segment gene that has duplicated multiple times to form proteins with 3- or 6-fold repeats (5Kwiatkowski D.P. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recent three-dimensional structure analyses show that the segments within gelsolin (6Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), as well as segments from different gelsolin family members, have a similar core structure (7McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.-G. Weeds A.G.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 8Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Eichinger L. Schleicher M. Holak T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Markus M.A. Nakayama T. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the gelsolin family of proteins have distinct actin binding characteristics and intracellular localizations. For example, unlike most gelsolin members, CapG is a nuclear as well as cytoplasmic protein (10Onoda K. Yu F.-X. Yin H.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and it does not sever filaments (11Yu F.-X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conserved residues in each protein appear to maintain the basic folds of the repeated segments, while actin binding per se involves residues customized for each segment and for each protein. Flightless I (fliI) 1The abbreviations used are: fliI,Drosophila flightless-I gene; fliI, Drosphilaflightles-I protein; FLI, human flightless-I protein; LRR, leucine-rich repeat, FLAP, FLI LRR associated protein; HC, IgG heavy chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: fliI,Drosophila flightless-I gene; fliI, Drosphilaflightles-I protein; FLI, human flightless-I protein; LRR, leucine-rich repeat, FLAP, FLI LRR associated protein; HC, IgG heavy chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase pair(s). is a recently identified member of the gelsolin family (12Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11386-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It was discovered as a mutation in Drosphila melanogaster that leads to flightlessness. This phenotype is accompanied by disorganization of the indirect flight muscle myofibrils (13Miklos G. De Couet G. J. Neurogenet. 1990; 6: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Other more severe fliI mutations lead to late larval or pupal death. Eggs lacking maternally supplied fliI show incomplete cellularization, abnormal furrow formation, and impaired gastrulation. Defective cellularization of the syncytial blastoderm is associated with a disorganized cortical actin cytoskeleton (14Straub K.L. Stella M.C. Leptin M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flightless and cellularization phenotypes suggest that fliI is required for actin organization during myogenesis and embryogenesis, respectively. The human flightless I (FLI) locus has been mapped to a region deleted in the Smith-Magenis syndrome (15Chen K.-S. Gunaratne P.H. Hoheisel J.D. Young I.G. Gabor Miklos G.L. Greenberg F. Shaffer L.G. Campbell H.D. Lupski J.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), which is associated with a spectrum of developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The COOH-terminal half of human FLI has 31% identity and 52% similarity to human gelsolin (12Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11386-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and has the same 6-fold segmental repeat typical of many gelsolin family members (Fig. 1 A). Since FLI is more divergent from gelsolin than other gelsolin family members such as CapG, adseverin, and villin (1Liu Y.T. Rozelle A. Yin H.L. Aktories K. Kohama K. Maruta H. G Proteins, Cytoskeleton, and Cancer. Springer-Verlag & Lander Bio. Science, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar), it probably arose from the prototypical ancestral protein very early during phylogeny and evolved independently (16Campbell H.D. Fountain S. Young I.G. Claudianos C. Hoheisel J.D. Chen K. Lupski J.R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether FLI is an actin-binding protein, and how it interacts with actin. The NH2-terminal half of FLI is distinct from that of the other previously identified gelsolin members. It contains 16 tandem 23-amino acid leucine-rich repeat motif (LRR) (12Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11386-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) found in an emerging collection of proteins (17Buchanan S.G. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Close to 100 proteins containing this motif have been identified thus far. Proteins in this LRR superfamily have diverse cellular localizations (extracellular, cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and nuclear) and functions (receptor ligand binding, signal transduction, cell adhesion, development, bacterial virulence, DNA repair, and RNA processing). The unifying theme among these diverse functions is molecular recognition. The LRR motif contributes to protein-protein interactions, either directly as the ligand binding module, or as a regulator to enhance affinity and/or specificity of binding to a separate ligand-binding site. In a few cases, the LRR binding partners have been identified. The ligand:LRR protein pairs include glycoprotein hormones:G-protein coupled receptors (18Tayar E.N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 125: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), collagen:matrix proteoglycans (such as decorin) (19Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), protein phosphatase-1:sds22 (required for the completion of mitosis) (20Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), neurotrophins:trk receptors (21Windisch J. Marksteiner R. Lang M. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Ras:yeast adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) (22Suzuki N. Choe H.R. Nishida Y. Yamawakikatoka S. Ohnishi Y. Tamaoki Y. Kataoka T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and pancreatic RNases:RNase inhibitor (24Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Among the LRR modules identified thus far, the FLI LRR 23-amino acid repeats fit the consensus for a LRR subgroup consisting of proteins which can potentially interact with Ras-like ligands (17Buchanan S.G. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Claudianos C. Campbell H.D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 405-414PubMed Google Scholar). This group includes Rsp-1 (also known as Rsu-1), which binds Raf-1 (26Masuelli L. Cutler M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the yeast adenylate cyclase (Cyr1). Rsp-1 has 35% identity and 53% similarity to FLI. It binds Raf-1 (26Masuelli L. Cutler M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and suppresses the transformation activity of v-Ras (27Cutler M.L. Bassin R.H. Zanoni L. Talbot N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cyr1 is regulated by Ras, and its LRR motif is required for membrane association and Ras binding (22Suzuki N. Choe H.R. Nishida Y. Yamawakikatoka S. Ohnishi Y. Tamaoki Y. Kataoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 87: 8711-8715Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The similarity in LRR motifs raises the intriguing possibility that FLI may mediate interactions with Ras homologs (25Claudianos C. Campbell H.D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 405-414PubMed Google Scholar). This is plausible because Ras transformation disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and Rac1, a small G-protein which drives membrane ruffling (28Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), has been implicated in Ras transformation. Gelsolin severing and capping may be regulated by Rac1 (29Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and gelsolin suppresses Ras-induced transformation in foci assays (30Fujita H. Laham L.E. Janmey P.A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Stossel T.P. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Mllauer L. Ishizaki A. Kuzumaki N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 615-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used a variety of approaches to determine if FLI binds Ras or its downstream effectors. In addition, we tried to identify other FLI-LRR binding partners, to begin a molecular characterization of this novel member of the gelsolin and LRR superfamilies. The human FLI cDNA which was inserted into pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene) through the EcoRI site, was kindly provided by H. D. Campbell (The Australian National University). This cDNA (12Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11386-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) is missing the AT nucleotides of the ATG initiation codon (GenBank accession U01184). To introduce a translation initiation codon, the cDNA was excised with EcoRV and SpeI in the multiple cloning region upstream and downstream of the EcoRI site, and subcloned into pGEM-5Zf(+) vector (Promega). The resultant clone contains a short fusion sequence 5′ of the original fliI cDNA (5′-ccATGgccgcgggatatcgaattccgGAG-3′) and was used for construction of all the yeast and mammalian FLI expression vectors described here. The FLI LRR domain construct was generated by SmaI digestion (nucleotide 1399), and encompasses amino acids 1–466. This construct extends past the end of the LRR repeat at amino acid 380 into part of the linker between the LRR- and gelsolin-like domains (Fig.1 A). A gelsolin-like domain construct which contains an initiation codon and spans FLI amino acid 496–1269 was constructed by introducing an initiation codon using polymerase chain reaction primers. Full-length and truncated FLI cDNA were cloned into the pTM1 vector (31Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). 1 μg of cDNA was added to the T7 polymerase-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega) in the presence of Trans35S-label (ICN Biomedical, Inc.), and in vitro transcription and translation were carried out in a 50-μl volume according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 and 4 μl of the in vitro transcribed and translated product was diluted to 80 μl with a buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, and 0.1% gelatin, pH 7.5, and added to 20 μl of packed actin-Sepharose beads (32Kwiatkowski D. Janmey P.A. Mole J. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the beads were then washed three times in the same buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. In some samples, 4 μl of 3 mg/ml actin or bovine serum albumin was added to determine if binding to actin-Sepharose was reduced by competition with soluble actin. GST-Ras, GST-RasVal-12, GST-RhoA, and GST-CDC42 (gifts of A. Hall, University College London and M. White, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) were expressed in BL21 and purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia). They were charged with GTP or GDP.35S-Labeled FLI and LRR produced by in vitrotranscription and translation were added to the beads and binding was determined as described (33Han L. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LexA based yeast two-hybrid system (34Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) was used initially to identify candidate FLI LRR interactive clones. The FLI LRR domain was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the sequence encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain of the yeast two-hybrid vector pBTM116. The construct (pLEX-LRR) was used as a bait to screen a GAL4 activation domain-based human HeLa matchmaker cDNA library (pGAD-GH vector, CLONTECH). The yeast L40 strain (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-His URA3::lexA-lacZ) was sequentially transformed, and potential interactors were identified as described previously (34Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.6 million transformants were screened. Positive plasmids were isolated and tested against pLEX-lamin to rule out nonspecific interaction. Pairwise assays were also used to detect interaction with small GTPases (plasmids provided by M. White and J. Frost, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The GAL4 DNA-binding domain-based two-hybrid system (35Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the specificity of the interaction between LRR and its candidate binding partner. FLI LRR was fused to the COOH terminus of GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS2 vector to create pAS2-LRR. This construct was co-transformed with the previously identified LRR interactive plasmids into yeast Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3-112 URA3::GAL-lacZ LYS2::GAL-HIS3 cyh r). Transformants were plated as patches on selective medium, and replica plated on Whatman No. 50 filter paper on agar plates for β-galactosidase assays. 32P-Labeled probes were synthesized with random primers by the Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Pharmacia). Full-length FLI, H186 FLAP, and β-actin cDNAs were used as templates. The premade poly(A) RNA human tissue blot, purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD) was hybridized in buffer containing 0.2% SDS, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 14–16 h. The membrane was washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature 3 times, and with 0.25 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min 2 times. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 1 h to 4 days. Membrane was stripped between probes. A mouse I.M.A.G.E. consortium (LLNL) EST clone (ID 532888) whose 5′ sequence (GenBank accession number AA068950) (36Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) is homologous to the two-hybrid human FLAP cDNA insert, was purchased from the ATCC. It was 32P-labeled and used to screen a mouse skeletal muscle 5′-Stretch Plus λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Approximately 8 × 105plaques were screened. The inserts in the positive plaques were amplified with the Expand Long Template polymerase chain reaction system (Boehringer Mannheim), using the λgt11 LD-insert screening amplimer set (CLONTECH). The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and nucleotide sequences were determined by manual and automatic sequencing using external and internal primers. The H186 FLAP cDNA was released from the HeLa matchmaker vector pGAD GH with SpeI and XhoI. The insert was ligated to the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) digested with XbaI and XhoI. The resultant plasmid was transformed into DH5α (Life Technologies) or BLR (Novagen). Bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.5 and GST-H186 FLAP fusion protein (GST-H186 FLAP) synthesis was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were lysed and fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with 0.3 m cupric chloride without fixation. The GST-H186 FLAP band was excised and used for rabbit immunization. The antibody from an early bleed, which recognizes H186 FLAP but not GST, was used for Western blotting. The FLI clone containing the inserted initiation codon (as described above) was further modified by attaching a COOH-terminal HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA). The construct was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) via the BamHI and XhoI sites in the multiple cloning region. H186 FLAP was cloned into pCMV5 (38Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed protein contains a 12-residue Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDLN) at the NH2 terminus, 218 amino acids from H186 FLAP, and 31 residues of pCMV5 sequence acquired because H186 does not contain its own stop codon. The FLAP-1 cDNA has its own translation start and stop codons and was cloned into pcDNA3. DNA was transfected singly or in combination (at a 1:1 weight ratio) into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were cultured for 24–36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfected cells (in 60 mm dishes) were labeled with Trans35S-label (100 μCi/ml) for 2 h in methionine-free medium and lysed in 300 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.025% sodium azide). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. 30–50 μl of 12CA5 anti-HA hybridoma culture medium (gift of R. Gaynor, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) was added to 150 μl of the lysis supernatant. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was added and incubation continued for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. Beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer, once with a buffer without detergent (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide), and finally with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. They were boiled in SDS gel sample buffer with 4 m urea and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 7.5% acrylamide or 5–15% gradient acrylamide gels were used. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using the ECL system (Amersham) or by autoradiography. To determine if FLI is an actin-binding protein, FLI and the FLI LRR domain (Fig.1 A) were expressed by in vitro transcription and translation (Fig. 1 B). In each case, a single in vitro transcribed product which migrated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel with mobility consistent with the calculated molecular mass was generated (145 and 68 kDa, respectively, for FLI and LRR). The in vitro transcription products were incubated with actin-Sepharose in the presence and absence of excess soluble actin. FLI bound actin-Sepharose in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C, left panel, lanes 1 and 2). Addition of actin monomers inhibited FLI binding to actin-Sepharose, as evidenced by the lack of FLI in the pellet, and its retention in the supernatant (compare lanes 3 with lanes 1). Densitometry scanning shows that doubling the amount of in vitro transcription product results in a 145% increase in FLI associated with actin-Sepharose (lanes 1 and 2) and addition of excess actin reduced FLI binding to actin-Sepharose to 16% (lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, bovine serum albumin did not decrease binding (data not shown). Thus, FLI bound actin specifically. This is not surprising, but until now, FLI has not been formally established as an actin-binding protein. In contrast to full-length FLI, in vitro transcribed and translated FLI LRR (Fig.1 B, right panel) did not bind actin-Sepharose (data not shown), suggesting that actin binding was mediated through the gelsolin-like domain. The close resemblance between FLI-LRR with those of Cyr1 and Rsp-1 raises the possibility that FLI may also interact with Ras or its downstream effectors. This possibility was examined in two ways. First, two-hybrid pairwise assays were used to identify interactionsin vivo. Second, recombinant Ras and RasVal-12, the consitutitvely active form of Ras, were expressed as fusion proteins with GST, and their binding to in vitro transcribed and translated LRR was determined by sedimenting GST fusion proteins with glutathione beads. Neither assay was able to detect evidence for Ras interaction with LRR. In the two-hybrid assay, LRR did not interact with RasVal-12 or Ras (data not shown), although RasVal-12 interacted with its known effectors, Ral GDS (39White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), Raf (34Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), and Cyr1 (34Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), under identical conditions. In addition, there was no evidence for LRR binding to other small G proteins, such as Rac2, RhoA, or CDC42 (data not shown). Likewise, we did not detect specific binding of in vitro synthesized LRR to GST-RasVal-12, GST-Ras, GST-CDC42, or GST-RhoA, either in the presence of GTP or GDP with the GST bead pull down assay (data not shown). Two-hybrid screens using LRR fused with the LexA DNA-binding domain as bait yielded four interactive clones that did not bind the negative control, lamin. All of these clones have similar DNA sequences, and one (H186) was selected for further analysis. H186 survived additional stringent tests for specific interactions (TableI). H186 interacted with LRR regardless of whether it was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain or the transcriptional activation domain. It did not bind lamin, and it still bound LRR when fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain instead of the LexA domain (Table I). In contrast, H186 did not bind the FLI gelsolin-like domain.

https://openalex.org/W2016042605,"The breast and ovarian cancer tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, encodes for a Zn2+-binding RING finger motif located near the protein NH2 terminus. The RING finger motif is characterized by eight conserved Cys and His residues which form two Zn2+-binding sites termed Site I and Site II. We used limited proteolysis in conjunction with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy to investigate the metal binding properties and to probe the solution structures of wild-type and mutant BRCA1 constructs that include the RING finger. Our results show that the RING finger motif is part of a larger proteolysis-resistant structural domain which encompasses the first 110 residues of BRCA1. Analytical gel-filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrate that the BRCA1 NH2-terminal domain readily homodimerizes in solution. The cancer-predisposing C61G mutation, which alters a conserved Zn2+-binding residue, abolishes metal binding to Site II of the RING finger motif, while Site I remains intact and functional. The C61G mutation also results in increased proteolytic susceptibility of the COOH-terminal portion of the NH2-terminal domain and perturbs the oligomerization properties of BRCA1.

The BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene encodes for a large protein of 1863 amino acid residues that bears little homology to previously described proteins (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuch-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. et al.Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5210) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of BRCA1, however, contains a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues associated with the RING finger family. The RING finger is a Zn2+-binding motif found in a wide variety of proteins that are diverse both in function and origin (2Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Although generally thought to mediate macromolecular interactions, a specific function for RING finger domains has yet to be defined. Nonetheless, the RING finger domain is clearly important for BRCA1 function. The first 100 residues, which include the RING finger motif (residues 24–64), comprise the most highly conserved region among known BRCA1genes (5Abel K.J. Xu J. Yin G.-Y. Lyons R.H. Meisler M.H.

In addition, another RING finger-containing protein, BARD1 (BRCA1associated RING domain 1), has been identified that specifically interacts with the NH2-terminal region of BRCA1 (9Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).

Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The structures share common folding topologies for the core of the domain (Fig.1), which include at least two antiparallel β-strands and tetrahedral coordination of two Zn2+ atoms by the eight conserved residues that define the RING finger motif. The two Zn2+ sites are formed by alternating pairs of coordinating ligands with the first and third pairs forming Site I and the second and fourth pairs forming Site II. The PML and IEEHV solution structures show that the RING finger domain alone can behave as an autonomous Zn2+-dependent folding motif, but the RING finger of RAG1, in combination with a second RAG1 Zn2+-binding module, forms a larger structural unit that specifically homodimerizes in solution. Thus, there are significant differences among RING finger structures that are likely of functional significance. To understand properties of BRCA1 that may contribute to its function, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the NH2-terminal region of BRCA1 that includes the RING finger motif. Sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Pierce) and V8 (Worthington) were used. Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, α-chymotrypsinogen, ribonuclease A, and glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,2′:6′,2“-terpyridine (Terpy) (Aldrich) were used without further purification. Constructs containing the first 76, 112, and 172 amino acid residues of BRCA1 were prepared by PCR amplification of the desired regions using human lymphoblast cDNA as a template. Primers were synthesized to obtain BRCA1 PCR products incorporating NheI and BamHI endonuclease restriction sites in the 5′ primer and 3′ primer, respectively. PCR products and pET11a vector (Novagen) were digested with NheI and BamHI, and the DNA insert was cloned into the vector. The ligated construct was used to transformEscherichia coli BL21 cells for protein expression. Cloned inserts were sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer ABI prism 377 DNA sequencer. Due to the restriction sites used, each construct contains two extra amino acids (Ala and Ser), at the amino terminus. Construct and fragment designations refer to the number and position of BRCA1 residues. Starter cultures grown from single colonies were inoculated into 500-ml Luria broth/2-liter flasks containing 100 μg/liter ampicillin to an initial A600 nm of 0.1 and grown at 37 °C with shaking. When the A600 nm reached ∼0.5–0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 mm to induce expression. Cells were allowed to grow for 4 h after induction and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in ∼30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (4 mm) added, and cells were lysed with a French press. The homogenate was incubated with DNase, RNase, and MgCl2 (10 mm) at 4 °C for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Each BRCA1 construct separated into the pellet fraction, which was washed with lysis buffer, solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1% HOAc. The resulting supernatant was lyophilized, reconstituted in 0.1% HOAc, and further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Waters Delta Pak C4 column with a water/ACN gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Protein was applied at 30% ACN and eluted with a linear 30–50% ACN gradient varying at a rate of 0.5%/min. Protein-containing fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in 2 m guanidine HCl in the presence of Zn2+, and purified by gel-filtration chromatography (see below). Protein purity (typically ≥99%) and amino acid composition were determined by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy. Approximate extinction coefficients at 276 nm, calculated on the basis of amino acid composition, are 4.06 and 5.51 mm−1cm−1 for BC-112 and BC-172, respectively. BC-76, which contains no tyrosine residues, was quantified by amino acid analysis. Gel-filtration chromatography was performed using an HR 10/30 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled to a BioCAD Sprint (Perseptive Biosystems) chromatography system. The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (Buffer A), treated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove extraneous metal ions. Elution profiles were monitored at 212 nm. The column was calibrated using bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), α-chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Glutaraldehyde cross-linking reactions using peak fractions from the gel-filtration column (typically 2–10 μm by absorbance) were performed in the presence of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (w/v) prepared in Buffer A at ambient temperature. Reaction aliquots were removed at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after the addition of glutaraldehyde, quenched with an equal volume of 2 × SDS loading buffer (0.15 m Tris, 1.5% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1.25m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 8.8), run on 14% SDS-PAGE mini-gels, and visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad). Co2+binding to BC-76 peptides was monitored by acquiring UV-visible spectra over a range of 290–800 nm using an AVIV model 14DS UV-visible spectrophotomer. Buffer A was sparged with N2 to reduce oxidation of cysteine residues. Peptide concentrations were approximately 50 μm. The concentration of Co2+ stock solutions were determined spectrophotometrically using Terpy (14Storm M.C. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fractions purified by gel-filtration chromatography in Buffer A were quantitated and used directly for limited proteolysis experiments. Protease, either endoproteinase Lys-C or V8, was added to a final protein:protease ratio of 250–1000:1 (w/w). Reaction aliquots (5-μl) were removed at 0, 3, 10, 25, 60, and 120 min after the addition of protease and quenched by dilution into an equal volume of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteolysis of metal-free protein samples was performed both in the absence and presence of EDTA. A saturated 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) matrix solution was prepared in 30% ACN solution and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI samples were prepared using the dried droplet method (15Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar), and mass spectra were acquired with a Perseptive Voyager Elite MALDI mass spectrometer equipped with delayed ion extraction. Gel-filtration chromatography was used to assess the oligomerization properties of the NH2-terminal region of BRCA1. We engineered three constructs of BRCA1 (termed BC-76, BC-112, and BC-172 based upon the number of BRCA1 residues), all of which start at the NH2 terminus of BRCA1 and include the RING finger motif. Fig. 2 A shows gel-filtration elution profiles for the BC-76 and BC-112 constructs. Both wt BC-76 and BC-112 elute primarily as sharp peaks with peak widths nearly identical to those of standard proteins used for column calibration (profiles of standards not shown). This indicates that each protein elutes predominantly as a single species. Relative to the standard proteins, the apparent molecular weight for each construct is slightly more than twice that predicted from their monomeric molecular weights. These findings suggest that the BRCA1 RING finger constructs specifically oligomerize in solution. To verify the self-association inferred from the gel-filtration experiments and to determine oligomer stoichiometry, wt BC-76 and BC-112 were subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linking (Fig.2 B). The results show that the predominant species captured by the cross-linking reaction is a dimer. Some higher order oligomers are observed at higher glutaraldehyde concentrations and longer incubation times. Taken together, the gel-filtration and cross-linking experiments indicate that the NH2-terminal BRCA1 constructs form homodimers in solution. The C61G cancer-predisposing mutation alters one of the conserved Site II Zn2+-binding ligands in the RING finger motif (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2 A, both the BC-76 and BC-112 C61G mutant constructs elute from the gel-filtration column as a broad peak with a large apparent molecular weight. This behavior is indicative of proteins involved in weak, nonspecific aggregation. Wild-type BRCA1 RING finger constructs in the absence of Zn2+ show similar elution profiles (data not shown). Metal binding to both the wild-type and C61G mutant RING fingers was investigated using Co2+ as a spectroscopic probe. Previous studies have shown that addition of Co2+ to the RING finger domains of PML and BRCA1 yields characteristic spectral bands in the 600–800 nm region of the visible spectrum that are consistent with tetrahedral coordination of the Co2+ at both Site I and Site II by the conserved RING finger ligands (Fig. 1; Refs. 10Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar and 16Roehm P.C. Berg J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 695 nm increases linearly with Co2+concentration up to approximately 1 equivalent of Co2+(Fig. 3). Saturation occurs at slightly more than 2 equivalents of Co2+/BC-76 peptide. These results indicate that Co2+ binding occurs in two discrete stages, consistent with the findings of Roehm and Berg (16Roehm P.C. Berg J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who assign the first binding step to coordination of Co2+ by the four cysteine ligands of Site I. Titration of C61G BC-76 with Co2+ shows that stoichiometric binding to the higher affinity Site I is retained. The initial phase of the titration is nearly superimposable on the wild-type curve. However, binding saturates at ∼1 equivalent of Co2+. Thus, in the mutant RING finger metal binding to Site I is retained, while binding to Site II is either abolished or substantially reduced in affinity. Proteolytic susceptibility can be used to identify both stable structural regions and flexible segments within proteins (17Kriwacki R.W. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5320-5321Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Cohen S.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 1013-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Cohen S.L. Ferre-D' Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We used limited proteolysis in conjunction with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to probe structural changes that result from Zn2+ binding to the wild-type and C61G BC-76 constructs. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were collected on reaction samples quenched at various times after the addition of the endoprotease (Endo) Lys-C (Fig. 4). Prior to the addition of protease, only a single species corresponding to intact wt BC-76 is observed in the mass spectrum. Since Endo Lys-C cleaves COOH-terminal to lysine residues, there are nine potential cleavage sites in BC-76 (Fig. 4). In the absence of Zn2+, considerable cleavage is observed throughout the protein only 3 min after the addition of protease (Fig. 4 A), indicating that nearly every site is accessible to protease. After 60 min, proteolytic degradation is complete. Similar results were obtained with V8, which primarily targets glutamate residues (data not shown). These data show that in the absence of Zn2+, BC-76 is fairly flexible, with little or no protease-resistant structure. In contrast, wt BC-76 in the presence of Zn2+ is quite resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 4 B). Cleavage is restricted to two sites, resulting in fragments 1–70 and 1–55. Lys-70, the primary cleavage site after 3 min, is outside the minimal RING finger motif. Lys-55 is located between the third and fourth pairs of Zn2+-binding residues in the RING finger motif. Both fragments persist after 60 min of digestion. Thus, Zn2+binding to BC-76 yields two protease-resistant fragments: one that contains both Zn2+-binding sites and one that contains Site I only. Consistent with the Co2+ binding studies that indicated that C61G BC-76 still binds one metal ion, the BC-76 mutant is clearly less susceptible to proteolysis than the apo-peptide. Instead, the proteolysis profile of C61G shows similarities to the wt Zn2+-bound BC-76. At early time points, the same two fragments (1–55 and 1–70) as are seen in the wt BC-76 digest are observed for C61G. Inspection of Fig. 4 C reveals that a fragment (1–65) not observed during proteolysis of wt BC-76 accumulates in the C61G reaction mixture after 3 min. Lys-65 is immediately adjacent to the last conserved cysteine residue of the RING finger motif and is rendered susceptible to proteolysis as a consequence of the C61G mutation. These results show that the C61G mutant is capable of binding Zn2+ at Site I, but the mutation significantly alters the metal binding properties at Site II, which, in turn, affects the COOH-terminal structure of BC-76 rendering it more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. 2Proteolysis of wt BC-76 with Endo Lys-C performed in the presence of 1 Zn2+ equivalent yielded a proteolytic profile similar to the C61G BC-76 mutant, consistent with sequential metal binding to the RING finger domain. To determine whether the RING finger motif itself represents a complete and autonomous folding domain or is instead part of a larger structural domain, we performed limited proteolysis on two longer constructs, BC-112 and BC-172. Addition of Endo Lys-C results in rapid cleavage at residue 109 of BC-112, three residues from the COOH terminus (Fig.5 A). The remaining fragment is relatively stable against further proteolytic degradation. As observed for BC-76, some cleavage occurs at Lys-55 within the RING finger motif, generating fragments 1–55 and 56–109 and showing that this region of the RING finger domain is still accessible to protease despite the presence of the extra COOH-terminal residues. The stability of BC-112 is strongly Zn2+-dependent, as rapid degradation of the entire construct occurs upon addition of excess EDTA (data not shown). Identical experiments with the larger BC-172 construct also show rapid cleavage at residue 109 by Endo Lys-C (Fig.5 B). As with BC-112, residues 1–109 are moderately protected from further proteolysis, while the COOH-terminal fragment is rapidly degraded. Similar profiles were obtained for cleavage of BC-112 and BC-172 with V8 protease (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the first 110 residues of BRCA1 form a unique structural domain. Limited proteolysis of the C61G BC-112 mutant yields a proteolytic profile very different from that of wt BC-112 (Fig. 5 C). The mutant is degraded much faster than the wild-type construct. Furthermore, there is very little accumulation of the 1–109 fragment, while rapid cleavage at both Lys-55 and Lys-65 is readily apparent. Fragments corresponding to either residues 56–109 or 66–109 are not observed, indicating that the COOH-terminal region of C61G BC-112 is rapidly degraded. The appearance and persistence of the fragment 1–55 indicates that the mutant is still capable of binding Zn2+at Site I, similar to the shorter C61G BC-76 construct. Therefore, loss or reduction of Zn2+ binding at Site II has a profound effect on proteolytic susceptibility throughout the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule. Although the importance of BRCA1 in tumor suppression and cell growth regulation is widely recognized, little is known about properties of the protein that are pertinent to its function. To begin to address this question, we characterized a number of solution properties of the NH2-terminal portion of both wild-type and mutant BRCA1. Our results show that the first 110 residues of BRCA1, which include the RING finger motif, form a structural domain that readily homodimerizes in solution. As will be detailed elsewhere, the BRCA1 NH2-terminal domain identified by limited proteolysis of the homodimer is the same as that required for specific heterodimer formation with BARD1 (9Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The cancer-predisposing C61G mutation affects several important properties of the BRCA1 NH2-terminal domain. Constructs possessing this mutation bind a single metal ion (either Zn2+ or Co2+) at Site I, while Site II is nonfunctional. The inability to bind Zn2+ at Site II has two clear ramifications for the solution properties of the NH2-terminal domain. First, gel-filtration experiments reveal that the mutant constructs behave as aggregates that are larger than the well behaved dimers formed by wild-type constructs. Second, the C61G mutation causes increased susceptibility to proteolysis not only at a site directly following Zn2+ Site II (i.e. Lys-65), but throughout the COOH-terminal region of the domain. The increased flexibility (and possible unfolding) of the COOH-terminal portion of the domain may contribute to its tendency to aggregate. If homodimerization of BRCA1 is required for a critical function, the C61G mutant may well be deficient in this function. Recent biophysical characterization of the RING finger domain from the V(D)J recombination-activating protein, RAG1, shows that the RING finger is part of a larger structural domain that includes a second Zn2+-binding motif (13Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Rodgers K.K. Bu Z. Fleming K.G. Schatz D.G. Engelman D.M. Coleman J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 70-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The RAG1 RING finger forms a scaffold upon which residues both NH2- and COOH-terminal to the RING finger fold to form a homodimerization interface. the Kd for RAG1 dimerization, as determined by sedimentation ultracentrifugation, is approximately 3 μm. The Kd for BRCA1 homodimerization is at least as strong; protein concentrations of peak fractions off the gel-filtration column are typically 2–10 μm, and there is no evidence for the presence of monomeric subunits, indicating that the Kd for BRCA1 dimerization is in the submicromolar range. The protein concentrations used in our studies are undoubtedly much higher than the concentrations expected for BRCA1 in vivo. It will therefore be important to determine an accurateKd for BRCA1 homodimerization to assess the functional significance of these observations. The identification of a BRCA1 NH2-terminal domain permits characterization of specific protein-protein interactions and investigation of possible regulatory events that mediate these functions. Determination of the boundaries of the BRCA1 NH2-terminal structural domain also affords a starting point for detailed structural investigations of BRCA1. Although BRCA1 exhibits some traits in common with the RAG1 homodimer (13Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), there is no evidence for the existence for another BRCA1 Zn2+-binding motif in proximity to the RING finger motif, and the sequence homology between RAG1 and BRCA1 in the regions surrounding the RING finger motif is low. Thus, the structure of the BRCA1 dimerization interface is likely to be unique."
https://openalex.org/W2010309528,"Gain-of-function mutations of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene have been invoked as one of the major causes of toxic thyroid adenomas. In a toxic thyroid nodule, we recently identified a 9-amino acid deletion (amino acid positions 613–621) within the third intracellular (i3) loop of the TSHR resulting in constitutive receptor activity. This finding exemplifies a new mechanism of TSHR activation and raises new questions concerning the function of the i3 loop. Because the i3 loop is thought to be critical for receptor/G protein interaction in many receptors, we systematically reexamined the role of the TSHR's i3 loop for G protein coupling. Thus, various deletion mutants were generated and functionally characterized. We identified an optimal deletion length responsible for constitutive activity. If the number of deleted amino acids was reduced, elevated basal cAMP accumulation was found to be concomitantly diminished. Expansion of the deletion dramatically impaired cell surface expression of the receptor. Shifting the deletion toward the N terminus of the i3 loop resulted in unaltered strong constitutive receptor activity. In contrast, translocation of the deletion toward the C terminus led to significantly reduced basal cAMP formation, most probably due to destruction of a conserved cluster of amino acids. In this study, we show for the first time that amino acid deletions within the i3 loop of a G protein-coupled receptor result in constitutive receptor activity. In the TSHR, 75% of the i3 loop generally assumed to play an essential role in G protein coupling can be deleted without rendering the mutant receptor unresponsive to thyrotropin. These findings support a novel model explaining the molecular events accompanying receptor activation by agonist. Gain-of-function mutations of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene have been invoked as one of the major causes of toxic thyroid adenomas. In a toxic thyroid nodule, we recently identified a 9-amino acid deletion (amino acid positions 613–621) within the third intracellular (i3) loop of the TSHR resulting in constitutive receptor activity.

Because the i3 loop is thought to be critical for receptor/G protein interaction in many receptors, we systematically reexamined the role of the TSHR's i3 loop for G protein coupling. Thus, various deletion mutants were generated and functionally characterized. We identified an optimal deletion length responsible for constitutive activity. If the number of deleted amino acids was reduced, elevated basal cAMP accumulation was found to be concomitantly diminished. Expansion of the deletion dramatically impaired cell surface expression of the receptor. Shifting the deletion toward the N terminus of the i3 loop resulted in unaltered strong constitutive receptor activity. In contrast, translocation of the deletion toward the C terminus led to significantly reduced basal cAMP formation, most probably due to destruction of a conserved cluster of amino acids. In this study, we show for the first time that amino acid deletions within the i3 loop of a G protein-coupled receptor result in constitutive receptor activity. In the TSHR, 75% of the i3 loop generally assumed to play an essential role in G protein coupling can be deleted without rendering the mutant receptor unresponsive to thyrotropin. These findings support a novel model explaining the molecular events accompanying receptor activation by agonist. The glycoprotein hormone TSH 1The abbreviations used are: TSH, thyrotropin; TSHR, thyrotropin receptor; bTSH, bovine thyrotropin; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; i3, third intracellular loop; IP, inositol phosphate; LHR, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TM, transmembrane domains; wt, wild-type. is the major regulator of growth and differentiation of the thyroid gland (1Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar). TSH acts by binding to its receptor at the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) belongs to the large superfamily of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (1Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr.

In the human thyroid, the ligand-bound TSHR leads to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C by interacting with Gsand Gq/11 (4Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Van Sande J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP regulatory cascade controls growth and differentiated function (thyroid hormone secretion, iodide trapping), whereas Ca2+ and diacylglycerol stimulate iodination and thyroid hormone synthesis (1Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that agonist-dependent activation of GPCRs elicits a crucial conformational change in the receptor molecule resulting in a movement of transmembrane helices relative to one another and subsequent G protein activation (5Sheikh S.P.

The reallocation of transmembrane domains (TMs) is brought about by breaking and formation of interhelical noncovalent bonds between specific amino acid residues (7Groblewski T. Maigret B.

Interestingly, these intermolecular rearrangements can be mimicked by mutations that create constitutively active receptors. Gain-of-function mutations have been identified in many GPCRs (12Van Rhee M.A. Jacobsen K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the TSHR gene, gain-of-function mutations cause autosomal dominant nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism and toxic thyroid nodules (13Duprez L. Parma J. Van Sande J. Allgeier A. Leclère J. Schvartz C.

Within the overall receptor structure, the third intracellular loop (i3) and TM6 appear to be hot spots for gain-of-function mutations in different GPCRs. Several reports suggest that these domains may be particularly important for receptor/G protein interaction (12Van Rhee M.A. Jacobsen K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the adrenergic receptor system, cytoplasmic domains which are in juxtaposition to the plasma membrane, particularly near TMs 5, 6, and 7, have been implicated in G protein coupling (23Dohlman H.G. Thorner J Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and substitution of amino acid clusters with corresponding regions from α1- and β2-adrenergic receptors revealed selective effects of different regions in the i3 loop of the TSHR on inositol phosphate (IP) and cAMP signaling cascades. The N- and C-terminal i3 loop junctions appear to be involved in phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and sequence variation can result in loss- or gain-of-function (24Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D.

Mutations of the conserved A623 in the C-terminal junction of the i3 loop to lysine or glutamic acid was reported to result in loss of TSH-stimulated IP formation leaving cAMP accumulation unaltered (27Kosugi S. Okajima F. Ban T. Hidaka A. Shenker A. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24153-24156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSH-induced cAMP accumulation, however, was affected only by mutations in the C-terminal region of the i3 loop (24Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20970-20975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Rapoport B. Mol.

Characterization of mutant receptors harboring deletions in the i3 loop confirmed the importance of this particular region for receptor/G protein interaction. In the glucagon (28Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), glucagon-like peptide-1 (29Takhar S. Gyomorey S. Su R.-C. Mathi S.K. Li X. Wheeler M.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2175-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (30Shapiro R.A. Palmer D. Cislo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21734-21738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trimmed i3 loops resulted either in severely impaired or unaltered signaling abilities. We recently identified a 9-amino acid deletion (amino acid positions 613–621) within the i3 loop of the TSHR in a toxic thyroid nodule (31Führer D. Holzapfel H.P. Wonerow P. Scherbaum W.A. Paschke R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3885-3891PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to functional properties of all previously described deletion mutants in the corresponding region of other GPCRs, the TSHR deletion mutant displayed constitutive activity. This finding prompted us to further evaluate the role of the TSHR i3 loop for G protein coupling. Thus, we generated various TSHR deletion mutants within the i3 loop varying in length and location and characterized their functional profile. To characterize functional properties of different deletions within the i3 loop of the TSHR (see Fig. 1), mutations were created by employing standard PCR mutagenesis techniques (32Higuchi R. Ehrlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar) using the human TSHR expression plasmid, TSHR-pSVl (33Libert F. Lefort A. Gérard C. Parmentier M. Perret J. Ludgate M. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), as a template. PCR fragments containing the mutations were digested and used to replace the correspondingEco81l/Eco91l fragment in the TSHR-pSVl vector. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived sequences were confirmed by restriction analysis and dideoxy sequencing with thermosequenase and dye-labeled terminator chemistry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. For cAMP and radioligand binding assays, the cells were transfected using a DEAE-dextran method (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 106 COS-7 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes and transfected with different TSHR deletion constructs (5 μg/dish). Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were split into 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Functional assays were performed 48 h after transfection. For the measurement of agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, COS-7 cells were transfected in 12-well plates (3 × 105cells/well) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were used for an IP accumulation assay 48 h after transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed once with Hank's solution without NaCl containing 280 mmol/liter sucrose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 2.5% low fat milk (19Parma J. Van Sande J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were incubated in the same medium in the presence of 140,000–160,000 cpm of 125I-bovine thyrotropin (bTSH) (25 μCi/μg, 40 units/mg, Brahms Diagnostica) and the appropriate concentrations of nonlabeled bTSH (Sigma) at room temperature for 4 h. Cells were subsequently solubilized with 1n NaOH after two washes with Hank's solution. Bound radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. bTSH, TSHR concentrations, and KD values are expressed as milliunits/ml. Data were analyzed assuming a one-site binding model using the fitting module of SigmaPlot 2.0 for Windows (35Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). For cAMP assays cells were washed once in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by a preincubation with the same medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with appropriate concentrations of bTSH for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml 0.1 n HCl. Supernatants were collected and dried. cAMP content of the cell extracts was determined with a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml [myo-3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics containing 10 mm LiCl. TSH-induced increases in intracellular inositol phosphate levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (36Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). A nine-amino acid deletion (Δ613–621) within the i3 loop of the TSHR (Fig. 1) resulted in constitutive activation of the cAMP signaling cascade reflected by a 5-fold increase in basal cAMP levels in conjunction with a markedly blunted maximal cAMP response (approximately 60% of wt receptor level) after stimulation with 100 milliunits/ml of bTSH (see Figs. 3 and 4). Taking this naturally occurring deletion mutant as a point of reference, we generated further mutants (Fig. 1) to clarify the relative importance of distinct amino acids as well as of the extent and the location of the deletion for constitutive TSHR activity. All mutant receptors with deletions of more than one amino acid showed reduced cell surface expression (Table I). This was particularly prominent for the Δ609–621 and Δ609–624 deletion constructs (Table I), indicating that deletions in the i3 loop can severely interfere with correct folding and trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. The TSHR has been described to be constitutively active, and elevated basal cAMP levels can be observed after transient transfection of COS cells (37Cetani F. Tonacchera M. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding by comparing basal cAMP levels determined in COS-7 cells transfected with identical amount of either the human V2 vasopressin or the TSH receptor (see Fig. 3). Several TSHR deletion mutants (Δ609–621, Δ613–624, Δ609–624, and Δ618–624) showed decreased basal cAMP levels most likely due to decreased cell surface expression levels.Figure 4TSH stimulated cAMP accumulation and125I-bTSH displacement binding studies in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type and mutant TSH receptors. cAMP accumulation assays (A) and 125I-bTSH displacement studies (B) have been performed in COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with wt TSHR (▪), Δ613–621 (▴), Δ613–617 (▿), Δ618–621 (⋄), Δ609–617 (•), and Δ618–624 (□), plasmids. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of bTSH, and increases in cAMP levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To estimate KD values, transfected cells were subjected to displacement studies using about 140,000 -160,000 cpm 125I-bTSH per well and increasing concentrations of bTSH. Data are given as percentage of specifically bound 125I-bTSH (less than 10% of total counts) in the absence of unlabeled ligand.

To test for differential functions of these two portions with regard to TSHR activation, we created the mutant receptors Δ618–621 and Δ613–617 with deletions of 4 conserved or 5 nonconserved amino acids, respectively. Both mutant receptors remained constitutively active, although at levels lower than the initial Δ613–621 mutant (Fig.3). Receptor density (Bmax), KD values, and cAMP levels after maximal bTSH stimulation were comparable between Δ618–621 and Δ613–621 (Fig. 4; Table I). When compared with the wt receptor, deletion of the less conserved N-terminal amino acids (Δ613–617) had only minor effects on maximal TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Table I). In accord with the latter findings, the Δ613–617 mutant showed a slightly increased cell surface expression compared with mutants Δ613–621 and Δ618–621 (Table I). To investigate the functional importance of the size of the deletion, we generated three mutant receptors with expanded deletions. Only mutant Δ613–624, the smallest deletion within this series of mutants, displayed expression levels of a similar order of magnitude as the initial mutant Δ613–621 (Table I). TSH responsiveness in terms of cAMP accumulation, however, of this C-terminally extended mutant was markedly blunted (Fig. 3). On the contrary, mutant Δ609–621 located in the central and N-terminal portion of the i3 loop, responded to TSH challenge with an increase in cAMP levels comparable to Δ613–624 despite a profoundly diminished receptor density (Fig. 3, Table I). Further extension of the deletion (Δ609–624) led to an accompanying decrease in cell surface expression and hormonal responsiveness. Having shown that the length of the deletion was a crucial parameter defining functional consequences, we addressed the issue as to whether the location of the deletion within the i3 loop would also be of importance. To this end, we created two mutant receptors lacking 7 and 9 amino acids, respectively, in regions adjacent to the initial Δ613–621 deletion. Mutant Δ618–624 in which the deletion is shifted toward the C terminus of the i3 loop was characterized by a receptor density (TableI, Fig. 4) and a maximal cAMP response comparable to mutant Δ613–621, yet did not display constitutive activity (Figs. 3 and 4). Like deletion mutant Δ613–624, Δ618–624 was also devoid of the critical amino acids 622–624 in the conserved C-terminal part of the i3 loop. On the contrary, deletion mutant Δ609–617 located in the central and N-terminal portion of the i3 loop was effectively inserted into the plasma membrane and displayed prominent constitutive activity (Table I, Fig. 4). Maximal hormone-stimulated cAMP formation reached levels similar to the activated wt TSHR (Figs. 3 and 4). To study the effects of single amino acid deletions within the i3 loop on TSHR function, we deleted individual amino acids in the conserved and nonconserved portions of Δ613–621. When expressed in COS-7 cells, mutants Δ615 and Δ616 located within the less conserved portion of the i3 loop did not differ from the wt receptor in terms of receptor density, KD values, basal and TSH-stimulated cAMP levels (Table I, Fig. 3). A deletion of Lys618 situated in the C-terminal highly conserved portion of Δ613–621 did not have significant impact on the functional properties of the receptor (TableI, Fig. 3). The small decrease of KD values was most probably a consequence of a reduced receptor density (Table I). Deletion of Asp619 resulted in profound constitutive activity of the mutant receptor. This result was unexpected because a mutant TSHR characterized by a deletion of Asp619 in conjunction with a T620S substitution has previously been reported to be functionally indistinguishable from the wt receptor (38Takeshita A. Nagayama Y. Yokoyama N. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Yamashita T. Obara T. Murakami Y. Kuma K. Takamatsu J. Ohsawa N. Nagataki S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 80: 2607-2611Google Scholar). In addition to the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system the activated human TSHR is also known to stimulate phospholipase C activity (39Van Sande J. Raspé E. Perret J. Lejeune C. Maenhaut C. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 74: R1-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To address the question whether the various deletion mutations would affect the IP signaling pathway, we tested all receptor mutants for basal and hormone-induced IP production. None of the TSHR mutants constitutively stimulated the IP signaling pathway (data not shown). As shown in Table I, bTSH-induced IP accumulation closely correlated with the relative maximal increase in cAMP levels. Deletion mutations (Δ609–621, Δ613–624, and Δ609–624) that were characterized by low plasma membrane expression levels were unable to signal to phospholipase C. A 9-amino acid deletion within the i3 loop of the TSHR (Δ613–621) leading to constitutive receptor activity prompted us to systematically analyze the effect of deletion mutations within the i3 loop on TSHR function. Our major finding is that various deletions in the i3 loop result in ligand-independent receptor activation as long as certain critical C-terminal amino acids are not affected. We show that maximal constitutive activity correlates with an optimal length of the deleted receptor portion. In contrast to previous assumptions, these data entertain the notion that several clusters of amino acid in the TSHR's i3 loop are not required for G-protein activation. However, the i3 loop is an important structural determinant to safeguard receptor folding, trafficking and activation by agonist. First we asked the question whether the absence of distinct critical amino acids within the original deletion would be responsible for constitutive activity. Sequence comparison revealed that the four C-terminal amino acids within Δ613–621 are highly conserved within the family of glycoprotein hormone receptors (Fig. 2). Therefore, we constructed two smaller deletions comprising either conserved C-terminal or non-conserved N-terminal amino acids (Δ618–621 and Δ613–617, respectively). Both mutant receptors retained constitutive activity, albeit at reduced levels compared with Δ613–621. The observation that two separate portions of the original deletion each caused constitutive activity, let us put forward the proposal that a deletion per se was responsible for ligand-independent receptor activation. A reduction in the size of the deletion led to a decreased constitutive receptor activity irrespective of the exact position of the amino acids deleted. Alternatively, we examined the functional consequences of N- and C-terminal extensions of the original deletion Δ613–621. Expanded deletions led to a marked decrease in cell surface expression of the mutated receptors. These results indicate that the length of the loop connecting TM5 and TM6 cannot be reduced below a critical size, which would interfere with correct insertion of the receptor into the cell membrane. It is worth mentioning, however, that even large deletions did not completely abrogate hormone-stimulable cAMP formation and cell surface expression. Interestingly, mutants Δ609–621 and Δ613–624 showed a similar cAMP response, although the Δ613–624 construct was expressed at 5–6-fold higher levels indicating that the Δ613–624 deletion targeted amino acids critically required for productive Gs coupling. Indeed, amino acids 621–625 form a conserved B-X-X-B-B motif with B denoting basic and X nonbasic amino acids (Figs.1 and 2). All glycoprotein hormone receptors share this amino acid cluster at corresponding positions within the i3 loop (40Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The substitution of Ala623 within this amino acid cluster with different amino acids leads to constitutive activation of the cAMP cascade (41Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) or to a selective loss of IP signaling (27Kosugi S. Okajima F. Ban T. Hidaka A. Shenker A. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24153-24156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the TSHR further supporting the involvement of this region in G protein activation. Moreover, similar motifs were identified as structural determinants for Gi and Gs coupling in other heptahelical receptors (30Shapiro R.A. Palmer D. Cislo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21734-21738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Okamato T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the importance of the location of deletions within the i3 loop for TSHR function, the original deletion was shifted N- and C-terminally by three amino acids. The N-terminally shifted deletion mutant (Δ609–617) showed strong constitutive activity and a maximal stimulation comparable to the wt receptor. A deletion within the i3 loop of the glucagon receptor comparable in length and location to Δ609–617, resulted in an attenuated glucagon-induced cAMP response (28Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This N-terminal deletion mutant showed a very low cell surface expression and consequently, low agonist-induced cAMP accumulation. These results are at odds with our results obtained with deletion mutant Δ609–617 of the TSHR. However, receptor regions involved in G protein coupling vary in location and sequence between different GPCRs (3Gudermann T. Nürnberg B. Schultz G. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and therefore, similar structural modifications at corresponding locations do not necessarily have to yield identical functional effects in different GPCRs. In contrast to the latter results, a C-terminally shifted deletion mutant (Δ618–624) showed no constitutive activity. Basal values for cAMP accumulation were lower than for wt TSHR, and the maximal response was strongly attenuated. Interestingly, this effect is in good agreement with the functional properties of a comparable deletion mutant generated in the glucagon receptor (28Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case of the TSHR, the decreased cAMP response was not caused by a decrease in cell surface expression because expression levels were comparable to the original deletion Δ613–621 and also to the shorter deletion mutants Δ613–617 and Δ618–621 which all displayed constitutive activity. A conspicuous difference between these four deletion mutants is the destruction of the B-X-X-B-B motif in Δ618–624 indicating the necessity of this amino acid cluster for effective Gscoupling. It should not go unnoticed, however, that although the destruction of the conserved motif attenuated constitutive activity, the ability of the receptor to couple to Gs was not utterly precluded as shown by reproducible increases in intracellular cAMP levels after TSH stimulation. As point mutations within the original deletion Δ613–621 have been reported (18Van Sande J. Parma J. Tonacchera M. Swillens S. Dumont J. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) to result in constitutive activity, we analyzed the influence of distinct single amino acid deletions within the i3 loop on TSHR function. For this purpose, we generated four mutant receptors with deletion of Pro615, Gly616, Lys618, and Asp619, respectively. Only the Δ619 mutant showed constitutive activity. A D619G substitution also leads to constitutive activity of the TSHR (18Van Sande J. Parma J. Tonacchera M. Swillens S. Dumont J. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating an important role of this amino acid for receptor activation. Decreasing the length of the i3 loop by one amino acid does not by itself lead to constitutive activity as exemplified by the deletion mutants Pro615, Gly616, and Lys618. Therefore, deletions of critical amino acids may have an effect similar to activating substitutions of these residues in that critical interhelical, intrahelical, or intraloop bonds are disrupted, thereby releasing a structural constraint in the receptor and exposing critical activating receptor domains for interaction with G proteins. Interestingly, the deletion of Asp619 in conjunction with a T620S substitution has been reported not to lead to constitutive activity (38Takeshita A. Nagayama Y. Yokoyama N. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Yamashita T. Obara T. Murakami Y. Kuma K. Takamatsu J. Ohsawa N. Nagataki S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 80: 2607-2611Google Scholar). GPCRs are assumed to exist in equilibrium between inactive and active states, and only the active state effectively interacts with G proteins. At the structural level, the molecular events accompanying the functional transition from inactive to active states are largely unknown. Recent studies with spin-labeled rhodopsin (6Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) or rhodopsin molecules carrying engineered metal-ion-binding sites (5Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) emphasized the importance of rigid body movements of helices relative to one another during the activation process. Furthermore, a model of the LHR suggested possible structural and functional effects of constitutively activating mutations (43Lin Z. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A tightly packed hydrophobic cluster between the intracellular halves of TM5 and TM6 is postulated to be essential for receptor quiescence. According to the model, activating mutations would then disrupt the hydrophobic packing and disturb the relative positioning of TM5 and TM6 in the plasma membrane (43Lin Z. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our results with various deletion mutants of the TSHR are fully compatible with such models and may provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of GPCR activation. Based on our results we propose a novel model of TSHR activation. We show that shortening of the TSHR's i3 loop rather than deletion of distinct amino acids is responsible for constitutive activity. This assumption is based on the fact that several deletion mutations which do not overlap in the deleted sequence display constitutive activity. Therefore, it is very likely that a similar mechanism accounts for shifting the receptor into the active conformation. Additionally, the extent of constitutive activity appears to be dependent on the length of the deletion. It can not be excluded, however, that a loss of one or more distinct amino acids within a TSHR deletion mutant is responsible for constitutive activation. The i3 loop has previously been thought to directly mediate receptor/G protein interaction. Surprisingly, none of the deletion mutants examined showed a complete abolishment of Gs coupling. It is likely that a decrease in the length of the i3 loop will affect the conformation of the adjacent transmembrane domains. The N-terminal part of TM6 appears to be most important for LHR activation. There is evidence that a peptide consisting of the wt sequence of the lower portion of TM6 of the LHR can activate adenylyl cyclase (44Abell A.N. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14586-14591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Within this receptor region there is more than 90% amino acid identity among glycoprotein hormone receptors. Thus, the N-terminal portion of TM6 is capable of activating Gs, if freed from all conformational constraints imposed by neighboring receptor sequences. Agonist binding (Fig. 5 A), activating point mutations, and a shortening of the i3 loop (Fig. 5 C) may all lead to a relative movement of TM5 to TM6, most likely allowing a relative movement of TM6 toward the cytoplasm, thus enabling critical transmembrane sequences to interact with Gs. A similar hypothesis has been derived from alanine-insertion studies (Fig.5 B) with the m2 muscarinic receptor (45Liu J. Blin N. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6172-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TSHR activation proposed in Fig. 5 is, however, limited to the mutations made and tested in this study. Since at present no data are available whether insertion mutations within TM6 of a glycoprotein hormone receptor may display constitutive activity as observed with the m2 muscarinic receptor a direct comparison of receptor activation between these two GPCRs remains speculative. In conclusion, we performed a thorough analysis of a naturally occurring mutant of the human TSHR and developed a novel model describing TSHR activation at the molecular level. Additional studies with the TSHR will have to show whether this model is correct and whether it can be extended to all glycoprotein hormone receptors or even to other GPCRs more distantly related. We express our gratitude to Brahms Diagnostica (Berlin) for providing 125I-bTSH and to Dr. G. Vassart for supplying the plasmid TSHR-pSVl."

This cell line was 10-fold resistant to MTX in comparison to parental L1210 cells, yet the EC50 for 5-CHO-THF was increased by a factor of only 2. The initial uptake of MTX, at a concentration of 1 μm, was decreased by a factor of 40, whereas influx of 5-CHO-THF dropped by a factor of only 8. This difference in initial uptake rates was attributed solely to changes in influx Vmax without a significant change in Km. Whereas the RFC1 mRNA level in L1210-G1a cells was indistinguishable from that of parental L1210 cells, a serine to asparagine substitution was identified at amino acid 46 within the first predicted transmembrane domain. This was a result of a homozygous mutation of G→A in the genome. Transfection of the mutated RFC1 cDNA into MTXrA cells, which lack functional endogenous carrier, resulted in a clonal derivative MTXrA-S46N. The increase in influx of 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF was 5 and 13 times greater than that for MTX in the transfectant, consistent with the influx ratio in the L1210-G1a line. The functional expression of the mutated RFC1 reduced the growth requirement for 5-CHO-THF by a factor of 30, compared with only a 3-fold decrease in the MTX IC50. This represents the first reported RFC1 mutation that confers resistance to MTX due to a markedly impaired influx with relative conservation of reduced folate transport. The kinetic changes are consistent with a substrate-dependent alteration in carrier mobility that favors reduced folates over MTX. These changes may account for the development of MTX resistance due to impaired drug transport in vivo, allowing tumor cells to meet their folate requirement with 5-CH3THF, the predominant blood folate.

Folate cofactors are required for the de novo synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and some amino acids.

Methotrexate (MTX) continues to play an important role in the treatment of a variety of human malignancies (11Jolivet J. Cowan K.H. Curt G.A. Clendenninn N.J. Chabner B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). However, its efficacy has been limited by the frequent emergence of drug resistance (12Gorlick R. Goker E. Trippett T. Waltham M. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. N. Engl. J.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transport-related resistance has been associated with decreased expression of RFC1, decreased carrier function, and/or decreased affinity of the carrier for the drug (16Gorlick R. Goker E. Trippett T. Steinherz P. Elisseyeff Y. Mazumdar M. Flintoff W.F. Bertino J.R. Blood. 1997; 89: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cells acquire resistance to MTX under usual growth conditions in the laboratory, the requirement for folates is met through the uptake of folic acid, the folate species in most media. Transport of folic acid is mediated largely by a process that is distinct from RFC1 (17Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); hence, the loss of carrier function has only a small effect on folic acid growth requirement (7Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P.

This report represents the first such analysis based upon the chemical mutagenesis of L1210 murine leukemia cells followed by growth under MTX selective pressure with 5-CHO-THF as the sole folate source. The data shed some insight into mutational events that result in marked transport-related resistance to MTX while preserving sufficient transport activity for reduced folates to permit normal growth. [3′,5′,7-3H]-(6S)-5-CHO-THF and [3′,5′,7-3H]-(6S)-5-CH3THF were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), and [3′,5′,7-3H] MTX was obtained from Amersham Corp. Folates were purified by high performance liquid chromatography prior to use (26Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimetrexate was a gift from Dr. D. Fry (Warner-Lambert and Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). All other reagents were obtained in the highest purity available from various commercial sources. L1210 leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μmfolic acid supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 2 mm glutamine, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For assay of folate growth requirement, cells were grown for 1–2 weeks in folate-free RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed bovine calf serum, 200 μm glycine, 100 μm adenosine, and 10 μm thymidine (GAT). For analyses of growth requirement, cells were grown in 96-well plates (1 × 105 cells/ml) and then exposed continuously to the appropriate concentrations of MTX, folic acid, or 5-CHO-THF for 72 h, following which, cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count, and viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. G418 was omitted from medium in growth studies with transfectants (see below). Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels. Transfer and hybridization were performed as described previously (27Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transcripts were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis of the hybridization signals and normalized to β-actin. Influx measurements were performed by methods described previously (27Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with HBS, and resuspended in HBS to a density of 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min, following which, uptake was initiated by the addition of radiolabeled folate, and samples were taken at the indicated times. Uptake was terminated by injection of 1 ml of the cell suspension into 10 ml of ice-cold HBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold HBS, and processed for measurement of intracellular radioactivity (27Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For influx determinations, uptake intervals were adjusted so that cell MTX did not exceed the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity, ensuring that unidirectional uptake conditions were sustained. For other folates studied, initial rates were established over an interval in which cell folate uptake was linear as a function of time with an extrapolated ordinate intercept at time 0 near the point of origin. Prior to transport studies with transfectants (see below), cells were expanded for no longer than 3 doublings without G418 to ensure that the expression of the mutated RFC1 was maintained. L1210 cells were maintained in GAT-containing medium for 1 week to deplete endogenous folate pools prior to treatment with 1.6 mm of ethylmethanesulfonate for 12 h, a concentration that produced 10% cell survival. After cells were washed to remove the mutagen, they were grown in GAT medium for an additional 2 days; transferred to folate-free medium supplemented with dialyzed calf serum, 25 nm 5-CHO-THF, and 100 nm MTX; and plated on 24-well clusters. This concentration of MTX is 10 times greater than the IC50 under these conditions and completely suppresses growth of parental L1210 cells. The surviving cells were maintained in this selective medium for another 3 weeks, after which they were plated in complete RPMI medium containing 0.5% soft agar. After an additional 2 weeks, individual clones were picked up and expanded, and MTX influx, 5-CHO-THF growth requirement, and dihydrofolate reductase level were evaluated. One clone, L1210-G1a, exhibiting both markedly impaired MTX transport and the lowest 5-CHO-THF growth requirement, was selected for further study. The L1210-G1a cell line has been maintained in drug-free complete RPMI 1640 medium and displayed a stable phenotype for more than 9 months. Poly(A)+mRNA was purified from 4 × 106 cells using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Dynal) and dissolved in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The first strand synthesis was carried out with a Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 10 μl of poly (A)+ RNA. The protein coding sequence was isolated from the products of the first strand synthesis by amplification utilizing oligonucletide primers that flanked the coding region of RFC1 (5′ primer at nucleotide −46 from the translation start codon 5′-GCGGATCCTGGAGTGTCATCTTGG-3′ and 3′ primer at nucleotide +82 from stop codon 5′GCCTCGAGCTGGTTCAGGTGGAGT-3′). Two 8-bp linkers were introduced into the primers so that BamHI and a XhoI restriction sites were created in the PCR products to facilitate directional subcloning. Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) was employed to ensure accuracy of the amplified PCR fragment. The amplifications were performed for 35 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 65 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The 1682-bp-long predicted PCR product was purified from agarose gel (Qiagen) and cloned into a pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of cloned cDNAs were determined on automated sequencer models ABI 373A and ABI 373 from Perkin-Elmer Corp. in the sequencing facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center. RFC1-S46N cDNA with a serine to asparagine substitution at amino acid 46 was excised from the pCR-blunt vector (see above) by a double restriction with BamHI and XhoI and recloned into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) with the same restriction sites. MTXrA cells (1 × 107 cells), which lack functional endogenous RFC1 (37Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were electroporated (250 V, 200 microfarads) with 50 μg of nonlinearized pCDNA3.1(+) harboring the mutated cDNA from RFC1-S46N in a final volume of 800 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were then diluted in 20 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, allowed to recover for 48 h, adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing G418 (750 μg/ml of active drug), and then distributed into 96-well plates at approximately 4 × 104 cells/well. G418-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution and then expanded for further studies. One of the clones, MTXrA-S46N, which exhibited the highest level of RFC1 mRNA, was chosen for detailed studies. An RFC1-specific 221-bp fragment was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers that flanked the mutation identified in L1210-G1a cells: 5′-85TCATCTTGGCCCGCCAGTTC104-3′ and 5′-306CTGCTCCTTGGTGAATTTAC287-3′ (based on GenBank accession no. U32469). Genomic DNA was isolated with the Easy-DNA™ kit (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg was used for amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase. Following an initial melt for 2 min at 95 °C, amplification was carried out for 35 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s for 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and subjected to restriction analysis with HindIII without further purification. The stable, MTX-resistant L1210-G1a line was isolated from L1210 cells after chemical mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate and subsequent selection in 100 nm of MTX with 5-CHO-THF as the sole folate source. As indicated in Fig.1 A, L1210-G1a cells were 10-fold resistant to MTX in the presence of 25 nm5-CHO-THF, the concentration used in the selection medium. The IC50 for MTX was further decreased slightly in both lines (parental > mutant) when 2.3 μm folic acid was the folate source, resulting in a net increase in the difference in drug sensitivities between L1210 and L1210-G1a cells (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, sensitivity to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate in either folic acid or 5-CHO-THF was increased by a factor of 4 in L1210-G1a cells, ruling out a change at the level of dihydrofolate reductase (not shown). Finally, the 5-CHO-THF EC50 was increased by a factor of only 2 in L1210-G1a cells (Fig.1 C). Hence, a cell line was developed in which sensitivity to MTX decreased by an order of magnitude, whereas the growth requirement for the 5-CHO-THF substrate was minimally increased. MTX resistance could not be attributed to down-regulation of transcription of RFC1. Indeed, RFC1 mRNA levels in L1210-G1a and L1210 cells were comparable as shown in Fig. 2(lanes labeled MTXr A-S46N and MTXr A will be discussed below). There were, however, important differences in influx of MTX and 5-CHO-THF in these cell lines, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Influx of 5-CHO-THF was only ∼25% greater than that of MTX in parental L1210 cells. In contrast, MTX influx was markedly decreased in L1210-G1a cells, with barely measurable residual transport activity. Influx of 5-CHO-THF was also markedly decreased in L1210-G1a cells, but residual transport was 12% that of L1210 cells. Hence, the decrease in transport of MTX was far greater than that for 5-CHO-THF in the L1210-G1a line.Figure 3Initial uptake rates for MTX and 5-CHO-THF in L1210 and L1210-G1a cells. Following a 25-min incubation in HBS at 37 °C, L1210 (triangles) and L1210-G1a (squares) cells were exposed to 1 μm of 5-CHO-THF (closed symbols) or MTX (open symbols) at time 0, and the time course of uptake monitored over 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize the mechanism that underlies the differences in 5-CHO-THF and MTX transport activities in L1210-G1a cells, influx kinetic parameters for these folates, together with 5-CH3THF, the physiological reduced folate, were determined in L1210 and L1210-G1a cells. As shown in Fig. 4, influx of all these folates follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The kinetic parameters as derived from nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation and those obtained from the double reciprocal plots are almost identical. As indicated in Table I, the influx Kt for MTX and 5-CHO-THF is the same in L1210 cells, whereas the Kt for 5-CH3THF influx is about 2–3-fold lower. These values are essentially unchanged in L1210-G1a cells. In contrast, whereas the influxVmax is the same for all folates in L1210 cells, there are substantial differences in the extent to which the influxVmax decreased in L1210 G1a cells. The influxVmax in L1210-G1a cells decreased by a factor of 44 for MTX but declined by a factor of only 8 and 6.6 for 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF, respectively, relative to L1210 cells. Hence, differences in the rates of translocation of reduced folates and MTX, rather than carrier affinity for folate substrates, appeared to be the basis for the preferential transport of reduced folates observed in the L1210-G1a line.Table IKinetic parameters for the influx of MTX, 5-CHO-THF, and 5-CH3THF in L1210 and L1210-G1a cellsL1210L1210-G1aL1210/L1210-G1aMTXVmax11.5 ± 0.70.26 ± 0.0244Kt6.9 ± 0.45.4 ± 0.91.35-CHO-THFVmax13.5 ± 0.331.68 ± 0.158.0Kt5.07 ± 0.117.20 ± 0.780.705-CH3THFVmax10.2 ± 0.611.54 ± 0.076.6Kt1.97 ± 0.112.68 ± 0.080.73 Open table in a new tab Because the level of RFC1 transcript was unchanged in the L1210-G1a line, studies were undertaken to determine whether a mutation in RFC1 was the basis for the transport differences observed. Utilizing primers based on the published murine RFC1 sequence, cDNAs encompassing the entire coding region of RFC1 were isolated from L1210-G1a cells by reverse transcription-PCR and then cloned and fully sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the RFC1 open reading frame in both parental and L1210-G1a lines was identical except for a single G→A mutation at nucleotide position 260 (based on GenBank accession no. U32469). This change resulted in the substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid residue 46. Fortuitously, this single purine nucleotide change eliminates a single HindIII restriction site in the RFC1 coding region, thus allowing for the determination of whether all mRNAs in L1210-G1a cells harbored the same mutation. As shown in Fig. 5A, the reverse transcription-PCR products derived from L1210-G1a cells were not cut by HindIII, in contrast to those derived from the parental cells, demonstrating that this mutation was present in all cDNAs isolated from the L1210-G1a line. To access whether the single G→A nucleotide change occurred in both RFC1 alleles, a 222-bp genomic fragment from RFC1 was amplified by PCR and subjected to restriction analysis. As illustrated in Fig.5 B, HindIII failed to cut the genomic PCR fragment derived from this line, thus establishing that this mutation is homozygous in the genome. The cDNA of the mutated carrier, designated RFC1-S46N, was electroporated into MTXrA cells, and a clonal derivative, MTXrA-S46N was established to characterize the properties of this carrier variant. The transcript generated by the pcDNA3.1 expression vector was diagnostically shorter than that encoding endogenous RFC1 in L1210 and MTXrA cells (Fig. 2), with a level 50% higher than that of RFC1 in L1210 cells based on two separate Northern blot analyses. The initial uptake rates of MTX, 5-CHO-THF, and 5-CH3THF in MTXrA-S46N were all increased as compared with the MTXrA line from which it was derived (Fig. 6). However, the magnitude of the increase in influx was quite different among these folates, as quantitated in Table II. Influx was augmented by a factor of 4 and 10 for 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF relative to MTX in MTXrA-S46N cells (TableII, line 4), respectively. The impact of expression of RFC1-S46N was better seen when background transport in the MTXrA cells, (Table II, line 3), was subtracted from that of the MTXrA-S46N transfectant line (line 4). This yielded net increases in 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF influx that were 5 and 13 times higher, respectively, than that of MTX (Table II, line 5). These values are all consistent with the differences observed in L1210-G1a cells (Table II, line 2). Influx kinetic parameters for 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF in MTXrA-S46N cells were assessed to determine whether the mutated carrier expressed in the transfectant possessed the same characteristics as in L1210-G1a line. the Kt values for 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF influx were 5.5 and 2.4 μm, respectively, virtually identical to the those in L1210 and L1210-G1a cells.Table IIComparison of initial uptake rates of MTX, 5-CHO-THF, and 5-CH3THF in the cell lines studiedCell lineInitial uptake rateFold, ΔMTX5-CHO-THF5-CH3THF5-CHO-THF/MTX5-CH3THF/MTXnmol/g dry weight/min1L12101.49 ± 0.061.88 ± 0.043.35 ± 0.011.32.22L1210-G1a0.039 ± 0.0010.20 ± 0.010.38 ± 0.045.1103MTXrA0.015 ± 0.0010.024 ± 0.0020.048 ± 0.0051.63.24MTXrA-S46N0.045 ± 0.0050.18 ± 0.010.44 ± 0.034105MTXrA-S46N-MTXrA0.0300.160.395.313 Open table in a new tab The small increase in MTX influx in MTXrA-S46N cells (Table II) resulted in only a small increase in sensitivity of these cells to the drug, as illustrated in Fig. 7 A. The IC50for MTX in MTXrA-S46N still remained about 20 times greater than that of L1210 cells. In contrast, a 7-fold increase in 5-CHO-THF influx in MTXrA-S46N relative to MTXrA cells (Table II) resulted in a 30-fold decrease in the 5-CHO-THF growth requirement (Fig. 7 B), close to the EC50 of L1210 cells, although influx was still 18 that of the latter line. In prior studies, MTX transport-deficient cell lines have been characterized that were selected in vitro with folic acid as the sole folate source (7Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P.

A. 1987; 84: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these cell lines, transport of the reduced folates, 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF, was decreased as well, and the growth requirement for 5-CHO-THF was substantially increased (7Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 18Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol.

Because the physiological folate cofactor in the circulation of humans and rodents is 5-CH3THF, these MTX resistant cells would not be expected to survive in vivo. Consistent with this is the observation that a MTX-resistant L1210 variant derived in vitro in the presence of folic acid, with a substantial increase in the EC50 for 5-CHO-THF, grew upon implantation in mice only if folic acid was co-administered to augment the levels of its reduced folate derivatives (19Sirotnak F.M. Goutas L.J. Mines L.S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4732-4734PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism of MTX resistance in these cells is unlikely to be relevant to the in vivosetting in which tumor cell survival requires the transport and utilization of 5-CH3THF. Folic acid is a viable folate source when RFC1 function is lost in L1210 cells because this agent is transported to a large extent by another mechanism (17Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Folic acid is, however, a trivial component of folates found in blood and tissues and hence cannot meet one-carbon requirements in humans when RFC1 is not functional. How then do tumor cells survive when resistance to MTX due to loss of transport develops in patients treated with related antifolates? To address this question, MTX resistance was developed, in vitro, under conditions in which the available folate source was the reduced cofactor 5-CHO-THF, an excellent substrate for RFC1. Although 5-CH3THF, the physiological reduced folate, is an even better substrate for the carrier, its poor stability renders it an unreliable folate source in cell culture. A chemical mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate was employed to enhance the mutation rate, and a single step selection protocol was chosen to minimize the possibility of dihydrofolate reductase amplification (13Sirotnak F.M. Moccio D.M. Kelleher L.E. Goutas L.J. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4447-4452PubMed Google Scholar). This design is not unlike the clinical situation in which MTX is often administrated in regimens that include DNA-damaging agents. Using this strategy, a cell line, L1210-G1a, was isolated that displayed a 10-fold resistance to MTX but only a 2-fold increase in the growth requirement for 5-CHO-THF. The relatively small change in 5-CHO-THF growth requirement was based, in part, upon the observation that influx of MTX in L1210-G1a cells was decreased by factor of more than 40, yet influx of 5-CHO-THF was decreased by a factor of only 8. Hence, there was preferential conservation of transport of the tetrahydrofolate cofactor, a phenomenon shown to be relevant for 5-CH3THF as well. Beyond this, the increase in 5-CHO-THF growth requirement was only ¼ the decline in influx. This is probably attributable to the lack of proportionality between the decline in influx and steady-state folate levels mediated by RFC1, as characterized for MTX. In prior studies from this laboratory, changes in RFC1 activity in L1210 cells primarily influence the bidirectional fluxes with much smaller changes in the steady-state levels achieved (27Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the observation that although MTX influx in L1210-G1a cells decreased by a factor of more than 40, the IC50 for MTX decreased by a factor of only 10. Because it is free folate that is the substrate for polyglutamylation and subsequent one-carbon transfer reactions within the cell (influx is not rate-limiting), it is this parameter that will determine the folate growth requirement. Finally, because the EC50 for 5-CHO-THF increased from ∼2.5 to 5.0 nm but the concentration of this folate in the medium was 25 nm, the loss of RFC1 activity would have little functional impact on folate metabolism. This is not surprising because to meet the need for folates during cell growth, sufficient transport is necessary to increase folate pools by a factor of only 2 over the doubling time of the cells. Because reduced folates are retained within the intracellular compartment as polyglutamyl derivatives, their levels are apparently sustained even at a slow rate of uptake. Of considerable interest is the functional basis for the different loss of transport activities among the folate compounds in the L1210-G1a line. These differences were not due to an alteration in the substrate binding pocket within RFC1 that influences affinity for the folates because wild type influx Kt values were preserved. Rather, the fall in influx was attributed almost entirely to a decline in Vmax. Within the context of the usual carrier paradigm, the influx Vmax is determined by the total number of carriers and the rate-limiting step in the carrier cycle (34Stein W.D. Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 127Crossref Google Scholar). For transport of folates in L1210 cells, the rate-limiting step in influx is the translocation of the unloaded carrier from the intracellular to extracellular membrane interfaces, a process that is accelerated when cells are loaded with carrier substrate (35Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 624-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carrier mobility has not been thought to be influenced by the substrate transported, and in fact, the influx Vmax for all the folates was the same in L1210 cells. The data suggest that this is not the case with the L1210-G1a mutant. Here, the influxVmax is determined by the transport substrate, suggesting that in this cell line, entry of the loaded carrier into the cell is rate-limiting and that the velocity of this step in the entry process varies with the different folate species. The basis for this difference in Vmax is not clear but it may be that the 4-amino group in the MTX pteridine ring results in an allosteric change in the mutated carrier upon substrate binding that restricts its mobility in comparison to the rate of translocation of the 5-CHO-THF- and 5-CH3THF-carrier complex. The molecular basis for the changes in carrier cycling observed in the L1210-G1a line was a single mutation in RFC1 that resulted in a serine to asparagine substitution at amino acid 46. There have been no reports as yet in patients of RFC1 mutations in tumor cells with impaired MTX transport. However, in one study, RFC1 mRNA levels were normal or slightly decreased in human leukemic lymphoblasts, making it likely that there were mutations in RFC1 and that reduced folate transport must have been relatively preserved (16Gorlick R. Goker E. Trippett T. Steinherz P. Elisseyeff Y. Mazumdar M. Flintoff W.F. Bertino J.R. Blood. 1997; 89: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have been four documented mutations in RFC1 identified in tumor cells developed under MTX selective pressure in vitro that result in altered transport of folates. Introduction of premature stop codons in RFC1 cDNAs in MOLT3/MTX10,000 produced a truncated protein with a decreased influx Vmax without a change in Kt (36Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Moscow J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a change that would not result in a selective loss of function. An alanine to proline substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain of the murine RFC1 with resultant induction of a rigid kink within the α-helical peptide backbone led to a decrease in the MTX influx Vmax of 2 orders of magnitude without a change in the extent or affinity of specific binding to carrier at the cell surface (37Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A serine to asparagine mutation at amino acid 127 associated with a low frequency truncation of RFC1 in the second allele was associated with a decrease in folate binding affinities in CCRF-CEM cells (38Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar). In a preliminary report, two mutations in the murine RFC1, one of which is at amino acid 48, were each shown to increase carrier affinity for folic acid, thereby augmenting folate accumulation and rendering cells resistant to the glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase inhibitor DDATHF (39Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar). The RFC1 mutations identified in the L1210-G1a cells occurred just two amino acids away in the first putative transmembrane domain, which is conserved in all mammalian species studied (20Dixon K.H.

The lack of change in the affinity of the mutated carrier for reduced folates and MTX suggested that this amino acid residue is not involved in the binding of substrates. Replacement of the serine with other amino acids or substitutions at adjacent sites will further define the importance of this residue and region in carrier cycling and substrate binding. Biochemical and biophysical analysis of mutated membrane transporters has been the primary approach to understanding the structure-function relationships for many carriers because crystallization of membrane proteins is extremely difficult. Hence, characterization of the bacterial lactose permease (40Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5539-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and human glucose transporters (GLUT) (41Saravolac E.G. Holman G.D. Gould G.W. Facilitative Glucose Transporters. 1997: 39-66Google Scholar), among others, have been based upon this approach. Extensive site-directed mutation analyses have revealed that amino acid residues critical for glucose transport activity are rare. For instance, sequential replacement of every residue with alanine within the conserved helix of transmembrane VIII in GLUT3 produced only one mutant with a small increase in influx Km (42Seatter M.J. Kane S. Porter L.M. Arbuckle M.I. Melvin D.R. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Substitution of all six cysteines with serine in GLUT1 resulted in a mutated carrier that retained all kinetic features of the wild type allele, thus excluding involvement of these residues in GLUT1 function or oligomer formation (43Due A.D. Cook J.A. Fletcher S.J. Qu Z.C. Powers A.C. May J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The serine to asparagine substitution in RFC1 was found to affect both alleles. This is in contrast to other mutations in which the wild type RFC1 allele was present but not transcribed (37Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or the normal RFC1 allele was present and transcribed along with the mutant alleles (36Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Moscow J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two different transcripts were also recently identified in CEM/MTX(38). It is possible that only one allele was present in the L1210 cells at the time that it was mutated or that the second allele might have been lost during the selection of L1210-G1a cells. The homozygosity of RFC1 must be an important factor contributing to the stability of the phenotype of this cell line."

Quantitative measurements of α and βγ subunit binding have been difficult due to a very high affinity. We used fluorescence flow cytometry to quantitate binding of fluorescein-labeled Gi1α (F-α) to picomolar concentrations of biotinylated Gβγ. Association in Lubrol solution was rapid (kon = 0.7 × 106m−1 s−1), and equilibrium binding revealed a Kd of 2.9 ± 0.8 nm. The binding showed a complex dependence on magnesium concentration, but activation of F-α with either GDP/aluminum fluoride or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) completely prevented formation of the heterocomplex (Kd > 100 nm). The binding was also influenced by the detergent or lipid environment. Unlabeled βγ reconstituted in biotinylated phospholipid vesicles (pure phosphatidylcholine or mixed brain lipids) bound F-α ∼2–3-fold less tightly (Kd = 6–9 nm) than in Lubrol. In contrast, βγ in ionic detergents such as cholate and 3-[(cholamidopropyl)diethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate exhibited substantially lower affinities for F-α. Dissociation of F-α from βγ reconstituted in lipid vesicles was observed upon addition of aluminum fluoride or excess unlabeled α subunit, indicating that myristoylated α subunit has only a weak interaction with lipids without the βγ subunit.

Receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins is a common mechanism for transducing biological signals. Cell-surface receptors regulate G proteins by inducing a conformational change that catalyzes release of GDP from the α subunit, allowing GTP to bind and activate the G protein. It is generally accepted that G protein activation in vitro involves α subunit dissociation from βγ subunits and that dissociated α and βγ subunits interact with effector proteins to modulate cellular responses (1Birnbaumer L.

The subunit interactions in a lipid environment are even less well understood.Several areas of uncertainty remain in the mechanism of G protein subunit interactions with themselves and with membranes. The role of lipids and G protein subunit modifications in α/βγ interactions has not been defined quantitatively. The sequence of events in subunit activation and dissociation has recently been called into question (8Mittal R. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, it has been suggested that unphysiologically high magnesium concentrations are required for Gs subunit dissociation (9Basi N.S. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to test in a quantitative manner the binding of the α and βγ subunits in both detergent solution and in a lipid environment to study factors regulating their affinity. One of the major limitations to the study of very high affinity protein/protein interactions is that the concentrations of proteins needed to evaluate affinities are often greater than the Kd for the binding interaction. This leads to artifacts and inaccurateKd determinations. Sklar and co-workers (10Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have used flow cytometry to study high affinity binding of fluorescent ligands to the surface of cells. More recently, Nolan et al.(11Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) used bead-based systems to study protein/DNA interactions in vitro. In this report, we describe the use of biotinylated Gβγ (b-βγ) 1The abbreviations used are: b-βγ, biotinylated Gβγ; F-α, fluorescein-labeled Gi1α; r-myr-αi1, recombinant myristoylated G protein αi1 subunit; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)diethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate. 1The abbreviations used are: b-βγ, biotinylated Gβγ; F-α, fluorescein-labeled Gi1α; r-myr-αi1, recombinant myristoylated G protein αi1 subunit; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)diethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate. bound to avidin-coated polystyrene beads and fluorescein-labeled Gi1α (F-α) to measure equilibrium constants and rates for α and βγ binding in the picomolar range by flow cytometry. In addition, biotinylated lipids permit measurements of the binding of unlabeled βγ with F-α in a lipid environment. Mechanisms of α/βγ interactions and factors that modify those interactions are described. This simple and quantitative approach to the study of protein/protein interactions provides new information about G protein function and has great potential for the study of the assembly of membrane protein complexes in general.RESULTSThe use of flow cytometry for measuring high affinity F-α binding to b-βγ on avidin-coated beads is illustrated in Fig.1 A. Binding of 40 nm fluorescein-labeled Gi1α to 0.5 nm b-βγ (medium solid line) can be readily distinguished from nonspecific binding (thick solid line) in the histograms shown in Fig. 1 B. Because the measured result is the mean of ∼3000–5000 events, the mean channel numbers are very accurate, and replicates generally agreed within 2%. Nonspecific binding was only 15–20% of total binding even at 40 nmF-α. Avidin-coated beads without βγ gave essentially the same binding as βγ-bound beads in the presence of excess α subunit (data not shown). Accurate measurements of binding were routinely made with βγ concentrations as low as 100 pm (see Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), and even 20 pm βγ gave clear binding signals. The binding could be substantially decreased by preincubation of F-α with either GTPγS or AMF (Fig. 1 B).The time course of association and dissociation of 1 nmF-α with 100 pm b-βγ is illustrated in Fig.2. The data were generally fit well by a single exponential association and dissociation, but in some experiments, two kinetic phases of dissociation were evident. the koff was 0.047 ± 0.005 min−1(0.00078 s−1) with a half-time of 14.8 min. The dissociation upon addition of AMF was much faster, being nearly complete by the first time point at 1 min. The apparent on-rate (kon(app)) was measured at several concentrations of F-α, and individual rate constants were determined. A secondary plot of kon(app) versus[F-α] (Fig. 2 A, inset) gave akon of 0.7 × 106m−1 s−1 and akoff of 0.0013 s−1. This yields a kinetic Kd of 1.9 nm.Since magnesium profoundly affects the interaction of α and βγ subunits, we examined the effect of free magnesium on α/βγ binding in Lubrol. As expected, there was greater binding at lower magnesium concentrations (Fig.3 A). There appeared to be a biphasic curve with a plateau at the normal physiological magnesium concentration of 0.1–1 mm. Saturation curves with 0.2 or 9.8 mm free magnesium showed equivalent maximum binding capacities with an ∼2-fold difference in Kd, 2.9 ± 0.8 (n = 7) and 4.4 ± 1.1 (n = 5), respectively (Fig. 3 B). Other experiments with 20 ppm Lubrol or the monodisperse form C12E10 showed no significant difference in affinity from 0.1% Lubrol (data not shown).There have been questions raised recently about whether GTP analogs can fully dissociate subunits in low magnesium solutions (9Basi N.S. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In our system, the binding of F-α was completely eliminated after full occupancy with GTPγS at 0.2 mm free Mg2+(Fig. 4). Initial experiments showed evidence of some residual affinity, but this was due to incomplete occupancy of the α subunit with nucleotide. 2Even with 90% saturation of the α subunit with GTPγS, there was sufficient unoccupied α subunit to give an apparent Kd of 20 nm (versus2 nm for GDP-bound α subunit). Similarly, aluminum fluoride in the presence of 10 mm magnesium resulted in a Kd for α/βγ association of >100 nm.Figure 4Saturation binding with GDP-, GTPγS-, and AMF-liganded F-α. Fluorescein-labeled Gi1α (80 nm) was preincubated for 3 h at 30 °C in HEDNML with 10 μm GDP (▪) or GTPγS (•) or for 30 min at room temperature with AMF (▴). Equilibrium binding to 100 pm b-βγ was then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of three (GDP) or mean ± range of two (GTPγS and AMF) experiments. the solid line is a nonlinear least-squares fit to a hyperbolic binding function with a Kd of 2.9 nm, and the dashed lines are linear least-squares fits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, the affinity of subunits changed significantly with different detergents. Preliminary saturation experiments showedKd values for F-α of 3, 30, and 50 nmfor Lubrol, CHAPS, and cholate, respectively. Due to the lower affinity and higher nonspecific binding, the saturation data with cholate and CHAPS were less reliable. Thus, IC50 values for r-myr-αi1 were measured in competition with F-α (Fig.5 and TableI). As in the direct binding studies, r-myr-αi1 competed ∼10 and 30 times less well in CHAPS and cholate, respectively. Although the ratio of affinities in the three detergents were conserved, IC50 values for competition by r-myr-αi1 were consistently lower thanKd values determined in saturation experiments for F-α binding to βγ. This may reflect slightly weaker βγ binding by the labeled α subunit or a heterogeneity of the βγ pool purified from bovine brain tissue. In the latter case, there could be a higher affinity in competition experiments due to the selective occupancy of high affinity βγ sites by the low labeled ligand concentrations.Figure 5Competition binding of F-α to βγ in different detergents. b-βγ was bound to avidin-coated beads and exchanged by centrifugation in HEDNM containing three different detergents: 0.1% Lubrol (▪), 0.4% cholate (•), or 0.7% CHAPS (▴). Unlabeled r-myr-αi1 (0.2–1000 nm) was premixed with either 1 nm F-α (Lubrol) or 2 nm F-α (cholate or CHAPS). The mixture of α subunits was combined with the indicated beads and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Binding of F-α was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding expressed as mean channel numbers (3.0 in Lubrol, 7.1 in CHAPS, and 4.0 in cholate) was subtracted from the total fluorescence in the absence of competitors (23 in Lubrol, 14 in CHAPS, and 7.5 in cholate), and then data were normalized to maximum specific fluorescence. Data are means of three independent experiments, and solid lines are nonlinear least-square fits to a one-site competition function. Average IC50 values derived from the fits are summarized in TableI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIC50 values for r-myr-αi1 binding to βγ in different environmentsLubrolCholateCHAPSBrain lipidsIC50(nm)0.7 ± 0.321 ± 5.25.3 ± 0.81.3 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab To examine G protein subunit binding affinity in a lipid environment, we prepared bovine brain lipid vesicles containing 1 mol % biotin-labeled lipid with and without unmodified βγ subunit. Incorporation of βγ into the lipid vesicles and vesicle binding to avidin beads were monitored by immunostaining with a β-specific polyclonal antibody. There was very little competable binding of F-α to the beads with biotin-labeled lipids alone, but lipids containing βγ showed substantial specific binding (Fig.6 A). Similarly, when the biotin-labeled lipids were left out of the reconstitution mixture, there was no specific binding of F-α to the beads (provided BSA was included in the incubation and wash buffers). This demonstrates the requirement for biotin-labeled lipids and rules out nonspecific absorption of lipid vesicles to the avidin-coated beads. The affinity for specific F-α binding to βγ in brain lipid vesicles (Kd = 8.6 ± 1.8 nm; Fig.6 B) was slightly lower than the affinity in Lubrol (Kd = 2.9 ± 0.8 nm). The affinity of F-α for βγ in vesicles prepared from pure dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was similar to that in bovine brain lipids (Kd = 6.8 ± 1.4 nm; data not shown). In competition studies, the IC50 of r-myr-αi1 for βγ in brain lipids was also a factor of 2 greater than that in Lubrol (Table I).Figure 6Binding of F-α to βγ in lipid vesicles. Biotin-labeled lipid-containing vesicles with and without non-biotin-labeled βγ (bg) were prepared by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Vesicles were allowed to bind to avidin-coated beads in HEDNM (with 0.2 mm free Mg2+) with 0.1% BSA and no detergent for 30 min at room temperature. A, total and nonspecific F-α binding to the βγ-containing lipid vesicles versuslipid vesicles alone. F-α (20 nm) was incubated with beads coupled to βγ-containing vesicles, or the corresponding amount of lipid vesicles without βγ was added (solid bars). Nonspecific binding was defined by addition of 1 μm unlabeled r-myr-αi1 to the vesicles before F-α was added (hatched bars). Data are from a single experiment repeated two times with similar results.B, saturation binding of F-α to βγ in brain lipid vesicles. Equilibrium binding of F-α in HEDNM (with 0.1% BSA) to 0.1 nm βγ in lipid vesicles was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Nonspecific binding in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled r-myr-αi1 was subtracted and fit to a hyperbolic binding function (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)With the ability to measure G protein subunit interactions in lipid membranes, we wanted to determine whether G protein subunit dissociation would lead to rapid Gα dissociation from the membrane. Heterotrimer was assembled by preincubation of F-α with the βγ-containing biotinylated bovine brain lipid vesicles coupled to the beads. Dissociation of F-α was initiated by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled r-myr-αi1 or by activation with aluminum fluoride. Both treatments resulted in F-α dissociation from the vesicles (Fig. 7). In agreement with the dissociation rates for the heterotrimer in Lubrol solution, AMF-induced release of F-α was rapid (koff = 0.047 min−1). As expected from the lower affinity between subunits in the lipid environment than in Lubrol, the dissociation rate from the surface of the vesicles was ∼2–5-fold faster than that in Lubrol (koff = 0.28 min−1). These data show that r-myr-αi1 can rapidly dissociate from a lipid vesicle surface following G protein activation. The incomplete dissociation of F-α upon AMF activation may be due to some small residual affinity of AMF-bound α subunits for βγ or lipids (Figs.4 and 6 A).Figure 7Dissociation kinetics of F-α from βγ in brain lipid vesicles. Unlabeled βγ subunits were reconstituted into the bovine brain lipid vesicles with 1% biotinylated lipid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Vesicles were preincubated with avidin-coated beads for 30 min at room temperature in HEDNM with 0.1% BSA. Particles were then centrifuged for 2 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was exchanged two times to remove any unbound material. Fluorescein-labeled Gi1α (2 nm) was added to the βγ-containing vesicles coupled to the beads and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Dissociation of F-α from βγ was initiated at 22 °C either by competing with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled r-myr-αi1 (▴) or by sequential addition of AMF (▪). Data are means ± S.D. of duplicate determinations from a single experiment representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)By combining two real-time measurements, namely spectroscopic analysis of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the heterotrimer and flow cytometric detection of physical separation of the subunits, the sequence of the events involved in G protein activation could be resolved. The increase in Gα tryptophan fluorescence has been used as a measure of conformational changes accompanying G protein activation (20Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Ross E.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid kinetics of the αi1 intrinsic fluorescence increase were recorded using a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. Addition of AMF resulted in a 10–15% increase in fluorescence of the αi1·βγ heterotrimer. Controls using HEDNML instead of AMF or mixing of boiled r-myr-αi1·βγ with AMF showed no change in the intensity of the fluorescence. The AMF activation-induced dissociation of F-α from the F-α·b-βγ heterotrimer assembled on the avidin-coated beads was analyzed by continuous acquisition mode on the flow cytometer. The rate of Gα activation monitored by intrinsic fluorescence was ∼3-fold faster than the rate of subunit dissociation by flow cytometry (Fig.8). This indicates that an activating conformational change in the α subunit precedes subunit dissociation (see “Discussion”). This was not a difference between labeled and unlabeled protein as similar rates of AMF-induced fluorescence change were seen with F-α·βγ. If there was any difference, F-α gave slightly faster kinetics (data not shown).Figure 8Kinetics of activation-induced conformational change and dissociation of the heterotrimer. The time courses of the AMF-induced increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and of the release of F-α from b-βγ attached to beads are compared on the same time scale. Purified r-myr-αi1 and bovine brain βγ were mixed in an equimolar ratio in HEDNML and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (22 °C). Equal volumes of 400 nmheterotrimer and 2× AMF were mixed in the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer, and tryptophan fluorescence of αi1(GDP)·βγ was measured by exciting at 290 nm and monitoring emission at wavelengths above 320 nm (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data were collected every 2 ms, and are averages of eight traces from a single experiment representative of four independent experiments. The fluorescence increase is ∼15% of the starting fluorescence. The AMF-induced dissociation of F-α from the F-α·b-βγ heterotrimer assembled on the beads was monitored by flow cytometry. Fluorescein-labeled Gi1α (2 nm) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in HEDNML with 100 pm b-βγ precoupled to avidin-coated beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescence from the beads was measured to provide the value of maximum binding, and then the samples were diluted with equal volumes of 2× AMF in the same buffer. The data were collected in a continuous “list mode” data acquisition option of the flow cytometer. With the flow cytometric data, sample addition and mixing prevented acquisition of data earlier than 10 s. More than 10,000 data points were accumulated during the 200-s time course, so the data were smoothed by averaging every 10 time points (▪). Data shown are from a single measurement repeated at least two times in each of three independent experiments. The kinetics for both G protein activation and subunit dissociation were best fit by a two-exponent function. Both phases were faster for the intrinsic fluorescence change. The weighted mean t½ of Gα activation was 15 s, and that for subunit dissociation was 48 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe results described here extend our knowledge of G protein subunit interactions and how they relate to the lipid environment and G protein activation mechanisms. This novel flow cytometric approach permitted us to address quantitatively the role of detergent, lipid environment, and regulatory factors affecting G protein α and βγ subunit binding. Also, we show that Gα conformational changes precede subunit dissociation and that upon G protein activation in lipid vesicles, a myristoylated α subunit rapidly dissociates from the membrane.Previous attempts to determine affinities between G protein subunits using different experimental approaches have resulted in a range of the dissociation constants. Kohnken and Hildebrandt (21Kohnken R.E. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20688-20696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used Western blots to detect binding of the α subunit to biotinyl-βγ immobilized on streptavidin-agarose. The apparent Kd values in 0.05% Lubrol-PX were ∼20 nm for α41 and ∼350 nm for α39. The last value was at least three times larger that the EC50 measured indirectly from the βγ-supported ADP-ribosylation of α39 by pertussis toxin (22Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Katada T. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8182-8191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Helmreich and co-workers (24Heithier H. Frohlich M. Dees C. Baumann M. Haring M. Gierschik P. Schiltz E. Vaz W.L. Hekman M. Helmreich E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1169-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) used steady-state fluorescence energy transfer to examine the interaction between fluorescein-labeled Goα and rhodamine-labeled brain βγ subunits. In 0.25% Lubrol, the apparentKd for specific GTPγS-sensitive binding was 10 nm. The signal-to-noise ratio in these studies was limited as only 20% quenching of fluorescence was seen. In comprehensive studies by Ueda et al. (25Ueda N. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of six different βγ forms on the steady-state GTPase activity of α subunits was determined in 0.001–0.05% C12E10. Both Gsα and Goα showed EC50 values of 2 nmfor β1γ1 and 0.2–0.5 nm for all other βγ complexes. Gi2α GTPase was inhibited with an EC50 of ∼0.4 nm by all βγ subunits tested. In our analysis of resonance energy transfer between fluorescein-labeled Goα and eosin-labeled βγ by stopped-flow kinetics, we observed only 5% quenching of F-α fluorescence and could only say that the equilibriumKd was <60 nm (26Neubig R.R. Connolly M.C. Remmers A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the present data showing a dissociation constant of 1–3 nm in 0.002–0.1% Lubrol are generally consistent with previous literature reports. The advantages of this approach are as follows: 1) direct measurement of the binding interaction rather than an indirect functional measure; 2) the simplicity of the method and the reproducibility of results; and 3) its easy application to a wide variety of experimental conditions, which has allowed us to test the effects of many factors that regulate subunit interaction.Flow cytometry is equally suitable for continuous analysis of real-time binding or dissociation kinetics (10Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A.

Cytometry. 1995; 21: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We defined the on- and off-rate constants for α-GDP and βγ, and the binding is quite fast; kon is 0.7 × 106m−1 s−1. The dissociation of the αi·βγ complex upon AMF activation has been shown previously by its ability to reverse the aggregation of αi in the presence of βγ (28Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 631-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cerione and co-workers (8Mittal R. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) proposed that the dissociation of transducin subunits by AMF precedes the tryptophan fluorescence change usually attributed to activation. A potential problem with that study is the indirect measurements of dissociation by subunit exchange and fluorescence energy transfer. Our direct determination of the dissociation rate of the αi·βγ heterotrimer found it to be 3-fold slower than the rate of the G protein conformational change accompanying activation. This suggests a simpler model in which the conformational change occurs first, followed by dissociation.G protein subunit interactions are strongly influenced by magnesium (21Kohnken R.E.

We observed a 2-fold reduction in α/βγ binding affinity by increasing the free MgCl2 concentration from 0.2 to 10 mm, and binding was reduced even further in 40 mm MgCl2. This nucleotide-independent dissociation at very high magnesium is important to keep in mind in evaluating G protein subunit interactions. Because of these observations, all other studies in this paper used a physiologically relevant free Mg2+ concentration of 200 μm. The effect of GTPγS to completely prevent formation of the F-α·b-βγ heterocomplex even in the presence of physiological concentrations (0.2 mm free MgCl2) is at odds with a recent report for αs that indicated that very high magnesium concentrations were required for subunit dissociation (9Basi N.S. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine αs/βγ interactions with the flow cytometric method to further evaluate this possible discrepancy.One aim of this study was to quantitate interactions between G protein subunits in detergent micelles and in lipid vesicles under similar conditions. Several frequently used detergents had significant effects on the affinity of heterocomplex formation. Sodium cholate (0.4%) and CHAPS (0.7%) reduced the affinity of α and βγ"

https://openalex.org/W2035803054,"The effect of varying the Mg2+concentration on the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-OGDH) activity and the rate of oxidative phosphorylation of rat heart mitochondria was studied. The ionophore A23187 was used to modify the mitochondrial free Mg2+ concentration. Half-maximal stimulation (K0.5) of ATP synthesis by Mg2+ was obtained with 0.13 ± 0.02 mm (n = 7) with succinate (+rotenone) and 0.48 ± 0.13 mm(n = 6) with 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) as substrates. Similar K0.5 values were found for NAD(P)H formation, generation of membrane potential, and state 4 respiration with 2-OG. In the presence of ADP, an increase in Piconcentration promoted a decrease in the K0.5values of ATP synthesis, membrane potential formation and state 4 respiration for Mg2+ with 2-OG, but not with succinate. These results indicate that 2-OGDH is the main step of oxidative phosphorylation modulated by Mg2+ when 2-OG is the oxidizable substrate; with succinate, the ATP synthase is the Mg2+-sensitive step. Replacement of Pi by acetate, which promotes changes on intramitochondrial pH abolished Mg2+ activation of 2-OGDH.

By using permeant fluorescent dyes and nuclear magnetic resonance, tissue-dependent variations in [Mg2+]c in the range 0.4 of 0.8 mm have been observed, in response to several hormones and agonists. For instance, norepinephrine induced a net release of cellular Mg2+ (1Romani A. Scarpa A.

Depletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores, induced by α-adrenergic agonists, activated the uptake of Mg2+ by these organelles (6Zhang G.H. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10352-10356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP stimulated the release of 40% of cellular Mg2+ in ascites cells (7Wolf F.I. Di Francesco A. Covacci V. Corda D. Cittadini A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); it was proposed that cAMP promoted Mg2+ release through the activation of a plasma membrane Na+/Mg2+ antiporter (8Wolf F.I. Di Francesco A. Covacci V. Cittadini A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, a report indicating that addition of cAMP also induced a net release of 20–25% of total Mg2+ in rat liver mitochondria (9Romani A. Dowell E. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24376-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not confirmed (10Altschuld R.A. Jung D.W. Phillips R.M. Narayan P. Castillo L.C. Whitaker T.E. Hensley J. Hohl C.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1103-H1111PubMed Google Scholar). In beef heart mitochondria, the transition from basal (state 4) to active (state 3) respiration led to a small, but significant elevation in the mitochondrial matrix free Mg2+concentration ([Mg2+]m) from 0.5 mm to 0.6–0.7 mm. This increase in [Mg2+]m persisted during ATP synthesis, until added ADP was exhausted; at this time [Mg2+]mreturned to basal levels. These variations in [Mg2+]m were inhibited by oligomycin (11Jung D.W. Apel L. Brierley G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An elevation in [Mg2+]m from 44 μmto 1.69 mm also induced a stimulation in the rate of citrulline synthesis in rat liver mitochondria (12Rodrı́guez-Zavala J.S. Saavedra-Molina A. Moreno-Sánchez R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 411: 179-188Google Scholar). Modulation of mitochondrial glutaminase by 0–2 mm Mg2+ has also been observed (13Kovacevic Z. Day S.H. Collett V. Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of these reports describing an active movement of Mg2+in cells and mitochondria of different tissues and in response to different agonists suggest that Mg2+ may play a role as a second messenger in the cell. In this work, we show that variations of external Mg2+, and hence in [Mg2+]m, can modulate the activities of the 2-OGDH and the ATP synthase and, in consequence, Mg2+ may affect the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Rat heart mitochondria were isolated from male Wistar rats of 250–300-g weight according to a previously described method using the protease type XXVII (Nagarse) from Sigma (14Moreno-Sánchez R. Hansford R.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Heart mitochondria were loaded with Mag-Fura-2 or BCECF (Molecular Probes) by incubating 30–40 mg of mitochondrial protein in 2 ml of a medium composed of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (SHE medium), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ADP, 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and 5 μmMag-Fura-2/AM or BCECF/AM at 25 °C for 20 min. At the end of this incubation period, mitochondria were diluted 10–15 times with ice-cold SHE medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin, centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of SHE medium, and kept on ice until use. Mitochondria loaded by following this procedure showed higher respiratory control values than nonloaded mitochondria, 8.6 and 4.3 (n = 2), respectively, with 10 mm 2-oxoglutarate as a substrate. Mag-Fura-2-loaded mitochondria (0.5 mg protein/ml) were incubated in 120 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA (KME medium), 5 mm succinate, and 2 μm rotenone, at pH 7.25 and 30 °C. To avoid interference by matrix NAD(P)H fluorescence, 2-oxoglutarate was not used as an oxidizable substrate for determinations of [Mg2+]m. Fluorescence changes were monitored under smooth stirring and gassing with 100% O2 in an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer. Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 398 nm and emission was collected at 483 nm. [Mg2+]m was determined from the fluorescence ratio signal (R, 398/340 nm).Rmax and Rmin were obtained at the end of each experiment. Rmin was generated by addition of 800 pmol of A23187/mg protein and sufficient EDTA-Tris, pH 8.0, to chelate all the Mg2+ present in the incubation medium; 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to ensure complete Mg2+ equilibration across the membrane.Rmax was obtained after further addition of 70 mm MgCl2. Calculation of [Mg2+]m was made using the following equation (15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Mg2+]=Kd(Mg2+)R−RminRmax−R∗SfSbEquation 1 where Kd(Mg2+) is the dissociation constant for the Mg-dye complex in the mitochondrial matrix and Sf and Sb are the dye fluorescence intensities at 398 nm with zero and excess Mg2+, respectively. the Kd(Mg2+) value was determined experimentally to be 1.52 ± 0.18 mm(n = 5). BCECF-loaded mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in KME medium containing 0.5 mm2-oxoglutarate, 10 mm NaCl, 600 μm ADP, 3.5 μm oligomycin, 800 pmol of A23187/mg of protein and different concentrations of Mg2+, Pi, or acetate. For pH calculations, a calibration plot was generated incubating 0.5 mg of protein/ml in the medium mentioned above, at the desired pH, in the presence of 2 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, 200 pmol of nigericin/mg of protein and 0.005% Triton X-100 to equilibrate all ion gradients. Excitation wavelengths were 450 and 500 nm; fluorescence was collected at 530 nm. The plot of pH values versus fluorescence ratio signal gives a straight line between pH 6.8 and 7.8. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in KME medium containing 0.5 mm 2-oxoglutarate or 5 mm succinate (+1 μm rotenone), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 30 units of hexokinase, and 5 mm32Pi (specific activity, 1–1.5 × 106cpm/ml, Cerenkov radiation), at 30 °C. After 5 min, 1.2 mm ADP was added, and the reaction was stopped 30 s later by addition of 200 μl of 30% (w/v) cold trichloroacetic acid. Excess 32Pi was extracted as described previously using acetone + n-butyl acetate as organic solvents (16Moreno-Sánchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12554-12560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity of an aliquot of the aqueous phase was determined as 32Pi Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in KME medium containing 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 10 mm NaCl, 600 μm ADP, pH 7.25, and different concentrations of Mg2+ and Pi at 30 °C. Matrix NAD(P)H formed was determined following mitochondrial intrinsic fluorescence at 460 nm with the excitation wavelength at 340 nm. To obtain the fluorescence minimum, mitochondria were incubated in the absence of added substrates until endogenous substrates were depleted (approximately 5–8 min) (NAD(P)H = 0%); the fluorescence maximum was reached by adding 5 μm rotenone for complete reduction of NAD(P)+ (NAD(P)H = 100%) at the end of each experiment. Mitochondria (1 mg protein/ml) were suspended in KME medium containing 0.5 mm2-oxoglutarate, 10 mm NaCl, 5 μm safranin O, at 30 °C. Absorbance was recorded at 554 − 520 nm (17Åkerman K.E. Saris N.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 426: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Zanotti A. Azzone G.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 201: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using a dual-beam SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Zero Δψ was reached by addition of 1 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and 2 μmrotenone at the end of each experiment. The membrane potential was also quantitatively measured using the distribution of [3H]TPP+. Mitochondria (1.5 mg protein/ml) were suspended in 500 μl of KME medium containing 5 mm Pi, 10 mm NaCl, 0.8 μm [3H]TPP (specific activity, 4–5 × 104 cpm/ml) at 30 °C and different concentrations of Mg2+. After 5 min, 800 pmol of A23187/mg of protein were added; 3 min later 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate was added, and the incubation was continued for another 3 min. Then, mitochondria were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. Aliquots from the pellet and supernatant were taken to measure the [3H]TPP+ distribution; the membrane potential was determined as described previously (19Moreno-Sánchez R. Rodrı́guez-Enríquez S. Cuellar A. Corona N. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1995; 319: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration was measured using an oxygen Clark-type electrode. Mitochondria (0.6 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in KME medium containing 1 mm2-oxoglutarate, 10 mm NaCl, 1 or 5 mmPi, and 800 pmol of A23187/mg of protein. After 5 min, 600 μm ADP was added, and the change in the rate of respiration was measured. Mitochondria (2.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in KME medium plus 5 mmsuccinate and 2 μm rotenone at 30 °C for 10 min under orbital shaking. Then, 3% (v/v) cold perchloric acid, 25 mm EDTA was added, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant neutralized for enzymatic determination of ATP and ADP. Essentially identical results were obtained when mitochondria were previously sedimented in a microcentrifuge at 6–10 °C and further denaturalized by the addition of perchloric acid. The increase in the external Mg2+ concentration induced a proportional, but small elevation in [Mg2+]m in rat heart mitochondria (Fig.1). This Mg2+ gradient ([Mg2+]m/[Mg2+]ex) showed a slope of 0.066, in the range 0–3 mm externally added Mg2+, indicating that Mg2+ does not easily equilibrate across the mitochondrial inner membrane, probably due to a slow Mg2+ influx, or to an active Mg2+efflux. Similar results were previously reported for rat liver mitochondria (12Rodrı́guez-Zavala J.S. Saavedra-Molina A. Moreno-Sánchez R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 411: 179-188Google Scholar). To accelerate the equilibration of Mg2+, the divalent cation ionophore A23187 was added. Fig. 1 shows that the ionophore modifies the steady-state concentration of matrix Mg2+, although equilibration with external Mg2+was not complete. Since mitochondria incubated with A23187 conserved the H+ gradient, it was not unexpected that A23187 did not produce complete equilibration of Mg2+ concentrations across the mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, A23187 seems to be a weak Mg2+ ionophore due to a low affinity and poor mobility across the mitochondrial membrane (20Debono M. Molloy R.M. Dorman D.E. Paschal J.W. Babcock D.F. Deber C.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6865-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Jung D.W. Chapman C.J. Baysal K. Pfeiffer D.R. Brierley G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Wang E. Taylor K.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13817-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the addition of A23187 allowed a more rapid manipulation of matrix Mg2+in a lower range of external Mg2+ concentrations. The use of 1600 pmol of 4-bromo-A23187/mg of protein, instead of A23187, resulted in a curve very similar to that shown in Fig. 1 in the absence of ionophore (data not shown). The addition of A23187 to mitochondria incubated in the absence of added MgCl2 decreased [Mg2+]mfrom 0.49 to 0.02 mm and induced a significant diminution of matrix ATP/ADP ratio and the ADP + ATP content (see Fig. 1,inset). The further addition of 3 mmMg2+, in the presence of A23187, increased [Mg2+]m from 0.02 to 1.15 mm and preserved matrix ATP/ADP ratio and ADP + ATP content at high values. Although a correlation between [Mg2+]m and the ATP/ADP ratio (or ATP content) was not found for mitochondria incubated with 3 mm Mg2+ and with or without A23187, it is apparent from the data of Fig. 1 that, in the presence of A23187, the addition of external Mg2+ modified both the [Mg2+]m and the ATP/ADP ratio, which may affect the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. The rate of oxidative phosphorylation, assayed in the presence of A23187, depended on Mg2+ concentration in the incubation medium (Fig. 2). Since the sensitivity to Mg2+ depended on whether succinate (+rotenone) or 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) was used (p < 0.05), the data of Fig. 2 suggest the existence of at least two sites of modulation by Mg2+. These sites may be located in the phosphorylating system (i.e. the ATP synthase or the adenine nucleotide translocase) during succinate oxidation, and at the level of 2-OGDH for 2-OG oxidation. Replacement of Mg2+ by Mn2+also induced an activation of ATP synthesis, but at higher concentrations (K0.5 values for Mn2+were 0.60 ± 0.047 mm (n = 3) with succinate and 0.92 ± 0.052 mm (n = 3) with 2-OG as a substrate). Since succinyl-CoA synthase also requires Mg2+, its contribution to the uptake of 32Pi was assayed. In the inset of Fig. 2, it is shown that substrate level phosphorylation by the Krebs cycle accounted for up to 40–50% of total ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation with 2-OG as an oxidizable substrate. As substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation with 2-OG showed different sensitivities to Mg2+, an effect of Mg2+ on sites different from succinyl-CoA synthase seemed likely. To discard the participation of contaminating ATPases, in the ATP synthesis assays, hexokinase + glucose was used to capture ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation. This prompted us to determine the Mg2+ dependence of hexokinase. Under the conditions of ATP synthesis (see Fig. 2), K0.5 values of hexokinase for ATP-Mg were 92 μm, in the presence of 400 μm ATP, and 31 μm in the presence of 100 μm ATP. These two concentrations of added ATP represent the maximal level of ATP synthesis (for 1 mg of protein/ml in 30 s at 30 °C) during oxidative phosphorylation with succinate and 2-OG, respectively. The sensitivity of hexokinase to Mg2+revealed that this enzyme is not involved in the lower sensitivity of oxidative phosphorylation to Mg2+ with 2-OG as a substrate (see Fig. 2). However, in the presence of succinate, the sensitivity of oxidative phosphorylation to Mg2+ might result from a mixed response of both hexokinase and ATP synthase to Mg2+. However, an essentially identical sensitivity of oxidative phosphorylation to Mg2+ was observed in the absence of hexokinase (K0.5 = 0.13 ± 0.014 mm, n = 3), with succinate (+rotenone). The change in the magnitude of the membrane potential, as estimated from the distribution of TPP+, was initially used to monitor indirectly variations in 2-OGDH activity in mitochondria incubated with limiting concentrations of 2-OG (Fig.3 A). A membrane potential (Δψ) of 130 mV in the absence of added ADP and Mg2+ and in the presence of A23187 and Pi, was determined. This value increased to 140 mV by the increase in [Mg2+]ex (Fig. 3 A,circles). With 600 μm ADP, steady state Δψ diminished to 112 mV by increasing [Mg2+]ex(Fig. 3 A, squares), due to stimulation of ATP synthesis. Although under these last conditions the oxidative system was activated by Mg2+, the diminution in Δψ indicated that, at Mg2+ concentrations of 0–1.5 mm, activation of the phosphorylating system of the pathway by Mg2+ was predominant. At higher Mg2+concentrations (>1.5 mm), activation of the oxidative system prevailed over that of the phosphorylating system, resulting in Δψ values larger than those obtained at zero Mg2+ (data not shown). The enhancement of Δψ up to 162 mV by increasing [Mg2+]ex, in the presence of ADP + Pi + oligomycin (Fig. 3 A, triangles), which was larger than that reached at the same concentration of [Mg2+]ex in the absence of ADP, indicated that ADP was a modulator of the Mg2+ activation. In the absence of added Mg2+, removal of Pi markedly diminished Δψ (Fig. 3 A, diamonds). In the absence of Pi, Δψ increased when [Mg2+]ex was increased, but only to 105 mV. This latter observation prompted us to determine the effect of different concentrations of Pi on the activity of 2-OGDH. In comparison to the [3H]TPP+ method, the absorbance difference of safranin O (Fig. 3 B) allows for continuous monitoring of Δψ, and a large number of experiments with the same mitochondrial preparation. Using the safranin O signal, the increase in Pi concentration (in the presence of ADP + oligomycin) potentiated the activating effect of Mg2+ on the steady state value of Δψ (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the half-maximal stimulation of Δψ by Mg2+ was decreased and the maximal value of Δψ was elevated by increasing Pi concentrations. This effect of Pi was not apparent in the absence of added ADP. Similar results to those of Fig.3 B were obtained by measuring the [3H]TPP+ distribution under the same conditions (data not shown). The activity of 2-OGDH was also measured, following the level of reduction of matrix pyridine nucleotides. In the absence of added Pi, the increase in [Mg2+]ex did not promote the generation of NAD(P)H (Fig.4 A). However, an increase in Pi concentration induced both a decrease in the K0.5 value for Mg2+ and an increase in the level of NAD(P)H reduction. The rate of respiration measured in the presence of ADP + oligomycin (state 4) was also stimulated by increasing [Mg2+]ex (Fig. 4 B). Again, the presence of increasing Pi concentrations potentiated the stimulation by Mg2+, through a diminution in the K0.5 value for Mg2+ and an increase in the maximal rate of respiration. Thus, the data of Figs. 3and 4 indicate that Pi, in the presence of ADP, potentiates the activating effect of Mg2+ on 2-OGDH activity. The study of the effect of different Pi concentrations on the Mg2+ sensitivity of ATP synthesis and state 3 respiration supported by succinate (+rotenone) revealed a negligible effect on the K0.5 value for Mg2+, indicating that the effect of Pi was exerted only at the Krebs cycle level. Lack of Mg2+ activation on state 4 respiration with succinate (+rotenone) as substrate and oligomycin (data not shown), discarded the possibility that Mg2+activated the respiratory chain. Matrix acidification brought about by the Pi uptake might be involved in Mg2+ activation of 2-OGDH. The activating effect of 5 mm Pi on the stimulation of matrix NAD(P)H formation by Mg2+ was not reproduced by addition of 10 or 20 mm acetate (data not shown); the final steady-state pH values in BCECF-loaded mitochondria incubated with 10 mm acetate or 5 mm Pi, in the presence of ADP, oligomycin, and A23187, were 6.91 and 6.88 with no added Mg2+, and 7.11 and 7.16 with 1 mmMg2+, respectively. These results indicate that matrix acidification is not the mechanism involved in the Pipotentiating effect. The different sensitivity to Mg2+ of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, with 2-OG or succinate, suggested that different sites in the pathway are involved in the interaction with Mg2+. With the former substrate, the data on Δψ, matrix NAD(P)H, and respiratory rates indicated that the main site of interaction with Mg2+ was 2-OGDH. Since ADP-Mg is the true substrate for the ATP synthase (24Kozlov I.A. Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 463: 29-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), increasing [Mg2+]m is expected to activate this enzyme. However, the substrates for adenine nucleotide translocase are free ADP and ATP (25Pfaff E. Heldt H.W. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). During ATP synthesis, external ADP exchanges with matrix ATP. As ATP has a higher affinity for Mg2+ than ADP, increasing [Mg2+]m is expected to inhibit the adenine nucleotide translocase activity through the diminution of the internal substrate. Therefore, the effect of increasing [Mg2+]m on the rate of oxidative phosphorylation is not readily apparent. As the elevation of external Mg2+, and hence [Mg2+]m, resulted in higher rates of ATP synthesis with succinate as substrate, it can be assumed that Mg2+ activation of the ATP synthase prevailed over Mg2+ inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocase. Stimulation of the rate of oxidative arsenylation, an analogous process to oxidative phosphorylation, but without the participation of adenine nucleotide translocase (16Moreno-Sánchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12554-12560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by Mg2+ using succinate (data not shown), supported the interpretation of an activating effect of Mg2+ on the ATP synthase. In addition to a direct interaction of Mg2+ with the oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, Mg2+ might also perturb matrix Ca2+ homeostasis, and hence, affect the rate of ATP synthesis (16Moreno-Sánchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12554-12560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moreno-Sánchez R. Rodrı́guez-Enríquez S. Cuellar A. Corona N. Arch. Biochim.

Acta. 1991; 1060: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Moreno-Sánchez and Torres-Márquez (27Moreno-Sánchez R. Torres-Márquez M.E. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). For instance, Mg2+ might compete with Ca2+ for the same binding sites in 2-OGDH. A decreased Ca2+ sensitivity by increasing Mg2+has been observed for the NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase (28Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas an enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity was described for the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (29Thomas A.P. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the sensitivity of 2-OGDH to Ca2+, at different Mg2+ concentrations, has not yet been determined, Panov and Scarpa (30Panov A. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that 2-OGDH can be activated synergistically by both Mg2+ and Ca2+, implying the existence of different binding sites. Panov and Scarpa (30Panov A. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also determined a dissociation constant (Kd) for Mg2+ of 25 μm in the isolated 2-OGDH, with saturating concentrations of thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme A, and NAD+. Although such aKd value for Mg2+ is lower than the K0.5 value obtained in this study (0.48 mm, see Fig. 2), it can be argued that the matrix concentrations of the 2-OGDH coenzymes in intact heart mitochondria may be limiting, and that 2-OGDH activity is not the only controlling step of the pathway (25Pfaff E. Heldt H.W. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The value of the Kd orK0.5 for Mg2+ may establish the physiological relevance of variations in [Mg2+]m. Thus, a K0.5value of 0.48 mm would appear as more physiologically relevant for modulating 2-OGDH activity and the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, since this concentration is in the range of [Mg2+]m in intact mitochondria (31Rutter G.A. Osbaldeston N.J. McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Murphy E. Freudenrich C.C. Lieberman M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the estimatedK0.5 values for Mg2+ refers to the external Mg2+ concentrations, which were not fully equilibrated with the mitochondrial matrix by A23187 (cf. Fig. 1). Thus, the K0.5 value of 0.48 mm for external Mg2+ corresponds to a [Mg2+]m of 140 μm, which is slightly below the physiological range. HigherK0.5 values for Mg2+ were determined at low Pi concentrations. For instance, aK0.5 value of 1 mm for Mg2+ was observed in NAD(P)H formation with 1 mm Pi (see Fig. 4 A). Such aK0.5 value was diminished to 0.5 mmby increasing Pi concentration up to 3 mmPi. The corresponding [Mg2+]m for 1 mm external Mg2+ would be 350 μm, a value well within the physiological range. A variation in the cytosolic Pi concentration from 0.83 to 3.1 mm induced by epinephrine was established in rat heart (33Headrick J. Dobson G. Williams J. McKirdy J. Jordan L. Willis R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1074-H1084PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, physiological modulation of the 2-OGDH activity by Mg2+ may depend on the level of cytosolic (and matrix) Pi. Other possible sites of modulation by Mg2+ during oxidative phosphorylation supported by 2-OG oxidation were the succinyl-CoA synthase, the ATP synthase and hexokinase (in the experiments of32Pi incorporation into ATP). However, the Mg2+ sensitivity of these three enzymes showed that their saturation by Mg2+ was fully achieved at concentrations (<0.2–0.3 mm) that stimulated oxidative phosphorylation by less than 40%. The lack of stimulation of state 4 respiration by Mg2+ in mitochondria that oxidized succinate, in the presence of oligomycin, discarded an effect of Mg2+ at the level of the respiratory chain. Thus, these results indicate that 2-OGDH is one (but not the only) of the main controlling steps of oxidative phosphorylation (see also Moreno-Sánchez et al. (26Moreno-Sánchez R. Devars S. López-Gómez F. Uribe A. Corona N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), at nonsaturing Mg2+ concentrations. In this respect, control of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation by changes in the spermine/Mg2+ rates, without a concomitant increase in [Ca2+]m, has been shown in dog pancreas mitochondria (19Moreno-Sánchez R. Rodrı́guez-Enríquez S. Cuellar A. Corona N. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1995; 319: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Modulation of the 2-OGDH activity by adenine nucleotides is well established (23Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A synergistic effect by Ca2+ and adenine nucleotides has been described (28Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mg2+ also activates 2-OGDH (30Panov A. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (this work), but in contrast to other enzyme effectors, the mechanism of action is by enhancing the catalytic enzyme capacity (kcat), rather than by increasing substrate affinity. Potentiation of the modulating effect of Mg2+ by Pi, although clearly demonstrated in this work, is somewhat puzzling. There is a report describing an activation of purified 2-OGDH by a high concentration of Pi (>10 mm), through the diminution of the K0.5 for 2-OG (34Lawlis V.B. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Pi potentiating effect could be through promoting changes in matrix pH, since modulation of 2-OGDH activity by pH has also been reported (35Smith B.C. Clotfelter L.A. Cheung J.Y. La Noue K.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, substitution of acetate for Pi, to induce similar matrix pH values, did not restitute the Mg2+ sensitivity of 2-OGDH. Thus, a direct interaction of Pi with the enzyme is likely to occur. From the present findings, the question that arises is to what extent and how Pi and Mg2+ affect the interplay of the other well described effectors, such as Ca2+ and adenine nucleotides, and the coenzymes NAD+, thiamine pyrophosphate, and coenzyme A, on 2-OGDH activity.

Chem. 271, 29759–29763) demonstrated that the α-subunit of the colonic H+,K+-ATPase (HKα2) requires coexpression with a β-subunit to support H+/K+ transport in a heterologous expression system (Xenopus laevis oocytes). In these studies, HKα2 formed stable and functional α·β complexes when coexpressed with either the rat β1-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase or the β-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, suggesting that different β-subunits may interact with HKα2. The present studies tested this hypothesis by development and application of a specific antibody against HKα2 peptide. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine if HKα2 co-precipitates with the same β-subunit in organs known to express HKα2 protein. The data demonstrate that HKα2 assembles with β1-Na+,K+-ATPase in the renal medulla and in distal colon. Previous experiments from our laboratory (Codina, J., Kone, B. C., Delmas-Mata, J.

The data demonstrate that HKα2 assembles with β1-Na+,K+-ATPase in the renal medulla and in distal colon. It is assumed that all members of the X +,K+-ATPase family, including the gastric H+,K+-ATPase isoform, exist as dimers of α- and β-subunits (1Sachs G. Shin J.M. Briving C. Wallmark B. Hersey S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 2Kone B.C. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1996; 22: 349-365PubMed Google Scholar). The α- or catalytic subunit of the H+,K+-ATPase has a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, contains the binding site for specific inhibitors such as Sch-28080 and omeprazole, and is responsible for internalizing K+ and secreting H+. The catalytic subunit for thoseX +,K+-ATPases characterized thus far requires, for biological activity, a glycosylated β-subunit. Nevertheless, the absolute requirement of the colonic α H+,K+-ATPase subunit (HKα2) 1The abbreviations used are: HKα2, α-subunit of the colonic H+,K+-ATPase; HKα1, α-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase; βHKα1, β-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase; β1, β-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1The abbreviations used are: HKα2, α-subunit of the colonic H+,K+-ATPase; HKα1, α-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase; βHKα1, β-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase; β1, β-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. for a β-subunit for functionality, has been called into question (3Lee J.

Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that when the rat HKα2 is expressed in a baculovirus expression system, in the absence of exogenous β-subunit, the HKα2 migrated to the plasma membrane and exhibited K+-ATPase activity that was partially sensitive to Sch-28080 and totally insensitive to ouabain. In contrast a different pharmacologic profile was observed when HKα2 was expressed in oocytes from Xenopus laevis (4Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol.

Our laboratory, on the other hand, used two different β-subunits as follows: the β-subunit of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase (βHKα1) and the β1-subunit of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase (β1) (5Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both studies reported an enzymatic activity, measured as86Rb+ uptake, that was totally dependent on the presence of a β-subunit. Also in contrast with the report of Lee and associates (3Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), this activity was insensitive to Sch-28080 and was partially sensitive to ouabain. Although the findings of Lee and associates (3Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggested that under certain conditions HKα2 may function in the absence of a β-subunit, the study by Cougnon and associates (4Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and that from our laboratory (5Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), cited above, demonstrated, nevertheless, that under certain physiological conditions different β-subunits may interact with HKα2. The interaction of HKα2 with various β-subunits observed in heterologous systems does not necessarily reveal what may pertain in intact tissues, however. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze those interactions in the two tissues known to express HKα2 protein (the rat distal colon and rat renal medulla) (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar, 7Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J.

Our results demonstrate that HKα2 assembles with β1 in both organs. Chronic hypokalemia (LK) was accomplished in male Sprague-Dawley rats (135–175 g) by dietary K+ restriction (9DuBose Jr., T.D. Codina J. Burges A. Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F500-F507PubMed Google Scholar). Rats in the LK group received tap water to drink and were maintained for 14 days on a customized vitamin-fortified nominally K+-free diet that contained 0.001 nmol/g potassium (ICN Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH, lot 960189). Control rats were pair fed each day with the same diet, to which KCl (0.03 mmol/g) was added. (ICN Biochemicals, P5411). Tap water was consumed ad libitum. The dietary modification was well tolerated and generated a stable and reproducible model of chronic K+ depletion. The rats were sacrificed in sets of two rats (one from each experimental group) to minimize bias during preparation. To prepare membranes, the organs to be studied were homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann, model PT 10/35) in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 3 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (buffer A) containing 27% sucrose (w/v). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to the top of 45% (w/w) sucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C (10Scherer N.M. Toro M.J. Entman M.L. Birnbaumer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The membranes in the interphase 27/45% sucrose were diluted in buffer A and collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g. The final protein concentration was measured using the Lowry method (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (TPEQLDELLTNYQ) (12Kraut, J., Hiura, J., Scott, D., Besancon, M., Shang, A., Smolka, A., Sachs, G., 10th International Congress of Nephrology, July 2–6, 1995, 43, Madrid, Spain.Google Scholar) that extends from amino acid 686 to 698 of the published sequence of HKα2 (13Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). The peptide was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Two rabbits were injected and bled according to standard protocols. The peptide was tested for similarity to differentX +,K+-ATPases, and the maximum identity (69%) of the peptide was with the human ATP1AL1 (or HKα4) protein which is known to be expressed in brain, skin, and kidney (14Grishin A.V. Sverdlov V.E. Kostina M.B. Modyanov N.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the most divergence was with rat HKα1 (23% identity) (15Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the antibodies against HKα2 were tested by Western blot analysis of HKα2 synthesized “in vitro” using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described previously by our laboratory (16Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The specificity was tested using membranes prepared from rat stomach (enriched in HKα1) (1Sachs G. Shin J.M. Briving C. Wallmark B. Hersey S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), total rat kidney (enriched in α1-Na+,K+-ATPase) (17Shull G.E. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1985; 316: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), or rat distal colon (enriched in HKα2) (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar, 7Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F744-F750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes, prepared as described above, were separated on SDS-PAGE as described previously by our laboratory (18Hsu W.H. Rudolph U. Sanford J. Bertrand P. Olate J. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Boyd A.E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11220-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred overnight at 30 V to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, BA85) in the presence of Tris/glycine buffer (25 mm Trizma (Tris base), 250 mmglycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol). The nonspecific binding sites of the nitrocellulose membrane were blocked in the presence of 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). This was followed by 2-h incubation with the primary antibody diluted 1:1000–10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with a peroxidase-bound donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and the reacted antibody was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN2108) following the manufacturer's instructions. The complete open reading frame of HKα1 (15Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HKα2 (13Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α1-Na+,K+-ATPase (19Shull G.E. Greeb J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), β1 (20Young R.M. Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4905-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β2 (21Martin-Vasallo P. Dackowski W. Emanuel J.R. Levenson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4613-4618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and βHKα(22Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12123-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all them from rat origin, were subcloned into the plasmid pAGA#2 as described previously by our laboratory (16Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The in vitrosynthesis of the recombinant proteins was accomplished using the TnT system (Promega, Madison, WI, catalog number L4610) in the presence of [35S]methionine following the instructions of the manufacturer. The quality of the synthesized proteins was verified by separating the synthesized proteins on SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. The quantity of the synthesized protein was monitored by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the35S-synthesized recombinant protein (16Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Subunit assembly was detected as coimmunoprecipitation of HKα2 and a β-subunit using an anti-HKα2 antibody. Immune serum (150 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg (1 mg/ml) of membranes. The membranes were rinsed twice with 1 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 3 mmbenzamidine, and 1 μg/μl soybean trypsin inhibitor). Membrane proteins were extracted with 500 μl of buffer B containing 1% CHAPS for 1 h at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the HKα2/anti-HKα2antibody complex was precipitated by addition of 40 μl of protein A/G Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog number sc-2003) for 2 h at 4 °C (5Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resin was extensively washed, and the bound protein was extracted with Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and separated in SDS-PAGE. The presence of a β1-subunit was detected with a monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, catalog number 05-382). After immunoprecipitation of HKα2from the distal colon with anti-HKα2 antibody, the precipitated material was treated with Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 65 °C for 30 min. This treatment induces a total reduction of the dimer heavy/light chain of the IgGs that are similar in mobility to HKα2. We found that about 60–70% of the HKα2 is lost in this step at 65 °C. The interaction between anti-HKα2 antibody and the native HKα2 from different membranes was verified by incubating anti-HKα2antibody overnight at 4 °C in increasing concentrations of distal colon, renal medulla, and renal cortex membranes from both control and LK rats, in the presence of buffer B. The membranes were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as a source of anti-HKα2antibody to detect HKα2 in membranes prepared from distal colon (30 μg). To remove N-linked carbohydrates from the β1-subunit, membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence of buffer B containing 1% CHAPS. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and deglycosylation was accomplished in the presence of 25,000 units/ml PNGase F (24Tarentino A. Plummer Jr., T.H. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4150-4157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, catalog number 704L) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1% CHAPS. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar); proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the immunoblots were performed as described above. When necessary,N-deglycosylation was performed using immunoprecipitated samples. In this case, deglycosylation was accomplished before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer to the Protein A/G Plus agarose, and the sample was incubated as described above for 60 min at 37 °C. The immunoprecipitated HKα2/β complex from the distal colon was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, 1 mm PMSF, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1% CHAPS, 0.03 units/ml endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Sigma, catalog number E2391) (25Umemoto J. Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8609-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.07 units/ml neuraminidase (Sigma, catalog number N7885) (26Chavira Jr., R. Burnett T.J. Hageman J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), 0.05 units/ml α-l-fucosidase (Sigma, catalog number F7753) (27Parekh R.B. Tse A.G. Dwek R.A. Williams A.F. Rademacher T.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and 25,000 units/ml PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, catalog number 704L) (24Tarentino A. Plummer Jr., T.H. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4150-4157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and β1 was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-β1 antibody exactly as described above. In some experiments the presence of either endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase or PNGase F, or both were omitted during the deglycosylation (see figure legends). The monoclonal antibody against the β1-Na+,K+-ATPase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY, catalog number 05-382). Anti-α1-Na+,K+-ATPase (LEAVE) was a gift from Dr. T. Pressley (Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX) (28Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C743-C751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity and sensitivity of the monoclonal β1-Na+,K+-ATPase antibody was verified using recombinant β1, β2, and βHKα1 synthesized in vitro (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) in the presence of [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The left panel of Fig.1 demonstrates that anti-β1antibody reacted with recombinant β1 (3.4 ng). Signal was not detected when either β2 (15 ng) or βHKα1 (16 ng) was applied to the SDS-PAGE. The ECL signal of the nitrocellulose membrane was allowed to decay for 24 h and exposed again overnight to detect [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Fig. 1 (right panel) demonstrates that all three subunits ran as a single band of the expected mobility. The specificity of anti-HKα2 antibody was tested by immunoblot using rat plasma membranes from different organs as follows: distal colon membranes (10 μg) (enriched in HKα2), whole kidney membranes (100 μg) (enriched in α1-Na+,K+-ATPase), and stomach membranes (100 μg) (enriched in HKα1). The results of one of these experiments are shown in Fig.2, left panel. Specific antibody reactivity was detected in colon membranes (10 μg) but was not observed in kidney or stomach (up to 100 μg). This signal was blocked by preincubation (1 h at 4 °C) with the immunizing peptide (250 μm) (data not shown). By using recombinant protein as standard, the anti-HKα2 antibody achieved a lower limit of detection equal to 2–5 ng. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was established by immunoprecipitation of recombinant protein. The results of one experiment is shown in Fig. 2,right panel. Only HKα2 was immunoprecipitated by the addition of anti-HKα2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitation was blocked by incubating the antibody with immunizing peptide (data not shown). Our laboratory has reported previously that HKα2 assembles stably and functionally in a heterologous expression system with two different rat β-subunits (βHKα1 and β1) (5Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To explore the relevance of this observation in vivo, membranes (1 mg) were prepared from the renal medulla of rats after chronic dietary K+ depletion (chronic hypokalemia), a condition known to maximize H+,K+-ATPase expression in kidney (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar,7Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F744-F750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These membranes were incubated overnight with anti-HKα2 antibody (150 μl) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted against a monoclonal antibody to the β1-subunit of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase (Fig.3, left panel). The anti-β1 monoclonal antibody detected a band at approximately 50–55 kDa (lane 1). This band was not present when the immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HKα2antibody that was preincubated with the synthetic immunizing peptide (lane 2) or with preparations that did not contain membranes (lane 3). The central panel of Fig. 3demonstrates that β1 was not detected from 1 mg of membranes prepared from the renal medulla of control rats. However, β1 was detected in the immunoprecipitated sample of renal medulla from control rats when as much as 35 mg of proteins were used in the immunoprecipitation experiment (data not shown). This observation agrees with data reported previously by our laboratory (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar) and others (7Kraut J.A. Hiura J. Besancon M. Smolka A. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F744-F750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sangan P. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C685-C696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the abundance of HKα2 is very low in renal medulla of control rats. Surprisingly, a β1-subunit was not detected, as well, when the immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using up to 1 mg of membranes from control distal colon or the distal colon harvested from rats with chronic hypokalemia (Fig. 3, right panel). To verify that the distal colon contains a β1-subunit detectable by our monoclonal antibody, we performed the experiment displayed in Fig. 4. Distal colon membranes (50 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The β1-subunit was detected by immunoblot using the monoclonal β1 antibody. The antibody recognized a wide band in the region expanding from 40 to 80 kDa. This wide band “disappeared” upon deglycosylation with PNGase F (which remove the N-linked carbohydrates), generating a distinct band at 33 kDa (the expected mobility for β1). A band of the same mobility was generated upon deglycosylation of membranes from renal medulla (50 μg). The β1-subunit from both organs when deglycosylated displayed the same mobility as the β1-subunit synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). Furthermore, when variable amounts of membranes were deglycosylated, it could be ascertained that there was approximately 2-fold more N-glycosylated β1 in the renal medulla as compared with the distal colon. The observation that the β1-subunit was not immunoprecipitated from the distal colon using the anti-HKα2 antibodies can be explained if HKα2 were to undergo secondary modification in the distal colon which could render HKα2 inaccessible to the antibody. To test this possibility we performed two experiments. Increasing concentrations of distal colon membranes (from 0 to 2000 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HKα2 antibody. Membranes with bound antibody were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as a source of anti-HKα2 antibody to detect HKα2 by immunoblot in membranes prepared from distal colon. As expected, increasing concentrations of membranes decreased the intensity of the signal in the immunoblot, indicating that anti-HKα2 antibody interacted with the native HKα2 in the distal colon membranes (Fig.5). In contrast, when 2000 μg of renal cortex from control rats were incubated with anti-HKα2antibody, the intensity of the band in the immunoblot did not decrease. This finding is in agreement with previous observations from our laboratory indicating that the levels of HKα2 are either very low or absent from the renal cortex of normal rats (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar). Finally, when the antibody was incubated overnight with 2000 μg of membranes prepared from renal medulla of chronically hypokalemic rats (condition shown to enhance the expression of HKα2 in these membranes), there was a decrease in the intensity of the band on the immunoblot. This finding indicates that HKα2 is present in membranes from the renal medulla during hypokalemia but, as expected, in less abundance than in the distal colon (6Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 31Google Scholar). In the second experiment, distal colon plasma membranes (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HKα2 antibody. The pellet was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. The sample was separated on SDS-PAGE, and the presence of HKα2 was detected by immunoblot using the anti-HKα2 antibody. Fig.6 shows a band which comigrated with HKα2 from distal colon membranes (5 μg). The mixture of anti-HKα2 and anti-α1 antibodies recognized a “doublet” in the membranes from distal colon, whereas a band corresponding to the mobility of HKα2 was detected in the immunoprecipitated sample (data not shown). These findings verify that the immunoprecipitated α-subunit is not the α1-Na+,K+-ATPase. Taken together, the two experiments described above indicate that anti-HKα2 antibody does not discriminate between HKα2 from renal medulla and distal colon, and the differences in the β1-subunit detected in the immunoprecipitation shown in Fig. 3 reside in the β-subunit per se. Fig. 4 reveals that it was more difficult for the β1 monoclonal antibody to detect the glycosylated as opposed to the deglycosylated form of β1 in distal colon. To investigate the possibility that β1 might be associated with HKα2 in the distal colon, but could not be detected by Western analysis, we performed the following experiment. The anti-HKα2antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the HKα2/β complex from distal colon and renal medulla from rats after chronic dietary K+ depletion. The immunoprecipitated protein wasN-deglycosylated in the presence of PNGase F and applied to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The presence of β1-subunit was tested with the monoclonal antibody against β1. The results shown in Fig.7 demonstrate that the antibody detected β1 in the immunoprecipitate from renal medulla but not in the immunoprecipitate prepared from distal colon membranes. We have estimated, using recombinant HKα2 as a standard (16Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), that each milligram of membranes from renal medulla contains approximately 30 ng of native HKα2 (which would be predicted to associate with 10–12 ng of β1). By using recombinant β1 as standard, we detected that the total β1 immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of membranes from the renal medulla was approximately 10 ng. This finding suggests that in the renal medulla of the chronically hypokalemic rat, β1may represent the only β-subunit that associates with HKα2. Comparison of the quantities of HKα2present in membranes from both renal medulla and distal colon indicates that the distal colon contains 20-fold more HKα2 than the renal medulla. Nevertheless, β1 could not be detected in distal colon if deglycosylation was confined to conventionalN-deglycosylation. The previous observation that β1 did not immunoprecipitate with HKα2 in the distal colon could be interpreted as follows: (a) in the distal colon, the β1 associated with HKα2 is anO-linked carbohydrate; (b) in the distal colon, the β1 associated with the HKα2 is anN-linked carbohydrate, but the glycosylated protein is not accessible to PNGase F; or (c) the β1-subunit does not associate with HKα2 in the distal colon. As displayed in Fig. 8, the immunoprecipitated sample from the distal colon was deglycosylated with a mixture of enzymes to remove sialic acid, fucose, and O- and N-linked carbohydrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sample was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the presence of β1 was detected with anti-β1 monoclonal antibody. Fig. 8 shows that β1 was detected in the immunoprecipitated sample and, as in the renal medulla, displayed a mobility which was identical to the mobility of β1-Na+,K+-ATPase synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). To determine if the β1-Na+,K+-ATPase associated with HKα2 in the distal colon contained N- orO-linked carbohydrate, we performed the following experiment. The immunoprecipitated HKα2/β1 complex was deglycosylated with PNGase F or endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase to remove N- or O-linked carbohydrates, respectively. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with the monoclonal antibody against the β1-subunit. The results demonstrated that β1 was not detected (Fig.9, lanes 1 and 2). However, removal of the sialic acid and fucose with a mixture of neuraminidase and α-l-fucosidase generated a band that was recognized by the anti-β1-monoclonal antibody. This band displayed a mobility of 32 kDa (lane 3). Addition of endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase to the mixture of neuraminidase and α-l-fucosidase, to remove the O-linked carbohydrates (lane 4), did not alter the mobility of the β1-subunit recognized by the monoclonal antibody. However, addition of PNGase F to the mixture of neuraminidase and α-l-fucosidase (lane 5) rendered a β1-subunit with the same mobility of the β1-subunit synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown), and this band also displayed a mobility that was identical to the band generated from the renal medulla after PNGase F treatment. Our results clearly demonstrate that under physiological conditions HKα2 associates with β1-Na+,K+-ATPase in both organs, the renal medulla and the distal colon. The present study employed immunoprecipitation techniques to investigate the specificity of association of HKα2 with β-subunits in the kidney and in the distal colon. Specifically, two questions were explored as follows: does HKα2 associate with a β-subunit in tissues in which HKα2 protein is known to be expressed, and does HKα2 associate with the same β-subunit at these locations? Our data demonstrate that HKα2consistently co-precipitated with the β1-Na+,K+-ATPase subunit in the renal medulla and in the distal colon. The difference between both organs was in the complexity of the glycosylation, particularly in the distal colon, which necessitated complete deglycosylation removing sialic acid and/or fucose bound to the β1 to achieve deglycosylation by PNGase F. The highly complex pattern of glycosylation of the β1-subunit coimmunoprecipitated with HKα2in the distal colon was the most likely explanation for our inability to detect the β1-subunit from immunoprecipitated samples from distal colon prior to more complete deglycosylation (Fig. 3,right panel, lane 1). Lee and associates (3Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have expressed HKα2 in a baculovirus expression system in the absence of an exogenous β-subunit. These investigators reported a K+-ATPase that was resistant to ouabain and partially sensitive to Sch-28080. These data raised the possibility that, under certain conditions, HKα2 may be biologically active in the absence of a β-subunit. Our data from distal colon and renal medulla do not support this hypothesis, since β1 was consistently coimmunoprecipitated with HKα2 from both tissues. Both, β1-Na+,K+-ATPase (29Marxer A. Stieger B. Quaroni A. Kashgarian M. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and HKα2 (3Lee J. Rajendran V.M. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been localized to the apical membrane of distal colonocytes. Furthermore, our laboratory has demonstrated, using oocytes from X. laevis that β1 assembles stably with HKα2. The functionality of HKα2/β1 was substantiated by86Rb+(K+) uptake (5Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These data suggested that in the distal colon β1 could represent the β-subunit that associated with HKα2. The findings of the present study establish that β1 and HKα2 assemble stably and functionally in a plasma vesicle fraction from distal colon. More importantly, by establishing that the Na+,K+-ATPase interacts with HKα2in the renal medulla and in the distal colon, our data suggest additionally that a unique “colonic” β-subunit may not exist. Factors that regulate α1-Na+,K+-ATPase/β1and HKα2/β1 association in cells containing both HKα2 and α1-Na+,K+-ATPase remain to be defined. We thank Thomas A. Pressley (Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX) and Carlos H. Pedemonte (University of Houston, Houston) for carefully reading the manuscript and for their suggestions during the course of this study."

A cAMP-responsive sequence (CRS1) from bovine CYP17has previously been shown to be a binding site for Pbx1. A member of a second mammalian homeodomain family, Meis1, is now also demonstrated to be a CRS1-binding protein upon purification using CRS1 affinity chromatography. CRS1 binding complexes from Y1 adrenal cell nuclear extract contain both Pbx1 and Meis1. This is the first transcriptional regulatory element reported as a binding site for members of the Meis1 homeodomain family. Pbx1 and Meis1 bind cooperatively to CRS1, whereas neither protein can bind this element alone. Mutagenesis of the CRS1 element indicates a binding site for Meis1 adjacent to the Pbx site. All previously identified Pbx binding partners have Pbx interacting motifs that contain a tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the homeodomain that is required for cooperative binding to DNA with Pbx. Members of the Meis1 family contain one tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the homeodomain, but site-directed mutagenesis indicates that this residue is not required for cooperative CRS1 binding with Pbx. Thus, the Pbx-Meis1 interaction is unique among Pbx complexes. Meis1 also cooperatively binds CRS1 with the Pbx homologs extradenticle from Drosophila melanogaster and ceh-20 from Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that this interaction is evolutionarily conserved. Thus, CYP17CRS1 is a transcriptional regulatory element containing both Pbx and Meis1 binding sites, which permit these two homeodomain proteins to bind and potentially regulate cAMP-dependent transcription through this sequence.

Homeobox genes encode proteins that contain a conserved 60-amino acid DNA binding domain, the homeodomain, and function as transcriptional regulators (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W.

One specific class of homeobox genes is the PBC class, which includes five related genes (3Burglin T.R. Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes.

Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by these genes contain highly conserved atypical 63-amino acid homeodomains belonging to a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) superclass (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), as well as regions of identity amino-terminal to the homeodomain (3Burglin T.R. Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 25-71Google Scholar). The functional role of the ceh-20 protein is not known. However, in Drosophila, genetic studies have demonstrated that exd is required for normal development, and based on these studies, exd was proposed to function in parallel with genes of the homeotic complex (5Rauskolb C. Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,9Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The homeotic complex contains a clustered set of evolutionarily conserved homeobox genes involved in segmental identity in the developing embryo, and these genes are referred to as the HOM complex in Drosophila or the Hoxcomplex in mammals (10Akam M. Cell. 1989; 57: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). exd in collaboration with specific HOM genes is required for expression of specific endogenous and transgenic reporter genes in the Drosophilaembryo (12Chan S.K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A biochemical basis for this activity is that although the protein exd binds DNA weakly by itself and many of the HOM proteins also bind DNA with low affinity and specificity, exd and HOM proteins interact to cooperatively bind DNA (12Chan S.K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 603-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14van Dijk M.A. Murre C. Cell. 1994; 78: 617-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, exd cooperatively binds DNA with engrailed, a homeodomain protein that is not encoded by a HOM gene (14van Dijk M.A. Murre C. Cell. 1994; 78: 617-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, a proposed role for exd action is that it serves to provide specificity of binding and increased affinity for DNA to other homeodomain proteins (15Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Pbx1 was first identified as a site of t(1;19) chromosomal translocation leading to the production of an E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein in a subset of pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (16Nourse J.

Although multiple Hox proteins and engrailed interact with Pbx to cooperatively bind artificially selected DNA sites in vitro, only three transcriptional regulatory elements have been reported to be binding sites for Pbx. The rhombomere 4 regulatory region from the mouseHoxb-1 gene contains three sites required for enhancer activity, two of which are bound by Pbx1 and Hoxb-1 in vitro(28Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The element TSEII regulates expression of the somatostatin gene and is cooperatively bound by Pbx and the homeodomain protein STF-1 (29Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The third regulatory binding site for Pbx1, and the first such site discovered, is a cAMP-responsive sequence (CRS1) from the bovineCYP17 gene (30Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kagawa N. Ogo A. Takahashi Y. Iwamatsu A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18716-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP17, which encodes 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P-450 required for cortisol and androgen biosynthesis, is expressed in adrenal glands and gonads and is transcriptionally regulated by cAMP (32John M.E. John M.C. Boggaram V. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4715-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Pbx1a and Pbx1b were purified as CRS1-binding proteins and demonstrated by overexpression studies to enhance the cAMP transcriptional response conferred through this element (31Kagawa N. Ogo A.

Biophys. 1997; 338: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We now report the copurification of a member of another homeodomain family, Meis1, by CRS1 affinity chromatography. The first identified member of the Meis1 homeobox gene family is also referred to as Meis1, and this locus was originally identified as a site of retroviral integration associated with development of myeloid leukemia in BXH-2 mice (34Moskow J.J. Bullrich F. Huebner K. Daar I.O. Buchberg A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5434-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The other two mammalian members of the Meis1 family areMeis1-related gene 1 (Mrg1) and Meis1-related gene 2 (Mrg2), and the proteins encoded by these genes contain atypical 63-amino acid homeodomains also belonging to the TALE superclass (35Steelman S.

Copeland N.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2235-2242PubMed Google Scholar). CRS1 is the first regulatory element identified as a binding site for a member of the Meis1 family. Both Pbx1 and Meis1 are components of CRS1 binding complexes from mouse adrenal cell Y1 nuclear extract. Furthermore, Meis1 is demonstrated to cooperatively bind CRS1 with Pbx1 as well as with the Pbx homologs exd and ceh-20. Mutagenesis of the CRS1 element identifies a Meis1 binding site adjacent to a Pbx binding site. The cooperative DNA binding between Pbx1 and Meis1 does not require a tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the Meis1 homeodomain. This study therefore reveals that members of the Meis1 family are Pbx binding partners on CRS1, of which the interactions with Pbx are distinct from all previously reported binding partners. Purification of nuclear proteins from Y1 mouse adrenal cells by CRS1 affinity chromatography and peptide sequencing was described previously (31Kagawa N. Ogo A. Takahashi Y. Iwamatsu A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18716-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Pbx1a and Pbx1b cDNAs were subcloned in pBK-RSV (Stratagene) (31Kagawa N. Ogo A. Takahashi Y. Iwamatsu A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18716-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Pbx1 cDNAs were used for these studies, but human and mouse Pbx1b proteins are identical (17Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X.H. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1993; 74: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) was kindly received from Cordelia Rauskolb and Eric Weischaus. Lambdaphage SHLX2 containing ceh-20 insert was kindly received from Lucinda Fulton, and this phage was originally obtained from the C. eleganscDNA library produced by Chris Martin (4Waterston R. Martin C. Craxton M. Huynh C. Coulson A. Hillier L. Durbin R. Green P. Shownkeen R. Halloran N. Metzstein M. Hawkins T. Wilson R. Berks M. Du Z. Thomas K. Thierry-Mieg J. Sulston J. Nat.

The phage was converted to plasmid using recombination between lox sites flanking the insert, and the ceh-20 cDNA was then subcloned into pBK-RSV using aSacI site at the 5′ end and a HindIII site at the 3′ end. Proteins were produced using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications using either T7 or T3 polymerase. Proteins were produced simultaneously both in the presence and absence of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). Proteins translated in the presence of [35S]methionine were analyzed following 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Y1 nuclear extract was prepared essentially as described (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Wild type CRS1 oligos used for EMSA contained the following sequence from bovine CYP17 (CYP17sequence in uppercase letters, flanking restriction sites in lowercase letters): 5′-cGAGACGTTGATGGACAGTGAGCAAGg-3′ and the complementary oligo 5′-tcgacCTTGCTCACTGTCCATCAACGTCTCgagct-3′. The three mutant CRS1 oligonucleotides comprised the following (mutant bases underlined): mutant A, 5′-GAGACGTTGCGGGACAGTGAGCAAG-3′; mutant B, 5′-GAGACGTTGATGCTCAGTGAGCAAG-3′; and mutant C, 5′-GAGACGTTGATGGAGCGTGAGCAAG-3′. Complementary matching oligos were synthesized, and mutant oligos contained similar flanking sites as wild type oligo. Oligos were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using [γ32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). For EMSA using reticulocyte lysate, a total of 2 μl of lysate was mixed on ice with 10,000 cpm end-labeled CRS1 in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll (molecular weight, 400,000), 2% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 2 μg of tRNA. After mixing, reactions were electrophoresed on a prerun 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE (1× TBE = 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA), 0.5% Ficoll gel at 250 volts (38Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11299-11305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager. For EMSA with nuclear extract, 2 μg of nuclear extract was used, with conditions similar to those for lysate reactions except that 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 10 μg of tRNA were used. For supershift experiments, antibodies were added just before labeled oligonucleotides. Mutagenesis of codon 213 from tgg to gcg was accomplished by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Complimentary oligos used for production of the mutant codon were as follows (mutated bases are underlined): 5′-CTGACCAGCCCTCTGCGAATAGAGACCATG-3′ and 5′-CATGGTCTCTATTCGCAGAGGGCTGGTCAG-3′. Meis1 cDNA was amplified with mutant oligos using native Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). An ApaI fragment containing the mutation was excised and subcloned back into wild type Meis1a cDNA, from which the wild type ApaI fragment had been removed. This eliminated the possibility of errors in other regions of the cDNA or plasmid. The ApaI fragment obtained by mutagenesis was completely sequenced to confirm that the only mutation in this fragment was at codon 213. The complete coding sequence of human Pbx1b was subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for production of glutathioneS-transferase-Pbx1b fusion protein. GlutathioneS-transferase-Pbx1b was produced in Escherichia coli strain JM109, and expression of the fusion protein was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. GlutathioneS-transferase-Pbx1b was purified using glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 600 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-Pbx1b was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and used for injection into a rabbit. The rabbit was boosted with the same amount of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The IgG fraction of the Pbx immunoreactive serum was purified from a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the production of the Meis1 antibody, a peptide corresponding to the first 16 amino acids of this protein was synthesized by MacroMolecular Resources. This peptide was used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. This antibody is specific for Meis1a and Meis1b. 2S. Steelman, unpublished observations. During previous studies to determine the mechanism by which CRS1 from bovine CYP17 activates transcription in a cAMP-dependent manner, four CRS1-binding proteins from mouse adrenal Y1 cells were purified by CRS1 DNA affinity chromatography, and peptide sequences were obtained from each (31Kagawa N. Ogo A. Takahashi Y. Iwamatsu A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18716-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of one of the purified proteins was approximately 43 kDa, two proteins were in the range of 53 kDa, and one protein was 60 kDa. Based on peptide sequence, the 43-kDa protein and one of the 53-kDa proteins were determined to be the homeodomain proteins Pbx1b and Pbx1a, respectively, which are produced by differential splicing of Pbx1 mRNA (31Kagawa N. Ogo A. Takahashi Y. Iwamatsu A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18716-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the 60-kDa protein is being investigated. The sequence for one peptide was obtained from the second 53-kDa protein. This sequence matches an amino acid stretch contained within the Meis1 homeodomain family (Fig.1 A). The three mammalian members of the Meis1 gene family are Meis1,Mrg1, and Mrg2 (34Moskow J.J. Bullrich F. Huebner K. Daar I.O. Buchberg A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5434-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35Steelman S. Moskow J.J. Muzynski K. North C. Druck T. Montgomery J.C. Huebner K. Daar I.O. Buchberg A.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2235-2242PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the sequence data, this peptide most closely matches amino acids 182–192 of Mrg1 (Fig. 1 A), but the specific isoform that was purified cannot be determined unambiguously from this one peptide. To further test whether a member of the Meis1 family can bind CRS1, the EMSA was tested with Y1 nuclear extract. An antibody specific for the amino terminus of Meis1 was used to determine whether Meis1 binds CRS1. There are two isoforms of Meis1 produced by the Meis1 gene due to differential splicing of the mRNA (34Moskow J.J. Bullrich F. Huebner K. Daar I.O. Buchberg A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5434-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These proteins, referred to as Meis1a and Meis1b, differ in their carboxyl termini, and therefore, the Meis1 antibody will recognize both isoforms. Two CRS1 binding complexes are formed within Y1 nuclear extract as revealed by EMSA (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) (30Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither preimmune IgG nor serum affected these CRS1 binding complexes (Fig. 1 B, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 4). Anti-Pbx IgG reduced the intensity of the CRS1 complexes and produced a supershift (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Anti-Meis1 serum produced a supershift complex although it did not greatly reduce the overall intensity of the two CRS1 complexes (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). One possible reason for the minimal effect of Meis1 antiserum on CRS1 binding may be the presence of other isoforms of this family, such as Mrg1 and Mrg2, contained within this complex, that would not react with this specific antibody. This experiment confirms that Meis1 is a CRS1-binding protein contained within Y1 nuclear extract. Because CRS1 binding complexes from Y1 nuclear extract contain both Pbx1 and Meis1, in vitro translated Meis1 was used to test whether this protein could bind CRS1 either individually or by interacting with Pbx1. Pbx1 has previously been demonstrated not to bind DNA as a monomer or homodimer to other DNA sequences (18van Dijk M.A. Peltenburg L.T. Murre C. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Lu Q. Knoepfler P.S. Scheele J. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and likewise, Pbx1 alone does not bind CRS1 in vitro. 3Y. Takahashi, unpublished observations. The proteins encoded by the two mRNA splicing variants of Pbx1, Pbx1a and Pbx1b, as well as the two proteins encoded by the mRNA splicing variants of Meis1, Meis1a and Meis1b, were used to analyze CRS1 binding. These proteins were translated in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate and predominately full-length proteins were produced for both isoforms of Pbx1 and Meis1 (Fig.2 A). Binding to CRS1 was examined using EMSA (Fig. 2 B). Neither of the Pbx1 isoforms and neither of the Meis1 isoforms could bind CRS1 alone (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). However, when either Pbx1 isoform was incubated with either Meis1 isoform, unique complexes formed that bound CRS1 (Fig.2 B, lanes 6–9). These complexes migrated corresponding to the size of the Pbx1 and Meis1 isoforms included in each reaction, which indicates that the complexes contained both Pbx1 and Meis1 isoforms. Specifically, Pbx1a and Meis1b, the largest isoforms, produced the slowest migrating CRS1 complex. Likewise, Pbx1b and Meis1a, the smallest isoforms, produced the fastest migrating CRS1 complex. The other two combinations of isoforms produced complexes of intermediate migration. In addition, an isoform of both Pbx1 and Meis1 are required for cooperative binding because neither a mixture of Pbx1 isoforms nor a mixture of Meis1 isoforms could interact to bind CRS1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10 and 11). Antibodies against Pbx1 and Meis1 were used to further confirm the presence of these proteins in the complex. The formation of the CRS1 binding complex in the presence of Pbx1b and Meis1a was not affected by the addition of preimmune IgG (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). However, the addition of anti-Pbx IgG reduced formation of the CRS1 binding complex (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). A faint supershift was seen, and in addition, the anti-Pbx IgG disrupted binding so that much less complex was formed. Because this is a polyclonal antibody, the loss of complex formation could be due to disruption of the Pbx1 and Meis1 interaction, to that of Pbx1 and CRS1, or both. The Meis1 antibody also disrupted formation of the complex formed by Pbx1 and Meis1 and produced a supershift complex. Therefore, the use of these antibodies demonstrates that both Pbx1 and Meis1 are binding CRS1 together in a complex. Mutant CRS1 binding sites were designed to compare binding requirements by in vitro translated Pbx1b and Meis1a to Y1 nuclear proteins. Three CRS1 mutants were designed that each had two base pair changes (Fig.3). Mutant A contained this mutation within a region of CRS1 (5′-TTGAT-3′) that corresponds to a polymerase chain reaction identified high affinity Pbx binding site (39Lu Q. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3938-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40van Dijk M.A. Voorhoeve P.M. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6061-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this mutation within CRS1 has been demonstrated to eliminate binding of nuclear proteins to this element (33Ogo A. Waterman M.R. Kagawa N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A CRS1 mutant 3′ to this Pbx binding site has also previously been demonstrated to show greatly reduced binding in Y1 nuclear extract (33Ogo A. Waterman M.R. Kagawa N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and based on Pbx and Hox DNA binding models (24Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 41Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 42Chan S.K. Mann R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the proposed Meis1 binding site would be adjacent to the Pbx site on the 3′ side. Therefore, CRS1 mutants B and C were designed in the predicted Meis1 binding site. Binding to the wild type and mutant CRS1 oligonucleotides was analyzed by EMSA (Fig.3). In Y1 nuclear extract, binding to mutant A was undetectable (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 2). Binding to mutants B and C was greatly decreased compared with wild type but detectable with prolonged exposure of reactions (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Nonspecific binding by lysate was not affected by the mutant oligonucleotides (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). Also, binding of either Pbx1b or Meis1a individually to the wild type or mutant CRS1 sites was not detectable (Fig. 2 A and data not shown).In vitro-translated Pbx1b and Meis1a incubated together exhibited greatly decreased but detectable binding to all the CRS1 mutants compared with the wild type (Fig. 3, lanes 9–12). This experiment indicates that bases within CRS1 that decrease binding by Pbx and Meis1 also decrease binding of endogenous Y1 nuclear proteins. This evidence further corroborates Meis1 proteins as CRS1 binding partners of Pbx1 within Y1 cells. In addition, it identifies a putative Meis1 binding site within CRS1, because the mutants B and C are outside of the Pbx binding site. All previously characterized binding partners of Pbx have a tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the homeodomain that is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx. There are three classes of tryptophan-containing motifs found in these interacting proteins. Most of the homeotic genes, as well as STF-1, contain a hexapeptide motif (consensus, IYPWMK) (3Burglin T.R. Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 25-71Google Scholar) that includes a tryptophan required for Pbx cooperative DNA binding (22Knoepfler P.S. Kamps"
https://openalex.org/W2031983637,"The calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domain is a common motif found in extracellular proteins. A mutation that changes a highly conserved Gly residue to Ser in this domain has been identified both in the factor IX (FIX) and fibrillin-1 genes, where it is associated with relatively mild variants of hemophilia B and Marfan syndrome, respectively. We have investigated the structural consequences in vitro of this amino acid change when introduced into single cbEGF domains from human FIX (G60S) and human fibrillin-1 (G1127S), and a covalently linked pair of cbEGF domains from fibrillin-1. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis, mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR analysis demonstrate that wild-type cbEGF domains purified in the reduced form and refolded in vitro adopt the native fold. In contrast, the Gly → Ser change causes defective folding of FIX and fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains. However, in the case of the factor IX mutant domain, a Ca2+-dependent change in conformation, identified by NMR in a proportion of the refolded material, suggests that some material refolds to a native-like structure. This is consistent with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of FIX G60S from a hemophilia B patient Oxford d2, which demonstrates that the mutant protein is partially recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for this region of FIX. NMR analysis of a covalently linked pair of fibrillin cbEGF domains demonstrates that the C-terminal domain adopts the native epidermal growth factor fold, despite the fact that the adjacent mutant domain is misfolded.

Of all the missense mutations identified so far in cbEGF domains, one of the most interesting changes a highly conserved Gly residue to a Ser. This has been identified in the human FIX gene (G60S, over 50 reported cases) and is associated with mild hemophilia B (12Denton P.H. Fowlkes D.M. Lord S.L. Reisner H.M. Blood. 1988; 72: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and also in the human fibrillin-1 gene (G1127S), where it predisposes to ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection in later life (13Franke U.

From our structural knowledge of cbEGF domains, one would predict that this mutation might cause defective folding, since the conserved Gly is located in a turn at the end of a two stranded antiparallel β sheet (see Fig. 1), the main secondary structure feature of this type of domain (5Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 6Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D.

This study investigates the structural consequences of these Gly → Ser amino acid changes introduced into single cbEGF domains from factor IX and fibrillin-1, and into a covalently linked pair of cbEGF domains (cbEGF domains 13 and 14) from fibrillin-1. We demonstrate in vitrothat a Gly → Ser change does result in defective folding when introduced into single cbEGF domains from FIX and fibrillin-1, but in the case of FIX mutant cbEGF domain, a proportion of this material has a calcium-dependent conformation, similar to the wild-type domain. We show that this is consistent with the in vivosituation since plasma FIX from the hemophilia B patient Oxford d2 (14Winship P.R. Dragon A.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 77: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), containing the G60S change, shows significant reactivity toward a FIX monoclonal antibody specific for this region of FIX (12Denton P.H. Fowlkes D.M. Lord S.L. Reisner H.M. Blood. 1988; 72: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the Gly → Ser mutation is introduced into a covalently linked pair of fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains, the C-terminal domain adopts the native fold, despite the fact that the adjacent mutant domain is misfolded. The possible consequences of these results for the expression of mutant proteins with Gly → Ser amino acid changes in cbEGF domains are discussed. Two peptides (residues 1112–1154 of human fibrillin-1) were synthesized by use of conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer. One peptide corresponded to the 13th cbEGF domain, and the second contained a G1127S amino acid change. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of 87.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% water, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol, 2.5% thioanisole, and 2.5% ethylmethylsulfide (4 ml/100 mg of resin) for 3 h in a sonicating water bath. Resin was removed by filtration, and peptides precipitated with tertiary butyl methyl ether. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether, dissolved in 10% acetonitrile, and lyophilized. Each synthetic peptide was reduced by incubation for 2 h in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA. The solution was acidified to pH 3 with HCl and the reduced peptides purified by reverse phase HPLC (4Mayhew M. Handford P. Baron M. Tse A.G. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) prior to refolding. The peptides were refolded using an oxido- shuffling system (15Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 208-209Google Scholar) for 20 h at room temperature in a solution containing 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm CaCl2, 3 mml-cysteine, 0.3 mml-cystine at a concentration of <0.5 mg of peptide/ml. The reaction was stopped by adjusting to pH 3 and the products analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. The refolded wild-type peptide was purified by HPLC and lyophilized. DNA encoding the cbEGF domain from human factor IX (residues 46–84) was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from a hemophiliac patient (Oxford d2) with a mutation causing a G60S change (3Handford P.A.

This fragment was cloned into pMB54 in frame with the yeast α-factor leader sequence and sequenced prior to transfer into pMA91. Transformation of yeast and harvesting of secreted protein was as described previously (16Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Following batch adsorption of secreted protein to reverse-phase C18 particles and elution with 50% acetonitrile/H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, protein was lyophilized. This was then reduced for 2 h in 0.1 mDTT, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to HPLC purification (4Mayhew M. Handford P. Baron M. Tse A.G. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified reduced protein was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry and refolded as described above. Refolding experiments were also conducted in the absence of Ca2+ by the inclusion of 10 mm EDTA in the refolding mix. A DNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 3467–3721 of human fibrillin-1 cDNA and corresponding to amino acids 1112–1196 (numbering according to Ref. 17Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R.

DNA encoding the wild-type sequence of the 13th and 14th cbEGF domain pair (residues 1112–1196) and also a mutant containing a G1127S amino acid change was amplified by the use of a forward primer containing the following mixed sequence: 5′-TAGTAGGGATCCATAGAAGGACGATCAGCAATGGATATTGATGAGTGTCAGAGAGATCCTCTCCTATGCCGAGGT(AG)GTGTTTGCCAT-3′ and a reverse primer: 5′- TAGTAGAAGCTTCTATTAAACACAAAATAGCCTATCGGGAGT-3′. Each of these primers contained a restriction site (BamHI, forward primer;HindIII, reverse primer) at the 5′ end for cloning purposes. The forward primer also contained a sequence encoding a factor Xa cleavage site, followed by a spacer sequence encoding serine and alanine to facilitate cleavage. After digestion the amplified DNA was ligated into BamHI/HindIII-cleaved pQE-30 (Qiagen). Plasmid pQE-30 contains a sequence encoding a 6-histidine affinity tag, which is located upstream of the cloned fragment. The DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli NM554 (18Raleigh E.A. Murray N.E. Revel H. Blumenthal R.M. Westaway D. Reith A.D. Rigby P.W.J. Rigby Elhai J. Hanahan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) containing a lac repressor plasmid (pREP4, Qiagen). Positive clones were sequenced in an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to determine whether they contained the wild-type or the G1127S mutant sequence, and one of each was selected for protein expression. Growth of recombinant clones, induction, and purification of expressed proteins were as described previously (19Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The protein containing fractions determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were pooled, adjusted to 0.1 m DTT and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, reduced for 1–2 h at room temperature, and dialyzed against 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The reduced proteins were purified by reverse phase HPLC (4Mayhew M. Handford P. Baron M. Tse A.G. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), lyophilized, and refolded as described for the single domains. The refolded protein was lyophilized to concentrate the sample, digested with bovine factor Xa (DENZYME Aps, Aarhus, Denmark) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 20 h at a ratio of 1:1000 enzyme to protein to remove the 6xHis affinity tag, and the cleaved protein purified by reverse phase HPLC. The identity of the purified products was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Mutant peptides purified from the refolding mixture were assayed for free thiols with DTNB (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). Plasma from a hemophilia B patient Oxford d2 (14Winship P.R. Dragon A.C. Br. J.

Fowlkes D.M. Lord S.L. Reisner H.M. Blood. 1988; 72: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ELISA assays were performed as described in Ref. 22Handford P.A. Winship P.R. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Pooled normal human plasma used as a standard was assumed to have a FIX concentration of 5 μg/ml. All NMR spectra were acquired on home-built/GE Omega spectrometers at 500 or 600 MHz. All samples used for titrations contained 150 mm NaCl to approximate physiological ionic strength (I = 0.15) and 5 mm Tris buffer unless otherwise specified. Calcium titrations were performed as described previously (19Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Handford P.

Calcium-dependent shifts of the mutant FIX cbEGF domain were assessed in a series of one-dimensional spectra recorded on a deuterated sample (≤200 μm) at pH 7.4 and T = 30 °C. The fibrillin cbEGF 13 titration was performed using a deuterated 714 μm sample at pH 6.5 and T = 33 °C. One-dimensional spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 8000 Hz and a block size of 4096 complex points. These data were zero-filled to 8192 points, yielding a digital resolution of 0.98 Hz/point. A series of two-dimensional NOESY spectra were acquired for measurement of calcium binding to the fibrillin cbEGF 13–14 pair, as described previously (19Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2048 complex points were acquired in F2with a spectral width of 7017.54 Hz. These data were zero filled to 8K to yield a digital resolution of 0.86 Hz/point. The sample used in this titration was of 142 μm concentration, and the titration was performed at pH 6.5 and T = 33 °C. Measurement of the Tyr-1136 Hδ*-Hε* cross-peak position was complicated by overlap of this peak at data points 2–4 with an unassigned cross-peak, and by overlap of this peak with the diagonal for the final points of the titration (see Fig. 8). An attempt was made to perform this titration on a deuterated sample using one-dimensional NMR; however, the Hδ* resonance was not well enough resolved to permit determination of the Kd from these data. Calcium-dependent shift of Tyr-1178 in the mutant fibrillin cbEGF domain pair were assessed analogously at pH 6.5 and T = 33 °C in two-dimensional spectra. One-dimensional spectra of HPLC peaks 1 and 2 (see “Results”) of mutant fibrillin cbEGF 13 were recorded on samples containing 1.77 mg and 3.21 mg of protein, respectively, with no added NaCl to maximize signal to noise. NOESY spectra of the mutant and wild-type fibrillin cbEGF 13–14 pair shown in Fig. 5 were acquired on 1.59 mmand 1.69 mm samples, respectively, at T = 30 °C, pH 6.5, and in the absence of added NaCl. The location and sequences of cbEGF domain peptides from human factor IX and human fibrillin-1 analyzed in this study are shown in Figs. 2 and3. The position of the Gly residue mutated in each cbEGF domain is indicated. A variety of methods (yeast expression, E. coli expression, and peptide synthesis) were used to produce the primary sequence of each peptide (see TableI). In each case, the reduced form of the cbEGF peptide was purified to homogeneity by HPLC and then refolded in vitro using an oxido-shuffling system. The purified reduced peptides each gave a single peak, by reverse phase HPLC, which was of the expected mass (Table I). Refolding of each single cbEGF domain resulted in a reduction of mass of 5–7 daltons consistent (within experimental error) with the formation of three disulfide bonds. Refolding of the wild-type form of fibrillin cbEGF13 produced an HPLC profile similar to that obtained previously for the wild-type form of the FIX cbEGF domain (4Mayhew M. Handford P. Baron M. Tse A.G. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in that the refolded material gave a single peak by reverse phase HPLC, which eluted earlier than the reduced form of the peptide (Fig. 4,A and B).Figure 3Sequences of the FIX cbEGF domain (A), fibrillin cbEGF 13 (B), and the fibrillin cbEGF 13–14 pair (C), highlighting the position of the G60S and G1127S amino acid changes as well as the tyrosine residues (*) used in NMR analyses of calcium binding.

No free thiols (assayed by DTNB analysis, see “Experimental Procedures”) were detected in the single mutant domains. These data are consistent with the formation of misfolded monomeric peptide species. Two of the peaks identified in the chromatogram of refolded mutant fibrillin cbEGF 13 were collected for NMR analysis (see Fig. 4 D, arrows). All of the above refolding reactions were performed in the presence of Ca2+ (see “Experimental Procedures”), since this resulted in an increased yield of wild-type fibrillin cbEGF13 peptide with the native conformation (see below). In addition, Ca2+enhanced the yield of one peak in the chromatogram of mutant FIX cbEGF domain (see Fig. 4 C, arrow), which was subsequently analyzed using NMR. In contrast to the results of single cbEGF domains, HPLC analysis of wild-type and mutant fibrillin cbEGF domain pairs showed no difference in elution profiles of wild-type versus mutant refolded peptide. Both refolded in the presence of Ca2+ to give one major species (data not shown). No free thiols were detected in the refolded mutant cbEGF pair. Analysis of Oxford d2 plasma showed a total circulating FIX antigen of ∼1.3 μg/ml (mean of three experiments, individual values 1.27, 1.4, and 1.25 μg/ml) measured by H9 ELISA. This corresponds to 26% of pooled normal plasma. This is in agreement with the antigen level (28%) previously recorded for this patient (14Winship P.R. Dragon A.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 77: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using 2D5, which recognizes a functionally significant epitope between residues 50–96 of human factor IX, 0.4 μg/ml (mean of three experiments; individual values 0.4, 0.42, and 0.37 μg/ml) were detected. The 2D5/H9 ratio was ∼0.3. This demonstrates that factor IX Oxford d2 has significant native-like conformation, although from these experiments we cannot distinguish between 30% of mutant protein recognizing 2D5 with native affinity and 100% of mutant protein having a reduced affinity for 2D5. All wild-type constructs gave spectra consistent with folded species. In contrast to wild-type fibrillin cbEGF 13, one-dimensional spectra acquired for HPLC peaks 1 and 2 of the mutant form of fibrillin cbEGF 13 (see Fig. 4 D) were broad with poor dispersion of amide resonances, no upfield shifted methyl resonances, and no downfield shifted CαH resonances (which are characteristic of β-sheet secondary structure). The data are consistent with a heterogeneous sample, with no major component containing native-like structure. It is possible, however, that one or both of these samples contained a minor fraction of correctly folded material that was not of sufficient concentration to be observable in the spectra. A comparison of two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the wild-type and mutant containing fibrillin cbEGF 13–14 pairs is shown in Fig.5. Superposition of these spectra reveals that a subset of the peaks in the spectrum of the wild-type pair is present in the spectrum of the mutant. The position of the Tyr-1178 Hδ*-Hε* resonance is virtually identical in the two spectra, while the cross-peak corresponding to Tyr-1136 is absent in the spectrum of the mutant. These data indicate that domain 14 is correctly folded, and domain 13 is not. Correct folding of domain 14 of the mutant cbEGF pair was confirmed by observation of calcium-dependent chemical shift of the Tyr-1178 cross-peak (see below). The absence of peaks corresponding to domain 13 in the mutant cbEGF pair spectrum implies that a range of misfolded conformers of this domain exist in solution. The absence of free thiols in the sample of the mutant pair and mass spectrometric analysis show that misfolding is confined to domain 13, and no higher molecular weight disulfide cross-linked products were present in the NMR sample. To confirm correct folding of a proportion of refolded mutant FIX cbEGF domain and of domain 14 in the mutant fibrillin cbEGF pair, calcium-dependent shifts were observed in one- and two-dimensional spectra, respectively. Analysis of the well resolved Ca2+-dependent peak present in the chromatogram of mutant FIX cbEGF domain (Fig.4 C, arrow) by one-dimensional NMR identified features of a folded protein, including Ca2+-dependent chemical shifts in the aromatic region of the spectrum (Fig.6 D). This suggests that the mutant domain can adopt a calcium-dependent conformation, similar to the wild-type domain (3Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). No calcium-dependent chemical shifts were identified in spectra recorded for the other HPLC peaks derived from refolding mutant FIX cbEGF domain (Fig. 6, A–C). In addition, no calcium-dependent shifts were observed for HPLC peaks 1 and 2 of mutant fibrillin cbEGF 13, in agreement with the conclusion that neither of these samples contained a significant fraction of material with the wild-type fold. Chemical shift of conserved aromatic residues as a function of calcium concentration were used to derive dissociation constants for wild-type fibrillin cbEGF 13 and the cbEGF 13–14 pair (Fig.7). Both values are consistent with those measured in similar fibrillin cbEGF domain constructs (19Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Wild-type fibrillin cbEGF 13 had a dissociation constant of ∼2–3 mm. The affinity of the calcium binding site in the C-terminal domain (≤100 μm) of the cbEGF 13–14 pair measured at least an order of magnitude higher than the site in the N-terminal domain (∼3 mm). Fig.8 shows the aromatic region of the spectrum of the cbEGF 13–14 pair at zero and at saturating calcium concentrations. The Kd of domain 14 is at the limit of the range of calcium dissociation constants that can be measured by NMR. Domain 14 of the mutant fibrillin cbEGF 13–14 pair showed calcium-dependent changes in chemical shift consistent with this domain having wild-type calcium affinity (data not shown), despite the fact that the adjacent domain was misfolded. Our previous studies on cbEGF domains have demonstrated their ability to fold in vitro (either as single or pairs of domains) into their native conformation. We have utilized1H NMR techniques to assay characteristic structural features of the cbEGF domain, which include β-sheet formation and calcium binding. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a Gly → Ser amino acid change that, because of its strategic position in the cbEGF domain (see Fig. 1), was predicted to cause misfolding. HPLC and NMR data for the wild-type and mutant cbEGF domain constructs from fibrillin and factor IX demonstrated that this type of amino acid change is associated with a variable degree of misfolding in vitro, which is dependent on the exact sequence of the cbEGF domain. It is difficult to determine accurately the fraction of native-like fold associated with each of the intact proteins in vivo, particularly since fibrillin, a structural component of extracellular microfibrils, is not easily assayed. However, we can consider the structural basis for the misfolding. When the Gly → Ser mutation is introduced by molecular modelling into either the FIX or the fibrillin wild-type domain, a steric clash is observed between the serine side chain and the consensus disulfide bond connecting cysteines 5 and 6. Hence, one could speculate that a Gly → Ser change could interfere with the folding pathway associated with formation of this disulfide bond. Despite there being a clear structural basis for misfolding when the Gly → Ser amino acid change is present in cbEGF domains, this change is associated with relatively mild disease. In FIX this mutation has been identified in over 50 hemophiliac patients (see Ref. 7Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.-C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, and references therein), all of which have reduced circulating FIX antigen and reduced clotting activity, but relatively high specific activity. This activity is all derived from the mutant form of FIX, since hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive disease. We hypothesized from these data that although the mutation might be predicted to cause domain misfolding, a proportion of this domain must be able to adopt a near wild-type conformation to account for the relatively high specific activity of the circulating FIX in patients with the Gly → Ser change.This is supported by our in vitro study, where a proportion of refolded mutant factor IX cbEGF domain was found to contain calcium-dependent resonances, a structural feature of native cbEGF domains. In addition, ELISA analysis of FIX Oxford d2 showed that the reduced circulating FIX antigen in this patient was reactive toward the FIX monoclonal antibody 2D5, which recognizes an epitope in the region of FIX encompassing the cbEGF domain. This suggests structural similarity between the mutant and wild-type forms of FIX in the vicinity of the Gly → Ser change. It is interesting to note that a comparison (performed by one laboratory) of specific activities of mutant FIXs from different patients with the G60S change showed a range of specific activities from 0.24 to 0.6 (24Ketterling R.P. Bottema C.D.K. Phillips J.A. Sommer S.S. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that the proportion of native-like FIX that circulates in the blood stream varies from individual to individual. This may reflect variability in the folding pathway of mutant proteins, selective removal of misfolded forms from the secretory pathway, and/or an increased susceptibility of the secreted protein to proteolysis in different patients. Human fibrillin-1 is an important structural component of connective tissue microfibrils (25Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 26Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has a striking domain organization which includes 43 cbEGF domains (Fig. 2). Defects in this protein result in a spectrum of connective tissue disorders, which range from Marfan syndrome, Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, and ectopia lentis to familial ascending aortic aneurysm (27Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The inheritance of fibrillin disorders is autosomal dominant and therefore, unlike in hemophilia B, both mutant and wild-type forms of the protein may be expressed. An investigation into the effects of the G1127S change on fibrillin cbEGF 13 and fibrillin cbEGF 13 and 14 showed that the mutation caused misfolding and these effects were confined to domain 13. Misfolding of one cbEGF domain thus does not inhibit folding of the adjacent domain in vitro. This emphasizes the ability of the cbEGF domain to fold independently. The possible consequences of these results for expression of the phenotype associated with the G1127S change are (i) that, although not detected in vitro, a proportion of correctly folded cbEGF domain harboring the mutation is formed in vivo (its formation facilitated by sequential and cotranslational folding in eukaryotic cells and the presence of chaperones) and is secreted by the cell. It is then incorporated into the microfibril, together with wild-type protein where it produces a relatively mild effect, (ii) since the effect of the G1127S change on folding appears to be “self-contained” within a cbEGF domain, and does not interfere with the folding or calcium binding properties of the adjacent cbEGF domain in vitro, a proportion of the misfolded material may be secreted from the cell and assembled into the microfibril. These two possibilities (which are not mutually exclusive) are consistent with the analysis of a fibroblast cell line obtained from a patient with the G1127S change, which showed normal synthesis of total fibrillin, but reduced deposition in the matrix (13Franke U.

Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.7) is a novel type of flavoprotein oxidase that was first isolated from Penicillium simplicissimum CBS 170.90 grown on veratryl alcohol (1De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H.

In addition to the conversion of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin (Equation 1), the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of a wide range of phenolic compounds bearing side chains of variable size at the para-position of the aromatic ring (3Fraaije M.W.

Due to its broad substrate spectrum, vanillyl-alcohol oxidase may be applied in the fine chemical industry (5van Berkel, W. J. H., Fraaije, M. W. & De Jong, E.

Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, from rapid reaction kinetics conclusive spectral evidence was obtained that the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase-mediated oxidative demethylation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol proceeds through the formation of a quinone-methide product intermediate (4Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H.

In the absence of oxygen, this intermediate is stabilized in the active site of the reduced enzyme. Upon flavin reoxidation, the quinone methide of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol readily reacts with water, yielding 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, methanol, and hydrogen peroxide as final products. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase was elucidated (7Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H.

Each vanillyl-alcohol oxidase monomer consists of two domains. The larger domain creates a binding site for the ADP moiety of the FAD, whereas the smaller cap domain covers the active site that is located between the two domains. Furthermore, from the structures of several vanillyl-alcohol oxidase inhibitor complexes, it could be deduced that the shape of the active site cavity controls substrate specificity (7Mattevi A.

In this paper we describe the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene encoding vanillyl-alcohol oxidase from P. simplicissimum CBS 170.90, providing the necessary amino acid sequence information which together with the three-dimensional structure establishes the basis for future protein engineering studies. Growth conditions for P. simplicissimum (CBS 170.90; ATCC 90172) have been described before (6Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ.

Aspergillus niger NW156 (prtF28,leuA6, pyrA1, cspA1) a derivative of A. niger N400 (CBS 120.49) from the laboratory collection was used for transformation and was grown in minimal medium (9Pontecorvo G.

E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic with the exception of E. coli LE392 which was grown in NZYCM medium. Media were solidified using 1.5% (mass/volume) bacto-agar. Top agar was prepared using NZYCM medium solidified with 0.7% agarose (electrophoresis grade). Cell extracts were prepared by sonication as described (6Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity was determined at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm vanillyl alcohol, pH 7.5, by measuring the production of vanillin at 340 nm (ε340 vanillin = 14 mm−1 cm−1). Protein sequence analysis of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase was performed by Edman degradation at Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands. Isolation of phage and plasmid DNA and other molecular manipulations were carried out essentially as described (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1-125Google Scholar). A. niger and P. simplicissimum chromosomal DNA was isolated according to de Graaff et al. (14Graaff de L.H. van den Broek H.W.J. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were used as recommended by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The nucleotide sequence was determined using either the Cy5TM AutoCycleTM Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) or the Cy5TM-dATP Labeling Mix (Pharmacia Biotech). The reactions were analyzed with an ALFredTM DNA Sequencer. Computer analysis was done using the program DNAstar (Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated by grinding frozen mycelium in liquid nitrogen-cooled shake flasks and grinding balls using a micro dismembrator (Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). Ground mycelium was extracted with TRIzolTM Reagent according to the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolation of poly(A) tail mRNA was performed with oligo(dT)-cellulose obtained from Stratagene. Using 5 μg of poly(A) tail mRNA, isolated from P. simplicissimum grown for 54 h on 0.1% (mass/volume) veratryl alcohol as the sole source of carbon (see “Results”), a cDNA library was constructed with a ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit using Uni-ZAP XR Vector Arms and a ZAP-cDNA Gigapack Gold III packaging extract (Stratagene). All procedures were carried out as described in the manual supplied with the cDNA Kit. The cDNA library was screened with purified antibodies raised against vanillyl alcohol oxidase, detection limit less than 10 pg (15Fraaije M.W. Roubroeks H.P. Hagen W.R. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as described in the picoBlueTM Immunoscreening Kit instruction manual (Stratagene) using E. coli BB4 as a host. After a second immunoscreening in vivo excision of the pBlueScript phagemid from the Uni-ZAP XR Vector was performed using the ExAssist Helperphage with the E. coli SOLR strain according to the Single-Clone Excision Protocol (Stratagene). P. simplicissimum chromosomal DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI and size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. 10–18-kilobase pair fragments were recovered from the gel by electroelution and cloned into the BamHI sites of λEMBL3 vector arms (Stratagene). Following packaging, the phages were used to infect E. coli LE392 and plated. After overnight growth phages were recovered from the top agar by extraction with SM buffer (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1-125Google Scholar) yielding the primary library. The library was amplified by replating an aliquot of the recovered phages with E. coli LE392. For screening of the amplified library dilutions were prepared yielding 7000–8000 plaques per plate. Four plates of phage were transferred in duplicate to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and processed as recommended by the supplier. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (mass/volume) SDS at 65 °C. As a probe a 1215-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; vaoA, vanillyl-alcohol oxidase encoding gene. XbaI/BamHI fragment of the vaoA-cDNA was used (XbaI cuts at position 451 and BamHI cuts at position 1923 in the genomic sequence as shown in Fig. 1). The fragment was labeled with [32P]dATP as described previously (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Washing steps were carried out for 30 min at 65 °C in the following solutions: twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% (mass/volume) SDS, and once in 0.5× SSC, 0.5% (mass/volume) SDS. For secondary screening identical conditions were applied with the exception that phage dilutions were used yielding 200–300 plaques per plate allowing the selection of individual plaques. Phages were propagated in E. coli LE392 and phage DNA isolated as described (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using 1 μg of the selection plasmid pGW635 and 20 μg of cotransforming pIM3971. The copy number of the P. simplicissimum vaoA gene in A. niger NW156-T10 was determined by Southern blot analysis. 5 μg of SalI-digested P. simplicissimum chromosomal DNA and undiluted (5 μg) and serially diluted SalI-digestedA. niger NW156-T10 chromosomal DNA were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted, and subsequently hydridized with [32P]dATP-labeled vaoA-cDNA. Expression studies were carried out via transfer experiments. P. simplicissimum was precultured in medium described above using fructose (1%) as a carbon source. A. niger NW156-T10 was pregrown on complete medium (9Pontecorvo G. Roper J.A. Hemmons L.J. MacDonald K.D. Bufton A.W.J. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) with 1% fructose as a carbon source. After 16 or 30 h of growth for A. niger and P. simplicissimum, respectively, mycelium was harvested and transferred to fresh media supplemented with carbon sources as described under “Results.” At regular intervals mycelia were harvested and processed for RNA extraction or preparation of cell extract as described above. Northern blots and Southern blots were carried out as described previously (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1-125Google Scholar). [32P]dATP-labeled vaoA-cDNA was used as a probe (see above). The membranes were stripped according to the instructions of the manufacturer and rehybridized with a 900-bpEcoRI fragment encoding part of the 3′ end of the 28 S rDNA of Agaricus bisporus (18Schaap P.J. Müller Y. Baars J.J.P. Op den Camp H.J.M. Sonnenberg A.S.M. Van Griensven L.J.L.D. Visser J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar) to provide for a loading control. Western blot analysis was done as described previously (6Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the same antibodies as used for the cDNA library screening. Bound antibodies were detected by an alkaline phosphatase based immunoassay. Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase was visualized after SDS-PAGE as described (6Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance the expression of the vaoA-cDNA a consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence was introduced via PCR mutagenesis. This was done using the cDNA harboring plasmid pIM3970, taking advantage of the XbaI site at position 451 (numbering according to Fig.1) and the KpnI site from the polylinker of the vector pBlueScript SK downstream of the vaoA-cDNA. Two oligonucleotides were used, primer 1, a 51-mer with the following sequence: 5′ GCGGACGTCGTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGTCCAAGACACAGGAATTC3′, and primer 2, a 17-mer with the sequence 5′ CGAAGATTGTTCGCCTC 3′. Primer 1 is a mutagenic oligonucleotide. The sequence shown in boldface is identical to the N-terminal coding sequence, and the italicized sequence represents the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Primer 2 is complementary to the sequence from positions 587 to 603 in Fig. 1downstream of the XbaI site. PCR was performed in a Biometrica thermocycler in a 25-μl reaction volume containing PCR buffer (Pharmacia Biotech), 1.25 mm dNTP (each), 1 ng of vaoA-cDNA, 100 pmol of each oligonucleotide, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Pharmacia) with the following regime: 5 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 43 °C, and 1 min at 30 s 72 °C; 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR fragment generated with primers 1 and 2 was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and sequenced to check the orientation and to check for undesired mutations. Next, the fragment in the right orientation with respect to the polylinker-encoded PstI site was excised from pGEM-T by PstI/XbaI digestion and ligated into PstI/XbaI-digested pEMBL19. The gene was completed by cloning the XbaI/KpnI fragment isolated from pIM3970 into the XbaI/KpnI-digested previous pEMBL construct yielding plasmid pIM3972. The orientation of the gene is such that transcription takes place from the vector-encoded lacpromoter. E. coli TG2 cells carrying plasmid pIM3972 were grown batchwise in 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with 80 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in 2-liter flasks in a rotary shaker set at 250 rpm at 37 °C. From 5-liter batch cultures cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 55 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mg of DNase I, pH 7.0. Cells were disrupted by passing three times through a precooled French pressure cell press operated at 10,000 p.s.i. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g to remove cellular debris, the supernatant was made 0.5% in protamine sulfate from a 2% mass/volume stock solution. Subsequently, the protamine sulfate aggregates were precipitated by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g followed by adjustment of the supernatant to 25% ammonium sulfate saturation. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was adjusted to 65% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at identical settings as before. The pellet was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (30 × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear descending gradient from 0.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. Fractions were assayed for vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity, pooled, and dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Next the dialysate was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (30 × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated with 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0. After washing the column with 3 volumes of starting buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 25–300 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions containing vanillyl-alcohol oxidase were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration unit equipped with a YM-30 membrane. To ensure high abundance of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase mRNA, total RNA was isolated from P. simplicissimum after 54 h of growth on minimal medium containing veratryl alcohol when vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity was at 75% of its maximum (not shown). The primary library of 7·104 plaque-forming units was amplified to a titer of 1.4 ·109 plaque-forming units/ml. The first screening of the amplified library revealed that approximately 4.5% of the phages reacted with the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase-specific antibodies. From the second screening five positive phages were selected, and the phagemid was excised. Restriction enzyme analysis showed that the five phagemids contained identical inserts. From two such phagemids the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined over both strands by sequencing subclones and by the use of specific oligonucleotides. the vaoA-cDNA sequence and the derived amino acid sequence are presented in Fig. 1 together with the complete gene (see below). The vaoA-cDNA nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1680 bp encoding a protein of 560 amino acids with a deduced mass of 62,915 Da excluding FAD. Amino acid sequences obtained by automated Edman degradation of the N terminus of purified vanillyl-alcohol oxidase and of a purified internal peptide obtained by tryptic digestion of the enzyme were both identified in the deduced primary amino acid sequence (bold type in Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence revealed that the first five amino acids were missing from the N-terminal peptide sequence suggesting some limited proteolytic processing of the enzyme in P. simplicissimum. By using methods and conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” a genomic library of P. simplicissimum was constructed and subsequently screened with the [32P]dATP-labeledvaoA-cDNA as a probe. Two rounds of screening resulted in four positive phages that were characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blot analysis (results not shown). It was concluded that the entire gene should be located on an 8-kilobase pairSalI fragment which was subsequently subcloned into SalI-digested pUC18 yielding pIM3971. pIM3971 was used for sequencing either using specific oligomers based on the vaoA-cDNA sequence and on sequences from the gene or by subclones generated. Fig. 1 shows the complete vaoA gene, sequenced over both strands, including 582-bp promoter sequence and 293 bp of downstream sequence. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence revealed that the coding region is interrupted by five introns. The intron sequences follow the rules for filamentous fungi as proposed earlier (19Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Turner G. Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow1992: 28-53Crossref Google Scholar): they are short, 61, 60, 70, 52, and 75 bp for introns i, ii, iii, iv and v, respectively, and the introns have consensus 5′ and 3′ splice sites, GTPuNGPy and PyAG, respectively, and lariat sequences, NNCTPuAPy (where Pu indicates purine and Py indicates pyrimidine), with only slight deviations. The promoter region was analyzed for the presence of sequences involved in transcription regulation. The sequences 5′ GATA 3′ and 5′ GCCARG 3′ involved in nitrogen (20Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and pH regulation (21Suarez T. Angel-Penalva M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), respectively, were not present. The context independent CreA binding site of A. nidulans 5′ GYGGGG 3′ (22Dowzer C.E.A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) which is probably also recognized in Penicillium (23Mernitz G. Koch A. Henrissat B. Schulz G. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was found once (position −557 to −552 in Fig. 1). The 5′ CAAT 3′ sequence, shown to be involved in transcription activation in Saccharomyces and other fungi (24MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Belshaw N.J. Archer D.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2295-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was found at positions −38, −61, −112, and −373 (lowercase italic letters). No TATA box was found in the sequence immediately upstream of the start codon. However, CT-rich sequences thought to direct transcription initiation (19Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Turner G. Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow1992: 28-53Crossref Google Scholar) were present. Earlier studies have shown that vaoA expression is gratuitously induced in P. simplicissimum when grown on veratryl alcohol (1De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. Van der Zwan R.P. De Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or anisyl alcohol (6Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have readdressed this issue in a transfer experiment in which veratryl alcohol was used as the sole source of carbon. Analysis was carried out by Northern and Western blotting and by vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity determinations. In Fig. 2 the time course of induction is presented. Panel A shows the Northern blot probed with 32P-labeled vaoA-cDNA. in panels B and C the Western blot probed with the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase antibodies and the relative vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity are presented, respectively. The results clearly show that at the start of the transfer no vaoA-mRNA or vanillyl-alcohol oxidase enzyme is present. The vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity and enzyme concentration follow the vaoA-mRNA concentration with a lag, i.e. while the mRNA is maximal at 36 h the maximal activity is observed between 48 and 72 h. Furthermore, when P. simplicissimum was grown on the combination of 0.1% (mass/volume) veratryl or 0.1% (mass/volume) anisyl alcohol and 1% (mass/volume) glucose no vanillyl-alcohol oxidase was produced (results not shown) indicating that the gene is carbon catabolite-repressed. This was also suggested by the presence of the context independent CreA binding site in the promoter region. A. niger NW156-T10, a pIM3971 multicopy transformant harboring 25–30 vaoA copies, was used to study vanillyl-alcohol oxidase expression. Southern analysis using the vaoA-cDNA as a probe demonstrated that A. niger NW156 does not contain a vaoA gene with sufficient homology with the P. simplicissimum vaoA gene to be detected under the conditions applied. In transfer experiments with A. niger NW156-T10 the inducing properties of veratryl alcohol, anisyl alcohol, vanillyl alcohol, veratric acid, vanillic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were assessed 3 h after transfer (see Table I and Fig.3). The highest level of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase activity was obtained with veratryl and anisyl alcohol, whereas no activity was seen when A. niger NW156-T10 was grown on fructose and when an untransformed A. niger strain was transferred to veratryl or anisyl alcohol (not shown). Both 4-methoxybenzyl alcohols were used alone and in combination with fructose to study the time course of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase induction (results not shown). With anisyl alcohol already after 3 h strong induction was observed both by Northern and Western analysis, whereas after 6 h the induction decreased. When fructose was included the induction was weaker both at 3 and 6 h. With veratryl alcohol induction was retarded when compared with anisyl alcohol. Fructose alone or a mixture of veratryl alcohol and fructose resulted in no detectable vaoA-mRNA, and no vanillyl-alcohol oxidase was found by Western analysis.Table ISpecific activity of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase from the multicopy vaoA transformant Aspergillus niger NW156-T10SubstrateSpecific activityunits/mgFructose0.000Anisyl alcohol0.484Ferulic acid0.0794-Hydroxybenzoic acid0.124Vanillic acid0.175Vanillyl alcoho"
https://openalex.org/W2138654139,"We reported previously (Falk, M. M., Kumar, N. M., and Gilula, N. B. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 127, 343–355) that the membrane integration of polytopic connexin polypeptides can be accompanied by an inappropriate cleavage that generates amino-terminal truncated connexins. While this cleavage was not detected in vivo, translation in standard cell-free translation/translocation systems resulted in the complete cleavage of all newly integrated connexins. Partial cleavage occurred in heterologous expression systems that correlated with the expression level. Here we report that the transmembrane topology of connexins generated in microsomal membranes was identical to the topology of functional connexins in plasma membranes. Characterization of the cleavage site and reaction showed that the connexins were processed by signal peptidase immediately downstream of their first transmembrane domain in a reaction similar to the removal of signal peptides from pre-proteins. Increasing the length and hydrophobic character of the signal anchor sequence of connexins completely prevented the aberrant cleavage. This result indicates that their signal anchor sequence was falsely recognized and positioned as a cleavable signal peptide within the endoplasmic reticulum translocon, and that this mispositioning enabled signal peptidase to access the cleavage sites. The results provide direct evidence for the involvement of unknown cellular factors in the membrane integration process of connexins. We reported previously (Falk, M. M., Kumar, N. M., and Gilula, N.

The results provide direct evidence for the involvement of unknown cellular factors in the membrane integration process of connexins. Translocation of membrane proteins is a complex process. It involves recognition and targeting of the proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Cx, connexin; PM, plasma membrane; SA, signal anchor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SP, signal peptide; SPase, signal peptidase; TM, transmembrane; wt, wild type; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; PL, prolactin. membrane, their insertion into the lipid bilayer with their correct transmembrane (TM) orientation without interrupting the permeability barrier of the membrane bilayer, and finally, their maturation into functional proteins that includes co- and post-translational processes such as signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage of ER target signal sequences, folding, disulfide bridge formation, glycosylation, and other post-translational modifications, and eventually oligomerization. A large portion of the current knowledge on the synthesis and translocation of secretory and membrane proteins has been obtained by synthesizing these proteins in translation competent cell lysates supplemented with ER-derived membrane vesicles (microsomes) (1Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Since the lysate system has been found in many cases to accurately reproduce the steps involved in translation, translocation, and co- and post-translational modifications, it has become a standard assay system to study these processes. Many secretory and predominantly single spanning TM proteins have been investigated using this assay system, and a large body of information on the mechanisms involved in the membrane translocation of these protein types has been accumulated (reviewed in Refs. 2Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 3High S. Laird V.

However, little is known about the synthesis of polytopic membrane proteins that traverse the membrane bilayer more than once. This holds true in particular for membrane channel proteins that bear charged amino acid residues within their TM domains to allow the formation of a hydrophilic pore within the membrane bilayer. Experimental evidence indicates that secretory, as well as TM proteins use the same translocation machinery, and that many of the steps that are involved in the biogenesis of both protein types are closely related (3High S.

However, several recent discoveries indicate that the current understanding of membrane protein translocation is quite incomplete, and it may be much more versatile than previously expected (reviewed in Ref. 4Johnson A.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 90-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We used connexin (Cx) polypeptides as model proteins to study the steps involved in the synthesis of channel forming membrane proteins. Cxs are the proteins that form gap junctions, TM channels providing direct cell-to-cell communication. They are nonglycosylated, polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins (class III membrane proteins) that traverse the membrane bilayer four times with NH2 and COOH termini located in the cytoplasm (Ncyt-Ccytorientation). This TM topology was suggested by hydropathy analyses of the primary amino acid sequences and is supported by many other topological analyses (cited in Ref. 7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). More than a dozen different Cxs have been cloned and sequenced from rodents, and all represent structurally conserved members of a multigene family that mainly differ in the length of their COOH-terminal domains. To form a gap junction channel, 6 Cxs oligomerize into a ring-shaped structure with a central hydrophilic pore, termed connexon. Two connexons, each provided by two neighboring cells then pair in the adjacent PMs to form the transcellular, double-membrane channel (reviewed in Refs. 8Bruzzone R. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 9Kumar N.M. Gilula N.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). We found that the translation of Cx polypeptides in standard cell-free translation/translocation systems supplemented with ER-derived microsomes resulted in a complete, but inappropriate proteolytic processing that affected all Cx polypeptides upon their membrane integration (reported in this study and in Ref. 7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Functional Cxs organized in gap junction plaques at the PM are not processed in this manner (10Nicholson B. Dermietzel R. Teplow D. Traub O. Willecke K. Revel J.-P. Nature. 1987; 329: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11Zimmer D.B. Green C.R. Evans W.H. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7751-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in Cx membrane integration in vitro and in vivo suggested that the membrane integration process of Cxs somehow differs from the membrane integration of previously studied membrane proteins and may require additional factors which are absent in the cell-free translation system. Further analysis showed that a comparable cleavage product was also detectable in the ER membranes of different cell types that overexpress Cxs. There, the amount of cleaved Cx polypeptides correlated with the expression level (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction clipped off an NH2-terminal portion of the Cx polypeptides, and appeared to be similar to the cleavage of target signal peptides (SP) from pre-proteins synthesized on the ER membrane. Further characterization indeed suggested a cleavage by SPase (12Lively M.O. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9488-9495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme that normally cleaves NH2-terminal ER target SPs from secretory and certain TM pre-proteins oriented with their NH2 terminus located in the lumen of the ER. Cxs, however, are oriented with their NH2 terminus facing the cytoplasm, and no NH2-terminal SP is encoded within their NH2 terminus. Instead, internal hydrophobic signal anchor (SA) sequences have been characterized in Ncyt-oriented membrane proteins, such as the Cxs, that function in their membrane targeting and anchoring (reviewed in Refs.2Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 3High S. Laird V. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Johnson A.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 90-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, Cxs should not be cleaved by this enzyme upon their membrane integration. Here we report the TM topology of Cxs generated in ER membranes, and that a modified TM orientation is not causing this inappropriate cleavage. Furthermore, we performed an extensive characterization of the cleavage site, reaction, and conditions that are associated with this proteolytic processing. The results indicated that the SA sequence of Cxs was improperly recognized and positioned within the ER translocon when Cxs were translocated in vitro, and that this mis-positioning allowed SPase to access the cleavage sites in the Cx sequences. The results provide direct evidence that additional, unknown cellular factors are involved in the successful membrane integration of Cx polypeptides in vivo that are absent or not functional in standard cell-free translation/translocation systems. For the in vitro transcription of efficiently translated synthetic Cx RNAs, rat α1 (Cx43), and human β1 (Cx32) cDNAs were cloned into the transcription vector pSP64T (13Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) as described in Falk et al. (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the Cx sequences was performed using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction as described in Falket al. (14Falk M.M. Sobrino F. Beck E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2251-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that proofreading PFU polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Plasmids pSP64Tα1and β1 were cut with NheI, dephosphorylated, and the wt sequences were replaced with the NheI-cut polymerase chain reaction amplified mutagenic cDNA fragments. For rapid identification of mutated clones, nucleotide exchanges were chosen that, in addition to the desired amino acid substitution, created new endonuclease restriction sites. Clones with correctly oriented inserts were determined by restriction endonuclease mapping, and selected constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. N-Glycosylation consensus sites with the general amino acid sequence NXS or NXT (15Hart G.W. Brew K. Grant G.A. Bradshaw R.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 9747-9753Google Scholar) were introduced into the β1 Cx sequence by substituting specific amino acid residues in different Cx domains supposed to be located on either side of the membrane bilayer. Selected amino acid residues around the SPase cleavage sites determined in α1 Cx and in β1 Cx were substituted in the α1 Cx sequence. Double α1 Cx mutants having both α1 and β1 Cx cleavage sites mutated were created by using the respective single site mutants as template DNAs. β1 Cx mutants with an increased hydrophobic character of the first transmembrane domain (TM1) were created by exchanging the central arginine (Arg-32) residue in the hydrophobic (h) core region of TM1 with leucine (Leu), and/or three additional leucine codons were inserted immediately downstream of the Arg-32 codon into the TM1 domain. A Bluescript-based plasmid containing the wild type synaptophysin cDNA was generously provided by R. Scheller (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford, CA). To increase in vitro translation efficiency, the synaptophysin cDNA was recloned into the in vitro transcription vector pSP64T (13Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Bluescript KS-based plasmids pCSR2, pCSR3, pCSR4, and pCSR5, encoding β1Cx/synaptophysin chimeras, in which the Cx sequence is progressively replaced by synaptophysin sequence, were generously provided by R. Leube (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany). Construction of the chimeras is described in Leube (16Leube R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 883-894PubMed Google Scholar). The pSP64T-based plasmid pBP4 encoding bovine preprolactin was kindly provided by D. Zopf and P. Walter (University of California, San Francisco, CA). A pSP64T-based plasmid encoding rat lens membrane protein MP26 was kindly provided by N. M. Kumar (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids used for in vitro transcription were linearized, phenol/chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated prior to RNA synthesis. Transcription reactions were performed using T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI). The quality and amount of synthesized RNA was determined by analyzing aliquots on agarose gels. Synthetic RNAs were either used immediately or stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Cell-free translation reactions were performed as described previously (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates were purchased from Promega Biotech and programmed with synthetic RNA. Typically 0.5–1 μg of RNA was used per 25-μl reaction volume. RNAs were translated in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine (555 MBq/ml, Amersham Corp.). Translation reactions were supplemented co-translationally with canine pancreas-derived rough microsomes, which were either obtained from Promega Biotech or prepared as described by Walter and Blobel (18Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Typical concentrations were 0.5–1 Eq/10-μl reaction volume (18Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were incubated at 30–35 °C for 30–60 min except as otherwise stated. Membrane bound proteins were harvested by pelleting the microsomes through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion, using an Airfuge ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), as described in Falk et al. (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To removeN-linked carbohydrates from the N-glycosylated Cx constructs, 10-μl aliquots of the corresponding translocation reactions were incubated with 1 unit of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at room temperature prior to immunoprecipitation. To test a possible influence of the pH on the cleavage reaction, increasing volumes of 50 mm NaCl or NaOH solutions were added to the translocation reactions. Microsomal vesicles were depleted of their lumenal proteins by perforating them at high pH as described (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), except that CAPS (pKa 10.4) was replaced with CHES (pKa 9.3). 100-μl microsome aliquots were diluted 10-fold with either 50 mm (final concentration) HEPES buffer (pKa 7.55), pH 7.4, or 50 mm (final concentration) CHES buffer, pH 9.5 and pH 10.2, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Microsomes were neutralized and collected as described (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and stored on ice until used. Depletion of their soluble, lumenal proteins was monitored by analyzing the protein content in the supernatants on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. To ensure protease inhibitor access to the lumen, microsomes were perforated as described above and preloaded with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 0.25 and 1 mm final concentration), iodoacetamide (1 mm final concentration), EDTA (1 mm final concentration), EGTA (2 mmfinal concentration), or diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2 mmfinal concentration) (Sigma) by adding these inhibitors to the perforation buffers. For radiosequencing, Cxs were labeled withl-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]phenylalanine (37 MBq/ml, Amersham Corp.). A complete amino acid mixture (1 mm final concentration) lacking phenylalanine (Phe) was prepared from amino acid calibration markers (Sigma). A standard translation reaction (60 μl) consisted of 30 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 3 μl of 1 mmamino acid mixture without Phe, 15 μl of [3H]Phe, 1–3 μg of synthetic RNA, and 6–8 equivalents of microsomes. After translation the reaction was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, and the areas containing the α1 or β1 Cx polypeptides were excised, cut into smaller pieces, and placed into the chamber of an ELUTRAP elution device (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The elution buffer (0.1% SDS, 20 mmNH4HCO3, 1 mm thioglycolic acid, 0.1% dithiothreitol) was continuously mixed by pumping the buffer from the negative pole to the positive pole with a peristaltic pump (Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted overnight at 100 V. The eluate (∼1 ml/chamber) was dried and SDS removed by ion-pair extraction with unhydrous acetone/triethylamine/acetic acid/water (85:5:5:5). Cxs were then solubilized in 0.1% SDS solution and protein corresponding to ∼100,000–200,000 cpm were applied to a Polybrene-treated glass fiber filter for 20–25 cycles of amino acid sequence analysis in an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequenator (Foster City, CA). Individual cycles were collected before on-line high performance liquid chromatography analysis. 50-μl aliquots were mixed with scintillation mixture (Bio-Safe II, Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactive peak activities were aligned with phenylalanine residues in the Cx sequence to determine the exact position of the cleavage site. Translation products were analyzed on 10 and 12.5% SDS Laemmli gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 29:1). Samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer containing 3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed without heating to prevent aggregation of Cx polypeptides. Following electrophoresis, gels were soaked for 10 min in 1 m sodium salicylate (Sigma) to enhance 35S and 3H-autoradiography, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. To determine cleavage efficiency of the SPase cleavage site mutants, autoradiographs were scanned densitometrically using an AlphaImager 2000 Digital Imaging and Analysis System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Average cleavage efficiencies of the mutants were expressed in percent compared with the cleavage efficiency of wild type α1 Cx. For the analysis of the Cx biogenesis described in this study, the two most abundant Cx isotypes, heart Cx α1 (Cx43) and liver Cx β1 (Cx32), were used. As we reported previously, Cx polypeptides can be expressed efficiently as full-length proteins in reticulocyte lysates or wheat germ extracts in the absence of microsomes. Synthetic Cx RNAs produced translation products that migrated with an electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels that corresponded to their predicted molecular weights (Fig. 1, lane 1, shown for α1 Cx; see also Ref. 7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, translation in the presence of pancreatic microsomes resulted in the generation of cleaved Cxs with a faster mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1, lane 2) that were retained in the microsomal membrane fraction after pelleting the microsomes through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). All Cx isotypes examined thus far were aberrantly processed in this manner (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Full-length Cx polypeptides also generated in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 1,lane 2) were not membrane associated and stayed in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1, lane 3), indicating that they were synthesized by free ribosomes that failed to bind to the membranes. Other secretory and transmembrane proteins, such as prolactin (PL), MP26, and synaptophysin (Syn), translated in parallel reactions in the presence of microsomes gave results as reported previously, namely SP cleavage of pre-prolactin (20Lingappa V.R. Devillers-Thiery A. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), membrane integration of MP26 without SP cleavage or glycosylation (21Anderson D.J. Mostow K.E. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7249-7253Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and membrane integration and N-glycosylation of Syn (22Cowan D. Linial M. Scheller R.H. Brain Res. 1990; 509: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 5–10). The TM topology of Cxs integrated into microsomes was determined by N-glycosylation site tagging. N-Glycosylation consensus sequences were introduced into the extracellular loops (E1 and E2), and into the intracellular loop (I-loop) described to be located on both sides of the PM (Fig.2 A). While the β1 mutants with the consensus sites in the extracellular loop E1 (designated β1E1K48N and β1E1L56S), or E2 (designated β1E2L165N/K167S) were efficiently glycosylated resulting in a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.2 B, lanes 5, 8 and 14), the mutant with the consensus site in the I-loop (designated β1I-loopH126N) was not glycosylated (Fig. 2 B, lane 11). Endoglycosidase H (endoH) digestion removed the carbohydrate side chains and shifted their electrophoretic mobility back to the mobility of the wt protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6, 9, and 15). Protease protection assays have shown previously that the COOH-terminal domain of the Cxs is located correctly outside the microsomes (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the TM topology of Cx polypeptides integrated into ER membranes (microsomes) was identical to their topology in the PM, and therefore, a hypothetical aberrant TM topology could not be responsible for the cleavage. To determine whether Cx polypeptides have to be translocated into the lumen of the microsomes to be cleaved, we translated Cxs in the presence of microsomes that were preincubated with 0.25 and 1 mm NEM. This alkylating agent was previously reported to prevent protein translocation (23Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To verify inhibition of protein translocation by NEM, Syn and PL were translated in parallel as control proteins. 0.25 mm NEM allowed the translocation of a portion of the control proteins, as indicated by a reduction in glycosylation of Syn, and a reduction of cleavage of pre-PL into PL. 1 mm NEM, however, completely abolished glycosylation of Syn, as well as cleavage of pre-PL, respectively (Fig.3, lanes 1–3, middle and bottom panels). Successful targeting and binding of the newly translated polypeptides to the membrane was indicated by their recovery with the membranes after pelleting the microsomes through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion. Cx cleavage was completely abolished under the conditions described above (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3, top panel), indicating that membrane targeting was not sufficient for the Cx processing, but requires the translocation of the nascent Cx polypeptides into the membrane bilayer and into the lumen of the microsomes. Translocation and cleavage was also abolished when microsomes were preincubated at 30 °C for 30–90 min. This treatment resulted in the complete inactivation of the microsomal translocation activity (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7). A direct inhibitor for eucaryotic signal peptidases is not known, however, indirect experimentation reported in Falk et al. (7Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggested a cleavage by SPase. To obtain additional evidence for a SPase-mediated cleavage, microsomes were depleted of their soluble lumenal proteins by preincubating them at high pH (pH 9.5 and 10.2), using the protocol of Nicchitta and Blobel (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), followed by centrifugation through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion. However, protein depletion had little effect on the cleavage reaction (Fig. 3,lanes 8–10), indicating that the Cxs were not cleaved by a soluble, ER lumenal protease. Note that non-membrane integrated full-length Cxs generated as a by-product in the presence of microsomes (described above) were not removed prior to analysis, and therefore, are present on the gels shown in Fig. 3, lanes 8–12, and Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7. To exclude the possibility that the Cxs were cleaved by a different membrane-anchored ER protease, Cxs were translocated into microsomes that were preloaded at high pH with different class-specific protease inhibitors to ensure access of the chemicals to the microsomal lumen. While alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide (1 mm final concentration), or chelating agents such as EDTA (1 mmfinal concentration) efficiently blocked protein translation under the conditions described, preincubation of the microsomes in diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2 mm final concentration) or EGTA (2 mm final concentration), allowed translation, but had no significant influence on the cleavage reaction (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). Furthermore, the cleavage was relatively independent of pH (∼pH 5.5–9.0), temperature (30–41 °C), and RNA concentration (0.05–1 μg/10-μl reaction volume) (not shown). All these results provided additional strong evidence for a cleavage performed by SPase, and argued against a cleavage by any other known protease involved in protein degradation, such as “rapid ER degradation” (24Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or “quality control” (25Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 26Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The exact location of the cleavage sites was mapped for cell-free expressed α1 and β1 Cx polypeptides by NH2-terminal amino acid radiosequencing after translating the Cxs in the presence of labeled phenylalanine (Fig. 4 A). Phenylalanine was chosen because of its unique distribution within the NH2-terminal portion of the Cx polypeptide. While no Phe residues are present in the NH2-terminal domain, two Phe residues separated by an isoleucine (Ile) are present in the first TM domain (Phe-29 and Phe-31 in β1 Cx, and Phe-30 and Phe-32 in α1 Cx). Finally, single or double Phe residues are present in the first extracellular loop (E1) (Phe-51 and Phe-68/Phe-69 in β1 Cx, and Phe-52 and Phe-70 in α1 Cx; Fig. 4 B). Radioactive peak activities released in the individual degradation cycles (cycle 11 in the β1 Cx and cycle 6 in the α1 Cx sequencing reaction) best matched the distribution of Phe residues in the Cx sequences when aligned with Phe-51 of β1 Cx and Phe-52 of α1 Cx, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). This analysis identified two cleavage sites separated by five amino acid residues from each other. Both sites were located within the border region between TM1 and E1, between alanine (Ala) 40 and glutamic acid (Glu) 41 in β1 Cx, and glycine (Gly) 46 and aspartic acid (Asp) 47 in α1 Cx, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Both cleavage sites are homologous to natural SPase cleavage site motifs, small, uncharged amino acid residues in positions −3 and −1 with respect to the cleavage site (27von Heijne G. J. Mol.

Each type of binding site shows unique ligand selectivity due to different contributions by the δ, γ, or ε subunits. The present study compares epibatidine and carbamylcholine binding in terms of their site and state selectivities for muscle receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Measurements of binding to αγ, αδ, and αε intracellular complexes reveal opposite site selectivities between epibatidine and carbamylcholine; for epibatidine the rank order of affinities is αε > αγ > αδ, whereas for carbamylcholine the rank order is αδ ≅ αε > αγ. Because the relative affinities of intracellular complexes resemble those of receptors in the closed activable state, the results suggest that epibatidine binds with unique site selectivity in activating the muscle receptor. Measurements of binding at equilibrium show that both enantiomers of epibatidine bind to adult and fetal receptors with shallow but monophasic binding curves. However, when receptors are fully desensitized, epibatidine binds in a biphasic manner, with dissociation constants of the two components differing by more than 170-fold. Studies of subunit-omitted receptors (α2βδ2, α2βγ2, and α2βε2) reveal that in the desensitized state, the αδ interface forms the low affinity epibatidine site, whereas the αγ and αε interfaces form high affinity sites. In contrast to epibatidine, carbamylcholine shows little site selectivity for desensitized fetal or adult receptors.

Muscle-type AChRs are heteropentamers of homologous but functionally distinct subunits with compositions α2βγδ in fetal and α2βεδ in adult muscle (4Mishina M. Takai T. Imoto K. Noda M. Takahashi T. Numa S. Methfessel C. Sakmann B. Nature (London). 1986; 321: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Within the pentamer are two binding sites for acetylcholine (ACh); one is formed at the αδ subunit interface, whereas the other is formed at the αγ interface in the fetal receptor and at the αε interface in the adult. Each type of binding site displays distinct selectivities for agonists and competitive antagonists. For example, carbamylcholine binds 30-fold less tightly to the αγ binding site than to the αδ and αε binding sites owing to different contributions of the γ, δ, and ε subunits (5Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol.

Previous studies used γ-δ and ε-δ subunit chimeras to identify residues in these subunits which confer site selectivity for curare, conotoxin M1, and carbamylcholine (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The overall findings show that four loops, well separated in the primary sequence of the non-α subunits, contribute to the binding site interface (10Prince R.J. Sine S.M. The Nicotinic Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX1998Google Scholar). To investigate further the structure of the ligand binding site, the present work examines binding of epibatidine to sites of fetal and adult muscle AChRs. We reasoned that a structurally constrained ligand such as epibatidine would be less able to accommodate differences in binding site structure and thus might show greater or different selectivity compared with flexible agonists such as carbamylcholine and ACh. We show that epibatidine binds with novel site selectivity to muscle AChRs, selecting strongly for the αε and αγ binding sites over the αδ site. Further, unlike carbamylcholine, epibatidine maintains strong site selectivity when the receptor is converted to the high affinity desensitized state. Owing to its unique site and state selectivity, epibatidine is a potentially valuable probe of binding site structure and of elements that confer state-dependent selectivity. 125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Proadifen and (−)-, (+)-, and (±)-epibatidine were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. The 293 human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Sources of the mouse AChR subunits were as described previously (7Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Bouzat C. Bren N. Sine S.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1395-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were transfected at about 50% confluence using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (7Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells expressing intracellular αγ, αε, or αδ complexes or cell surface pentamers (α2βδγ or α2βδε) were maintained at 37 °C for 48 h after transfection. Cells expressing triplet pentamers (α2βδ2, α2βγ2, or α2βε2) were maintained at 37 °C for 24 h after transfection and then at 31 °C for 48 h. Cells expressing surface pentamers were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 1 min, and resuspended in potassium Ringer's solution (140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 30 mg/l bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10–11 mm NaOH). Cells expressing intracellular complexes were permeabilized with saponin before harvesting (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Agonist binding was determined by competition against the initial rate of 125I-labeled α-BTX binding as described previously (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, the receptor complexes were equilibrated with agonist for 40 min before addition of 5 nm125I-labeled α-BTX. The cells were then incubated for a further 20–40 min to allow occupancy of at most 50% of the binding sites by125I-labeled α-BTX. The total number of sites was determined by incubating with 25 nm125I-labeled α-BTX for 20–40 min and subtracting a blank determined in the presence of 10 mm carbamylcholine. The cells were harvested using a Brandell cell harvester and counted in a γ counter. We fit the following two equations to our data using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software): 1−Fractional occupancy=1−[L]n/([L]n+Kn)Equation 1 1−Fractional occupancy=1−P⋅[L]/(K1+[L])−(1−P)⋅[L]/(K2+[L])Equation 2 where [L] is the concentration of competing ligand,K is an apparent dissociation constant, n is the Hill coefficient, K1 and K2 are intrinsic dissociation constants, and P is the fraction of sites with dissociation constantK1. Transfection of HEK-293 cells with α and γ, δ, or ε subunit results in robust expression of agonist displaceable intracellular α-BTX binding sites. To determine selectivity of epibatidine for these intracellular complexes, we measured binding by competition against125I-labeled α-BTX binding. Both enantiomers of epibatidine bind with highest affinity to αε complexes, intermediate affinity to αγ, and lowest affinity to αδ (Fig.1 A and TableI). Although both isomers of epibatidine bind with the same affinity to αε complexes, the (−)-isomer binds with significantly higher affinity to αγ and αδ complexes compared with the (+)-isomer. By contrast, carbamylcholine shows opposite site selectivity to epibatidine, binding with high affinity to αδ and αε and low affinity to αγ complexes (Fig.1 B and Table I). In this and previous studies (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) we found that agonists bind to intracellular complexes with Hill coefficients significantly less than 1. Because complexes of an α and a non-α subunit should form only one type of binding site, the shallow binding curves we observe indicate some type of site heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, selectivities of carbamylcholine and acetylcholine for intracellular complexes (5Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) coincide with selectivities of receptors in the closed activable state determined by single channel kinetic analysis (12Zhang Y. Chen J. Auerbach A. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Wang H-L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further, intracellular complexes show the same rank order of affinity for the competitive antagonistd-tubocurarine to that observed in native receptors, αγ ≅ αε > αδ (14Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14692-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular complexes, unlike fully assembled native receptors, do not enter a high affinity desensitized state and are presumably incapable of channel gating (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus the binding site selectivity of intracellular complexes may most closely resemble that of closed activable receptors.Table IBinding of (+)- and (−)-epibatidine and carbamylcholine to intracellular complexesAgonistSiteKdnnmCarbamylcholineαγ43300 ± 45000.5 ± 0.02αδ1500 ± 920.78 ± 0.03αε1700 ± 1960.57 ± 0.03(+)-Epibatidineαγ148 ± 280.56 ± 0.06αδ834 ± 1060.68 ± 0.06αε5.6 ± 0.60.69 ± 0.05(−)-Epibatidineαγ36.2 ± 5.70.6 ± 0.05αδ391 ± 350.7 ± 0.04αε5.3 ± 0.60.7 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab To assess site selectivity of epibatidine for receptors containing the full complement of subunits, we expressed adult or fetal receptors in HEK-293 cells and measured binding to intact cells under control and desensitizing conditions (Fig. 2 and TableII). Under control conditions, both enantiomers of epibatidine displace 125I-labeled α-BTX with much higher affinity than carbamylcholine. Although fetal and adult receptors bind epibatidine with similar affinities, fetal receptors distinguish between (+)- and (−)-epibatidine, whereas adult receptors do not. Hill coefficients for epibatidine are only ∼0.8 compared with values for carbamylcholine of ∼1.3. Although a Hill coefficient less than 1 implies multiple binding sites, for agonists equilibrium binding cannot be interpreted using a simple two site model. At equilibrium, agonist binding is determined by affinities of the sites in the resting, open, and desensitized states as well as the allosteric constants governing channel opening and desensitization (see under “Discussion”).Table IIBinding of (+)- and (−)-epibatidine and carbamylcholine to adult and fetal receptorsAgonistReceptor typeK1K2PnnmCarbamylcholineAdult26320 ± 14311.3 ± 0.08Fetal29310 ± 11401.28 ± 0.06Carbamylcholine + proadifenAdult1070 ± 850.91 ± 0.06Fetal191 ± 170.91 ± 0.08(+)-EpibatidineAdult913 ± 550.7 ± 0.03Fetal1330 ± 1350.91 ± 0.08(+)-Epibatidine + proadifenAdult3.8 ± 0.4837 ± 40.41 ± 0.00Fetal1.05 ± 0.09182 ± 0.90.5 ± 0.00(−)-EpibatidineAdult903 ± 670.7 ± 0.03Fetal513 ± 180.82 ± 0.02(−)-Epibatidine + proadifenAdult2.3 ± 0.2609 ± 460.43 ± 0.01Fetal0.56 ± 0.08151 ± 200.45 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab To measure binding of agonist to a single functional state of the receptor, we used the local anesthetic proadifen to promote entry into the high affinity desensitized state (15Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13679-13689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When fully desensitized with proadifen, adult and fetal receptors bind carbamylcholine with high affinity and Hill coefficients close to 1, indicating binding to a single class of high affinity sites (Fig. 2, B and D, and Table II; however, see below). Epibatidine, on the other hand, binds in a distinctly biphasic manner in the presence of proadifen; fits to a two-site equation (Equation 2) yield intrinsic dissociation constants different by more than 170-fold (Fig. 2,A and C and Table II). Thus, whereas carbamylcholine does not distinguish between the αγ and αδ binding sites in the desensitized fetal receptor nor between the αε and αδ sites in the desensitized adult receptor, epibatidine selects strongly between the two binding sites of each receptor. To determine which subunits form the high affinity sites in fetal and adult receptors, we expressed triplet α2βγ2, α2βδ2, or α2βε2 receptors and measured agonist binding under control and desensitizing conditions (Fig.3 and TableIII). Unlike native receptors, the two binding sites in triplet receptors are formed by α and identical non-α subunits (17Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under control conditions both enantiomers of epibatidine bind more tightly to α2βγ2and α2βε2 than to α2βδ2 pentamers. Carbamylcholine, by contrast, binds more tightly to α2βδ2than to α2βγ2 or α2βε2 pentamers. In the presence of proadifen, the affinities of epibatidine and carbamylcholine for α2βγ2 pentamers increase markedly, as with native pentamers, whereas affinities for α2βδ2 pentamers are only slightly affected; similar results were obtained for carbamylcholine by Sine and Claudio (17Sine S.M.

Although expression of α2βε2 pentamers was too low to accurately measure under desensitizing conditions, at equilibrium epibatidine binds to these receptors 30-fold more tightly than to the low affinity binding site of desensitized adult receptors. Thus in the desensitized adult receptor, the high affinity component corresponds to the αε site, whereas the low affinity component corresponds to the αδ site. Our preliminary experiments with (±)-epibatidine tested a range of proadifen concentrations to determine an optimum concentration for promoting desensitization. As observed previously, increasing proadifen concentrations progressively increase carbamylcholine affinity to approach a limiting value corresponding to the agonist affinity for the desensitized state (15Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13679-13689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the fetal receptor, the limiting carbamylcholine affinity is reached at 200 μmproadifen; at all concentrations of proadifen carbamylcholine binding is well described by Hill coefficients of 1 or greater, implying binding to a single class of sites (Fig.4 and TableIV). For the adult receptor the limiting affinity is achieved by only 30–60 μm proadifen; at proadifen concentrations up to 60 μm, carbamylcholine binding is described by Hill coefficients of 1 or greater, again indicating binding to a single class of high affinity sites (Fig. 4 and Table IV). However, in the presence of 100–200 μmproadifen, carbamylcholine binds to adult receptors with Hill coefficients of 0.7–0.8. As carbamylcholine affinity reaches a limit at lower proadifen concentrations, the observed broadening of the binding curve at high proadifen concentrations likely results from an action distinct from enhancement of desensitization.Table IVDependence of desensitized state agonist binding on proadifen concentrationReceptor typeProadifen(±)-EpibatidineCarbamylcholineK1K2nPK1K2nμmnmnmnmnmAdult01797 ± 680.76 ± 0.0228410 ± 13501.1 ± 0.05108.4 ± 1.2580 ± 710.45 ± 0.036310 ± 4001.46 ± 0.12302.4 ± 0.17807 ± 500.46 ± 0.011266 ± 621.1 ± 0.05601.4 ± 0.14776 ± 380.33 ± 0.011020 ± 611.03 ± 0.061001.77 ± 0.25788 ± 370.24 ± 0.01858 ± 630.74 ± 0.04100234 ± 353180 ± 4932001.14 ± 0.33616 ± 390.18 ± 0.01873 ± 590.8 ± 0.04200293 ± 472588 ± 417Fetal0811 ± 240.98 ± 0.0323720 ± 8801.3 ± 0.061013 ± 1.3205 ± 520.72 ± 0.045030 ± 3551.45 ± 0.13301.9 ± 0.11216 ± 380.75 ± 0.01745 ± 761.14 ± 0.08601.06 ± 0.01252 ± 480.65 ± 0.02388 ± 681.11 ± 0.071001.57 ± 0.14298 ± 360.57 ± 0.02333 ± 561.1 ± 0.062000.64 ± 0.07215 ± 180.45 ± 0.01218 ± 131.04 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab At both fetal and adult receptors, epibatidine binds in a distinctly biphasic manner in the presence of proadifen; biphasic binding is observed at all proadifen concentrations greater than 10 μm. Furthermore, for both sites of the adult receptor, epibatidine affinity increases to reach a limiting value with proadifen concentrations of 30 μm or greater, as observed for carbamylcholine (Table III). For the fetal receptor, the maximum increase in affinity is reached at 60–100 μm proadifen, similar to results with carbamylcholine (Table IV). Thus for both fetal and adult receptors, a given concentration of proadifen increases carbamylcholine and epibatidine affinities to similar extents. We noticed for epibatidine, however, that the relative weights of the high and low affinity components depend on proadifen concentration (Fig. 4 and Table IV). For fetal receptors in the presence of 30 μm proadifen, the high affinity component dominates, whereas for adult receptors the two components are approximately equally weighted. When proadifen concentration is increased to 200 μm, fetal receptors show equally weighted low and high affinity components, whereas adult receptors show a dominant low affinity component. These results indicate that in addition to promoting desensitization, proadifen noncompetitively inhibits the binding of 125I-labeled α-BTX binding. Furthermore, the extent of inhibition differs for each site in the two types of receptors. To examine this additional action of proadifen, we measured the initial rate and total number of 125I-labeled BTX binding sites at varying concentrations of proadifen. The results show that increasing proadifen concentrations reduce the rate of toxin binding and the total number of sites approximately in parallel (Fig.5). As these determinations reflect contributions of both sites in each receptor type, they do not reveal which of the αδ, αε, or αγ sites are preferentially affected. However, our results on site selectivity of epibatidine show that proadifen decreases the rate and number of BTX sites in a site-selective manner (Fig. 4); site selectivity for proadifen follows the rank order, αε > αδ > αγ. The present study examines various combinations of AChR subunits to characterize the interaction of (+)- and (−)-epibatidine with the three types of binding sites of muscle AChRs. Our results reveal that epibatidine is unique among AChR agonists thus far characterized in that it binds with high affinity to αε and αγ sites and low affinity to αδ sites. Further, unlike classical agonists, epibatidine selects between these binding sites in the desensitized state of the receptor. Binding of agonists to the AChR can be described by the following conventional scheme: 2A+R⇌K1A+AR⇌K2A2R⇌ΘA2OM⥮2A+D⇌Kd1A+AD⇌Kd2A2DScheme 1 where R is the closed, activable state of the receptor, O is the open state, D is the desensitized state, and A is agonist.K1 and K2 are the dissociation constants for the activable state binding sites, and Kd1 and Kd2 are the dissociation constants for the desensitized state binding sites, M is an allosteric constant governing the transition between the activable and desensitized states, and Θ is the channel opening equilibrium constant (18Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18052-18062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lingle C.J. Maconochie D. Steinbach J.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because apparent affinity measured in equilibrium binding assays depends on the four intrinsic dissociation constants as well as the state equilibrium constants, such measurements do not directly reflect intrinsic agonist affinities of a particular binding site. Nevertheless, estimates of parameters in the upper limb of Scheme 1 can be derived from the kinetics of single channel currents. Single channel kinetic analysis established that K1 and K2 for ACh differ by 30–100-fold in fetal mouse and Torpedo receptors (12Zhang Y. Chen J. Auerbach A. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sine S.M. Claudio T. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen.

Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we observe a similar selectivity pattern for carbamylcholine binding to mouse intracellular complexes: αδ and αε complexes bind agonist with high affinity but αγ complexes bind agonist 20–30-fold less tightly. As in previous studies (6Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) we find that intracellular complexes bind agonists with Hill coefficients less than 1. Because complexes of an α and a single type of non-α subunit should form only one class of binding site, a Hill coefficient less than 1 suggests heterogeneous binding sites. Heterogeneity of intracellular complexes could arise from 1) formation of tetrameric complexes of the form αxαx, wherex is γ, δ, or ε (22Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); 2) access of agonist to immature or partially degraded complexes due to permeabilization by saponin; 3) a fixed proportion of the receptors arrested in the low affinity activable and high affinity open channel and desensitized states. Despite this apparent heterogeneity, carbamylcholine selectivity determined in our binding assay parallels selectivity of the activable state of the native receptor determined from single channel kinetic analysis (12Zhang Y. Chen J. Auerbach A. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Wang H-L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The overall results suggest that the ligand selectivities of αγ, αδ, and αε complexes most closely resemble those of the corresponding closed activable binding sites in native pentamers. Thus in activating the receptor, epibatidine likely binds with high affinity to the αγ and αε sites but with low affinity to the αδ site. Unlike the closed activable state, the desensitized state can be studied in isolation by measuring agonist binding in the presence of a desensitizing agent such as proadifen (15Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13679-13689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we observe that carbamylcholine does not distinguish between the desensitized αγ, αδ, and αε binding interfaces. This is evidenced by the monophasic binding curves of desensitized fetal and adult receptors and the similar affinities of desensitized α2βδ2 and α2βγ2 triplet receptors. Similar results were obtained previously for carbamylcholine and ACh (17Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sine S.M. Ohno K. Bouzat C. Auerbach A. Milone M. Pruitt J. Engel A.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Epibatidine, by contrast, distinguishes between the two sites in desensitized fetal and adult receptors. Previous studies showed that α2βγ2 and α2βδ2 pentamers bind a range of ligands with affinities similar to those of the two sites in native fetal receptors (7Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that binding sites of subunit-omitted receptors are close in structure to binding sites in the corresponding native receptor. For epibatidine, we observe similar dissociation constants for desensitized α2βγ2receptors and the high affinity component of desensitized fetal receptors and similar dissociation constants for desensitized α2βδ2 receptors and the low affinity components of desensitized fetal and adult receptors. These results strongly suggest that the biphasic binding of epibatidine under desensitizing conditions is due to intrinsic differences in the αγ and αδ binding sites, i.e. the different contributions of the γ and δ subunits to the binding sites confer different epibatidine affinities. A second possibility is that biphasic binding might represent uncoupled binding sites of a single receptor type where one component corresponds to the high affinity desensitized state and the other corresponds to the low affinity activable state,i.e. proadifen might eliminate the cooperativity of the binding sites predicted by the allosteric model of Monod et al. (24Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 3: 318-356Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis seems unlikely because the low affinity component in the presence of proadifen is shifted to the left of the overall curve in its absence. In addition, uncoupling of the binding sites by proadifen should result in a biphasic binding curve for carbamylcholine, whereas we observe essentially monophasic binding of carbamylcholine to both adult and fetal receptors. Thus the weight of evidence suggests that unlike acetylcholine and carbamylcholine, epibatidine selects between the desensitized αγ and αδ binding sites in the fetal receptor and between the αε and αδ binding sites in the adult receptor. Whereas previous studies with the competitive antagonist d-tubocurarine showed site selectivity for desensitized Torpedo receptors (25Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 24: 5464-5475Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), to our knowledge epibatidine is the first agonist that selects between the binding sites of the desensitized receptor. Our preliminary experiments sought to determine the optimal concentration of proadifen for desensitizing each receptor type. These studies revealed additional complexities in the interaction of proadifen with the AChR. In the absence of agonist, high concentrations of proadifen inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled α-BTX; this inhibition manifests as decreases in both the initial rate and maximal number of toxin binding sites. A decrease in the maximal number of toxin binding sites suggests that proadifen shifts the receptor into a conformation that no longer binds α-BTX. On the other hand, slowing of the rate of α-BTX association could be due to either noncompetitive or competitive inhibition by proadifen. If proadifen competitively inhibits α-BTX association, one might expect a decrease in agonist affinity as the concentration of proadifen increases. However, we observed no decrease in agonist affinity even at the highest concentration of proadifen. Thus if the interaction between α-BTX and proadifen is competitive, the site of interaction does not overlap with the agonist binding site. We observed an additional action of proadifen when we measured epibatidine binding in the presence of varying concentrations of proadifen. Our results establish that epibatidine binds in a biphasic manner in the presence of proadifen. However, the apparent ratio of high to low affinity sites varies with proadifen concentration. Whereas for both adult and fetal receptors the fraction of high affinity sites decreases as the proadifen concentration increases, the effects of proadifen differ quantitatively for the two types of receptors. At 60 μm proadifen, adult receptors show approximately equally weighted high and low affinity components, whereas fetal receptors show about 3-fold more high than low affinity sites. In contrast, at 200 μm proadifen, fetal receptors show equally weighted high and low affinity components, whereas adult receptors show a dominant low affinity component. The changes in the apparent ratio of sites indicate different proadifen sensitivities of the αγ, αδ, and αε interfaces to the inhibitory effects of proadifen. In the fetal receptor, the αδ site is more sensitive to proadifen than the αγ site. Thus at low concentrations of proadifen, α-BTX binding to the αδ site is inhibited more, and the apparent weight of the αγ site is greater. As the proadifen concentration is increased, α-BTX binding to the αγ also becomes inhibited while effects on the αδ site reach a maximum. This yields equally weighted high and low affinity components at 200 μm proadifen. Conversely, in the adult receptor the αε site is more sensitive to proadifen than the αδ site. At low concentrations of proadifen, the adult receptor shows two equally weighted components, but as the proadifen concentration is increased the weight of the high affinity αε component decreases. Further experiments are required to determine whether changes in the ratio of high and low affinity binding sites owe to changes in the rates at which the αγ, αδ, and αε interfaces bind α-BTX or whether the binding sites differ in their propensity to enter a conformational state which does not bind α-BTX. Our overall results demonstrate that epibatidine binds with unique site and state selectivity to fetal and adult muscle AChRs. In contrast to carbamylcholine, epibatidine selects strongly for binding sites formed by the αγ and αε subunit interfaces compared with the αδ interfaces. Further, unlike carbamylcholine, selectivity of epibatidine is maintained in the desensitized state. Structure-function studies using epibatidine should allow identification of new binding site determinants in the AChR thus refining our understanding of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2051444751,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites occur frequently in DNA as a result of spontaneous base loss or following removal of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase. The action of many AP endonuclease enzymes at abasic sites in DNA leaves a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residue that must be removed during the base excision repair process. This 5′-dRP group may be removed by AP lyase enzymes that employ a β-elimination mechanism. This β-elimination reaction typically involves a transient Schiff base intermediate that can react with sodium borohydride to trap the DNA-enzyme complex. With the use of this assay as well as direct 5′-dRP group release assays, we show that T4 DNA ligase, a representative ATP-dependent DNA ligase, contains AP lyase activity. The AP lyase activity of T4 DNA ligase is inhibited in the presence of ATP, suggesting that the adenylated lysine residue is part of the active site for both the ligase and lyase activities. A model is proposed whereby the AP lyase activity of DNA ligase may contribute to the repair of abasic sites in DNA.

A model is proposed whereby the AP lyase activity of DNA ligase may contribute to the repair of abasic sites in DNA. DNA repair pathways have evolved to process a wide range of chemically distinct lesions in DNA (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Seide W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar). One of the most common types of damage is spontaneous or enzymatic hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond between a DNA base and the sugar phosphate backbone generating an abasic site (AP site). 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase; dRP, 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate; FPG, formamidopyrimidine glycosylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. AP sites are highly mutagenic and require rapid and efficient repair. AP sites are processed by a base excision repair pathway that is frequently initiated by the action of a class II AP endonuclease that cleaves the DNA backbone adjacent to the lesion to produce 3′-OH and 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate termini (2Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The latter residue, referred to as a 5′-dRP moiety, is relatively alkali labile and can be removed by AP lyases that facilitate β-elimination. Most enzymes demonstrated to have dRPase activity operate through this lyase mechanism, although some, such as the Escherichia coli recJ protein, catalyze hydrolysis (3Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The two classes of dRPase enzymes can be distinguished by the fact that the lyase mechanism frequently involves formation of a transient Schiff base intermediate in which an amino group on the enzyme is covalently bound to the DNA. This lyase mechanism, first proposed for E. coli endonuclease III (4Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8200-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), provides a simple method to identify a polypeptide with AP lyase activity because the Schiff base intermediate can be trapped in a stable form by reaction with a strong reducing agent, such as NaBH4 or NaBH3CN. Thus, with an appropriate radioactively labeled substrate, the label can be transferred to the AP lyase enzyme. This borohydride trapping has been documented for several repair enzymes (5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dodson M.L. Schrock R.D.I. Lloyd R.S.

The combined action of AP endonuclease and AP lyase leaves a one-nucleotide gap that is filled by a DNA polymerase. The final step in repair involves DNA strand sealing by DNA ligase. The mechanism of DNA ligase involves covalent modification of the enzyme by adenylation, transfer of the AMP residue in a phosphoanhydride linkage to the 5′-phosphate of nicked DNA, followed by resealing of the DNA strand driven by the energy of AMP hydrolysis. We recently characterized a mtDNA ligase as part of an effort to reconstitute repair of AP sites using mitochondrial enzymes (12Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The size, template specificity, and immunological properties of the mtDNA ligase suggested that this was a form of DNA ligase III. In the course of this work we found that mtDNA ligase is active on a DNA substrate containing an AP site incised on the 5′ side by a class II AP endonuclease. Our observations prompted a detailed investigation of the action of T4 DNA ligase as a prototype for ATP-dependent DNA ligases at AP sites in DNA. In this paper we show that in the presence of ATP, T4 DNA ligase is able to reseal an incised AP site. In the absence of ATP, T4 DNA ligase acts as an AP lyase to facilitate a β-elimination reaction that leads to removal of the 5′-dRP residue. A model is presented whereby an intrinsic AP lyase activity in DNA ligase may facilitate repair of AP sites. mtDNA ligase, mitochondrial AP endonuclease, and DNA ligase I were purified from Xenopus ovary tissue as described (12Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. T7 DNA ligase was a gift from Dr. J. Dunn (Brookhaven National Laboratory). Variable quantities of both preparations of bacteriophage DNA ligase were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) in parallel with standard proteins of known concentration. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm that both preparations were essentially homogeneous and to permit estimation of protein concentrations using densitometry of the stained gels. Radiochemicals were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (HK-UNG). FPG protein was a gift from J. Tchou and A. P. Grollman (SUNY-Stony Brook). Sodium borohydride and sodium thioglycolate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Other reagent grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. The Poros Q 4.6 × 50-mm column used for anion exchange HPLC was obtained from Perceptive Biosystems. Oligonucleotides were either synthesized by the phosphoramidite method at the SUNY-Stony Brook Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility or were obtained from Operon. A continuous duplex oligonucleotide was prepared by annealing a 5′-32P kinase-labeled 32-mer (5′-CATGGGCCGACATGAUCAAGCTTGAGGCCAAG) to a complementary oligonucleotide (5′-TCTTGGCCTCAAGCTTGATCATGTCGGCCCATG). Two nicked duplex oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing a 5′-32P kinase-labeled 17-mer (5′-UCAAGCTTGAGGCCAAG; referred to as U17) and either a nonradioactive 15-mer (5′-CATGGGCCGACATGA) or 12-mer (5′-GGGCCGACATGA) to the same complementary strand described above. The 12-mer was used in the experiment in Fig. 7 C to permit better resolution of the reaction product from the initial labeled substrate. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated using standard procedures (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and annealed by heating to 80 °C in 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA and slow cooling to 4 °C. Oligonucleotides were treated immediately before use with UDG in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and diluted into an assay mixture with DNA ligase in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, unless otherwise indicated. Borohydride trapping was performed by a modification of published procedures (9Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr.

After 30 min at 25 °C, the solution was adjusted to contain 6 mm CaCl2and 10 μg/ml micrococcal nuclease. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and detected by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). dRPase activity was measured as described (3Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and HPLC analysis of products generated in the presence of sodium thioglycolate was performed as described (5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), except that a Poros Q anion exchange column was used. Our laboratory has studied the base excision repair pathway with nuclear and mitochondrial protein fractions using templates containing precisely positioned single AP sites embedded in covalently closed circular DNA (12Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These sites are readily cleaved on the 5′ side by class II AP endonuclease to yield a 3′-OH terminus and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residue. When templates bearing incised AP sites are incubated with DNA ligase in the presence of ATP, the DNA ligases are able to reseal the nicked strand (Fig.1). This reaction has been reported for T4 DNA ligase (16Goffin C. Bailly V. Verly W.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8755-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but not for eukaryotic DNA ligases. Because ligation of a 5′-dRP moiety directly reverses the action of AP endonuclease, it is counterproductive for repair. It is also a potential confounding factor in efforts to reconstitute repair reactions in vitro, because religation of an abasic site might not be differentiated from actual repair. In the experiment in Fig. 1, we used a substrate with a synthetic analogue of an abasic site, a tetrahydrofuran analogue that has been used extensively in repair studies (15Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is an analogue of a reduced deoxyribose moiety and is not subject to β-elimination. Experiments presented below show that T4 DNA ligase can also reseal an authentic (nonreduced) AP site. We previously showedXenopus laevis mtDNA ligase can be labeled using a borohydride trapping procedure that is specific for AP lyase activities (12Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is a general property of ATP-dependent DNA ligases, we tested T4 and T7 DNA ligases for the ability to react with AP sites in a borohydride trapping assay. This assay employed an oligonucleotide substrate designed to contain a specific U residue adjacent to a nick, referred to as 15-*U17:33 to denote a 15-mer annealed adjacent to a kinase-labeled (*) 17-mer to a 33-mer complementary strand. Treatment of the duplex oligonucleotide with UDG results in a 5′-phosphoryl abasic site. This is an exact model of the substrate that would be generated by action of a class II AP endonuclease. Fig. 2 shows that both T4 DNA ligase and T7 DNA ligase react in this assay. Controls in lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 2 demonstrate that cross-linking was dependent on the presence of NaBH4 and on the AP site, because the reaction was not observed with a control oligonucleotide containing thymine in place of uracil. We performed a variety of control experiments to characterize the putative AP lyase activity in T4 DNA ligase. The extent of cross-linking with a nicked substrate varies with solution conditions. Cross-linking is reduced at 5 mm MgCl2 in comparison with the standard reaction conducted at 1 mmMgCl2 and is inhibited more than 90% by 1 mmATP (Fig. 3). The standard reaction includes post-treatment with micrococcal nuclease to degrade the oligonucleotide cross-linked to protein by NaBH4. When this nuclease treatment was omitted, the electrophoretic mobility of the major cross-linked protein species was reduced, as expected for a DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3 B). In the absence of micrococcal nuclease treatment a minor cross-linked labeled species with essentially the same gel mobility as unmodified T4 DNA ligase was also observed. This faster migrating species is expected to be formed as an intermediate in the action of an AP lyase, as shown in Fig.4. The initial product of an attack by AP lyase on an AP site is a Schiff base intermediate in which the enzyme is joined to DNA. The AP lyase reaction proceeds with elimination of the DNA from the C3′ position of deoxyribose, producing an enzyme-dRP intermediate with a Schiff base linkage. Both the enzyme-DNA and enzyme-dRP species can be reduced by NaBH4 to generate the doublet of cross-linked species in Fig. 3 B. These borohydride cross-linking results are consistent with the hypothesis that T4 DNA ligase contains AP lyase activity.Figure 4The chemistry of AP lyase action accounts for DNA-enzyme and dRP-enzyme complexes following NaBH4treatment. This scheme is based on those presented for other AP lyase enzymes (7Tchou J. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11671-11677Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Shiff base reaction scheme requires attack by a free amino group of the AP lyase on the C1′ residue of the deoxyribose. This reactive nitrogen is referred to as N-enz. Other functional groups within the enzyme may assist in the β-elimination reaction as indicated. Covalent intermediates in the Schiff base reaction scheme labeled 1 and 2 may be reduced by borohydride to yield stable species with the protein cross-linked to an oligonucleotide or to a dRP moiety, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In other experiments, we found that it was not necessary to present the AP site in the context of a nick in DNA, although this is the preferred substrate. Borohydride trapping was observed when the 15-mer oligonucleotide was omitted from the standard nicked substrate, leaving a 5′-AP site adjacent to single-stranded DNA. We also observed cross-linking to a free oligonucleotide with a 5′-dRP site generated by the action of UDG on the 5′U-17-mer oligonucleotide (5′-32P-UCAAGCTTGAGGCCAAG). The efficiency of borohydride trapping with a single-stranded 5′-AP oligonucleotide was about 50% of that observed with the nicked oligonucleotide substrate. The single-stranded oligonucleotide substrate was used in some experiments described below to simplify preparation of large quantities of substrate for AP lyase assays. The borohydride trapping reaction is a very sensitive probe of AP lyase activity but is not always efficient because it acts on a transient intermediate in the overall AP lyase reaction. For DNA glycosylases that remove a base and attack the AP site in a sequential dual mechanism, such as FPG protein, this borohydride trapping procedure is relatively easy to control. It is more difficult to trap a large fraction of a protein that does not contain an intrinsic glycosylase activity because the NaBH4 required to cross-link the enzyme-DNA Schiff base intermediate can also react with the ring open form of the sugar residue to inactivate the substrate. As an independent assay for AP lyase activity, we monitored the release of free 5′-dRP from DNA as an acid or ethanol-soluble species, as shown in Fig. 5. When reactions were performed with a high concentration of the single stranded 5′-dRP-17-mer oligonucleotide, we found that dRP release was linear with time, showed a clear temperature optimum, and was inhibited by ATP as observed for the borohydride trapping assay. The ethanol-soluble species released by T4 DNA ligase in the presence of thioglycolic acid was observed to have the same chromatographic properties as the product released by FPG protein, which has a well characterized AP lyase activity (Fig.6 and Refs. 5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tchou J. Grollman A.P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6269-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Figure 6The putative 5′-dRP product released by DNA ligase has the same chromatographic properties as that released by FPG protein, a well characterized AP lyase. The 5′-32P U17 oligo pretreated with UDG was incubated with either FPG protein as a positive control (A) or with T4 DNA ligase (B) in the presence of 50 mm sodium thioglycolate. The product released by the lyase activity of FPG protein has been shown to react with thioglycolate to generate an anionic species (5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bricteux-Gregoire S. Verly W.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6269-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reaction of the β-elimination product with thioglycolate leads to reduction of the aldehyde, blocking the subsequent δ-elimination reaction for FPG protein. The ethanol-soluble reaction products were analyzed by chromatography on a Poros Q HPLC column using the indicated NaCl gradient. The intact oligonucleotide elutes from this column with the 1m NaCl step.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The borohydride trapping and dRP release assays show that T4 DNA ligase is an authentic AP lyase by the same criteria used to show that DNA pol β possesses AP lyase activity (10Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 11Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although T4 DNA ligase is capable of processing multiple AP site substrates (Fig. 5 A), the turnover number is less than 10% of the vigorous rate observed for FPG protein (5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the glycosylase activity of FPG protein is reported to be significantly slower than the AP lyase activity (5Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A lower turnover number for the AP lyase activity in T4 DNA ligase may be expected because the enzyme is likely to bind persistently to the gapped substrate generated by AP lyase action on a site previously cleaved by AP endonuclease. We have not yet identified the active site for the DNA ligase-associated AP lyase. The borohydride trapping reaction requires attack on the C1′ residue of deoxyribose by an N-terminal amino group or by an internal lysine (19Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the AP lyase activity is suppressed by ATP suggests that the active site lysine residue that is adenylated in DNA ligase (20Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) may be involved directly in the nucleophilic attack that promotes β-elimination. This residue is normally in close proximity to the nick in a DNA substrate in the course of a DNA ligation reaction. However, we have not ruled out the possibility that another lysine residue may be involved in this attack, because the deadenylated enzyme may have an altered conformation that interacts differently with DNA substrates containing 5′-dRP residues. It will be particularly interesting to map the active site residue in T7 DNA ligase that reacts in the borohydride trapping reaction because the structure of this enzyme has been determined (21Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This enzyme has the added advantage that it is relatively small, with only 359 amino acid residues. We have observed AP lyase activity using the borohydride trapping assay for the following four different ATP-dependent DNA ligases: T4 and T7 DNA ligase (Fig. 2), mtDNA ligase (12Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and DNA ligase I (data not shown). Because ATP-dependent DNA ligases as a class share structural and functional features (22Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 251-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it is likely that the presence of AP lyase activity will be conserved in this family. To date we have not been able to document AP lyase activity in bacterial DNA ligases from eitherE. coli or T. aquaticus either in the presence or the absence of their cofactor, NAD (data not shown). The critical question raised by our observations is whether the AP lyase activity associated with T4 DNA ligase plays a significant physiological role. A model for the action of T4 DNA ligase at AP sites is shown in Fig. 7. In living cells, AP sites are very rapidly incised by AP endonuclease to generate the sort of nicked AP substrate we have used in our reactions. The experiments reported here show that T4 DNA ligase can act as an AP lyase at these sites in the absence of ATP. Under these conditions, the deadenylated enzyme cannot seal the nick and instead facilitates β-elimination, leading to loss of the 5′-dRP residue. This produces the single nucleotide gap structure diagramed as species 5 in Fig. 7. This single base gap may be repaired by the action of DNA polymerase and the conventional strand sealing action of DNA ligase. It is also important to consider the action of T4 DNA ligase at incised AP sites in the presence of ATP, because a large fraction of DNA ligase may exist in the adenylated state in vivo. Our results suggest that the adenylated T4 DNA ligase has a reduced ability to promote β-elimination. Instead, when a T4 DNA ligase molecule that is activated by adenylation binds this nicked substrate, it seals the nick to regenerate an internal AP site, as shown in Fig. 1 and diagramed as species 3 in Fig. 7 A. The second product of the ligation reaction is a “disarmed” DNA ligase molecule that is no longer adenylated but is still in contact with the AP site. To test whether T4 DNA ligase is able to incise DNA on the 3′ side of an internal AP site (i.e., without prior action of an AP endonuclease), we performed the experiment in Fig. 7 B. This experiment shows that T4 DNA ligase is clearly capable of strand incision to yield a product with a slightly slower gel mobility than that produced by the well characterized AP lyase of FPG protein. This suggests that T4 DNA ligase is able to promote β-elimination but unlike FPG protein does not efficiently promote δ-elimination. This sort of incision reaction was not observed in Fig. 1 because that experiment employed a reduced AP site analogue. These results suggest that when T4 DNA ligase seals a nick generated by class II AP endonuclease, it may recognize the product as a mistake and employ its lyase activity to reopen the DNA. To test this prediction, we performed the experiment shown in Fig. 7 C. In this experiment, T4 DNA ligase was incubated with a 17-mer oligonucleotide containing a 5′-32P-dRP residue adjacent to a nonradioactive 12-mer. DNA ligase was able to ligate the 12-mer to the 5′-dRP-17 mer to generate a 29-mer with an internal 32P-dRP residue (lane 3of Fig. 7 C). A limited extent of ligation was observed without the addition of exogenous ATP (lane 2), presumably because a fraction of the T4 DNA ligase is purified in an adenylated form. The more efficient ligation in the presence of ATP was followed by incision on the 3′ side of the AP site to produce a labeled 12-mer with a 3′-dRP residue. Thus, the label transfer experiment in Fig.7 C confirms the model for the action of T4 DNA ligase at an AP site in the presence of ATP. The ring open 3′-dRP residue produced by AP lyase cannot be rejoined by DNA ligase due to the 2′-3′-double bond, but the 3′-dRP group would be susceptible to release by class II AP endonuclease. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the role of T4 DNA ligase in base excision repair may not be limited to the final step of strand closure. We thank J. Dunn, F. Johnson, Y. Matsumoto, and B. Weiss for helpful discussion and for comments on the manuscript and J. Tchou and J. Dunn for gifts of E. coli FPG protein and T7 DNA ligase, respectively."

In vivotransfection of mammary gland tissue with the luciferase gene was carried out by introducing the DNA constructs into the mammary ducts of both mice and sheep. The successful transfection of ewe mammary glands was demonstrated by the detection of luciferase activity in mammary gland biopsy material up to a month after a single administration of the construct. To test whether products of expression of transfected genes could be secreted into the milk in this system, the N-terminal secretory signal sequences of bovine β-lactoglobulin or the entire coding sequence of human α-lactalbumin were fused to the N terminus of the luciferase gene. After transfection with the modified luciferases, both murine and sheep milk could be shown to contain luciferase activity, whereas mice, which had been transfected with the nonmodified luciferase gene, did not secrete any activity in the milk. This approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of gene transfer in vivo into mammary gland epithelial cells using constructs delivering DNA via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

This approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of gene transfer in vivo into mammary gland epithelial cells using constructs delivering DNA via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Three major approaches are currently being used to achieve gene delivery into recipient organs: (i) animal virus-based vectors (retroviruses and adenoviruses), (ii) liposomal transfer, and (iii) receptor-mediated endocytosis (for review, see Refs. 1Cooper M.J.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In terms of wide application in human gene therapy, the first approach is limited by safety concerns with respect to the use of viral vectors, whereas the second approach has disadvantages associated with the cytotoxicity of Lipofectin for some organs and in vivo instability of liposomes. Since gene delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis does not make use either of viral vectors or liposomes, it appears to be the method of choice for gene transfer in vivo, although its application in human gene therapy thus far has been largely restricted by problems of high variability and lower efficiency of gene transfer, compared with the first two methods. These problems associated with receptor-mediated gene delivery are attributable to the fact that most parameters determining the efficiency of this process have not been characterized or optimized. In particular, the methods of preparation of DNA-containing complexes, the specificity of the receptor selected for delivery, the specific properties of target tissue, etc. may all be critical. To date very few receptors have been used for DNA delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis, including asialoglycoprotein (7Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol.

A serious problem with respect to many methods of gene delivery is the degradation of DNA in cellular lysosomes before it reaches the nuclei of transfected cells. Wu and co-workers (16Wu C.H.

To rescue DNA from cellular lysosomes, some authors have suggested the use of DNA-delivering constructs coupled with mutant adenoviruses (25Curiel D.T. Agarwal S. Wagner E. Cotten M. Proc. Natl.

Although impressive data on direct gene transfer to airway lung epithelium employing adenovirus·polylysine·DNA complexes have been obtained (21Gao L. Wagner E. Cotten M. Agarwal S. Harris C. Romer M. Miller L. Hu P.C. Curiel D. Hum.

Thus, the scarcity of reports appearing to date on in vivo receptor-mediated transfection makes their generalization impossible. We have previously investigated the use of insulin and the insulin receptor for gene delivery and demonstrated in vitro gene transfer by an (Ins-pLys)-DNA 1The abbreviations used are: Ins-pLys, insulin-polylysine conjugate; Ad5, human adenovirus type 5; EDS-76, duck egg drop syndrome virus; LA, α-lactalbumin; pLys, poly-l-lysine; Str-pLys, streptavidin-polylysine conjugate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; luc, luciferase; AU, arbitrary units. 1The abbreviations used are: Ins-pLys, insulin-polylysine conjugate; Ad5, human adenovirus type 5; EDS-76, duck egg drop syndrome virus; LA, α-lactalbumin; pLys, poly-l-lysine; Str-pLys, streptavidin-polylysine conjugate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; luc, luciferase; AU, arbitrary units. construct via the receptors of cultured cells (29Sobolev, A.

The insulin receptor is known to be widely represented in almost all tissues of mammals, which makes it promising for local gene transfection to virtually any organ. In the present report, we demonstrate for the first time in vivo insulin receptor-mediated gene transfer to mammary glands of mice and ewes. We analyze the effect of co-transfection of the mammary gland with avian and attenuated human adenoviruses on the level of gene expression (luciferase) and its persistence for several weeks. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of using receptor-mediated transfection of mammary gland tissue to enable the products of foreign genes to be secreted in the milk of transgenic animals. Our results have relevance both to gene therapy approaches and the potential production of proteins of importance in the milk of large mammals such as dairy cattle. Murine mammary epithelial HC-11 cells were grown (33Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin using a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (all Sigma). 18–20 g of female BALB/c mice and 3-year-old Romanov ewes were used. Bovine insulin (Sigma) was125I-iodinated with the use of IODO-GEN (Pierce). 90-kDa poly-l-lysine (pLys; Sigma) was labeled with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitro-[U-14C]benzene (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The preparation and purification of the conjugate were carried out as described previously (29Sobolev, A. S. (1988) International Conference on Medical Biochemistry, October 17–21, 1988, USSR Ministry of Health, Moscow.Google Scholar); briefly, bovine [125I]iodoinsulin conjugated with citraconic anhydride (Serva) to protect its terminal amino groups was covalently linked to [14C]pLys with the use of the bifunctional cross-linking reagent, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (Sigma) according to Jung et al. (34Jung G. Kohnlein W. Luders G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resultant conjugate was purified on a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham) column, and the citraconyl groups were then removed. The insulin/pLys molar ratio in different batches of the conjugate was between 5 and 10 insulin molecules per molecule of pLys. About 80% of the insulin reacted with the pLys, with the yield after purification procedure being ∼50%. Streptavidin (Molecular Probes) was linked to 90-kDa pLys with the use of N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate using the same procedure as that described above without the terminal amino group protection, and the conjugate was purified on a Sephacryl S-300 column. The pLys/streptavidin molar ratio was between 1 and 2 pLys molecules per molecule of streptavidin. The initial plasmid was pRSVL, kindly provided by Dr. D. Helinski (35de Wet J.R. Wood K.W. Deluca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). In this vector, the luciferase gene is under control of the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus. To prepare plasmid pRSV-spBLG-luc and all other constructions, site-directed mutagenesis was used (36Drutsa V.L. Kaberdin V.R. Koroleva O.N. Shilov I.A. Bioorgan. Khim. 1991; 17: 1487-1493PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids were digested with a restriction endonuclease, cutting at a unique site in the vicinity of the site selected for mutation and then treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the absence of dNTP to digest one strand of each end of the cleaved DNA. A mutagenic primer and two adaptor primers were then annealed to the single-stranded tails thus formed. The adaptors were sequences complementary to the opposite strands of DNA, which were needed to restore the sticky ends at the initial site of plasmid cleavage. The adaptor complementary to the strand to be mutagenized remained unphosphorylated at the 5′-end. The subsequent addition of T4 DNA ligase and T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTP restored the initial site of plasmid cleavage, filled the gaps, and closed the mutant strand into a circle. The wild type strand remained open because of the nonphosphorylated adaptor. Finally, the second mutant strand was formed by nick translation using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. After transformation, the yield of mutants was normally about 100%. To construct the plasmid with a signal peptide, the HindIII site of pRSVL was used with the adaptors 5′-GTGTGCACCTCCA-3′ and 5′-GTACCGGAATGCTA-3′ for the upper and bottom DNA strands, respectively. The following mutagenic oligonucleotide was used to prepare pRSV-spBLG-luc: 5′-CATCCTCTAG AGGATAGAAT GGCGCCGGGC CTTTCTTTAT GTTTTTGGCG TCTTCGACGA TGATGGCC-3′. To construct the plasmids of the pCMV series,HindIII-SmaI fragments of plasmid pRSVL (comprising the whole luciferase gene together with its 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions) were subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of plasmid pCRTM3 (Invitrogen). This vector permits expression of a protein from the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This generated the pCMV-luc plasmid. To generate the construct encoding the LA luciferase fusion protein, an NheI restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in pCMV-luc using the mutagenic primer 5′-GTTTTTGGCGT CTTCCGCTAG CATGGTTTAC CAACA-3′ by the same method of mutagenesis (36Drutsa V.L. Kaberdin V.R. Koroleva O.N. Shilov I.A. Bioorgan. Khim. 1991; 17: 1487-1493PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an NheI site containing pCMV-luc vector. In parallel, the human LA gene was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using human genomic DNA as a template. The primers for polymerase chain reaction contained BglII and NheI restriction sites for subsequent subcloning of the polymerase chain reaction product. The human LA gene thus obtained was then cloned into pGEM7Zf(+) vector (Promega), and the sequence was confirmed. Finally, the LA gene was excised using HindIII and NheI restriction sites and inserted into the modified NheI site containing pCMV-luc vector to generate plasmid pCMV-LA-luc. Duck egg drop syndrome (EDS-76) virus was grown as described (37Rosenkranz A.A. Antonenko Y.N. Smirnova O.A. Yurov G.K. Naroditsky B.S. Sobolev A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Chicken embryo lethal orphan virus was grown in 9-day-old chicken embryos; after a 3-day incubation, virus-containing allantois fluid was harvested (37Rosenkranz A.A. Antonenko Y.N. Smirnova O.A. Yurov G.K. Naroditsky B.S. Sobolev A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) dl312 strain was grown in the 293 cell line. After incubation, infected cells were harvested, centrifuged, homogenized, mixed with an equal volume of Freon 113, and then recentrifuged. The aqueous phase was used for virus purification. Virus-containing material was centrifuged through a discontinuous CsCl gradient. The viral bands were collected and centrifuged through a preformed linear gradient of CsCl. The viral bands were again collected and stored at 4 °C. Virion concentration was determined by spectrophotometric analysis (38Chardonnet Y. Dales S. Virology. 1970; 40: 462-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Virions (5 × 1011 virions/ml in 1.36 g/ml CsCl solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) were biotinylated (3 h at room temperature) with 7 μm biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinamide ester (Sigma) followed by dialysis against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Complex formation of Ins-pLys conjugate with plasmid DNA was carried out as described previously (31Rosenkranz A.A. Yachmenev S.V. Jans D.A. Serebryakova N.V. Murav'ev V.I. Peters R. Sobolev A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ins-pLys conjugate was added dropwise to the plasmid solution in 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, with mixing. Formation of virus-containing complexes was accomplished at pH 7.5 in 25 mm HEPES buffer with 150 mm NaCl and 0.25 mm EDTA by the sequential addition of Str-pLys, plasmid, and Ins-pLys to biotinylated viruses. Internalization of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (31Rosenkranz A.A. Yachmenev S.V. Jans D.A. Serebryakova N.V. Murav'ev V.I. Peters R. Sobolev A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) Ins-pLys plasmid construct was assessed by video-intensified microscopy using an AT200 cooled CCD camera (Photometrics) and Axioplan microscope (Zeiss). HC-11 cells were plated 2 days before an experiment. After washing with fresh RPMI 1640 medium, transfecting complexes (1–12.5 nm DNA) in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin buffered with HEPES, pH 7.5, were added to the cells and incubated for 3 or 18 h at 37 °C. A 5-fold excess of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and bicarbonate was then added, and the cells were placed in a CO2 incubator for 2 days unless otherwise indicated. A special device to introduce material into the milk duct of a mammary gland was constructed (32Sobolev, A. S., Rosenkranz, A. A., and Nikitin, V. A. (1994) Russian Patent 2025487.Google Scholar).2 Briefly, the device consisted of a body with a nipple-shaped hollow, a channel for delivery of negative pressure, a special sphincter dilator with an axial channel in the bottom of the hollow; it also had a special cannula, with a cavity to measure volumes that passed through the axial channel (32Sobolev, A. S., Rosenkranz, A. A., and Nikitin, V. A. (1994) Russian Patent 2025487.Google Scholar).2 25–75 μl and 75 ml of transfecting complexes in Hanks' solution containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin were introduced into the milk ducts per murine mammary gland and sheep mammary gland, respectively. Lactation of ewes was induced according to a 2-week regime of hormonal induction (39Fowler P. Knight C. Foster M. J. Dairy Res. 1991; 58: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity in cultured cells was assayed in the presence of CoA (40Simpson W.J. Hammond R.M. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1991; 6: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA, disrupted using 1% Triton X-100 (Serva) in the same buffer, and centrifuged. 50 μl of the resultant supernatant were mixed with 350 μl of 25 mmglycylglycine buffer, pH 7.8, containing 15 mmMgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmdithiothreitol, then 20 μl of 1 mm CoA and 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin were added, and the luminescence was measured using an LKB 1250 luminometer. A standard of 1 ng of luciferase (Sigma) corresponds to 1250 AU. Mammary glands were washed with Hanks' solution, homogenized in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 1 mm EGTA, 3 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and centrifuged. The luciferase activity was measured in the obtained supernatant as above. Biopsy material was frozen and kept in a liquid nitrogen until use. Milk proteins (10 μl of milk/lane) were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (12.5%) electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin and then for 60 min with a primary antibody. We used affinity-purified rabbit anti-luc obtained from Promega diluted 1:5000. After being washed with Tris-buffered Tween saline, membranes were incubated for 60 min with anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma), and the immunoblots were finally developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) as substrate.

Murine mammary epithelial HC-11 cells possess insulin receptors (data not shown) and are thus able to bind and internalize insulin molecules. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Ins-pLys plasmid construct was incubated with HC-11 cells for 3 h, and free excess insulin inhibited binding and internalization of the construct (Fig.1 a–d). Video-intensified microscopy of a single cell with higher magnification reveals that the construct was localized in the cytoplasm near the cell nuclei (Fig.1 e). The image was processed using a gradient Sobel image filter, which resulted in the direction-independent enhancement of brightness gradients in the image (44Pratt W.K. Digital Image Processing. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1978: 492-535Google Scholar). This processing revealed that the construct appeared to be localized in vesicular and/or tubular bodies, probably endocytotic compartments (Fig. 1 f). The (Ins-pLys)-pRSVL construct (12.5 nmplasmid DNA and a lysine/nucleotide ratio of 0.4) was used to transfect HC-11 cells, with luciferase activity readily detectable in cell lysates (4.9 ± 0.7 AU/106 cells). Excess free insulin almost completely inhibited the transfection (less than 0.5 AU). Endocytosed DNA is known to face many obstacles before it reaches the nucleus, one of which is degradation in endosomes/lysosomes. Adenoviruses are able to exit from endosomes along with other components of these vesicles, and this property of adenoviruses has been employed successfully to enhance the transformation efficiency of the transfecting constructs (25Curiel D.T. Agarwal S. Wagner E. Cotten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8850-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 26Curiel D.T. Wagner E. Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. Agarwal S. Li C.M. Loechel S. Hu P.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1992; 3: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We decided to test whether the replication-deficient human adenovirus, serotype 5, strain dl312 (Ad5) adenoviruses could increase transfection of mammary gland epithelial cells using our insulin-containing constructs. A significant increase in cellular luciferase activity was obtained when the virus was coupled directly to pLys through a streptavidin-biotin linkage; the activity was dependent on the Str-pLys/virion ratio in the construct (Fig.2 A). Free Ad5 was less efficient when co-incubated with (Ins-pLys)-pRSVL construct; for example, the addition of 3.3 × 1010 virions/6-cm dish 60-fold increased transfection of HC-11 cells by 5.1 nmIns-pLys construct. Greater addition of Ad5 led to cytotoxicity. Excess free insulin added together with the transfecting construct significantly decreased reporter gene expression, again indicating that transfection in this system was mainly an insulin-receptor-mediated process (Fig. 2 B). Avian adenoviruses (chicken embryo lethal orphan virus or EDS-76) lacking determinants for mammalian cells were also tested and found to be able to enhance HC-11 cell transfection provided they were linked to the transfecting constructs. Free avian viruses, in contrast to human Ad5, were unable to enhance transfection (data not shown). The (Ins-pLys)-pRSVL construct was infused into the milk ducts of mice. On days 1, 3, 6, and 9 the mice were sacrificed, their transfected and intact mammary glands and livers were homogenized, and luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase activity could be detected in extracts prepared from the transfected mammary glands over all 9 days, whereas no activity could be detected in the intact glands (Fig.3). We also tested mammary gland transfection using adenovirus-containing constructs. The (biotinylated Ad5-Str-pLys)-pRSVL-(Ins-pLys) (2.7 nm) construct was injected into the mouse milk ducts, and luciferase activity was measured in gland homogenates 2 days later, the activity being about 10 times higher than that after injection of the construct in the absence of viruses (179 ± 92 AU,n = 10 as compared with 18.6 ± 10.2 AUn = 9 of luciferase activity/g of tissue without adenoviruses). Increasing the concentration of DNA-delivering complex up to 30 nm led to a more than 10-fold increase in luciferase activity in tissue homogenates for (Ins-pLys)-DNA construct. In this case adenoviruses did not enhance transfection above that in their absence (Fig. 4), implying that increasing the amount of transfecting construct can enable a significant amount of construct to enter the endosomolytic pathway. Increasing the lysine/nucleotide ratio up to about 2 in the DNA-transfecting constructs led to a significant increase in luciferase activity in the transfected HC-11 cells; further increase reduced the activity (Fig. 5). In contrast to these in vitro results, we could not detect luciferase activity in homogenates of murine mammary glands after infusion into the ducts of the construct with a lysine/nucleotide ratio of 2. Sheep mammary glands were transformed with the (biotinylated EDS-76-Str-pLys)-pRSVL-(Ins-pLys) construct using the same approach. On days"

A rat liver enzyme active in catalyzing the ring opening has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and found to be active in the hydrolysis of ethylene, vinylene, and propylene carbonates to CO2 and the respective glycols. Neither thiocarbonates nor open chain carbonates served as substrate nor did a variety of esters, lactams, lactones, and related heterocycles. The enzyme was active, however, with imides and appears to be identical to rat liver imidase. The identification was confirmed by copurification of enzyme activities, by similarities in the pattern of inhibition, and by the reactivity with a polyclonal antibody directed against the enzyme purified here. Ethylene carbonate, a cyclic organic carbonate widely used industrially, is toxic when metabolically converted to ethylene glycol. A rat liver enzyme active in catalyzing the ring opening has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and found to be active in the hydrolysis of ethylene, vinylene, and propylene carbonates to CO2 and the respective glycols. Neither thiocarbonates nor open chain carbonates served as substrate nor did a variety of esters, lactams, lactones, and related heterocycles. The enzyme was active, however, with imides and appears to be identical to rat liver imidase. The identification was confirmed by copurification of enzyme activities, by similarities in the pattern of inhibition, and by the reactivity with a polyclonal antibody directed against the enzyme purified here. The systemic toxicity observed with ethylene carbonate, a cyclic organic carbonate that serves as a major intermediate in the plastics industry, was recognized as being similar to the effects of ethylene glycol (1Hanley T.R. Schuman A.M. Langvardt P.W. Rusek T.F. Watanabe P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When the cyclic carbonate was fed to rats, ethylene glycol accumulated as did more oxidized metabolic products (1Hanley T.R. Schuman A.M. Langvardt P.W. Rusek T.F. Watanabe P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Since simple hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate results in the formation of ethylene glycol (Reaction 1), we examined a number of commercially available esterases, expecting to find one capable of catalyzing the conversion. The survey included rabbit and porcine liver esterases and pancreatic lipase, the last enzyme having recently been shown to hydrolyze large, micellular organic carbonates (2Matsumoto K. Fuwa S. Shimojo M. Katajima H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan. 1996; 69: 2977-2987Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ethylene carbonate was not a substrate of any of these enzymes. Because of an interest in the family of enzymes that are active in detoxication, enzymes that are generally characterized by extremely broad substrate specificity (3Jakoby W.B. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20715-20718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we searched for activity toward the cyclic organic carbonate functional group.We report the isolation in homogeneous form of an enzyme from rat liver that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate as well as certain other cyclic organic carbonates but that is inactive toward linear organic carbonates and carboxyesters. Of specific interest is the finding that the isolated enzyme appears to be identical to one variously described as dihydropyrimidinase (EC 3.5.2.2), hydantoinase, dihydropyrimidine hydrase, and dihydropyrimidine aminohydrolase, an enzyme previously identified as a nonspecific imidase active with a large number of cyclic and linear imides (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSOrganic carbonates and their analogues were from Aldrich; sources of additional candidate substrates have been presented (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, other reagents and enzymes were from Sigma.ElectrophoresisPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with an X-cell Minigel Cell (Novex, San Diego) using the manufacturer's precast isoelectric focusing gels (pH 3–10 range) as well their 14% Tris-glycine gels; the latter were used with SDS by the method of Laemmli (5Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was conducted at 100 V for the first h, 200 V for the second h, and 500 V for the last 30 min. Protein standards for SDS, gradient-native, and isoelectric focusing gels were purchased from Novex, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Bio-Rad, respectively.The isoelectric focusing pattern was assessed after incubating 1 mg/ml of enzyme under the following conditions: with 60 units/ml of potato acid phosphatase at pH 5.0 for 90 min, with 20,000 units/ml of calf intestinal mucosa alkaline phosphatase at pH 8.0 for 90 min (both enzymes from Boehringer Manheim), or with 1 unit/ml of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase at pH 5.5 for 60 min.Covalently bound carbohydrate was measured by G. Gilbert Ashwell using a Dionex PA-1 ion exchange system; this technique is capable of detecting 1 mol of carbohydrate/mol of enzyme (6Gabriel O. Ashwell G. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Standard AssayEthylene carbonate was adopted as the standard assay substrate, and its hydrolysis was followed by estimating the formation of ethylene glycol. The product was oxidized by periodate to form 2 mol of formaldehyde, which was allowed to react with chromotropic acid to yield a colored product (7MacFadyen D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 158: 107-133Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml was incubated in 100 mmsodium pyrophosphate at pH 8.1 with 5 mm ethylene carbonate for 1 h at 25 °. The reaction was terminated by transfer to an ice bath and addition of 0.1 ml of 10 nH2SO4. After adding 0.2 ml of 10 mmpotassium periodate and incubation at 37 ° for 30 min, 0.25 ml of 0.1 m sodium arsenite was added, and the reaction mixture was maintained at room temperature for another 10 min. A 150-μl aliquot of each sample was mixed with 900 μl of chromotropic acid reagent. (The reagent was prepared from 200 mg of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,7-naphthalene disulfonic acid in 110 ml of water that was cooled in ice and to which 90 ml of concentrated H2SO4 were slowly added). The sample was heated at 95 ° for 30 min, and its absorbance was measured at 570 nm in cuvettes of 1-cm light path. Under these conditions, a change in A570 of 0.619 represents the formation of 2.0 μmol of formaldehyde from 1.0 μmol of ethylene glycol. The reaction is linear with time and with enzyme concentration for measurements of absorbance changes of less than 1.0. (Note that the yield of formaldehyde by periodate oxidation is 1 mol/mol from either propylene carbonate or vinylene carbonate).A unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate to form 1 μmol of ethylene glycol/min under standard assay conditions. Specific activity is in terms of units of activity/mg of enzyme. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as standard and the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).Continuous Spectrophotometric AssayThe standard assay is effective only with substrates that yield a compound with vicinal nucleophilic groups as products (7MacFadyen D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 158: 107-133Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). That is not the case for products derived from the linear carbonates of ethyl, propyl, and allyl alcohols that we followed by the formation of the respective alcohol. The alcohols were measured by coupling the hydrolysis of the carbonate with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase and measuring the formation of NADH. Although ethylene glycol was not an effective substrate in this dehydrogenase-coupled assay, the formation of each of the other noted alcohols could be readily measured. Included in a total volume of 1.0 ml were 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 2 mm NAD, 0.2 unit of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, and 0.2 unit of yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase. After 3 min, 0.04 units of the organic carbonate hydrolyzing enzyme was added followed by 5 mmtest substrate. The course of the reaction was followed at 340 nm with a Shimadzu UV1201 spectrophotometer. An absorbance change of 12.2 represents the formation of 1 μmol of acid from the respective alcohol.Other Enzyme AssaysEvidence of stereoselectivity was sought by monitoring hydrolysis of propyl carbonate by circular dichroism spectrometry with a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme incubation conditions were the same as for the standard spectrophotometric assay except for the increased volume, 3 ml, of the reaction vessel.Imidase activity was measured as described previously (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); activities with phthalimide, 6-dihydrouracil, patulin, and oxindole were followed by changes in absorbance at 298, 235, 331, and 390 nm, respectively.Hydrolysis of l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate was measured by thiol formation as assayed with DTNB 1The abbreviations used are: DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol; GSSG, glutathione disulfide. (9Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21088) Google Scholar). In a total volume of 1 ml, 2 μg of enzyme in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate at pH 8.1 were incubated for 1 h at 25 ° with 5 mmsubstrate and 0.1 mm DTNB; changes in absorbance were monitored at 412 nm (ε412 = 14,150m−1 cm−1).Luminol as a possible substrate was examined by chemiluminescence of the expected product in the presence of peroxidase (10Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Cook J. Black C.D.V. Russo A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Enzyme, 10 μg, was incubated in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate at pH 8.1 with 10 μm luminol. After 1 h, 10 μl of 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide were added along with 20 units of horseradish peroxidase, and luminescence was measured with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer.The possibility of hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides was examined by incubating candidates for substrate at 1 mm with 2 μg of enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, aliquots were applied to cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates containing a fluorescent indicator (Eastman Kodak). Plates were developed with 2-propanol:ammonium hydroxide:water (70:15:15), and the nucleotides were visualized under UV light. Carboxyesterase activity was measured with 4-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate (11Kim D.-L. Yang Y.-S. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression. Purif. 1990; 1: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Molecular Weight DeterminationCentrifugation was carried out with a Beckman XLA analytical centrifuge and a Ti-60 rotor using a 12-mm double sector cell containing 3-mm columns of protein solution (300 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, with or without 1 mm DTT) and diffusate (12Darawshe S. Millar D.B. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Minton A.P. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 69: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) layered over FC-47 fluorocarbon. Exact values of loading absorbance at 280 nm were obtained from initial scans taken just after speed had been reached. Rotor speeds of 5000 and 7000 rpm were employed at temperatures of 5 and 25 °C. Radial scans were performed at 6–8-h intervals; equilibrium was judged to have been reached when the calculated difference between successive scans was a flat line, indistinguishable from zero within experimental error. The enzyme was prepared by dialysis overnight against two changes of Tris-HCl at pH 7.8. A partial specific volume for the protein of 0.73 ml/g and a buffer density of 1.003 g/ml were used.ImmunologyAntibody to the enzyme, purified as described below and homogeneous upon SDS-gel electrophoresis, was prepared by Lofstrand Labs Ltd. (Gaithersburg, MD) 10 weeks after the initial inoculation with five booster doses, yielding a titer of greater than 1:32,000. The antibody was purified by salting out (between 0.3 and 0.5 saturation with ammonium sulfate), dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, and by elution with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl at pH 7.8 from a DEAE-Sepadex column. Antibody diluted with 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate at pH 7.8, was incubated with enzyme at 4 ° overnight, and the suspension was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at the same temperature. The supernatant fluid was tested for enzyme activity.PurificationLivers from young male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were shipped in DriIce by Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers, AZ) and stored for periods of up to 3 months at −80 °C. Unless otherwise noted, all procedures were conducted in a cold room at 4 °C or in an ice bath. The pH of all buffers refers to measurements taken after equilibration at room temperature.Step 1: ExtractAbout 300 g of liver were partially thawed and suspended in 3-fold their volume of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 nm pepstatin A, and 2 μg/liter antipain adjusted to pH 8.0 with HCl). Each half of this suspension was homogenized for 30 s in a Waring blender and then filtered though a double layer of cheesecloth. The combined filtrate was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g, and the residue was discarded.Step 2: Salting OutAmmonium sulfate, 25.2 g/100 ml was added to the solution, which was stirred for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant fluid was treated with an additional 10.8 g of ammonium sulfate/100 ml. The resultant precipitate was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min), suspended in 100 ml of Buffer A, and dialyzed overnight against three changes of 1, 1, and 4 liters, respectively, of the same buffer.Step 3: DEAE-SephacelThe enzyme solution was applied to a column (4.5 × 50 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A and was washed with an additional liter of the buffer. Protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 3.0 liters of the same buffer containing from 0 to 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 1, DEAE). Active fractions of approximately 7 ml each were pooled (fractions 290–320).Figure 1Elution patterns from columns of DEAE-Sephadex (DEAE), red agarose (RA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and CM-Sephadex (CM) using conditions described in the text. Cyclic carbonate hydrolysis activity (♦) and imidase activity (○) are indicated by straight lines.

The column was subsequently washed with 150 ml of Buffer B and eluted with a linear salt gradient in Buffer B ranging from 0 to 1 mNaCl. Active enzyme was collected, pooled (Fig. 1, RA), concentrated to 20 ml with an Amicon Diaflo PM10 membrane, and dialyzed overnight against three changes of, respectively, 1, 1, and 2 liters of Buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate containing 1 mm DDT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm pepstatin A, and 2 μg/liter antipain adjusted to pH 6.8).Step 5: HydroxyapatiteThe dialysate was applied to a column (2.0 × 20 cm) of hydroxyapatite gel (Sigma) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. After washing the column with 100 ml of Buffer C, enzyme was eluted with 400 ml of a linear salt gradient of Buffer C and Buffer C made 0.4 m in potassium phosphate at pH 6.8 (Fig. 1, HA). Pooled, active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5 ml with a PM10 membrane and dialyzed against Buffer E (Buffer C at pH 6.5 made 1 mm in EDTA).Step 6: CM-SepharoseThe dialyzed protein solution was loaded onto a column (1.0 × 15 cm) of CM-Sepharose previously equilibrated with Buffer E. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer E and eluted with a 120-ml linear salt gradient from 0 to 400 mm NaCl in Buffer E (Fig. 1, CM).Step 7: SephacrylAfter concentration to 1 ml, the enzyme solution was used to charge a column (2 × 80 cm) of Sephacryl S-400 (Amersham) that had been equilibrated with a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm DDT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and the three proteinase inhibitors. The column was developed with the aforementioned Tris buffer, resulting in the elution of the enzyme close to the front.RESULTSBased on the standard assay with ethylene carbonate as substrate, the enzyme responsible for Reaction 1 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by essentially conventional means in yields of 4–5% from rat liver. The enzyme is a homotetramer with subunits of identical size that were estimated to be 55,000 Da by SDS gel electrophoresis; a single band of protein was seen (Fig. 2,lane 1) in the same position whether or not the enzyme was heated with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (5Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, an Mr of approximately 220,000 was estimated; the Mr remained the same when equilibrium was established in the presence or in the absence of 1 mm DTT.Figure 2Electrophoresis patterns using 2 μg of the purified enzyme for SDS gels (lane 1) and for isoelectric focusing in the pH 3–10 range (lane 2). Lanes 3–7 represent isoelectrofocusing of the enzyme with the following additions: lane 3, 5 mm GSSG for 30 min;lane 4, 5 mm GSSG for 180 min; lane 5, 1 mm DTNB for 20 min; lane 6, 1 mm H2O2; lane 7, 1 mm DTT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of pHThe enzyme was most stable at slightly alkaline pH but not below neutrality. At the pH of the purification buffer, 7.8, activity was unaffected by storage of the purified enzyme at 4 and −80 °C for 3 months. Storage at pH 6.3 and 4 °C led to a 14% loss of activity after 3 days.As shown in Fig. 3, the pH optimum for the enzyme was at approximately 8.1 after correction for spontaneous hydrolysis. A correction was also required for the spontaneous hydrolysis of the other two active cyclic carbonates that were substrates.Figure 3Cyclic carbonate activity as a function of pH using the otherwise standard assay method with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 6.5–7.75) or sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.0 and above). Product formation due to spontaneous hydrolysis (⋄), in the presence of enzyme (□), and the difference due to enzyme action (•) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Redox EffectsAlthough the purified enzyme presented as a single protein band on both SDS and gradient native gels, gel isoelectric focusing displayed multiple protein bands between a pH 7.2 and 7.4 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Treatment of the protein with bovine alkaline phosphatase, potato acid phosphatase, orClostridium neuraminidase did not alter the pattern (not shown), and the determination of the presence of less than 1 mol of carbohydrate/mol of protein suggested that glycosylation was not responsible for the multiple bands. The multiple band pattern could be manipulated, however, with oxidizing and reducing reagents. In the presence of 1 mm DTT, major bands were apparent between pH 7.2 and 7.5. In contrast, 5 mm GSSG yielded at least nine protein bands with Pi values between 6.3 and 7.2; the shift to lower Pi was enhanced progressively over the course of a 3-h exposure to GSSG (lanes 3 and 4). A similar shift to lower Pi was observed with 1 mm DTNB (lane 5) or 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (lane 6) as oxidizing agents. The effect of GSSG could be reversed by subsequent incubation with DTT (not shown).Changes in Pi were reflected in enzyme activity. Incubation with 2 mm DTT resulted in dramatic loss of activity (Fig.4) that was irreversible if 20 mm DTT was used (not shown). Incubation of enzyme with 1 mm GSSG or 1 mm DTNB, however, resulted in a slight but distinct increase in activity. Observations of such changes in activity as the result of formation of mixed disulfides with glutathione have been made (13Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M.

Stoichiometry was estimated for ethylene carbonate; at completion, 0.99 and 1.00 μmol of ethylene glycol, respectively, were formed from 1.0 μmol of ethylene carbonate in two trials.When linear carbonates were used, diethyl, dipropyl, and allylmethyl carbonates were not substrates at concentrations of 1 and 10 mm. Also inactive in the same concentration range were certain related compounds that included the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides of adenine, uridine, and cytidine, esters and such heterocycles as (R)-pantolactone, tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxyl-ate, patulin, oxindole, 5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylate, luminol, and ethylene and vinylene trithiocarbonates. The enzyme did not display esterase activity with 4-nitrophenyl acetate or ethyl acetate nor phosphatase activity with 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate was not inhibited by the serine esterase inhibitor paraoxon at 3 mm.As with many of the substrates for the enzymes of detoxication (3Jakoby W.B. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20715-20718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Km values for the cyclic carbonates were in the millimolar range, although Vmax values were substantial. Thus, for ethylene, vinylene, and propylene carbonates, the respective Km values were 26, 37, and 4 mm, and the respective Vmax values were 65, 56, and 8 μmol min−1 mg−1.Since the product of propylene carbonate has an asymmetric center, evidence was sought for stereoselective hydrolysis. Under conditions previously employed for measuring circular dichroism with imidase (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no evidence could be obtained for the stereoselective appearance of an asymmetric product over the course of 18 h of incubation with enzyme.Imides as SubstratesAlthough a variety of heterocyclic compounds were tested and found inactive as noted above, one group, the imides, was effective as substrates. Phthalimide, the standard assay substrate for imidase, as well as 3,4-pyridyl-dicarboximide and 6-methyl dihydrouracil, were each substrates for the carbonate-hydrolyzing enzyme exactly as presented for rat liver imidase (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km for phthalimide had previously been found to be 3 mm with imidase (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was 3.5 mm for the enzyme purified here.When used as competitive inhibitors of propylene carbonate hydrolysis, phthalimide had a Ki of 5 mm, and N-carbamoyl-β-alanine, another substrate for the imidase reaction, had a Ki of 0.2 mm. Although ethylene carbonate appeared to be a competitive inhibitor of phthalimide hydrolysis, a Ki could not be accurately estimated at these high concentrations, i.e. greater than 0.1 m.Comparison of Imidase and Carbonate HydrolaseExamination of Table I will confirm that the two enzyme activities were purified concomitantly and that, in each case, only a single protein species was apparent at each step of purification (Fig.1). A dose-response curve with rabbit antibody raised against the electrophoretically homogeneous rat carbonate hydrolase was identically inhibitory to both carbonate and imide hydrolysis (data not shown). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, a precipitate could be removed, leaving the supernatant solution without activity; upon resuspension of the antigen-antibody precipitate, both activities were observed.Table ISummary of purification with ethylene carbonate and phthalimide as substratesVolumeTotal proteinSpecific activityImide/EtCO3EtCO3Phthalimidemlmgμmol/min/mgExtract600130800.0240.0502.1Salt precipitation10347200.0810.1101.4DEAE-Sephacel200822.85.01.8Red Agarose112264.07.71.9Hydroxyapatite326.45.915.62.6CM-Sepharose101.68.124.43.0Sephacryl S400151.26.721.73.2 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONExamination of the substrate specificity of the rat liver enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates led to the evaluation of compounds bearing other functional groups. Examples of linear organic carbonates, simple esters, lactones, lactams, and a number of a variety of heterocyclic compounds were inactive as substrates with the exception of imides. Several lines of evidence point to the identity of the newly isolated cyclic carbonate-hydrolyzing activity to an enzyme that this laboratory had previously described as an imidase (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that also plays a normal physiological role as an imidase in the pyrimidine salvage pathway (17Griffith O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, hydrolytic activity toward imides and carbonates co-purified throughout the various steps in the purification process (Table I). The isolated enzyme appears to be the only protein with either type of catalytic activity in rat liver; no second peak of active protein was apparent at any stage of purification (Fig. 1). Purified polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the homogeneous enzyme inactivated both activities in a similar manner. Finally, an imide and a cyclic carbonate were competitive inhibitors of carbonate hydrolase and imidase, respectively; the Ki for phthalimide with ethylene carbonate and this preparation of the enzyme, 5 mm, was close to the Km obtained for phthalimide, 3 mm, with the imidase purified by either the original method (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the significantly different method presented here.The mechanism previously outlined for the hydrolysis of imides (4Yang Y.-S. Ramaswamy S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appears to apply equally to the activity toward cyclic organic carbonates. The reaction would be expected to take the form of protonation of the carbonyl group of the carbonate, thereby providing a strong electrophilic center for the addition of water. Upon such addition, ring opening would be followed by elimination of CO2. The finding of this enzyme in rat liver provides a metabolic pathway for the conversion of cyclic organic carbonates to their respective glycols. The systemic toxicity observed with ethylene carbonate, a cyclic organic carbonate that serves as a major intermediate in the plastics industry, was recognized as being similar to the effects of ethylene glycol (1Hanley T.R. Schuman A.M. Langvardt P.W. Rusek T.F. Watanabe P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When the cyclic carbonate was fed to rats, ethylene glycol accumulated as did more oxidized metabolic products (1Hanley T.R. Schuman A.M. Langvardt P.W. Rusek T.F. Watanabe P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since simple hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate results in the formation of ethylene glycol (Reaction 1), we examined a number of commercially available esterases, expecting to find one capable of catalyzing the conversion. The survey included rabbit and porcine liver esterases and pancreatic lipase, the last enzyme having recently been shown to hydrolyze large, micellular organic carbonates (2Matsumoto K. Fuwa S.

https://openalex.org/W2159996144,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanism of transcriptional activation of human chorionic gonadotropin-α (hCGα) gene by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in trophoblast cells. We stably transfected hCGα promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs into Rcho-1 trophoblast cells and monitored the promoter activities. −290-base pair hCGα promoter containing a tandem repeat of cAMP response element (CRE) was activated by EGF in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Deletion analysis of hCGα promoter suggested an involvement of CRE in EGF-induced hCGα transcriptional activation. Moreover, the hCGα promoter, of which both CREs were mutated, did not respond to EGF. These results indicate that EGF activates the hCGα gene transcription through CRE. Although EGF did not alter the amount of CRE-binding protein (CREB), EGF induced CREB phosphorylation. We next examined the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation by EGF. Protein kinase C inhibitors (H7, staurosporin, and chelerythrine) inhibited EGF-induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas either mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 inhibitor (PD98059) or protein kinase A inhibitor (H8) showed no effect. Furthermore, H7 and staurosporin but not H8 inhibited hCGα promoter activation by EGF. In conclusion, EGF promotes hCGα gene transcription via the CRE region probably by phosphorylating CREB mainly through the protein kinase C pathway in trophoblast cells.

Human chorionic gonadotropin plays a critical role at the early stage of pregnancy and is progressively produced as human trophoblasts differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts (10Morrish D.W. Bhardwaj D. Dabbagh L.K. Marusyk H. Siy O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 65: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). EGF has been shown to increase hCGα and hCGβ mRNA level and their stability (16Cao H. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, it remains unclear whether or not EGF increases the transcriptional activity of hCG genes. hCG consists of hCGα and hCGβ subunits (17Pierce J. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). hCGα gene is present as a single copy gene on chromosome 6q21.1–23 (18Fiddes J.C. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar), whereas hCGβ consists of six closely spaced genes (19Jameson J.L. Lindell C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5100-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The structure of hCGα promoter is simpler and is well studied (19Jameson J.L. Lindell C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5100-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study we analyzed the effect of EGF on the hCGα gene. In this study, we used Rcho-1 cells to examine the molecular mechanism of EGF effect on the hCGα gene transcription. The Rcho-1 cell line was established from a transplantable rat choriocarcinoma (20Teshima S. Shimosata Y. Koide T. Kuroki M. Kiruchi M. Aizawa M. Gann. 1983; 74: 205-212PubMed Google Scholar) and can be manipulated to proliferate or differentiate along the trophoblast giant cell pathway (21Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Several genes have been shown to be transcriptionally activated during Rcho-1 cell differentiation (22Yamamoto T. Roby K.F. Kwok S.C.M. Soares M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6517-6523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Shida M.M. Ng Y.K. Soares M.J. Linzer D.I.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 181-188PubMed Google Scholar). Using Rcho-1 cells stably transfected with hCGα promoter-CAT construct, we studied the EGF effect on the transcriptional activity of hCGα gene and analyzed the mechanism of EGF action. The Rcho-1 cell line was routinely maintained in subconfluent conditions with NCTC-135 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (20% FBS/NCTC) as reported previously (21Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Differentiation was induced by growing to confluence in FBS-supplemented culture medium and then replacing the serum supplementation with 1% horse serum (1% HS/NCTC). −290hαCAT was kindly provided by Dr. John Nilson (24Bokar J.A. Keri R.A. Farmerie T.A. Fenstermaker R.A. Andersen B. Hamernik D.L. Yun J. Wagner T. Nilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5113-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of −290hαCAT were generated by the polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into pSV0CAT (Promega). CRE-tk-CAT and CRE-CRE-tk-CAT were generated by inserting one or two copies of CRE in the native orientation directly up-stream of the tk-CAT. −290hα (mCRE)CAT, both CREs of which were mutated, was generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced using T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kits (Amersham). Rcho-1 cells were transfected using a liposome-mediated delivery system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (23Shida M.M. Ng Y.K. Soares M.J. Linzer D.I.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 181-188PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were established by co-transfecting 9 μg of promoter-reporter construct plasmid DNA with 1 μg of pSV2Neo DNA. Selection of stable transfectants was performed by growth in the presence of G418 (250 μg/ml). Stably transfected Rcho-1 cells were incubated in 20% FBS/NCTC medium for 2 days, and then culture was shifted to 1% HS/NCTC. EGF from mouse submaxillary glands (Toyobo) was used for the EGF stimulation experiments. EGF treatment was started when the medium was replaced with 1% HS/NCTC. Protein concentrations of the whole cell extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay system. CAT reactions were carried out with 50 μg of protein for 3 h at 37 °C. The acetylated and nonacetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by a thin layer chromatography, autoradiographed, and quantitated by an image analyzer system (BAS2000, FUJIX). All experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. Synthesized oligonucleotides were obtained from Vector Research (Osaka, Japan). The following oligonucleotides were used in this study. CRE upper strand, 5′-AAATTGACGTCATGGTAA-3′; CRE lower strand, 5′-TTACCA TGACGTCAATTT-3′; mCRE upper strand, 5′-AAATTGATCTCA TGGTAA-3′; and mCRE lower strand, 5′-TTACCATGAGATCAATTT-3′. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form double-stranded DNA, which contained 5′-AGCT or -TCGA overhangs to facilitate labeling. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Rcho-1 cells according to a previously described procedure (25Ramos R.A. Nishio Y. Maiyar A.C. Simon K.E. Ridder C.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extraction buffer contained an additional phosphatase inhibitor (NaF) at 10 mm. Protein concentrations of extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 2 μg poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (1 × 104 cpm) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To demonstrate binding specificity, unlabeled CRE or mCRE was used. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts (150 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After a blocking reaction (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h, membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer with antisera against rat CREB (1:3,000 dilution) or against rat phosphorylated CREB (1:2, 500 dilution) for overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc., 1:3,000), the membranes were developed by using Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reprobing, the membranes were submerged in a stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min with occasional agitation. After washing twice in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, the membranes were blocked for 1 h and incubated with a rat CREB antiserum (1:3,000). CREB and phosphorylated CREB antisera were raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide (amino acids 1–205) and a synthetic phosphopeptide (amino acids 123–136), respectively (Update Biotechnology, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were resolved and transferred in the same way as above. Membranes were initially incubated in TNE-50 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature, washed briefly in TNE-50 without milk, and then incubated in TNE-50 containing a 1 × 106 cpm/ml CRE as a probe and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). After the incubation, the blots were washed three times for 5 min each with TNE-50, air dried, and then exposed to a Kodak XAR film. Statistical analysis was performed by unpairedt test. All experiments were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate and repeated at least three times with similar results. Rcho-1 cells morphologically and functionally differentiate in the differentiation medium (1% HS) throughout the culture period as reported previously (21Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). −290hαCAT activity showed a differentiation-dependent increase in stably transfected Rcho-1 cells (Fig.1 B, Control). To study the effect of EGF on the differentiation-dependent increase in hCGα promoter activity, Rcho-1 cells stably transfected with −290hαCAT were treated with various concentrations of EGF (0–10 nm) for days 2–8 of culture. Cells were harvested on day 8, and CAT activities were determined. EGF enhanced the hCGα promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 10 nm (2.7-fold enhancement) (Fig.1 A). EGF at 30 nm or more did not show a further promotion (data not shown). We next performed the time course study on the promotive effect of EGF on the differentiation-dependent increase in hCGα promoter activity for days 4–10 of culture. EGF at 10 nmpromoted the differentiation-dependent increase in hCGα promoter activity on days 8 and 10 of culture. Maximal EGF effect was observed on day 8 (Fig. 1 B). Clonal Rcho-1 cell culture under a differentiation condition contains a mixture of proliferative small cells and terminally differentiated giant cells. We investigated whether or not EGF affected the cell number and the proportion of the small and giant cells population throughout day 10 of culture. Neither the cell number nor the percentage of the small and giant cells changed by 10 nmEGF treatment up to day 10 (data not shown). The −290-base pair region of the hCGα promoter contains several consensus sequences: trophoblast-specific element, GATA element, and CRE (16Cao H. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine the region responsible for EGF effect, various deletion mutants were generated and stably transfected into Rcho-1 cells. Fig. 2(left) shows a diagram of deletion mutants used in the study. Stable transfectants were cultured with or without EGF (10 nm) on days 2–8 of culture. CAT activities in EGF-treated and untreated cells were compared (Fig. 2, right). Although transcriptional activities in deletion mutants up to −142 base pairs were promoted by EGF to an extent (2.6–2.8-fold) similar to that in −290hαCAT, −128hαCAT, which contains only one CRE, showed a substantially decreased response to EGF. −110hαCAT, which does not contain CRE, did not respond to EGF. −290hαCAT, and its deletion mutants up to −142 base pairs also responded to forskolin. −128hαCAT showed an impaired response to forskolin, and −110hαCAT did not respond to forskolin (data not shown), suggesting that CRE was functional in Rcho-1 cells. These results imply that CRE may be a response element for EGF. To further confirm the involvement of CRE for the EGF responsiveness of hCGα gene, an 18-base pair region containing CRE was inserted into the tk-CAT vector, and the transcriptional activation by EGF was estimated. Rcho-1 cells were stably transfected with CRE-CRE-tk-CAT, CRE-tk-CAT, or tk-CAT gene and treated with or without EGF (10 nm) for days 2–8 of culture (Fig.3 A, left). CAT activities in EGF-treated and untreated cells were compared. EGF significantly promoted CRE-CRE-tk-CAT activity by 2.2-fold and substantially enhanced CRE-tk-CAT activity, whereas the tk-CAT gene did not respond to EGF (Fig. 3 A, middle). The increase in CRE-CRE-tk-CAT activity by EGF was comparable with that in −290hαCAT (Figs. 1 A and 2). Forskolin also showed a similar effect on these genes. Forskolin significantly promoted CRE-CRE-tk-CAT activity, and a decreased response was observed in CRE-tk-CAT, whereas tk-CAT did not respond to forskolin (Fig.3 A, right). These results indicate that EGF confers a transcriptional activation even to a heterologous promoter through CRE in trophoblast cells. Furthermore, −290hα(mCRE)CAT, both CREs of which were mutated, did not respond to EGF (10 nm, 6 days of treatment) (Fig.3 B, middle) as well as to forskolin (Fig.3 B, right). These data strongly support the idea that the CRE on the hCGα promoter is essential for EGF responsiveness. To analyze the possible change by EGF in the transcriptional factors associating with CRE, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear proteins from EGF-treated and untreated Rcho-1 cells (Fig. 4 A). CRE formed several major DNA-protein complexes in both untreated (lane 2) and 10 nm EGF-treated (lane 5) Rcho-1 cells. These binding complexes seemed specific because these complexes were competed by excess amount of cold CRE (lanes 3 and 6) but not by excess amount of cold mutated CRE (lanes 4 and 7). No obvious differences were found in CRE-binding nuclear proteins between EGF-treated and untreated cells. These results suggest that EGF might not alter CRE-binding proteins. To further analyze CRE-binding proteins, we performed Southwestern blot analysis using nuclear proteins from EGF-treated and untreated Rcho-1 cells. Southwestern blotting using 32P-labeled CRE as a probe showed expression of a 43-kDa protein in nuclear protein samples from both EGF-treated and untreated Rcho-1 cells (Fig. 4 B). The protein seemed to be the CREB because of its size (26Montminy M.R. Bileziiikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). We also observed other bands in the Southwestern blotting, suggesting a possible involvement of other less defined CRE-binding proteins. The expression of CREB was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-CREB antibody. A 43-kDa CREB was observed in nuclear protein samples from both EGF-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 4 C). The band was not observed when the anti-CREB antiserum was substituted with a nonimmune serum (data not shown). The amounts of CREB were not different in each group. It is known that CREB is mainly phosphorylated at Ser133 and that the phosphorylation is essential for gene activation by CREB (27Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of hCGα promoter activation by EGF through CRE, we determined whether or not EGF phosphorylates CREB protein. Nuclear extracts were obtained from EGF-treated (10 nm for 5 or 30 min) and untreated cells, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody (Fig.5 A). Although phosphorylated CREB was not observed in nuclear proteins from untreated cells, it was present in cells treated for 5 min with EGF, and the amount of phosphorylated CREB decreased by 30 min of EGF treatment (Fig.5 A, upper panel). Anti-CREB antibody detected a similar amount of CREB in nuclear protein samples from untreated and EGF-treated (5 and 30 min) cells (Fig. 5 A, lower panel), showing that the changes in CREB phosphorylation by EGF were specific. We examined the time dependence of EGF effect on the CREB phosphorylation throughout 3 h (data not shown) and observed that the EGF effect was the most at 5 min. The results suggest that EGF promotes hCGα gene transcriptional activity through CRE, at least partly, by phosphorylating CREB. EGF activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and induces transcription by phosphorylating transcriptional factors (28Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 29Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation by EGF, we tested the involvement of MAP kinase cascade. Rcho-1 cells were left untreated or were pretreated for 1 h with MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059 (50 μm)) and then treated with EGF (10 nm, 5 min). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody. Pretreatment with the MEK1 inhibitor did not inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB as well as CREB expression (Fig. 5 B). In MAP kinase assays using myelin basic protein as a substrate, we observed that EGF activated MAP kinase and that PD98059 at 50 μm suppressed EGF-induced MAP kinase activation in Rcho-1 cells (data not shown). These results suggested that the MAP kinase cascade might not be a dominant pathway of CREB phosphorylation in Rcho-1 cells. To further analyze the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation by EGF, we tested whether protein kinase A (PKA) and/or PKC pathways are involved. Rcho-1 cells were left untreated or pretreated for 30 min with PKC inhibitors (H7 (10 μm), staurosporin (50 nm), chelerythrine (5 μm)), or a PKA inhibitor (H8 (10 μm)) and then stimulated with EGF (10 nm, 5 min) or with forskolin (10 μm, 1 h). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitors inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig.6, upper panel). Pretreatment with a PKA inhibitor H8 did not inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB. H8 inhibited forskolin-induced phosphorylation of CREB, showing the efficiency of the PKA inhibitor used in the study. Either PKC or PKA inhibitors did not affect CREB expression (Fig. 6, lower panel). These results suggest that EGF phosphorylates CREB mainly through the PKC-dependent pathway in trophoblast cells. To study the effects of PKC and PKA inhibitors on the EGF-enhanced hCGα promoter activity, Rcho-1 cells stably transfected with −290hαCAT were treated with EGF (10 nm) in the absence or the presence of PKC inhibitors (H7 (10 μm), staurosporin (50 nm)), or a PKA inhibitor (H8 (10 μm)) for days 2–8 of culture. Although H8 did not reduce the EGF-promoted hCGα promoter activity (2.6-fold), PKC inhibitors (H7 and staurosporin) significantly reduced the enhancement by EGF (Fig. 7). These PKC inhibitors alone did not reduce hCGα promoter activity (data not shown), indicating that they may specifically inhibit the EGF effect. In addition, H7 (10 μm) did not affect P-450 side chain cleavage (P-450scc) gene transcription but rather promoted progesterone secretion by Rcho-1 cells (31Yamamoto T. Chapman B.M. Soares M.J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 111: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the PKC inhibitors may not be due to cell toxicity. All these results suggest that phosphorylation of CREB through the PKC pathway may be involved in the hCGα promoter activation by EGF. Many studies have shown the importance of EGF in the maintenance of pregnancy and in fetal development. EGF deficiency during pregnancy causes abortion in mice (4Tsutsumi O. Oka T. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1987; 156: 241-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fetal mice lacking the EGF receptors are retarded in growth and die at midgestation in a 129/Sv genetic background (5Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In humans, the amounts of placental EGF receptors are decreased in intrauterine growth-retarded pregnancy (32Fujita Y. Kurachi H. Morishige K. Amemiya K. Terakawa N. Miyake A. Tanizawa O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 72: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The promotion of hCG gene expression by EGF might be a part of the pregnancy-supporting system. It has been known that EGF stimulates hCG secretion by trophoblast cells (33Benveniste R. Speeg K.V. Carpenter G. Cohen S. Linder J. Rabinowitz D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1978; 46: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cao et al. showed that EGF increased hCGα and hCGβ mRNA level by stabilizing them in JEG-3 cells (16Cao H. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, it has not been known whether or not EGF promotes hCG gene transcription. In this report, we first showed that EGF increased the transcriptional activity of hCGα gene using Rcho-1 cells. Rcho-1 cells are derived from a rat choriocarcinoma. Although rodent placentas do not express chorionic gonadotropin, the hCGα gene promoter when expressed as part of a transgene is active in placentas and pituitary of transgenic mice (24Bokar J.A. Keri R.A. Farmerie T.A. Fenstermaker R.A. Andersen B. Hamernik D.L. Yun J. Wagner T. Nilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5113-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Also we observed differentiation-dependent transcriptional activation of hCGα gene (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the Rcho-1 cell line seems to possess the activation system of hCGα gene as well as human trophoblast cells. The EGF effect to promote the hCGα transcriptional activity was dose- and time-dependent; however, EGF was less effective on day 10 of culture than on day 8, suggesting that terminally differentiated cells have a reduced response to EGF. EGF increases the transcriptional activities in various genes; EGF stimulation of gastrin transcription is mediated through a GC-rich gastrin EGF response element (34Merchant J.L. Demediuk B. Brand S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2686-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of the ovine P-450 side chain cleavage enzyme gene (CYP11A1) is stimulated by EGF through AP-1-like site (35Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Watanabe G. Johnson J. Eklund N. Lastowiecki P. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18301-18308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An AP-1-binding site in the c-fos gene can mediate the induction by EGF in HeLa cells (36Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We showed that CRE was an EGF response element in the hCGα promoter in trophoblast cells. It has been known that CRE is essential for basal promoter activity and cAMP responsiveness of hCGα gene (37Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Andersen B. Kennedy G.C. Hamernik D.L. Bokar J.A. Bohinski R. Nilson J.H. Mol.

A. 1987; 84: 2198-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some cAMP responsive genes also respond to EGF (35Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Watanabe G. Johnson J. Eklund N. Lastowiecki P. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18301-18308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Shi H. Teng C.T. J. Biol.

Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although both cAMP and EGF activate the ovine CYP11A1 promoter in JEG-3 cells through distinguishable regions (35Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Watanabe G. Johnson J. Eklund N. Lastowiecki P. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18301-18308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), both factors activated the hCGα gene via the same region (CRE) in this study. The mechanism of transcriptional activation by EGF is complicated and might be gene-specific. Several proteins binding to CRE have been identified, which include CREB, cAMP response modulator, activating transcription factor-1, and cAMP response element-binding protein-1 (identical to activating transcription factor-2). These proteins are known as members of bZIP proteins (44McKnight S.L. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been known that these proteins form homodimers or heterodimers to bind to the CRE (45Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 46Kara C.J. Liou H.C. Ivashkiv L.B. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We focused on CREB in this study because in Southwestern blot analysis we detected a 43-kDa CRE-binding protein, the migration of which in SDS-PAGE was the same as that of a 43-kDa immunoreactive CREB. However, we also observed other associating proteins (Fig. 4 B). The possible involvement of other CRE-binding proteins remains to be investigated. The activity of many transcription factors is regulated by posttranslational modification. Such modifications include phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues and oxidation and reduction of cysteines (47Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that CREB was phosphorylated by EGF. A most probable candidate for the phosphorylation site is Ser133 (27Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). The importance of the phosphorylation of CREB in generating its transcriptional functions has been shown in transgenic mice expressing a CREB with a serine to alanine substitution mutation at Ser133 (48Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can alter protein function by introducing an allosteric conformational change in the protein or by allowing (or blocking) specific electrostatic interactions with other molecules. These changes are thought to be involved in the regulation of transcription. The structural properties of CREB and phosphorylated CREB were analyzed by the method of CD, and it was shown that the phosphorylation at Ser133 did not alter the secondary structure of CREB and the DNA binding affinity of CREB to CRE sequences (49Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). From these results the phosphorylation of CREB might induce the production of the specific interactions with proteins such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) rather than the conformational change or increased DNA binding affinity. Furthermore other studies suggest that although phosphorylation of CREB is required to form the CREB-CBP complexes, other events are also involved for activation of CREB-mediated transcription (50Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Biophysical evaluation of phosphorylated CREB-CBP complexes will help to further understand the hCGα transcriptional activation. Whereas much research on the regulation of CREB transactivation has been directed toward the mechanisms of phosphorylation, relatively little is known about the phosphatase-mediated inactivation of CREB. Hagiwara et al. provided evidence that protein phosphatase-1 selectively dephosphorylates Ser133 in CREB and correspondingly attenuates the transcriptional activity of CREB (51Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikor S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). There is another study focused on the intracellular processes that regulate the phosphorylation state of CREB in the hippocampal neurons (52Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In the study it is shown that synaptic activity simultaneously influences both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CREB. During a brief stimulus, simultaneous activation of both kinase and phosphatase ensures that pCREB elevation will be large but brief. Longer stimuli cause prolongation of nuclear pCREB, possibly by hampering the phosphatase pathway. A possible involvement of the CREB dephosphorylation mechanism in the EGF effect on the hCGα gene remains to be studied. The phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 is mediated by PKA in pheochromocytoma cells (53Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and by PKC in B lymphocytes (54Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB may be mainly mediated by PKC. In Rcho-1 cells forskolin also phosphorylated CREB (Fig. 6, upper panel), suggesting that there may be several pathways (at least two pathways, PKC and PKA) to mediate CREB phosphorylation. EGF has been shown to activate Ras (55Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Bunday L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18301-18308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and induction of the CYP11A1 promoter by EGF involves aras/MEK1/AP-1-dependent pathway (60Pestell R.G.

Several reports have shown that PKC activates Raf, suggesting cross-talk between MAP kinase and PKC pathways (61Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummei R. Vahidi H. Mischack H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D.

Although our data do not exclude possible cross-talk between MAP kinase and PKC pathways, all these results suggests that EGF induces CREB phosphorylation mainly through the PKC pathway in trophoblast cells, resulting in transcriptional activation of the hCGα gene.

https://openalex.org/W2106650462,"Abstract The transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and concomitant phosphorylation of mannitol in Escherichia coliis catalyzed by the mannitol-specific transport protein from the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, enzyme IImtl. Interactions between the cytoplasmic B and the membrane embedded C domain play an important role in the catalytic cycle of this enzyme, but the nature of this interaction is largely unknown. We have studied the thermodynamics of binding of (i) mannitol to enzyme IImtl, (ii) the substrate analog perseitol to enzyme IImtl, (iii) perseitol to phosphorylated enzyme IImtl, and (iv) mannitol to enzyme IImtltreated with trypsin to eliminate the cytoplasmic domains. Analysis of the heat capacity increment of these reactions showed that approximately 50–60 residues are involved in the binding of mannitol and perseitol, but far less in the phosphorylated state or after removal of the B domain. A model is proposed in which binding of mannitol leads to the formation of a contact interface between the two domains, either by folding of unstructured parts or by docking of preexisting surfaces, thus positioning the incoming mannitol close to the phosphorylation site on the B domain to facilitate the transfer of the phosphoryl group."

The mechanism of action of IL-8 was investigated in GM 7373 cells. IL-8 did not prevent the binding of bFGF to its tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs) nor to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A transient interaction of IL-8 with the cell before the addition of the growth factor was sufficient to prevent bFGF activity. The inhibitory activity of IL-8 was abolished by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and was mimicked by the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Accordingly, both IL-8 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate caused a ∼60% decrease of the binding capacity of GM 7373 cells due to the down-regulation of FGFRs. Several C-X-C and C-C chemokines exerted an inhibitory action on bFGF activity similar to IL-8. Soluble heparin, 6-O-desulfated heparin, N-desulfated heparin, and heparan sulfate but not 2-O-desulfated heparin, chondroitin-4-sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and K5 polysaccharide abrogated IL-8 inhibitory activity consistently with the presence of low affinity, high capacity HSPG-like chemokine-binding sites on GM 7373 cells. Finally, neovascularization induced by bFGF in murine subcutaneous sponge implants was reduced significantly by IL-8. In conclusion, IL-8 inhibits the mitogenic activity exerted by bFGF on cultured endothelial cells by a PKC-dependent, noncompetitive mechanism of action that causes FGFR down-regulation. This activity is shared by several chemokines and requires endothelial cell surface HSPGs.

The process of angiogenesis, in which new capillary blood vessels are formed, is strictly regulated in the adult, and the proliferation of endothelial cells is low compared with many other cell types. Notable exceptions to this tight regulation of angiogenesis are found in the female reproductive system and during wound healing. The consequences of uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation manifest themselves in tumor neovascularization and in angioproliferative diseases. The control of angiogenesis is achieved by a balance between the levels of angiogenic and angiostatic factors that modulate neovascularization both in physiological and pathological conditions.Several molecules including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, tyrosine kinase FGF receptor; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAEC, adult bovine aortic endothelial cell; MBEC, mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; SIEC, sponge-induced mouse endothelial cell; DARC, Duffy antigen/erythrocyte chemokine receptor; ERK-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2; PKC, protein kinase C; IL-8, interleukin-8; PF-4, platelet factor-4; GRO, growth-related oncogene; MGSA, melanoma growth stimulating activity; IP-10, interferon-γ-inducible protein-10; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolynsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; H-8,N-[2-methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide; GF 109, bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; MEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium. 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, tyrosine kinase FGF receptor; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAEC, adult bovine aortic endothelial cell; MBEC, mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; SIEC, sponge-induced mouse endothelial cell; DARC, Duffy antigen/erythrocyte chemokine receptor; ERK-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2; PKC, protein kinase C; IL-8, interleukin-8; PF-4, platelet factor-4; GRO, growth-related oncogene; MGSA, melanoma growth stimulating activity; IP-10, interferon-γ-inducible protein-10; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolynsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; H-8,N-[2-methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide; GF 109, bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; MEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium. have been demonstrated to be positive mediators of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (1Klagsbrun M.

Res. 1996; 26: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When the binding of bFGF to low affinity HSPGs is prevented by treating the cells with heparinase or chlorate, the binding of bFGF to FGFRs is also reduced together with its ability to stimulate cell proliferation (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). In addition HSPGs may induce FGF(s) oligomerization, which facilitates FGFR dimerization and signal transduction (7Spivak-Krolzman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M.

They are divided into three structural subclasses depending on whether the first two of the four invariant cysteine residues are adjacent (C-C chemokines), separated by an intervening residue (C-X-C chemokines) or whether the first cysteine is missing (C chemokines) (8Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 9Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Introna M. Immunol.

Moore K.W. Schall T.J. Zlotnik A. Science. 1994; 266: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Moreover, C-X-C chemokines are subdivided further depending on the presence or the absence of the sequence Glu-Leu-Arg (the ELR motif) (8Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors are members of the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane family, and they bind either C-C or C-X-C chemokines (11Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 1: 47-64Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). An exception to this ligand specificity is the promiscuous Duffy antigen/erythrocyte chemokine receptor (DARC), which can bind members of both the C-X-C and C-C class (12Horuk R. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). So far no physiological function for DARC has been established. Besides a high affinity receptor interaction, chemokines bind sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including heparin and HS (13Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and thus can interact with HSPGs of the cell membrane and extracellular matrix. HSPGs on endothelial cells have been shown to present some chemokines to leukocytes in the multistep process of recruitment (14Rot A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).Recent work indicates that various chemokines may affect endothelial cell function. In particular, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and other C-X-C chemokines that contain the ELR motif (ELR+ C-X-C chemokines) have been reported to induce endothelial cell chemotaxis and/or proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (15Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 16Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L.

In contrast, platelet factor-4 (PF-4) and other C-X-C chemokines lacking the ELR motif (ELR− C-X-C chemokines) exert an angiostatic activity in vivo and inhibit bFGF-induced proliferation and migration in cultured endothelial cells (17Strieter R.M.

Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis underlying the pro- and anti-angiogenic activity of chemokines has not been clearly established, and some contradictory findings have been reported (see “Discussion”). The high degree of heterogeneity observed for endothelial cells of different tissue origins isolated from different animal species and the significant differences between large vessel and microvascular endothelium (3Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) may explain, at least in part, these discrepancies. Also, the use of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) obtained from different individuals and cultured under different conditions probably underlies the conflicting and confusing evidence available on the interaction of chemokines with endothelial cells (19Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1995; 21: 447-448Google Scholar). Unclear results have been obtained also concerning the expression and function of chemokine-binding sites in endothelial cells. DARC has been detected in endothelial cells of post-capillary venules and splenic sinusoids (20Peiper S.C. Wang Z. Neote K. Martin A.W. Showell H.J. Conklyn M.J. Ogborne K. Hadley T.J. Lu Z. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), whereas the presence of high affinity binding sites for125I-IL-8, together with IL-8 receptor type II mRNA expression, has been reported in human vascular endothelial cells (21Schonbeck U. Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. Loppnow H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2375-2383PubMed Google Scholar) but not confirmed by others (22Petzelbauer P. Watson C.A. Pfau S.E. Pober J.S. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The capacity of interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) to share with PF-4 a specific HSPG-binding site in SV-40-transformed murine endothelial cells has been also demonstrated (23Luster A.D. Greenberg S.M. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrate that IL-8 inhibits bFGF-induced cell proliferation in two out of six endothelial cell types tested. The bFGF antagonist activity exerted by IL-8 on fetal bovine aortic endothelial GM 7373 cells was due to a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, noncompetitive mechanism of action whose activation causes FGFR down-regulation. Various ELR+C-X-C, ELR− C-X-C, and C-C chemokines share with IL-8 the capacity to inhibit bFGF activity in GM 7373 cells. A promiscuous HSPG-like chemokine-binding site was identified on these cells by binding assays with radiolabeled IL-8, growth-related oncogene-α/melanoma growth stimulating activity (GROα/MGSA), and RANTES and by competition experiments with free GAGs. Finally, neovascularization induced by bFGF in murine subcutaneous sponge implants was reduced significantly by IL-8, in keeping with its capacity to inhibit the mitogenic activity exerted in vitro by bFGF on mouse endothelial cells isolated from these sponges.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman recombinant bFGF was expressed and purified from transformed Escherichia coli cells by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (24Isacchi A.

After overnight incubation, the cells were incubated for 24 h in fresh medium containing 0.4% FCS and 10 ng/ml bFGF in the presence of increasing concentrations of different chemokines. At the end of the incubation, the cells were trypsinized and counted in a Burker chamber. During this time period, control cultures incubated with no addition or with 10 ng/ml bFGF undergo 0.1–0.2 and 0.7–0.8 cell population doublings, respectively. Cells grown in 10% FCS undergo 1.0 cell population doublings (30Presta M. Tiberio L. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Ragnotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1991; 2: 719-726Google Scholar). For long term proliferation studies, GM 7373 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 10,000 cells/cm2. After 16 h, cells were incubated in fresh medium with 5% calf serum in the presence of 10 ng/ml bFGF and/or 100 ng/ml IL-8.

After 3 days, cells were trypsinized and counted.125I-bFGF Binding AssayHuman recombinant bFGF was labeled with 125I (37 GBq/ml; Amersham International) using Iodogen (Pierce) as described (31Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) at a specific radioactivity equal to 600 cpm/fmol. GM 7373 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at the density of 75,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in binding medium (serum-free medium containing 0.15% gelatin, 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5) with 10 ng/ml 125I-bFGF in the presence of increasing concentrations of the chemokine under test. After a PBS wash, cells were then washed twice with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) to remove 125I-bFGF bound to low affinity HSPGs and twice with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) to remove 125I-bFGF bound to high affinity FGFRs (32Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled FGF-2 and subtracted from all the values.Down-regulation of FGFRsGM 7373 cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 70,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with 100 ng/ml IL-8 or TPA. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold 2.0 mNaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated at 4 °C in binding medium containing increasing concentrations of 125I-bFGF. After 2 h, the amount of 125I-bFGF bound to high and low affinity sites was measured as described above. Binding data were analyzed by the Scatchard plot procedure (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17758) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase-2 (ERK-2)GM 7373 cells were grown at subconfluence in 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's MEM containing 10% FCS. Then cells were treated for 20 min with fresh medium with or without 10 ng/ml bFGF in the absence or in the presence of 100 ng/ml IL-8. Western blot analysis of the cell extracts was performed exactly as described (34Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-ERK-2 antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nagamine, Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). Phosphorylation of ERK-2 was evidenced as a mobility shift on the gel (34Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar).Chemokine Binding AssaysGM 7373 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in suspension with 125I-labeled ligands (0.5 nm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligands at 4 °C for 1 h. The incubation was terminated by removing aliquots from the cell suspension and separating cells from buffer by centrifugation through a silicone/paraffin oil mixture as described previously (35Neote K. Darbonne W. Ogez J. Horuk R. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12247-12249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. The binding data were curve fit with the computer program IGOR (Wavemetrics) to determine the affinity (KD), the number of sites, and nonspecific binding.Subcutaneous Sponge AssayFragments (about 1 cm3) of sponge (Spongostan Dental, Ferrosan, Denmark) hydrated for 2 h at 4 °C in saline alone or saline containing 100 ng of bFGF, 1 μg of IL-8, or bFGF plus IL-8 (200 μl/sponge) were inserted subcutaneously in the flank of anesthetized Crl:CD1(ICR)BR mice (Charles River, Milan, Italy). All sponges also contained 200 μg of heparin to stabilize the bFGF molecule in vivo (36Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). After 7 days sponges were removed, and neovascularization was quantified by measuring their hemoglobin content as described (36Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis work demonstrates that IL-8 inhibits the mitogenic response elicited by bFGF on certain endothelial cell types and significantly affects its angiogenic activity in vivo. At variance with previous results on the inhibitory activity exerted by PF-4 on bFGF (51Watson J.B. Getzler S.B. Mosher D.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence indicate that the mechanism of action of IL-8 is not competitive: (i) the inhibitory activity of IL-8 on cultured endothelial GM 7373 cells is not overcome by increasing concentrations of the growth factor; (ii) IL-8 does not compete for the binding of 125I-bFGF to high affinity FGFRs and low affinity HSPGs; and (iii) a short interaction of IL-8 with GM 7373 cells, followed by the removal of the chemokine before the addition of bFGF, is sufficient to prevent the mitogenic response. The demonstration that the inhibitory activity of IL-8 is abolished by the PKC inhibitors H-7 and GF 109 and mimicked by the PKC activator TPA points instead to a role for PKC in mediating IL-8 action on GM 7373 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the chemokine-dependent activation of a signal transduction pathway that modulates the response of endothelial cells to angiogenic growth factor(s).PKC activation has been demonstrated to attenuate signaling from tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (48Carpenter G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). We have found that IL-8 does not affect the capacity of bFGF to activate ERK-2, an early downstream signal that follows receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (34Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar), thus indicating that IL-8 does not affect the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR. However, IL-8 causes a ≈60% down-regulation of FGFRs that may explain, at least in part, the inhibitory action of the chemokine. The observation that a partial down-regulation of FGFRs is sufficient to abolish the capacity of the target cell to respond to bFGF is not surprising and may reflect the existence of threshold effects in the long term FGFR signaling required to sustain bFGF-induced cell proliferation (30Presta M. Tiberio L. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Ragnotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1991; 2: 719-726Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were drawn for TPA-treated HUVECs in which a partial decrease in FGFR binding capacity caused a complete suppression of the mitogenic activity of acidic FGF (49Hoshi H. Kan M. Mioh H. Chen J.-K. McKeehan W.L. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2797-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a member of the FGF family that shares with bFGF similar receptor binding and biological activity (2Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar).Previous observations had shown that ELR+ and ELR− C-X-C chemokines exert opposite effects on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (17Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Arenberg D.A. Burdick M.D. Kasper J. Dzuiba J. Van Damme J. Walz A. Marriot D. Chan S.-Y. Roczniak S. Shanafelt A.B. J. Biol.

To understand better its mechanism of DNA unwinding, we characterized a set of 4A′ mutant proteins (Washington, M. T., Rosenberg, A. H., Griffin, K., Studier, F. W., and Patel, S. S. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26825–26834). We showed here, using single turnover DNA unwinding assays, that the 4A′/E348K mutant protein had the unusual property of unwinding DNA (with a 5–6-fold slower rate) despite a significant defect in its dTTPase activity (a 25–30-fold slower rate). Comparing the DNA unwinding rates to the dTTPase rates, we estimated the DNA unwinding efficiencies of both wild-type (about 1 base pair unwound per dTTP hydrolysis) and mutant (4 to 6 base pairs unwound per dTTP hydrolysis). Thus the mutant had a 4–6-fold improvement in its DNA unwinding efficiency over that of the wild-type. We believe that this mutant undergoes less slippage (uncoupled dTTP hydrolysis) than the wild-type. We speculate that nature has selected for a high rate of DNA unwinding rather than a high efficiency of DNA unwinding. Thus even though the mutant is more efficient at DNA unwinding, the wild-type probably was selected because it unwinds DNA faster.

The 4A′ protein assembles into a ring-shaped hexamer of identical subunits around ssDNA (2Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is believed that when the 4A′ protein binds to the replication fork, one strand of the double-stranded DNA is bound through the central hole of the 4A′ protein ring and the complementary strand of DNA is excluded from the central hole (3Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). According to this model, DNA unwinding results from translocation along the DNA strand bound through the central hole (3Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The translocation along DNA and the DNA unwinding are coupled to deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) hydrolysis. Unfortunately this energy transduction process in DNA helicases is poorly understood. Mutagenesis studies of the 4A′ protein have been used to investigate the mechanism of DNA helicases (7Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These studies have largely focused on highly conserved residues in the helicase-specific conserved motifs (10Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues in conserved motif 1, which is thought to be involved in dTTP binding and hydrolysis (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar), have been changed in two site-directed mutant proteins (7Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Ng W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7857-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins are defective in dTTP hydrolysis activity and DNA unwinding activity. Amino acid residues in conserved motif 4 have been changed in three other site-directed mutant proteins (9Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins are defective, either directly or indirectly, in hexamer formation. In addition to the site-directed mutants of the 4A′ protein, a series of random mutants of the 4A′ protein were selected for in vivodefects in their DNA unwinding activity (13Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of nine of these mutant proteins revealed three general classes of mutant proteins that are defective in DNA unwinding (14Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins in one class can hydrolyze dTTP with near wild-type activity, but these proteins are defective in coupling the energy from dTTP hydrolysis to DNA unwinding. Mutant proteins in another class are defective in DNA binding and DNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis. Mutant proteins in the final class are defective in DNA-independent dTTP hydrolysis and DNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis. In this report, we describe a more detailed characterization of one of these 4A′ mutant proteins, the 4A′/E348K protein, that is a member of this last class. The mutant 4A′/E348K protein forms stable hexamers and binds single-stranded DNA with a high affinity, but it is completely defective in DNA-independent dTTP hydrolysis activity and partially defective in DNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis activity (14Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we report that despite a 25–30-fold defect in DNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis activity, the mutant 4A′/E348K protein surprisingly has a significant amount of DNA unwinding activity (only a 5–6-fold defect). Using steady-state and pre-steady state dTTP hydrolysis assays as well as single turnover DNA unwinding assays using oligodeoxynucleotide substrates, we have shown that the mutant 4A′/E348K protein has an improved DNA unwinding efficiency (the number of base pairs unwound per dTTP hydrolyzed). The mutant 4A′/E348K protein unwinds four to six times more DNA on an average per dTTP hydrolysis event than the wild-type 4A′ protein. To our knowledge, this is the first mutant motor protein possessing a greater efficiency of work than the wild-type protein. We speculate that in the case of the bacteriophage T7 4A′ helicase protein, nature has selected in favor of a high rate of DNA unwinding and not in favor of a high efficiency of DNA unwinding. Both the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells using the T7 expression system (15Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar,16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The pAR5018 plasmid, described by Rosenberg et al.(17Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encodes the wild-type 4A′ gene controlled by a T7 promotor. The pAR5506 plasmid encodes the mutant 4A′/E348K gene and was created by random mutagenesis of pAR5018 as described (13Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Creation of the site-directed mutant 4A′/E348A gene was done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the pAR5018 plasmid. The wild-type 4A′ and the mutant 4A′/E348K and 4A′/E348A proteins were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (14Washington M.T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by absorption measurements at 280 nm in TE buffer with 8 m urea (76,100 m−1cm−1) (18Patel S.S. Rosenberg A.H. Studier F.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15013-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as a reference. Solid dTTP (Sigma) was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH. Concentration of dTTP was determined by measuring absorption at 260 nm. Radioactive [α-32P]dTTP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham. Four oligodeoxynucleotides were used to measure the DNA unwinding activity. The 5′(36+66) oligodeoxynucleotide was a 102-mer with the sequence: 5′-TACGATCTAGCCTCAATACCAGGGTCAGGTTCGTTAGAGCGGATTACTATACTACATTAGAATTCAGACTGTAGAGATTCGGTAAGTCGGATCATGTACTAG. The 3′(15+66)F oligodeoxynucleotide was an 81-mer with a fluorescein incorporated at its 5′ end. Its sequence is: 5′F-CTAGTACATGATCCGACTATCCGAATCTCTAGAGTCTGAATTCTAATGTAGTATAGTAATCCGCTCATTGCTTGTATGGTC. These two oligodeoxynucleotides anneal to form a fork DNA with 66 base pairs of duplex DNA (the underlined portions). The 5′(36+33) oligodeoxynucleotide was a 69-mer with the sequence: 5′-TACGATCTAGCCTCAATACCAGGGTCAGGTTCGTTAGAGCGGATTACTATACTACATTAGAATTCAGAC. The 3′(15+33)F oligodeoxynucleotide was a 48-mer with a fluorescein incorporated at its 5′ end. Its sequence is: 5′F-GTCTGAATTCTAATGTAGTATAGTAATCCGCTCATTGCTTGTATGGTC. These oligodeoxynucleotides anneal to form a fork DNA with 33 bp of duplex DNA (the underlined portions). An additional oligodeoxynucleotide 60-mer was used in some DNA unwinding experiments to trap excess protein. Its sequence is: 5′-AATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTCATGACGATTACCTGAACCATCCTGACTCT. All oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12–16%) with urea (3–5 m) in TBE buffer. The oligodeoxynucleotides were electroeluted from the gel using an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell), and the concentration was determined spectroscopically at 260 nm. Single-stranded M13 DNA was prepared as described (20Miller H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two fork DNA substrates were used to measure the DNA unwinding activities of the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein. Both DNA substrates contained a short duplex region with a 5′ single-stranded tail (36 bases long) and a 3′ single-stranded tail (15 bases long) on the same side of the duplex region. One substrate, which had a 66-base pair duplex region, was formed by annealing the 5′(36+66) and the 3′(15+66)F oligodeoxynucleotides. The other substrate, which had a 33-bp duplex region, was formed by annealing the 5′(36+33) and the 3′(15+33)F oligodeoxynucleotides. The annealing reaction was performed by incubating 1.5 μm 5′(36+xx) DNA with 1.0 μm 3′(15+xx)F DNA in 100 mm NaCl. The solution was heated to 95 °C and slowly cooled over 3 or 4 h to 4 °C. The DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of moles of DNA molecules, and the slight excess of 5′ tail was not removed. The vast excess of protein over DNA substrates in these assays makes it highly unlikely that there is any effect from the presence of a small amount of the unlabeled single-stranded 5′ oligodeoxynucleotide. The DNA unwinding or helicase activities of the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein were measured at 18 °C by a stopped-flow assay (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using the KinTek stopped-flow apparatus (State College, PA). The wild-type 4A′ protein (1.33 μm hexamer concentration) or the mutant 4A′/E348K protein was preincubated with 4 mm dTTP, and 3 nm fork DNA for 90–120 min in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. After the preincubation period, this solution was loaded into syringe A. Syringe B contained the same buffer with 11 mm MgCl2 to initiate the reaction (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA unwinding was observed by monitoring the fluorescein fluorescence increase caused by DNA strand separation by exciting at 494 nm and using a LP 530 cut-on filter. The stopped-flow data were imported into SigmaPlot 4.0 and fit to Equation 1 using n = 1, 2, or 3 steps (21Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 375: 377-380Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The best fit curve was used to obtain the first-order rate constants for each of the DNA unwinding steps. In each case, the overall DNA unwinding rate constant was calculated by taking the rate constant, k, for each individual step and dividing it by the number of steps,n. F(t)=a1−∑r=1n(kt)r−1(r−1)!e−kt+cEquation 1 where a is the amplitude of the fluorescence change,n is the number of steps (1, 2, or 3), k is the exponential or first-order rate constant for each individual step, and c is the initial fluorescence signal. The DNA unwinding activities of both the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein at 18 °C under the same conditions as above were also examined using the rapid chemical quench flow apparatus (KinTek) (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prior to annealing the fork, one of the two strands in each fork DNA was 32P-end labeled. The preincubated protein, fork DNA, and dTTP in buffer was loaded into syringe A and MgCl2 in buffer was added from syringe B to initiate the reaction. Samples were quenched with 100 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 10% glycerol. Some bromphenol blue was added to each quenched sample, and the samples were immediately run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel to separate the fork DNA substrate from the unwound ssDNA products. Some experiments were done in the presence of 60-mer trap DNA (4 μm) added either to syringe A (protein, fork DNA, and dTTP) before the protein was added or to syringe B. The fork DNA substrate and the unwound products were quantitated using the PhosphorImager. In each experiment, the fraction of ssDNA, normalized to a heat-denatured fork DNA sample, was plotted versus time of reaction, and the data were fit to an equation describing a single exponential function. The amplitude and first-order rate constant were obtained from this fit in each case. The dTTP hydrolysis activities of the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein were measured at 18 °C. The enzyme (0.67 μm hexamers) was incubated in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm or 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol buffer in the presence of 50 nm M13 ssDNA and 50 μm dTTP for 20 min (30–50 μl reaction volumes). Reactions were initiated by adding various amounts of dTTP spiked with [α-32P]dTTP (2 μCi/reaction). Aliquots (5 μl) were quenched with 10 μl of 1 m HCl and 20 μl of chloroform. Quenched reactions were neutralized by adding 1 m NaOH, 0.25 m Tris base to reach pH 7 (about 8 μl), and 1 μl of the quenched reactions was spotted on a polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman). The radiolabeled dTTP and dTDP were separated using 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, as the chromatography running buffer. The dTTP and dTDP spots were quantitated using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The dTTP hydrolysis activities of the wild-type 4A′ protein and the mutant 4A′/E348K protein during DNA unwinding were examined at 18 °C under pre-steady state conditions using the KinTek rapid chemical quench flow apparatus. The wild-type 4A′ protein or the mutant 4A′/E348K protein (1.3 μmhexamers), fork DNA with a 33-bp duplex region (4 μm), and dTTP (300 μm) were preincubated in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 1.5–2 h and loaded into syringe A of the quench flow. Syringe B contained 11 mm MgCl2 in the same buffer to initiate the reaction and a small amount of [α-32P]dTTP (20 μCi). At various times, reactions were quenched with 1 n HCl and chloroform (100 μl), neutralized with 1 m NaOH, 0.25 m Tris base, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. HPLC size exclusion chromatography was used to examine the complex between the fork DNA substrate and the wild-type 4A′ protein or the mutant 4A′/E348K protein. A Bio-Silect SEC 400–5 column (300 × 7.8 mm) (Bio-Rad) was used. Samples (20 μl) were preincubated for 2 h and contained the wild-type 4A′ protein or the mutant 4A′/E348K protein (0.67 μm hexamers), 2 mmdTTP, and 15 nm fork DNA with a 33-bp duplex region in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Samples were injected and run at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Elution of DNA was monitored by measuring fluorescein fluorescence at 525 nm (excited at 494 nm). We compared the elution times of the protein and fork DNA complexes to the elution of the 4A′ protein under standard conditions (1.3 μm 4A′ protein hexamers, 8 μm 60-mer ssDNA, 1 mmdTMP-PCP in the same buffer with 10 mm MgCl2) in which we know hexamers are formed (22Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant 4A′/E348K protein is one in a set of randomly prepared mutant proteins of the bacteriophage T7 4A′ helicase protein that was genetically selected for the inability to support bacteriophage T7 DNA replication (13Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This amino acid substitution is adjacent to conserved motif 1a in the primary structure of the 4A′ protein (Fig.1). Here we report the DNA unwinding and dTTP hydrolysis activities of the mutant 4A′/E348K protein and show that this mutant protein has the unusual property of being able to unwind more base pairs of DNA per dTTP hydrolysis event than the wild-type protein. Thus the mutant 4A′/E348K protein is more efficient at unwinding DNA than the wild-type protein. It has been shown previously (14Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that the mutant 4A′/E348K protein is defective in dTTP hydrolysis, both in the absence and presence of ssDNA. To examine this activity in more detail, we measured both the intrinsic (DNA-independent) dTTPase activity and the DNA-stimulated dTTPase activities at 18 °C. In this assay, we incubated the wild-type 4A′ or the mutant 4A′/E348K proteins (0.083 μm) with [α-32P]dTTP (0–500 μm) in the presence or absence of M13 circular ssDNA (50 nm), and monitored the conversion of dTTP to dTDP as a function of time. 50 nm M13 ssDNA was sufficient to achieve maximal DNA-stimulated dTTPase activity with both the wild-type and mutant proteins. TableI shows the kcatand Km steady-state parameters for the wild-type 4A′ and the mutant 4A′/E348K proteins in the presence and absence of M13 ssDNA. The mutant 4A′/E348K protein had no detectable dTTPase activity in the absence of ssDNA. In the presence of ssDNA, the mutant 4A′/E348K protein had a 25–30-fold reduced kcat relative to the wild-type 4A′ protein.Table ISteady-state dTTPase parameters of 4A′ and E348KProteinDNA independent activityM13 ssDNA stimulated activitykcat1-2001The units for kcat are moles of dTTP hydrolyzed per mole of protein hexamer per second.Kmkcat1-2001The units for kcat are moles of dTTP hydrolyzed per mole of protein hexamer per second.Kmμmμm4A′0.12–0.185–2024.0 ± 1.2100–200E348K<0.005NA1-bNA, not applicable.0.97 ± 0.01935 ± 171-2001 The units for kcat are moles of dTTP hydrolyzed per mole of protein hexamer per second.1-b NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab To compare directly the DNA unwinding rates with the DNA-stimulated dTTPase rates, we also measured the steady-state M13-ssDNA-stimulated dTTPase activity of the wild-type 4A′ and the mutant 4A′/E348K proteins using similar protein concentration (0.67 μm), dTTP concentration (2 mm), and Mg2+ concentration (5 mm) used to measure DNA unwinding. These rate constants were used in the calculation of the DNA unwinding efficiency. For the wild-type 4A′ protein, the rate constant of M13 ssDNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis was 26 ± 0.4 mol of dTTP hydrolyzed per mole of protein hexamer per second and for the mutant 4A′/E348K protein, the rate constant was 0.87 ± 0.014 mol of dTTP/mol of hexamer per second. This was a 30-fold reduction in the steady-state DNA-stimulated dTTPase activity of the mutant 4A′/E348K protein relative to the wild-type 4A′ protein. Because dTTP hydrolysis is coupled to DNA unwinding, we expected the 25–30-fold decrease in the DNA-stimulated dTTPase activity of the mutant 4A′/E348K protein relative to the wild-type 4A′ protein to result in at least a 25–30-fold decrease in the DNA unwinding activity. To test this, we used a single turnover stopped-flow assay to monitor the kinetics of DNA unwinding (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two DNA substrates (fork DNAs) were used: one with a 33-bp double-stranded DNA region and one with a 66-bp double-stranded DNA region. Both fork DNA substrates had two non-complementary single-stranded tails on the same end of the duplex region, a 36-base long 5′ tail and a 15-base long 3′ tail. These lengths were shown to provide optimal DNA unwinding activity (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One strand of each fork DNA substrate was labeled at the end of the duplex region with a fluorescein, whose fluorescence increased upon DNA unwinding (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Assays were done at a low DNA substrate concentration (1.5 nm) to reduce the amount of re-annealing of the two DNA strands following enzyme-catalyzed unwinding and a high protein hexamer concentration (0.67 μm) to achieve the maximum unwinding rate. Thus, there was a 450-fold excess of the enzyme (hexamer concentration) over the DNA substrate. The wild-type 4A′ protein or the mutant 4A′/E348K protein was preincubated with the dTTP and the fork DNA in the absence of MgCl2. This preincubation period allowed a complex to form between the protein and the DNA fork, and the DNA unwinding reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2. Fig. 2 shows the stopped-flow traces of the DNA unwinding reactions catalyzed by the wild-type 4A′ and the mutant 4A′/E348K proteins. The stopped-flow traces show the exponential increase in the fluorescence of the DNA substrate due to DNA unwinding. We know that the change in fluorescence signal is due to DNA unwinding because the stopped-flow data overlay with the DNA unwinding data measured by the radiometric rapid chemical quench flow assay (4Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The traces obtained from using the 33-bp fork substrate had a short lag period preceding the exponential increase, while the traces obtained from using the 66-bp fork substrate had a longer lag period. The presence of the lag is due to this assay measuring only the final ssDNA products and not any partially unwound DNA intermediates. the solid lines represent the fit of the data to Equation 1 (see “Materials and Methods”) which describes the stepwise unwinding of DNA. For the wild-type 4A′ protein, the data obtained using the 33-bp substrate fit best with two steps (n = 2), and the data obtained using the 66-bp substrate fit best with three steps (n = 3). For the mutant 4A′/E348K protein, the data obtained using the 33-bp substrate fit best with one step (n = 1), and the data obtained using the 66-bp substrate fit best with two steps (n = 2). We have used this equation in our analysis of the stopped-flow DNA unwinding data only because it is the proper way to obtain the overall rate of DNA unwinding in the presence of a lag (21Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 375: 377-380Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although this analysis provides an estimate of the size of each step, a more detailed study of the unwinding activity using many lengths of duplex DNA is required to obtain accurate values for the size of each step. For each stopped-flow trace, the overall rate of DNA unwinding was calculated from the number of steps and the first-order rate constant for each step, both of which were obtained from the fit to Equation 1. Table II lists the overall rate constants of the DNA unwinding activities (in forks unwound per second). By multiplying the overall DNA unwinding rate (forks/s) by the length of DNA unwound in each fork substrate, we calculated the overall DNA unwinding rates in units of base pairs unwound per second. We found that the wild-type 4A′ protein unwound the 33-bp substrate with a rate of 27 bp/s and the 66-bp substrate with a rate of 19 bp/s. Because these two rates were similar, it is highly unlikely that there is an additional kinetic step, such as a conformational change, occurring prior to DNA unwinding and contributing to the lag. Thus the rate measured under the given conditions is actually the unwinding rate of double-stranded DNA. The mutant 4A′/E348K protein unwound the 33-bp substrate with a rate of 5.6 bp/s and the 66-bp substrate with a rate of 3.3 bp/s. Again the similar rates mean that we are actually measuring the DNA unwinding rate. The above data show that despite a 20–30-fold decrease in the dTTPase activity, there is only a 5–6-fold reduction in the DNA unwinding activity of the mutant 4A′/E348K protein relative to the wild-type 4A′ protein.Table IIDNA unwinding efficiencies of 4A′ and E348KProteinFork DNA size (bp)koverall2-2001The overall rate constant of DNA unwinding was calculated from the rate constants obtained from fitting the DNA unwinding stopped-flow traces (Fig. 1) to Equation 1 (see “Materials and Methods”).

The proximal kinase and distal reductase domains are separated by a short connector region. Substitutions of arginines at positions −2 and −3 upstream of the N terminus of the AGPR domain or replacement of threonine at position +3 in the mature AGPR domain revealed a second processing site at position −20. Substitution of arginine at position −22, in combination with changes at −2 and −3, prevented cleavage of the precursor and identified two proteolytic cleavage sites, Arg-Gly↓Tyr-Leu-Thr at the N terminus of the AGPR domain and Arg-Gly-Tyr↓Ser-Thr located 20 residues upstream. Inhibitors of metal-dependent peptidases blocked proteolytic cleavage at both sites. Amino acid residues required for proteolytic cleavage in the connector were identified, and processing was abolished by mutations changing these residues. The unprocessed AGK-AGPR fusion had both catalytic activities, including feedback inhibition of AGK, and complemented AGK−AGPR−mutants. These results indicate that cleavage of pAGK-AGPR is not required for functioning of these enzymes in the mitochondria.

These results indicate that cleavage of pAGK-AGPR is not required for functioning of these enzymes in the mitochondria. In eukaryotic organisms, arginine biosynthesis is compartmentalized. In Neurospora crassa, the first six steps occur in the mitochondria and the last two steps in the cytosol. Flux through the arginine biosynthetic pathway is regulated primarily by feedback inhibition of the enzymes that catalyze the first and second reactions. The second and third steps of the pathway are catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate kinase (AGK) 1The abbreviations used are: AGK,N-acetylglutamate kinase; AGPR,N-acetyl-γ-glutamyl-phosphate reductase; MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid.

Rev. 1986; 50: 280-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are produced from a polyprotein precursor (pAGK-AGPR), which is targeted to the mitochondria and processed into mature AGK and AGPR (3Wandinger-Ness A.U. Wolf E.C. Weiss R.L. Davis R.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyprotein consists of a mitochondrial targeting sequence followed by two protein domains, AGK and AGPR, separated by a connector region (Fig. 1 A). Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and targeted to the organelle by leader sequences at the N terminus of their precursors. Mitochondrial leader sequences are recognized by specific receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane and translocated from the receptors to downstream components of the import machinery (5Kiebler M. Pfaller R. Sollner T. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Nature. 1990; 348: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Kiel I.J.

Removal of N-terminal targeting sequences in the matrix is performed by a mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), composed of two similar subunits, α-MPP and β-MPP; α-MPP is soluble in the matrix, and β-MPP is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (9Hawlitschek G.

Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As import and processing take place, proteins are folded into functional enzymes or assembled into functional multienzyme complexes. We previously showed that two proteins were obtained that comigrated with mature AGK and AGPR upon incubation of in vitro synthesized wild-type pAGK-AGPR with purified MPP (4Gessert S.F. Kim J.H. Nargang F.E. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of the the precise cleavage site(s) in the connector region of the precursor remained to be determined. Targeting sequences have the capability to form an amphipathic α-helix (13von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar); however, defined sequences or structural motifs involved in proteolytic processing are not well understood (14Hendrick J. Hodges P. Rosenberg L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Gavel Y. von Heijne G.

Commun. 1993; 194: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The connector of pAGK-AGPR contains an internal processing sequence, which has some of the characteristics of a mitochondrial targeting sequence, although it is not predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix (4Gessert S.F. Kim J.H. Nargang F.E. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine residues at positions −2 or −3 and positions −10 or −11 relative to the first amino acid in the mature protein are often found in targeting sequences of mitochondrial precursor proteins and appear to form part of the not well defined motifs found at cleavage sites (15Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 16Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some similarities between the connector region of pAGK-AGPR and mitochondrial targeting sequences are apparent (Fig.1 B). Several questions are addressed in this study. What are the sequences or structural motifs that specify the cleavage at the connector region of pAGK-AGPR? How many cleavage events are necessary to process the polyprotein precursor into two proteins? Is processing of the precursor into two independent proteins required for function in the mitochondria? Processing of pAGK-AGPR and its biological function were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The roles of several amino acid residues as signals for processing were examined by introducing point mutations in the connector region of the precursor. Two sites for proteolytic processing were identified, and processing into two mature proteins was prevented by mutagenesis of these sites. Proteolytic cleavage of pAGK-AGPR in the connector region did not appear to be required for the activity of either enzyme or for feedback inhibition of AGK by arginine. Processing at the connector region of pAGK-AGPR is discussed in the context of putative advantages that targeting of fusion proteins may have versus the targeting of independent proteins. Escherichia colistrains DH5α and JM101 were used to propagate plasmid DNA. Strain GM48 was used to prepare nonmethylated DNA for digestion of methylation-sensitive restriction sites. E. coli RZ1032 and helper phage VCSM13 were used for the generation of single-stranded plasmid DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. Bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium or terrific broth (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. 2nd Ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar) as specified.Neurospora wild-type strain LA1 (74A) and arg-6strain LA358 (allele CD118) were obtained from R. H. Davis (19Davis R.H. Weiss R.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 192: 46-50Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Neurospora cultures were grown in Vogel's minimal medium N (20Davis R.H. de Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (940) Google Scholar) or in minimal medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml arginine. Plasmid constructs were derived from pUC19 (New England Biolabs) or pBluescript KSII(+/−) (Stratagene). Constructs pRW5 and pJK2 have been previously described (4Gessert S.F. Kim J.H. Nargang F.E. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); pRW5 contains a copy of the wild-type arg-6 gene, which encodes pAGK-AGPR in an 8.0-kilobase pair SphI fragment cloned into pUC19; and pJK2 contains a full-length wild-typearg-6 cDNA in a 3.0-kilobase pairEcoRI–HindIII fragment cloned into pBluescript KSII(−). Plasmid pRW7 is a derivative of pRW5 that contains the hph gene on a 1.69-kb SalI–BamHI fragment. Plasmid pgH2 contains the arg-6 gene from pRW7 on a 4.1-kilobase pair HindIII fragment cloned into pUC19. Mutations in the connector region of the precursor were introduced by PCR using an 888-base pair Bsu361 fragment from plasmid pgH2 as a template or by site-directed mutagenesis using an 877-base pairApaI–ClaI fragment from plasmid pJK2 (Fig.1 A, top diagram). A diagram of the introduced amino acid substitutions at the connector region of pAGK-AGPR is shown in Fig. 1 B. The wild-type sequence of both the cDNA and genomic constructs is shown at the top. For simplicity, only the names of the cDNA constructs are indicated in the figure. Construct pcPG16 contains substitutions of the arginine pair at positions −3 and −2 relative to the N terminus of the AGPR domain to proline and glycine. Construct pcPG16 was used as the template for the introduction of additional mutations in several plasmid derivatives. Plasmid pcGTPG5 contains substitutions of arginine residues at positions −15 and −14 to glycine and threonine in a pcPG16 background. Constructs pcG22PG42, pcP22PG54, and pcG22PG10 contain a substitution of arginine at −22 to glycine or proline in a pcPG16 background; plasmid pcG22PG10 also has a stop codon toward the N-terminal region of the mature AGPR domain. Construct pcA13PG16 substitutes alanine for proline at position −13 in the pcPG16 background. Construct pcP3 substitutes proline for threonine at position +3 in a wild-type background. Genomic constructs contain identical amino acid substitutions as the equivalent cDNA constructs and include a 56-base intron located toward the 3′-end of the distal AGPR coding region. The genomic constructs pgPG15-Hph, pgGTPG4-Hph, pgG22PG42-Hph, and pgP22PG54-Hph resulted from subcloning the 888-base pair Bsu361 fragment from pcPG16, pcGTPG5, pcG22PG42, or pcP22PG54 into pRW7. Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 391 PCR-mate DNA synthesizer (Table I). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the Kunkel procedure, modified for the use of single-stranded DNA derived from any plasmid (21Kunkel T. Roberts J. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was obtained by transformation of E. coli RZ1032 and infection of exponentially growing transformants with helper phage VCSM13 to a multiplicity of infection of 20. Annealing, extension by T4 DNA polymerase, and ligation were performed as suggested by Promega. PCR mutagenesis was performed by asymmetric PCR in a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler (22Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). Primary PCR reactions contained the template DNA pgH2 (∼10 ng), excess primer BsuAGK or IIB (100 pmol), limiting primer PG1 or PG2 (1 pmol), 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 25 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin), dNTPs (50 μm), and Taq polymerase (2.5 units) in a final volume of 100 μl. The PCR conditions for the denaturation, annealing, and extension reactions were 1 cycle at 94 °C (2 min), 60 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (1 min) followed by 20 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 60 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min) and 10 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 60 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1.5 min). For the second PCR amplification, ∼10 ng of each gel-purified first PCR product was used as a template. The outside primers, BsuAGK and IIB, were added, and PCR amplification was carried out using the same conditions as described above for the first amplification step. A low melting point agarose gel slice containing the second PCR product (∼660 ng) was resuspended in 80 μl of 1× Bsu361 buffer and digested with Bsu361 in a final volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 60 min. The enzyme was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. For the ligation reaction, 50 μl of the digestion mixture (∼330 ng) was added to 35 ng of Bsu361-linearized pgH2ΔBsu361 in a final volume of 100 μl of 1× ligation buffer and incubated with 1 unit of T4 ligase at room temperature for 12 h (22Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was used to transform competent cells of E. coli DH5α (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Constructs pgGTPG4, pcA13PG16, and pcP3 were also generated by asymmetric PCR using pgH2 as template DNA. The presence of the desired mutations was initially screened by digestion of DNA with SmaI (new site generated by the substitutions of Arg−2 and Arg−3 to Gly−2 and Pro−3), KpnI (new site introduced by the substitutions of Arg−14 and Arg−15 to Gly−14 and Thr−15), BstX1 (new site generated by the change Arg−22 to Gly−22), or HpaI (new site generated by the change Arg−22 to Pro−22) and subsequently by sequencing of the entire amplified regions.Table IOligonucleotides designed for site-directed and PCR mutagenesisName (size)Sequence (5′ → 3′)PCR mutagenesis BsuAGK (forward) (28-mer)5′-CCATCATCCATCCTGAGGAACTTCAGAA-3′ IIB (reverse) (28-mer)5′-GGGGCCCACGGACATCCTCAGGGCTGAG-3′ PGI (forward) (29-mer)1-2001Generates a KpnI site.5′-CAGCATCTCTAACCCCGGGGGCTACCTAA-3′ PG2 (reverse) (29-mer)1-bGenerates a SmaI site.5′-TTAGGTAGCCCCCGGGGTTAGAGATGCTG-3′ GTI (forward) (35-mer)5′-CTCCACTCTTGCTGGTACCCCTGCCCTTCCCAAGT3′ GT2 (reverse) (35-mer)5′-ACTTGGGAAGGGCAGGGGTACCAGCAAGAGTGGAG-3′ OLP18 (forward) (27-mer)5′-GGCTACCTACCCCAGACCAACCCCAAC-3′ OLP18 (reverse) (27-mer)5′-GTTGGGGTTGGTCTGGGGTAGGTAGCC-3′ OLP26 (forward) (33-mer)5′-CTCCACTCTTGCTCGCCGCGCTGCCCTTCCCAA-3′ OLP26 (reverse) (33-mer)5′-TTGGGAAGGGCAGCGCGGCGAGCAAGAGTGGAG-3′Site-directed mutagenesis OLP12 (27-mer)1-2003Generates a MspI site.5′-AAGAGTGGAGTAGCCGGGAACCTGCTG-3′ OLP14 (27-mer)1-dGenerates a BstXI site.5′-AAGAGTGGAGTAGCCCCCAACCTGCTG-3′1-2001 Generates a KpnI site.1-b Generates a SmaI site.1-2003 Generates a MspI site.1-d Generates a BstXI site. Open table in a new tab To analyze processing in vitro, wild-type and mutated precursor proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation. Plasmid DNA was linearized with EcoRV, treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. DNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated distilled H2O and stored at −20 °C. Proteinase-treated template was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega). Transcripts were visualized by electrophoresis using denaturing agarose gels (1.2% agarose containing 17% formaldehyde in MOPS buffer). Translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysates were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega). In vitrotranscribed RNA (2 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of RNasin (10 units/ml), 1 μl of a mixture of amino acids (1 mm) except methionine, 5 μl of [35S]methionine (1,200 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 6 μl of H2O, and 35 μl of reticulocyte lysate. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. A 2.5-μl aliquot was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The rest of the sample was brought to a final concentration of 0.3 m sucrose and 0.05 mmmethionine and stored at −80 °C. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from N. crassa wild-type strain 74A grown for 12 h at 30 °C in minimal medium (12Brunner M. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Import reactions were performed by incubating a suspension containing ∼70 μg of freshly isolated mitochondria in 100 μl of import buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm NADH) with 5 μl of in vitro translated product for 30 min at 25 °C. 1,10-Phenanthroline (2.5 mm) and EDTA (5 mm) were used (if indicated) as inhibitors of metal-dependent peptidases (24Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Kalousek F. Isaya G. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prior to import, mitochondria were preincubated with the inhibitors at 25 °C for 5 min in import buffer. After the addition of precursor to the reaction mixture, incubation was continued for 30 min. Postimport mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 12 min and treated (if indicated) with 50 or 100 μg/ml of proteinase K for 30 min at 0 °C to remove externally bound precursor. 35S-Labeled import products were analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and fluorography. The genomic constructs pRW7, pgPG15-Hph, pgGTPG4-Hph, pgG22PG42-Hph, and pgP22PG54-Hph were introduced into the arg-6 recipient strain LA358 by transformation following the procedure of Vollmer and Yanofsky (26Vollmer S. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4869-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected after 3–4 days of incubation at 30 °C in regeneration agar overlaid on agar plates containing arginine (200 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Transformants were tested for arginine prototrophy by screening on plates without arginine but containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Four isolates from each transformation were purified to homokaryons by four successive single conidial isolations. Purified transformants were analyzed by Southern and Western blots. Wild-type and ARG+ transformants were grown in 50 ml of minimal medium on a rotatory shaker at 30 °C and harvested after 12 h by vacuum filtration. Mycelia (0.5 g, dry weight) were washed three or four times with deionized H2O, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle to a fine powder. The powder was suspended in 1.5 volumes of boiling extraction buffer (3% SDS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and boiled for 5–7 min with vigorous mixing every 2.5 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants containing solubilized proteins were divided into 1-ml aliquots and frozen quickly on dry ice. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein microassay. Solubilized proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting at 4 °C in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol). The kinase (AGK) and reductase (AGPR) proteins were detected using anti-kinase or anti-reductase antiserum and an enhanced chemiluminescence system with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were exposed to film (Hyper-film type MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for time periods of 3–30 s. Mitochondria from transformants were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and ∼5–10 mg was sonicated three or four times for 10 s each in a Fisher sonic dismembrator, model 300, 35% maximal power, microtip probe in 1% TNET (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondrial membranes were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were brought to 400 μl with 1% TNET, and a 40-μl aliquot of undiluted anti-AGPR antiserum was added for each 5 mg of starting mitochondrial protein. Samples were incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with the equivalent of two volumes of Staphylococcus aureus extract as the source of protein A. Incubation was continued for 60 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1–2 min, and pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of TX/SDS (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Triton X-100) and once with 1 ml of TBS (25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl). Washed pellets were solubilized in 50 μl of SDS/sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Immunocomplexes were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in CAPS transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11) at 4 °C (27Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Proteins on the membrane were stained with Coomassie blue R250, the band of interest was cut out of the membrane, and the amino terminus was sequenced by the UCLA Sequencing Facility. N-Acetylglutamate kinase and N-acetyl-γ-glutamyl-phosphate reductase activities of the uncleaved precursor were assayed using mitochondria purified by sucrose step gradient centrifugation (3Wandinger-Ness A.U. Wolf E.C. Weiss R.L. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5974-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylglutamate kinase was assayed by a radioactive procedure modified from Wolf and Weiss (28Wolf E.C. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9189-9195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.5, 60 mmMgCl2, 30 mm ATP, 3.75 mm[14C]acetylglutamate, and 0.2 mNH2OH and were incubated for 80 min at 30 °C. Feedback inhibition was measured in the presence of 18.75 mmarginine. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μl of mitochondrial extract and stopped by transferring to a boiling water bath. The reaction mixtures were acidified by adding 100 μl of 0.5n formic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g to remove insoluble material. Supernatants were applied to an AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) column (0.7 × 6 cm) equilibrated with 0.1n HCOOH and eluted with 0.1 n HCOOH. Glutamate was eluted in the first 10 ml followed by the reaction product, acetylglutamyl hydroxamate, in the next 10 ml; unreacted acetylglutamate was eluted with 1.0 n HCOOH. Fractions containing the product were dried in a vacuum dessicator, redissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n HCOOH, and counted. Counts from a control reaction containing no ATP were subtracted from the values obtained in the test reactions. One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount required to produce 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 30 °C. The activity of acetylglutamate kinase is expressed in microunits and represents the average of three independent determinations. Acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase activity was assayed by following the increase in fluorescence as NADP+ was converted to NADPH (3Wandinger-Ness A.U. Wolf E.C. Weiss R.L. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5974-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m glycine, pH 9.3, 1.33 mm acetylglutamate 5-semialdehyde, 25 mm K2HPO4, pH 9.3, 0.67 mm NADP+ (freshly prepared), and 100, 200, or 300 μl of mitochondrial extract in a final volume of 3 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, acetylglutamate semialdehyde, and the increase in fluorescence was followed using a Gilson Spectra/Glo filter fluorometer (excitation filter, 330–380 nm; emission filter, 430–600 nm). The reactions were carried out at 25 °C. The activity is expressed as the change in fluorescence/min and represents the average from three independent determinations. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega and New England Biolabs. Taq polymerase was purchased from Promega. Sequenase version 2.0 was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. An in vitro transcription kit containing T7 RNA polymerase was obtained from Promega. 35S E. coli hydrolysate labeling reagent (Tran 35S label, 1274 Ci/mmol, 11.74 mCi/ml) was purchased from ICN. A nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit was obtained from Promega. The importance of an arginine residue at position −2 or −3 relative to the cleavage site of mitochondrial targeting sequences has been demonstrated (13von Heijne G.

Preliminary analysis indicated that replacement of arginine with glycine at position −2 relative to the N terminus of the AGPR domain (Arg−2 to Gly−2) did not prevent cleavage of the polyprotein in vitro. 2J.-H. Kim and R. L. Weiss, unpublished results. A precursor containing the changes Arg−2 and Arg−3 to Gly−2 and Pro−3 (pcPG16) was used as a substrate for an in vitro import assay (Fig.2 A). Postimport mitochondria were reisolated and treated or not treated with proteinase K to digest bound precursor. Processing of the wild-type precursor (lanes 1 and 4) resulted in two protein bands; the upper protein band corresponds to mature AGK (52 kDa), and the lower protein band corresponds to mature AGPR (37 kDa) (29Wandinger-Ness A.U. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5823-5830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of the mutant precursor derived from pcPG16 resulted in an AGK protein that comigrated with wild-type AGK, but the AGPR protein (AGPR*) appeared to have a higher molecular mass than wild-type AGPR (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 5). This result suggested that processing at the N terminus of the AGPR domain, between amino acids −1 and +1, was prevented by the amino acid substitutions and that one or more proteolytic cleavages took place at a location(s) upstream of the −1/+1 site in the connector region of the precursor. To investigate the role of the arginine residues at positions −14 and −15, mutations were introduced at these sites in a background that contained the previous changes at −2 and −3. Fig. 2 A(lanes 3 and 6) shows that processing of the precursor derived from pcGTPG5, which contains the changes Arg−15, Arg−14 to Gly−15, Thr−14 and Arg−3, Arg−2 to Pro−3, Gly−2 resulted in an AGK protein band that comigrated with wild-type AGK (compare with lane 1) and an AGPR band with a higher molecular mass than wild-type AGPR. The larger AGPR band comigrated with the AGPR* observed in the processing of the precursor from pcPG16 (lanes 2 and 5). Thus, substitution of the arginine pair at −14 and −15 had no effect on processing at the second cleavage site. Since mutations at the arginine pairs upstream of the −1/+1 cleavage site identified a second processing site in the connector region, the role of the arginine at position −22 was examined. Arg−22 was chosen because it is in a context that resembles the cleavage site at −1/+1. Analysis of the precursor derived from pcP22PG54 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), in which arginine at −22 was changed to Pro in a background where the arginine pair at −2 and −3 have been changed to Gly and Pro, shows that processing of the precursor was"

The mouse metallothionein-I (MT-I) promoter contains two C'BP-1 binding sites, one of which includes the MRE-c' region (-135 to -110). The C'BP-1 binding activity was detected by EMSA as a major activity for MRE-c' in nonproliferating adult liver cells but not in rat hepatoma cells. In this study, we purified and characterized a factor, C'BP-2, which had a dominant binding activity for MRE-c' in Morris hepatoma 3924A, a poorly differentiated, fast-growing tissue. C'BP-2 is a 28 kDa protein which exists in solution as a monomer. As observed for C'BP-1, affinity-purified C'BP-2 stimulated transcription from the mMT-I gene promoter. DNase I footprinting revealed two C'BP-2 binding sites in the regions that overlap with the CCAAT homologies of the C'BP-1 binding sites on the mMT-I promoter. C'BP-2 made essential contacts with the CCAAT homology and in the region upstream of this sequence. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay and methylation interference analysis revealed that C'BP-2 is a protein closely related, but not identical, to CP2. These data suggest that C'BP-1 and C'BP-2 may play a role in hepatocyte proliferation and/or differentiation."

This activity is, however, cryptic. Elicited in nucleotide excision repair by association with the UvrA protein, it may also be unmasked by a specific proteolysis eliminating the C-terminal domain of UvrB (generating UvrB*). We introduced fluorescent reporter groups (tryptophan replacing Phe47 or Asn51) into the ATP binding motif of UvrB, without significant alteration of behavior, to study both nucleotide binding and those conformational changes expected to be essential to function. The inserted tryptophans occupy moderately hydrophobic, although potentially heterogeneous, environments as evidenced by fluorescence emission and time-resolved decay characteristics, yet are accessible to the diffusible quencher acrylamide. Activation, via specific proteolysis, is accompanied by conformational change at the ATP binding site, with multiple changes in emission spectra and a greater shielding of the tryptophans from diffusible quencher. Titration of tryptophan fluorescence with ATP has revealed that, although catalytically incompetent, UvrB can bind ATP and bind with an affinity equal to that of the active UvrB* form (Kd of ∼1 mm). The ATP binding site of UvrB is therefore functional and accessible, suggesting that conformational change either brings amino acid residues into proper alignment for catalysis and/or enables response to effector DNA.

The ATP binding site of UvrB is therefore functional and accessible, suggesting that conformational change either brings amino acid residues into proper alignment for catalysis and/or enables response to effector DNA. Two challenges to our understanding of nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli are 1) the remarkable breadth of structural damage to DNA recognized by the Uvr repair proteins and 2) the complexity and energetics of assembly of an incision complex at the damaged site (reviewed in Refs. 1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

The extent of linkage between these may become more clear as the mechanisms of this multistep process are revealed in greater detail. One of the greater enigmas remaining in our attempt to understand these mechanistic steps is that of the multiple roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the UvrA and, especially, UvrB proteins. Both recognition of damage and incision (an energetically favorable reaction) are accomplished by other, specific endonucleases without the need for ATP (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UvrA is a DNA-independent ATPase, with two ATP binding sites, both essential in nucleotide excision repair (4Husain I. Van Houten B. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4895-4901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol.

UvrB, although it contains one Walker type A ATP motif (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar, 8Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2877-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), is catalytically silent in isolation. A cryptic, DNA-dependent ATPase activity is elicited, however, by interaction with UvrA (10Caron P. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9651-9662Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and this UvrB-associated activity is required for ensuing steps in damage location and in formation of the preincision complex. The obligate nucleotide cofactor ATP has multiple roles in the succession of macromolecular association/dissociation reactions that lead to dual endonucleolytic incisions flanking a damaged site in DNA. The binding of ATP promotes dimerization of UvrA (12Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Mazur S. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the interaction of UvrA2 with UvrB and DNA (6Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A.

It is significant that initial formation of this nucleoprotein complex, which is accompanied by a localized unwinding of the DNA (15Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), occurs at an undamaged site (13Mazur S. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to disengage from the nonspecific loading site, and thus to locate damage, is dependent on ATP hydrolysis by the UvrB component of the repair complex. Mutation of a conserved lysine in the UvrB ATP motif (K45A), which knocks out the UvrB ATPase, results in formation of a very stable, damage-insensitive UvrA2-UvrB(K45A)-DNA complex (16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once released from the loading site, ATP hydrolysis by UvrB may also be required to support the search for damage along DNA via a tracking mechanism (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or to promote the conformational changes in DNA and/or in UvrB that lead to formation of the stable UvrB-damaged DNA preincision complex, from which UvrA dissociates (14Orren D.K.

With the addition of UvrC, dual incision ensues, with the 3′ cut apparently dependent on the binding although not on hydrolysis of ATP by UvrB (23Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 24Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanistic role of the UvrB ATPase may be, at least in part, to power a UvrA2-UvrB helicase activity. UvrB itself has the full complement of conserved helicase motifs (26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 27Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); yet strand displacement activity, 5′ to 3′ and specific for short oligomers or D-loops (28Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Oh E.Y. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1336-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), requires association with UvrA. The K45A mutation in motif I (ATP binding site), cited above, eliminates the strand displacement activity (16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the ability of the UvrA2-UvrB complex to generate supercoiling in plasmid DNA (30Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in complex translocation. Mutations in other helicase motifs (V and VI) have substantiated the role of the strand displacement and ATPase activities associated with UvrB in formation of the preincision complex (27Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Conformational changes, to convey allosteric communications among binding and catalytic domains and to couple the energy of nucleotide binding or hydrolysis to physical displacements (work), are at the heart of proposed helicase mechanisms (31Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). To fulfill its role in repair, it is postulated that the UvrB protein must undergo such multiple conformational changes: to transduce allosteric signals associated with UvrA or UvrC binding and association with double or single-stranded DNA (with or without damage), and to couple binding or hydrolysis to movement. In this paper, we begin to examine the conformational dynamics of UvrB by use of fluorescent reporter groups that provide a signal responsive to their local environment, and that can report on changes on the nanosecond time scale. The focus of this study is on the initial activation of the UvrB ATPase, using as a model the serendipitous activation by a specific proteolysis carried out by the ompT gene product. Truncation of either 43 (8Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2637-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or 66–68 amino acids (32Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) from the C terminus of UvrB, which deletes no chromophores from the protein, yields an active DNA-dependent ATPase, denoted UvrB* (10Caron P. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9651-9662Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). UvrB* can interact with UvrA and form a preincision complex, but one that is less stable and with greatly reduced capacity for incision with added UvrC. Tryptophan (absent in the wild-type protein) has been introduced without significant alteration of function into the UvrB ATP binding motif, both at a site shown earlier to be mutable without phenotypic effect (Asn51) and at a residue nearer the essential and conserved lysine (Lys45) of the Walker motif (Phe47). Both “reporter mutants” reveal conformational changes, localized to the binding site, that accompany proteolytic activation. Furthermore, the tryptophan signal may be titrated to characterize nucleotide binding properties of UvrB, information previously unobtainable. Acrylamide (ultrapure), NATA, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and their buffers were obtained from New England Biolabs. The plasmid pTZuvrB, constructed by T. Seeley in this laboratory, was used as template for mutagenesis of the uvrB gene and for protein expression (16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASacI–PstI fragment of ∼4.5 kilobase pairs from pUCuvrB (11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), containing the endogenous promoters and complete coding sequence of the wild-type uvrB gene of E. coli(from strain AB1157), was cloned into the polylinker site of pTZ19R (obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), generating an ApR vector of approximately 7.4 kilobase pairs. E. coli hosts for pTZuvrB included JM109 (recA1,endA1, gyrA96, thi −, hsdR17, supE44, relA1, λ−, Δ(lac-proAB), F− (traD36, proAB, lacI q ZΔM15)), for long term storage; DH5α (F−, endA1, his R17 (rk−, mk+) sup E44, thi −, λ−, rec A1, gyr A96, rel A1Δ(arg F−, lac zya) U169, φ80lac Z ΔM15), obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and used for transformation with putative mutants; and the uvrBdeletion strain N364 (W3110 gal+, sup0, F−, Δ(attB-bio-uvrB)), obtained from M. Gottesman (Columbia University). A “cassette” mutagenesis strategy was used to introduce tryptophan into the ATP binding motif of UvrB, replacing 43 nucleotides excised as anXmnI–NcoI restriction fragment (nucleotides 577–624) with a synthetic duplex (sequence and numbering from Ref. 8Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2637-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) bore the following codon changes to the published wild-type sequence: for mutant F47W, TTC to TGG; N51W, AAT to TGG. The 43-mer was annealed to its synthetic complement (following 5′-phosphorylation of both using T4 polynucleotide kinase), a 47-mer extended by four bases at the complement's 5′-end to allow regeneration of the NcoI restriction site. Oligonucleotides were prepared using a MilliGen/Biosearch 7500 DNA synthesizer. Double digestion of plasmid pTZuvrB DNA with SacI and NcoI yielded two fragments, of ∼6485 and 865 nucleotides. The shorter fragment, encompassing the 5′-end of the coding sequence, was further digested with XmnI. The fragment of ∼815 nucleotides was retained, and the wild-type equivalent of the mutagenic synthon was discarded (fragments purified by electroelution). A three-fragment ligation (8:2:1 molar ratio of 43-base pair mutagenic oligonucleotide to 815-base pair SacI–XmnI to 6485-base pair SacI–NcoI, respectively) generated the mutant pTZuvrB vectors (see Fig. 1). Ligation products were transformed into DH5α for screening by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; primers synthesized using the MilliGen/Biosearch 7500 DNA synthesizer). Wild-type and mutant pTZuvrB plasmids were transformed into the uvrB deletion strain N364. Cells in early exponential growth were irradiated at varying doses with ultraviolet light and assayed for survival by colony counts, as described by Seeley and Grossman (11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type UvrB proteins were purified from the appropriate N364 (ΔuvrB)/pTZuvrB strain in late exponential growth. Cells, resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 20% sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; NATA, N-acetyltryptophanamide; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. were lysed by a 1-h incubation with lysozyme (0.25 mg/ml), followed by the addition of NaCl to 0.3 m. Purification then followed the published protocol (33Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using Butyl Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) supplanted phenyl-agarose in the third chromatography step; Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in place of Sephadex G-150; and FPLC using a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added as a final step. The butyl-Sepharose column was packed and equilibrated in a loading buffer composed of 1 m ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol. Ammonium sulfate was added to the fractions pooled from the DEAE-Sephacel column to a concentration of 1 m prior to loading. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 1 to 0m ammonium sulfate, and other buffer components were unchanged. UvrB (or mutant)-containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Diaflo YM30 membrane) before loading on a 4.9 cm2 × 100-cm Sephacryl S300 sizing column, equilibrated and eluted at 0.6–0.75 ml/min with a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. The Mono Q column (HR10/10) was equilibrated in a buffer of 1 m KCl in 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. Protein was loaded at this KCl concentration and eluted in a linear gradient from 1 m to 25 mm KCl. The purified UvrB proteins (KCl concentration of the pooled Mono Q fractions was approximately 300 mm) were concentrated by ultrafiltration, supplemented with glycerol to 30%, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. The purification of UvrA and UvrC proteins has been described (33Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proteolytically truncated proteins, UvrB* and its mutant counterparts, were produced and purified as described (16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the ompT-expressing E. coli strain UT5600/pML19 (34Gayda R.C. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of protein in stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm in a buffer of 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.5 (35Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Molar extinction coefficients of 29,560m−1 cm−1 for wild type and 35,250m−1 cm−1 for both Trp reporter mutants were calculated from the amino acid sequence (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The protein assay kit of Bio-Rad, based on the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard, was used for comparison among diluted samples. The comparative ability of mutant and wild-type UvrB proteins to complement UvrA and UvrC in the incision of UV-irradiated DNA was assayed by conversion of supercoil to nicked plasmid, as resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reaction mixtures included 25 ng of 3H-labeled plasmid (pHE6; 3996 base pairs at 105 cpm/μg, exposed to 750 J m−2 at 254 nm (11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) and UvrA and UvrC proteins at saturating concentrations in 40 mm K+-MOPS (pH 7.6), 85 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 15 mmMgSO4, 2 mm ATP, and bovine serum albumin (to 50 μg/ml). UvrB was added at varying concentrations prior to a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (to 0.2%) and EDTA (to 20 mm), and DNA species were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, 1 × TBE buffer. Ethidium bromide staining of outer lanes containing marker DNA was used to locate substrate and product bands. These were excised and solubilized in 21% hydrogen peroxide, 17% perchloric acid, and activity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Biosafe II mixture, Research Products International). The extent of reaction was calculated by use of the Poisson distribution. Comparisons of mutant and wild-type UvrB ATPase properties, in association with UvrA protein, or of the proteolyzed form of UvrB in isolation were performed essentially as described (11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction, using α-32P-labeled ATP, in 50 mm K+-MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT and bovine serum albumin (to 50 μg/ml), was monitored by thin layer chromatography. Chromatograms were scanned by a phosphor imager (Fujix BAS 1000), using MacBas version 2.0 for intensity quantitation. UvrB was added to varying concentrations either to 70 nm UvrA in assays omitting DNA or to 15 nm UvrA in the presence of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA (pTZ18R at 30 μm nucleotide, irradiated at 254 nm to 750 J m−2). The kinetic properties of UvrB* and the proteolyzed mutants, in the absence of UvrA, were determined using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as effector (φX174 phage DNA at 200 μg/ml). Steady state emission spectra and intensity measurements were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer, with cuvette temperature controlled by a Lauda circulating bath. All spectra and intensity measurements were corrected for background emission and scatter and, where appropriate, inner filter effects. Spectra are not corrected for wavelength-dependent instrument effects (output and photomultiplier response), but their stability was monitored during all assays by use of a p-terphenyl standard (available from Perkin-Elmer embedded in polymethylmethacrylate; excitation at 295 nm, emission at 340 nm). Quantum yields were estimated by direct comparison of emission intensities of protein samples to equimolar aqueous solutions of tryptophan, using a value of 0.14 for the quantum yield of tryptophan in water (38Chen R.F. Anal. Lett. 1967; 1: 35-42Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Quenching experiments with acrylamide were performed in stirred cells, at 25 °C, titrating from a stock of 3 m acrylamide. UvrB Trp reporter mutants were at 1 μm concentration in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl. Tryptophan emission, monitored at 340 nm, was selectively observed using 295-nm excitation. Intensity data following quencher additions were averaged over a 10-s collection and corrected for background emission (paired control lacking protein), dilution, and inner filter effect (calculated from acrylamide absorbance at 295 nm as described by Lakowicz (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar)). Intensities, F, at given quencher concentration, [Q], were then analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation, F0/F=1+KS­V·[Q]Equation 1 where F0 is the emission intensity of the protein in the absence of quencher, and KS-V is the Stern-Volmer constant for quenching, given by the slope when data are plotted as F0/F versus [Q] (40Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Where there is an apparent static component to the quenching mechanism, a modified form of the Stern-Volmer equation is used to describe total quenching and estimate the contributions of dynamic and static interactions (41Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), F0/F=(1+KS­V·[Q])exp(V·[Q])Equation 2 where the additional term, V, is a descriptor of the probability of an instantaneous interaction with a nearby quencher. Fluorescence emission was similarly titrated for study of ATP binding. Protein, at 1 μm, was assayed in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 85 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol in stirred cells at the indicated temperature. Excitation again was at 295 nm, with emission spectra collected in triplicate, and averaged for each addition of ATP. A paired titration substituting N-acetyltryptophanamide (NATA) for protein was performed to empirically correct for the significant inner filter effects arising from ATP absorbance as well as from dilution (at the maximum ATP concentration, 8 mm, the measured reduction in light intensity, (I0 −I)/I0, as gauged by the decrease in NATA emission, (F0 −F)/F0, was 0.35 ± 0.02). To obtain binding data from the ATP titrations, data were fit to the model, ΔF=ΔFmax−Kd·ΔF/LEquation 3 where ΔF is the observed change in fluorescence intensity (observed minus initial, corrected), Kd is the association constant, and L is the concentration of free ligand (approximated by the total ATP concentration). This model assumes a single binding site per protein molecule, with no interaction among proteins, and represents a trivial derivation from a standard binding expression (Eadie). In this model, simple yet appropriate to the published characteristics of UvrB, fluorescence quenching from ΔF0 (no ligand bound) to ΔFmax (100% of protein binding one equivalent of ATP) is linearly related to occupancy of the binding site. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed in collaboration with Drs. Ludwig Brand and Dmitri Toptygin (Johns Hopkins University). Instrumentation, data collection, and analysis have been described (42Badea M.G. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 378-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,43Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, excitation was by the pulse method, using a picosecond dye laser pumped by a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics 3000), with dye laser output frequency doubled to provide 295-nm pulses. Emission data, at 340 nm, were collected in duplicate using single photon counting detected by a Hamamatsu R1564U-06 microchannel plate photomultiplier. Parallel collections were made with a buffer control and a Ludox scattering solution, the latter for characterization of lamp output. Protein concentrations and buffer, which varied, are described in Table II and accompanying text. Data collection was at 25 °C.Table IIFluorescence decay parameters of UvrB derivatives F47W and N51WUvrBταUvrBταF47W χ21.0285.830.677N51W χ20.9926.350.8452.800.2363.030.1260.740.0770.730.0240.150.0100.110.004F47W τav5.3 nsN51W τav6.1 nsF47W2-bComparison of F47W versus F47W* was performed in buffer supplemented with glycerol (15%) and Mg2+ (15 mm).χ21.0515.610.481F47W*2-bComparison of F47W versus F47W* was performed in buffer supplemented with glycerol (15%) and Mg2+ (15 mm).χ21.0286.050.4082.380.2702.940.4130.790.1861.030.1410.280.0490.300.031F47W τav4.8 nsF47W* τav4.9 ns2-2001 τav = (∑αiτi2)/(∑αiτi).2-b Comparison of F47W versus F47W* was performed in buffer supplemented with glycerol (15%) and Mg2+ (15 mm). Open table in a new tab Residues within the ATPase motif of UvrB targeted for replacement by the fluorescent amino acid tryptophan included phenylalanine 47 and asparagine 51. It has been demonstrated that the latter position could be mutated without significant phenotypic effect, either by conservative or nonconservative substitutions (N51A, N51K; Ref. 11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A calculated risk was taken with the Phe47position, due to the conservative nature of the substitution and because the residue at this position within the motif is not conserved (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Employing cassette mutagenesis generated the desired mutants with 75–100% efficiency. The sequences of selected mutant clones were verified by reading at least 10 nucleotides beyond each ligation junction. We note that a commonly used oligo-directed mutagenesis approach (44Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) was not effective with template DNA produced from the full-length pTZuvrB construct. We have since been able to use oligo-directed mutagenesis following the cited protocol, by cloning only a fragment of the uvrB gene (EcoRI to BglII) into the pTZ19R vector. The same gene fragment, inserted into an M13 phage vector, was used previously in this laboratory for mutagenesis (11Seeley T. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have also encountered difficulty in sequencing the 5′ terminus of the gene and regions upstream of the promoters from the ssDNA template; these problems were obviated by performing sequencing reaction"
