https://openalex.org/W1987059825,"Bacterial endotoxins can stimulate the release of previously incorporated calcium-45 and tritiated proline from fetal rat bone in tissue culture. Endotoxin from Bacteroides melaninogenicus, an organism regularly found in the gingival crevice of man, produces a response similar to parathyroid hormone and is effective at doses as low as 0.1 microgram per milliliter. This response is inhibited by serum and dependent upon the presence of albumin. Endotoxins may play a role in the bone loss characteristic of human periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W1987491178,The frequency of the hippocampal theta rhythm in freely moving rats varies predictably in relation to behavior in a simple learning situation. The theta rhythm may be driven by electrical stimulation of the medial septal area at frequencies within the theta range. The threshold for septal driving is lowest at that frequency which the rat displays in response to frustrative nonreward; the driving threshold is selectively raised at this frequency by sodium amobarbital. It is suggested that the behavioral effects of amobarbital are due to a disruption of the theta frequency normally displayed in response to nonreward.

https://openalex.org/W1552342234,"Abstract The rate of degradation of intracellular radioactive protein of bacterial cells supported by a membrane filter has been measured directly from the appearance of radioactivity in the carrier-containing perfusate. For this purpose a perfusion apparatus has been constructed from a microsyringe filter holder. The conditions inside the apparatus are physiological and permit exponential growth up to 1 x 108 cells. Exchange of extracellular carrier leucine-12C with the intracellular leucine-14C pool is so rapid that at least 87% of the amino acid arising from protein breakdown appears in the perfusate and is not recycled into protein even in growing cultures. Only a limited portion of the cellular protein is subject to rapid degradation. It decays with a half-life of approximately 1 hour and constitutes 2 to 7% of the total cellular protein of cells growing in glucose minimal medium under various nutritional conditions (including growth and starvation). The proportion of the total protein synthesis which is directed to the synthesis of this rapidly degrading protein component increases with decreasing growth rate. At very slow growth rates 10 to 40% of the radioactivity that is incorporated into protein is incorporated into the rapidly degrading protein. Treatment which removes nonproteinaceous material and Pronase digestion of cells before and after the decay of the rapid component substantiates the conclusion that the rapidly decaying component is derived from bacterial protein. There is another radioactive component in the perfusate which is released at the very slow rate of 0.2 to 0.6% per hour for as long as the experiments are carried out (48 hours). This does not represent degradation of intracellular protein to amino acids since this process is independent of leucine exchange, and 30 to 50% of the radioactivity in the perfusate is acid-insoluble."

https://openalex.org/W1505087925,"Abstract The pyruvate-aspartic semialdehyde condensing enzyme, which occurs at the branch point in the aspartic acid family of amino acids leading to diaminopimelic acid and lysine biosynthesis, has been purified 5000-fold from crude extracts of Escherichia coli W. The protein has been shown to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and bears a net negative charge in the pH range 6.0 to 9.2. Amino acid analyses indicate the total absence of methionine. The Stokes radius of the condensing enzyme was determined from its elution volume on a Sephadex G-200 column, the sedimentation constant from sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the partial specific volume from its amino acid composition. These parameters were calculated as: 43 A, 7.1 (s20,w), and 0.724 cc per g, respectively. The molecular weight of the protein was determined as 134,000 daltons, and its frictional ratio as 1.26. The reaction catalyzed by the condensing enzyme is complex and forms a labile heterocyclic product that has been tentatively identified as dihydrodipicolinic acid. That the condensing enzyme functions in carbon-carbon bond formation by forming an imine linkage with one of its substrates has been shown by the following: (a) there is irreversible loss of enzymatic activity upon the addition of sodium borohydride only in the presence of pyruvate; (b) titration of substrate amounts of purified protein with radioactive pyruvate in the presence of sodium borohydride indicates the presence of four binding sites per protein molecule; (c) acid hydrolysis of protein derivatized with 14C-pyruvate by the borohydride treatment shows the presence of a lysine derivative that has been identified as e-N-(1-carboxyethyl)-l-lysine; (d) the protein catalyzes proton exchange between tritiated pyruvate and water that exhibits first order kinetics and is dependent on protein concentration. A possible role of the enzyme as a nucleophilic catalyst is discussed in connection with its similarity to δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase."

However, the extent of charging is only a small fraction of the level obtained with the homologous seryl-tRNA synthetase. It has been well established that most amino acids are speci- fied by more than one codon. A single tRNA molecule, how- ever, can recognize only one, two, or three codons. Thus, the proper translation of the genetic message to an amino acid specified by four codons, for example, requires at least two tRNA species (1, 2). This explains the occurrence in cells of families of tRNAs with different coding response but specifying the same amino acid (isoaccepting tRNAs). The number of such isoacceptors is further increased by the existence of multiple tRNA species specific for the same ammo acid and the same codon (redundant tRNAs (2)). Since leucine, serine, and arginine each have six codons, a larger number of isoacceptor RNAs is expected for these amino acids than for all others. Of these, the family of serine tRNAs has been most carefully studied, and there are three reports (3-5) of separation and partial puri- fication of the tRNASer family from Escherichia coli.

https://openalex.org/W1515866157,"Abstract The specificity and properties of the group of enzymes present in extracts of Lactobacillus casei which catalyzed phosphoribosyltransfer from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate to purine bases were markedly different from those in extracts of Escherichia coli. A comparison of the levels of hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine phosphoribosyltransfer activities in extracts of a wild strain and a 6-mercaptopurine-resistant strain of L. casei suggested the presence of a xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase which was distinct from the enzyme specific for hypoxanthine and guanine. This suggestion was substantiated by the finding that the activity toward xanthine was less stable at -21° and 60° than the activities toward hypoxanthine and guanine, and by its separation from these activities on Sephadex G-100. The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase present in the 6-mercaptopurine-resistant strain differed from that of the wild strain in its lower rate of ribonucleotide synthesis with hypoxanthine relative to that with guanine, and in its somewhat lower affinities for hypoxanthine and 6-mercaptopurine. When extracts of E. coli were treated at 60°, the phosphoribosyltransfer activities toward guanine and xanthine decreased at the same rate, whereas the activity toward hypoxanthine decreased more rapidly. Chromatography on Sephadex G-100 did not resolve the activities toward hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine in extracts of E. coli. However, on Ecteola-cellulose, these activities were separated into two distinct peaks, the relative specificities of which indicated the presence of two different enzymes or enzyme forms. With one, hypoxanthine was the most efficient phosphoribosyl acceptor, whereas with the other, guanine was the most efficient acceptor. No distinct xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was detected in extracts of E. coli. In extracts of both L. casei and E. coli, the activity toward adenine was distinct from the activities toward hypoxanthine, guanine, and xanthine. This was shown by separations on Sephadex G-100 columns and by the differences in rates of heat inactivation."

Some processes of the neuron end in the ganglionic neuropil, but most terminate on axons which pass through the ganglion in specific, identifiable tracts. The former processes are ipsilateral to the soma, while the latter, as well as their connections, display bilateral symmetry. Structural and functional evidence suggests that the demonstrated contacts are synaptic junctions, and that the approach can therefore be used to study patterns of synaptic organization in complex neural networks."

Crystals are elongate prisms up to 0.5 millimeter. X-ray diffraction photographs give discrete crystalline reflections to a spacing of at least 2 angstroms. The unit cell is orthorhombic P212121, with four molecules per unit cell of 40.8 by 47.5 by 136 angstroms. This is consistent with a highly asymmetric molecule such as the prolate ellipsoid suggested by the other physical measurements.

https://openalex.org/W1492017932,"Abstract Cytidine triphosphate synthetase detected earlier in crude rat liver extracts by other workers (Hurlbert, R. B., and Kammen, H. O., J. Biol. Chem., 235, 443 (1960)) has been purified about 350-fold from rat and calf liver. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UTP to CTP in the presence of ATP, l-glutamine, Mg++, and a sulfhydryl-containing compound. Although it is not an absolute requirement for the reaction, GTP is necessary for optimal activity. The kinetics of the reaction have been investigated. The velocity as a function of UTP concentration at saturating and nonsaturating concentrations of either ATP or GTP strongly resembled Michaelis-Menten hyperbolas. Similarly, hyperbolic relationships were found between the velocity and the concentration of l-glutamine either in the absence or presence of GTP. All Hill plots of these data were linear and gave Hill coefficients of unity. Thus, neither positive nor negative cooperative interactions between substrate sites or activator sites were detectable with this enzyme. These results sharply differentiate the liver enzyme from the analogous CTP synthetase of Escherichia coli B studied by other workers (Long, C. W., and Pardee, A. B., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 4715 (1967)). The bacterial enzyme has a much more stringent requirement for GTP but has no need for a sulfhydryl compound. The bacterial enzyme can exhibit both strong positive and negative cooperative substrate site interactions. With regard to regulation of enzymatic activity at the molecular level, it is noteworthy that liver and E. coli differ fundamentally at another locus in the biosynthetic pathway de novo for pyrimidine nucleotides. The liver aspartate transcarbamylase exhibits Michaelis-Menten behavior and the bacterial enzyme, sigmoidal kinetics (Gerhart, J. C., and Pardee, A. B., J. Biol. Chem., 237, 891 (1962)). The liver enzyme but not the bacterial enzyme is insensitive to negative feedback by CTP and to activation by ATP (Bresnick, E., and Mosse, H., Biochem. J., 101, 63 (1966))."

https://openalex.org/W1504696958,Abstract Previous studies have identified three classes of protein or RNA that are formed in succession during the infective cycle of T5 development in Escherichia coli F. The accompanying paper applies the powerful technique of disc electrophoresis of pulse-labeled RNA on acrylamide gels followed by autoradiography to separate and identify individual species of RNA in order to characterize the conditions and factors concerned with the time of their appearance and duration of synthesis. The use of 2.6% acrylamide gels permits the separation of some RNA species of relatively higher molecular weight but does not satisfactorily separate components in the range of 2.6 to 8.5 x 104 daltons. This latter has been accomplished by use of 10% acrylamide gels. New distinct species of RNA have been identified and the characteristics of their periods of synthesis described. The relationship of the low and high molecular weight components has been studied by means of the technique of DNA-RNA hybridization-competition. It has been found that most of the low molecular weight Class II RNA is derived by cleavage of high molecular weight Class II RNA.

The molar ratio of tRNA to enzyme was measured as 0.8: 1 for tRNASer and seryl-tRNA synthetase. The complex formation is specific with the cognate tRNA. Five purified different isoaccepting E. coli tRNASe’ species have been shown to form complexes with the enzyme. The presence of high salt (0.5

The enzymic activity was maximal in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates and was minimal with added RNase or actinomycin D. Activity was also dependent upon the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Addition of the optimal concentration of (NH4)2SO4 to the assay medium markedly stimulated the rate as well as the duration of incorporation of nucleoside triphosphates into RNA in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. The concentration of enzyme was limiting and primarily responsible for the decline in activity as incubation time was extended. At this time, addition of either more enzyme, calf thymus DNA, or inorganic salts resulted in marked stimulation of enzymic rate. Injection of cortisol (5 mg of steroid per 100 g, body weight) 3 hours prior to death caused a significant decrease in the activity of the aggregate polymerase prepared from thymic nuclei of these rats. The decreased activity was also seen with other thymolytic steroids, but not with nonthymolytic steroids. The extent of incorporation of UTP into the trichloracetic acid-insoluble fraction was stimulated by the presence of an optimal concentration of either (NH4)2SO4, KCl, or polyethylene sulfonate. Addition of calf thymus DNA to the assay system with or without (NH4)2SO4 also markedly stimulated the rate of RNA synthesis. Under all of these conditions, however, the enzymic activity of the aggregate preparation from thymic nuclei of rats injected with cortisol was significantly lower than that of a similar preparation from control animals. Base ratio analyses indicated that the composition of the RNA species synthesized by the aggregate RNA polymerase differed considerably from that formed by this preparation in the presence of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and was also influenced by the nature of the cation used. The inhibitory influence of cortisol on UTP-3H incorporation was still evident even after addition of E. coli RNA polymerase alone to the assay mixture containing the aggregate enzyme. Addition of either E. coli enzyme or (NH4)2SO4 to the Mn2+-catalyzed reaction, immediately after endogenous enzymic activity had plateaued, stimulated RNA synthesis further but did not obliterate the cortisol effect. In contrast, simultaneous addition of E. coli polymerase and the optimal concentration of (NH4)2SO4 to the assay system eliminated the differences in the rates of UTP-3H incorporation between the aggregate enzyme preparations from control and cortisol-treated animals."

https://openalex.org/W1602808886,"Abstract Three radioactively labeled peptides, Phe-[14C]-Gly-Gly, Phe-Gly-[14C]-Gly-Gly, and Phe-Gly-Gly-[14C]-Gly-Gly were synthesized by a solid phase technique and were purified by preparative paper chromatography. In Escherichia coli the relative rates of uptake, at peptide concentrations of 0.1 mm and at 1.0 mm, were inversely proportional to the number of residues in each peptide. The pentapeptide Phe-Gly-Gly-[14C]-Gly-Gly was taken up much more slowly than the homologous tri- and tetrapeptide. This was interpreted as direct demonstration of a size limit for oligopeptide transport by E. coli. In competition experiments, phenylalanine uptake by E. coli was inhibited by Phe-Gly and Phe-Gly-Gly. Inhibition of Phe-[14C]-Gly-Gly uptake by several peptides indicated a common uptake pathway for small oligopeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1583193850,"Abstract A series of tetrapeptides including triglycyl-dl-phenylalanine, dl-phenylalanyltriglycine, triglycyl-β-2-thienyl-dl-alanine, and β-2-thienyl-dl-alanyltriglycine was synthesized by conventional methods. The two pentapeptides l-phenylalanyltetraglycine and β-2-thienyl-l-alanyltetraglycine were synthesized by a solid phase method. The peptides were tested for their capacity to influence the growth of a wild strain of Escherichia coli. The two tetrapeptides containing β-2-thienylalanine were good inhibitors of E. coli growth in basal medium; however, the pentapeptide was inhibitory only at relatively high concentrations. The two tetrapeptides containing phenylalanine were more efficient in reversing the growth inhibitory effects of β-2-thienylalanine than was free phenylalanine, but the pentapeptide l-phenylalanyltetraglycine stimulated E. coli growth only at high concentrations in the presence of β-2-thienylalanine. When E. coli growth was dependent upon the presence of either dl-phenylalanyltriglycine or triglycyl-dl-phenylalanine, the analogous β-2-thienylalanine-containing tetrapeptides were more effective than free β-2-thienylalanine in inhibiting E. coli growth. The results show that the growth of a wild strain of E. coli is influenced by several tetrapeptides containing either phenylalanine or β-2-thienylalanine. However, two pentapeptides were relatively ineffective, probably because of severely limited transport of these larger molecules into the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1577297580,"Abstract Evidence is presented to show that the transacylase components of the pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase complex catalyze the transacylations of acetyl and malonyl groups from their CoA thioesters to the thioesters of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (ACP). The acetyl- and malonyltransacylase activities are inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, although it appears that a sulfhydryl group is not directly involved in the transacylations of acetyl and malonyl groups to ACP. Protection of both transacylase activities against N-ethylmaleimide inhibition can be achieved by previously incubating the synthetase with either acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA. Indoacetamide, while totally inhibiting triacetic acid lactone formation and fatty acid synthesis, has no effect on the acetyl- and malonyltransacylase activities. Acetyl-CoA competitively inhibits the malonyltransacylase activity and malonyl-CoA competitively inhibits the acetyltransacylase activity. CoA is an inhibitor of both transacylase activities, inhibiting competitively with respect to E. coli ACP. Treatment of the synthetase with 0.5 m guanidine hydrochloride followed by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography results in the separation of the acetyl- and malonyltransacylase activities from the bulk of the synthetase protein. Further separation from synthetase protein is achieved by Sephadex G-200 chromatography, but very low yields of the purified transacylase activities are obtained. It has not been possible to separate the acetyl- and malonyltransacylase activities from each other."
