https://openalex.org/W2043831227,"During geomagnetically disturbed periods the precipitational loss of energetic electrons from the outer radiation belt of the earth can readily provide the major ionization source for the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. One particularly intense manifestation of this interaction between the radiation belts and the lower atmosphere is the relativistic electron precipitation (REP) event which occurs at subauroral latitudes during magnetospheric substorm activity. At relativistic energies the precipitating electrons produce copious fluxes of energetic bremsstrahlung x-rays, the major portion of which penetrate deep into the stratosphere before undergoing excitation and ionization collisions with the neutral atmosphere. If such REP events occur more than a few percent of the time, they can, on an annual basis, provide a local source of upper stratospheric nitric oxide molecules (via the dissociation of molecular nitrogen) comparable to that from either galactic cosmic rays or energetic solar proton events. Since nitric oxide plays a major role in the removal of stratospheric ozone, it appears that the influence of REP events must also be considered in future photochemical modeling of the terrestrial ozone layer."

These azaarenes range from three- to eight-membered rings, with homologs containing up to eight alkyl carbons. In their composition, and presumably in their origin in natural fires, they resemble the aromatic hydrocarbons found in the same sediments. The analytical, geochemical, and environmental implications of these findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2076492800,"The objective of the biosphere reserve program is to identify and protect representative and unique segments of the world's biotic provinces as major centers for biotic and genetic preservation, ecological and environmental research, education, and demonstration. It is intended to be more than simply another program of preservation layered onto existing parks and reserves. The success of the program will depend in large measure on the overall significance of the selected reserves and the degree to which they are active sites for scientific research and monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W1971902734,"The weak El Niño event of 1975 had a clearly defined effect on the biological productivity of the southeastern tropical Pacific. During February and March 1975, warm (27 degrees C) water of low salinity (33.5 parts per thousand) and low nutrient content extended south across the equator east of the Galápagos Islands, replacing the nutrient-rich water normally supplied by equatorial upwelling. Equatorial primary production was less than 0.2 gram of carbon per square meter per day, one-fifth of the normal value. At the maximum development of the 1975 event, the coastal region of Peru continued to have strong nearshore upwelling with primary production values greater than 2.5 grams of carbon per square meter per day, although the zone of high production was confined to a 250-kilometer-wide band, one-half its normal width. The biological effects of the 1975 event were short-lived; in April and May 1975 the equatorial region had begun to reestablish its normal levels of primary production."

The activity of this enzyme is stimulated by coenzyme B12 and is inhibited by intrinsic factor. The inhibition is removed by the addition of coenzyme B12. This evidence is consistent with the presence of a cobalamin-dependent enzyme in higher plants."
