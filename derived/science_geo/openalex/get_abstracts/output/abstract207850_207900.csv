https://openalex.org/W2066737321,"Rabbit antibodies (7S) degraded by papain into univalent 3.5S fragments fail to fix complement when they combine, but do not precipitate, with the homologous antigens. Divalent 5S fragments obtained by pepsin digestion (composed of fragment I linked to II, but lacking fragment III) also fail to fix complement although they precipitate with homologous antigens. The amount of specific precipitate formed by the 5S antibody fragment is not increased by exposure to complement"

https://openalex.org/W2040743394,"PREVIOUS work1 on the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of fatty acids was based on the theory that either the 6-term. (that is, a double bond between the 6th and 7th carbon-atom counted from the terminal methyl group) or the 9-term. double bonds or both were fundamental for essential fatty acid activity. By means of a new quantitative bio-assay1 a number of fatty acids were tested and the results were in favour of the theory that both the 6-term. and the 9-term. positions are essential."

https://openalex.org/W2067499097,"Vendrig and Buffel have recently stated1 that trans-caffeic acid “may be a very important natural growth regulator, not less important than indole-3-acetic acid”. This conclusion was based on the identification of caffeic acid as one of the active growth substances in an ether extract of leaves, and on growth tests with commercial caffeic acid on 2-mm. sections of Avena coleop tiles. We believe that the true explanation of these observations is quite different. In what follows, a good crystalline sample of commercial caffeic acid, m.p. 188°–190°, was used."
https://openalex.org/W2042399199,"THE development of the kinetic studies of virus biosynthesis requires an accurate and rapid method for determining the amount of virus nucleoprotein contained in small samples of tissue. Bancroft and Curtis1 described a simple method which utilized trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as the substance for precipitating and extracting virus nucleic acid. Although this method is rather rapid, it results in the destruction of virus nucleoprotein and demands careful attention to the final concentration of TCA, because TCA itself has a high absorbance at 260 mµ which may cause gross errors in the measurement of the small amount of viruses. The disadvantages of the method were overcome by using ammonium sulphate instead of TCA: the accuracy and rapidity of the method were also increased."
https://openalex.org/W2026672941,The frequency of translocations induced in diploid conidia of Aspergillus nidulans by gamma rays was much higher than that of recessive mutants involving a single chromosome. More than half of the surviving nuclei contained viable translocations at radiation doses within the range normally employed for induction of mutants in microorganisms.

https://openalex.org/W2015408636,Japanese B encephalitis and some other arbor viruses were partially purified by cellulose column chromatography or by fluorocarbon deproteinization and tested for sensitivity to enzymes. Infectivity decreased markedly when the viruses were mixed with trypsin or pancreatic lipase at 37°C. The enzymes also impair the immunogenicity of the virus in rabbits. Poliovirus is resistant to the enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W2030658445,A surprising lack of dental decay was encountered in 600 individuals living in a primitive West African village where severe malnutrition exists. Low values of fluoride in water supplies and in deciduous teeth seem to exclude fluoride as a protective agent. Further studies of caries in this population are warranted.

https://openalex.org/W1963554425,"A NUMBER of authors have used paper and freely moving boundary electrophoresis for investigating proteins of gastric juice. We have tried to add to the results obtained by these methods by using electrophoresis in agar1 and immuno-electrophoresis2. With these methods, especially in the case of immuno-electrophoresis, we found that there exists a fundamental difference in the behaviour of acid and anacid gastric juices."

https://openalex.org/W1966729275,"THERE is much circumstantial evidence that, in the majority of birds at least, the communicative function of call notes and song depends principally if not entirely on those frequencies which fall within the range of normal human hearing1. Nevertheless, the limitations of the recording apparatus which has so far been used in the study of bird song are such that any ultrasonic frequencies present would probably have escaped detection. It seemed worth while, therefore, to take advantage of a recent opportunity to use apparatus designed for the recording and analysis of the ultrasonic cries of bats to study some representative examples of bird song which are known to contain fundamentals of high frequency and in which it was suspected, on more or less good evidence, higher frequency harmonics might also be found. The design and performance of the microphones and tape recorders used in this study will be fully described in a forthcoming publication on the subject2. They allowed reasonably accurate estimates of amplitude from about 50 c./s. to well over 100 kc./s."

https://openalex.org/W1980773474,"Young chicks imprinted to surrogate mothers were compared with nonimprinted controls on two tests designed to measure resistance to stress. Half of each group was run with and half without a surrogate present during the stress. One test involving survival time under starvation showed no effects. However, in the other test, imprinted chicks showed fewer distress calls in response to auditory stimulation than nonimprinted controls."

https://openalex.org/W1978056288,"POST-TETANIC potentiation has been investigated by a large number of authors in animal muscles1, but only rarely in other structures and in man. According to Peregrin2, post-tetanic potentiation in man is in close relation to the action-rest phenomenon of Sechenov. We have examined in 319 children aged 10–16 the activation of dynamic (phasic) work of the hand following static strain of 15–20 sec; the same hand working thus without rest. A mercury dynamometer was used, the frequency of work being 1 contraction in 1 sec. Five contractions after the static strain were statistically correlated with the last five contractions before it. A statistically significant rise was observed in only half my 1,188 experiments (51.86 per cent girls, and 48.40 boys), which is markedly less than in the group of higher age studied by Peregrin."
https://openalex.org/W1992162679,"A novel method for the coding of hand-sorted, edge-punched cards based in part on the phonetics of a word is outlined. The greatest utility of the scheme lies in its speed because of the elimination of a need of a controlled index. Experience gained in the operation of the new system is briefly described."
https://openalex.org/W2001626109,"THE introduction of polyethylene glycol adipate as a stationary phase in gas/liquid chromatography has made possible the separation and identification of the long-chain fatty acids present in such materials as montan wax1. This method has also proved useful in assessing the purity of commercially available fatty acids required for work with Langmuir monolayers. The acids were esterified with methanol and sulphuric acid. The esters were recrystallized from methanol, and were analysed chromatographically, using an 18-in. column (10 per cent polyethylene glycol + 1 per cent phosphoric acid on ‘Celite’) at a temperature of 210° C., with a hydrogen–nitrogen gas mixture (75 : 25) flowing at 25 ml./min. A flame-ionization detector was used. Results of the analysis of a number of commercially available acids are summarized in Table 1."
