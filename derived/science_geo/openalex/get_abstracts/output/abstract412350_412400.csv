https://openalex.org/W2019226819,"Many host-adapted bacterial pathogens contain DNA methyltransferases (mod genes) that are subject to phase-variable expression (high-frequency reversible ON/OFF switching of gene expression). In Haemophilus influenzae and pathogenic Neisseria, the random switching of the modA gene, associated with a phase-variable type III restriction modification (R-M) system, controls expression of a phase-variable regulon of genes (a ""phasevarion""), via differential methylation of the genome in the modA ON and OFF states. Phase-variable type III R-M systems are also found in Helicobacter pylori, suggesting that phasevarions may also exist in this key human pathogen. Phylogenetic studies on the phase-variable type III modH gene revealed that there are 17 distinct alleles in H. pylori, which differ only in their DNA recognition domain. One of the most commonly found alleles was modH5 (16% of isolates). Microarray analysis comparing the wild-type P12modH5 ON strain to a P12ΔmodH5 mutant revealed that six genes were either up- or down-regulated, and some were virulence-associated. These included flaA, which encodes a flagella protein important in motility and hopG, an outer membrane protein essential for colonization and associated with gastric cancer. This study provides the first evidence of this epigenetic mechanism of gene expression in H. pylori. Characterisation of H. pylori modH phasevarions to define stable immunological targets will be essential for vaccine development and may also contribute to understanding H. pylori pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000690906,"Polysialic acid (polySia) is a unique polysaccharide that modifies neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) spatiotemporally. Recently, we demonstrated that polySia functions as a reservoir for several neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. Here, we showed the direct interaction between polySia and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) by native-PAGE, gel filtration, and surface plasmon resonance. The minimum chain length of polySia required for the interaction with FGF2 was 17. Compared with heparan sulfate, a well known glycosaminoglycan capable of forming a complex with FGF2, polySia formed a larger complex with distinct properties in facilitating oligomerization of FGF2, as well as in binding to FGF receptors. In polySia-NCAM-expressing NIH-3T3 cells, which were established by transfecting cells with either of the plasmids for the expression of the polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII/STX and ST8SiaIV/PST that can polysialylate NCAM, FGF2-stimulated cell growth, but not cell survival, was inhibited. Taken together, these results suggest that polySia-NCAM might be involved in the regulation of FGF2-FGF receptor signaling through the direct binding of FGF2 in a manner distinct from heparan sulfate."

To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning the ability of Nautella sp. R11 to colonize, invade and induce bleaching of D. pulchra, we sequenced and analyzed its genome. The genome encodes several factors such as adhesion mechanisms, systems for the transport of algal metabolites, enzymes that confer resistance to oxidative stress, cytolysins, and global regulatory mechanisms that may allow for the switch of Nautella sp. R11 to a pathogenic lifestyle. Many virulence effectors common in phytopathogenic bacteria are also found in the R11 genome, such as the plant hormone indole acetic acid, cellulose fibrils, succinoglycan and nodulation protein L. Comparative genomics with non-pathogenic Roseobacter strains and a newly identified pathogen, Phaeobacter sp. LSS9, revealed a patchy distribution of putative virulence factors in all genomes, but also led to the identification of a quorum sensing (QS) dependent transcriptional regulator that was unique to pathogenic Roseobacter strains. This observation supports the model that a combination of virulence factors and QS-dependent regulatory mechanisms enables indigenous members of the host alga's epiphytic microbial community to switch to a pathogenic lifestyle, especially under environmental conditions when innate host defence mechanisms are compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2012150396,"Current treatments for HBV chronic carriers using interferon alpha or nucleoside analogues are not effective in all patients and may induce the emergence of HBV resistant strains. Bay 41-4109, a member of the heteroaryldihydropyrimidine family, inhibits HBV replication by destabilizing capsid assembly. The aim of this study was to determine the antiviral effect of Bay 41-4109 in a mouse model with humanized liver and the spread of active HBV. Antiviral assays of Bay 41-4109 on HepG2.2.15 cells constitutively expressing HBV, displayed an IC50 of about 202 nM with no cell toxicity. Alb-uPA/SCID mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and infected with HBV. Ten days post-infection, the mice were treated with Bay 41-4109 for five days. During the 30 days of follow-up, the HBV load was evaluated by quantitative PCR. At the end of treatment, decreased HBV viremia of about 1 log(10) copies/ml was observed. By contrast, increased HBV viremia of about 0.5 log(10) copies/ml was measured in the control group. Five days after the end of treatment, a rebound of HBV viremia occurred in the treated group. Furthermore, 15 days after treatment discontinuation, a similar expression of the viral capsid was evidenced in liver biopsies. Our findings demonstrate that Bay 41-4109 displayed antiviral properties against HBV in humanized Alb-uPA/SCID mice and confirm the usefulness of Alb-uPA/SCID mice for the evaluation of pharmaceutical compounds. The administration of Bay 41-4109 may constitute a new strategy for the treatment of patients in escape from standard antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2063738824,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) act by suppressing the activation and effector functions of innate and adaptive immune responses. HIV infection impacts Treg proportion and phenotype, although discrepant results have been reported depending on the patient population and the way Tregs were characterized. The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on Treg frequency have not been thoroughly documented. We performed a detailed longitudinal analysis of Treg frequency and phenotype in 11 HIV-infected individuals enrolled in a single, prospective clinical trial, in which all patients underwent the same treatment protocol and were sampled at the same time points. Tregs were characterized for their expression of molecules associated with activation, cell cycle, apoptosis, or function, and compared to circulating Tregs from a group of age-matched healthy individuals.Our results revealed increased proportions, but reduced absolute numbers of circulating CD3(+)CD4(+)FOXP3(+) Tregs in chronically infected HIV-infected patients. Treg frequency was largely normalized by HAART. Importantly, we show that similar conclusions were drawn regardless of the combination of markers used to define Tregs. Our results also showed increased expression of cell cycle markers (Ki67 and cyclin B) in Tregs from untreated infected individuals, which were decreased by HAART. However, the Treg phenotype in untreated patients was not consistent with a higher level of generalized activation, as they expressed very low levels of CD69, slightly elevated levels of HLA-DR and similar levels of GARP compared to Tregs from uninfected donors. Moreover, none of these markers was significantly changed by HAART. Treg expression of CTLA-4 and cytotoxic molecules was identical between patients and controls. The most striking difference in terms of functional molecules was the high expression of CD39 by Tregs in untreated patients, which HAART only partially controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1965014950,"Background The citrus red mite is a worldwide citrus pest and a common sensitizing allergen of asthma and rhinitis. It has developed strong resistance to many registered acaricides, However, the molecular mechanisms of resistance remain unknown. we therefore used next generation sequencing technology to investigate the global transcriptomes between resistant strains and susceptible strains. Results We obtained 34,159, 30,466 and 32,217 unigenes by assembling the SS reads, RS reads and SS&RS reads respectively. There are total 17,581 annotated unigenes from SS&RS reads by BLAST searching databases of nr, the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) with an E-value ≤ 1e-5, in which 7,075 unigenes were annotated in the COG database, 12, 712 unigenes were found in the KEGG database and 3,812 unigenes were assigned to Gene ontology (GO). Moreover, 2,701 unigenes were judged to be the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the uniquely mapped reads. There are 219 pathways in all annotated unigenes and 198 pathways in DEGs that mapped to the KEGG database. We identified 211 metabolism genes and target genes related to general insecticide resistance such as P450 and Cytochrome b, and further compared their differences between RS and SS. Meanwhile, we identified 105 and 194 genes related to growth and reproduction, respectively, based on the mode of action of Hexythiazox. After further analyses, we found variation in sequences but not in gene expression related to mite growth and reproduction between different strains. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first comparative transcriptome study to discover candidate genes involved in phytophagous mite resistance. This study identified differential unigenes related to general pesticide resistance and organism growth and reproduction in P. citri. The assembled, annotated transcriptomes provide a valuable genomic resource for further understanding the molecular basis of resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1986069023,"Although co-translational biological processes attract much attention, no general and easy method has been available to detect cellular nascent polypeptide chains, which we propose to call collectively a ""nascentome."" We developed a method to selectively detect polypeptide portions of cellular polypeptidyl-tRNAs and used it to study the generality of the quality control reactions that rescue dead-end translation complexes. To detect nascent polypeptides, having their growing ends covalently attached to a tRNA, cellular extracts are separated by SDS-PAGE in two dimensions, first with the peptidyl-tRNA ester bonds preserved and subsequently after their in-gel cleavage. Pulse-labeled nascent polypeptides of Escherichia coli form a characteristic line below the main diagonal line, because each of them had contained a tRNA of nearly uniform size in the first-dimension electrophoresis but not in the second-dimension. The detection of nascent polypeptides, separately from any translation-completed polypeptides or degradation products thereof, allows us to follow their fates to gain deeper insights into protein biogenesis and quality control pathways. It was revealed that polypeptidyl-tRNAs were significantly stabilized in E. coli upon dysfunction of the tmRNA-ArfA ribosome-rescuing system, whose function had only been studied previously using model constructs. Our results suggest that E. coli cells are intrinsically producing aberrant translation products, which are normally eliminated by the ribosome-rescuing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2020580205,"The WaaL-mediated ligation of O-antigen onto the core region of the lipid A-core block is an important step in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic pathway. Although the LPS biosynthesis has been largely characterized, only a limited amount of in vitro biochemical evidence has been established for the ligation reaction. Such limitations have primarily resulted from the barriers in purifying WaaL homologues and obtaining chemically defined substrates. Accordingly, we describe herein a chemical biology approach that enabled the reconstitution of this ligation reaction. The O-antigen repeating unit (O-unit) of Escherichia coli O86 was first enzymatically assembled via sequential enzymatic glycosylation of a chemically synthesized GalNAc-pyrophosphate-undecaprenyl precursor. Subsequent expression of WaaL through use of a chaperone co-expression system then enabled the demonstration of the in vitro ligation between the synthesized donor (O-unit-pyrophosphate-undecaprenyl) and the isolated lipid A-core acceptor. The previously reported ATP and divalent metal cation dependence were not observed using this system. Further analyses of other donor substrates revealed that WaaL possesses a highly relaxed specificity toward both the lipid moiety and the glycan moiety of the donor. Lastly, three conserved amino acid residues identified by sequence alignment were found essential for the WaaL activity. Taken together, the present work represents an in vitro systematic investigation of the WaaL function using a chemical biology approach, providing a system that could facilitate the elucidation of the mechanism of WaaL-catalyzed ligation reaction.

Bacterial cell surfaces are decorated with various types of glycoconjugates that play critical roles in the interactions between bacteria and the environment (1.Whitfield C.

A typical LPS molecule consists of three structural components: lipid A (endotoxin), a non-repeating core oligosaccharide, and O-antigen (4.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu.

The LPS biosynthesis at the IM involves the respective synthesis and export to the periplasmic surface of the IM of lipid A-core and O-antigen-pyrophosphate-undecaprenyl (O-antigen-PP-Und) and the final ligation of O-antigen onto the core region of the lipid A-core block (4.Raetz C.R.

Sequence analyses indicate that these WaaL homologues are all integral membrane proteins. Furthermore, although the primary amino acid sequences of these homologues show significant divergence, they exhibit similar membrane topology characteristics highlighted by the presence of multiple membrane-spanning domains and one large periplasmic loop with variable lengths (4.Raetz C.R.

In this study, a WaaL homologue from Escherichia coli O86:B7 (the R3-type core) was successfully expressed and purified with high purity.

The gene was then amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of E. coli O86:B7.

The insolubilized materials were removed by centrifugation (150,000 × g, 1 h, at 4 °C). n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside-bound WaaL in the supernatant was purified by using HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) as described previously (24.Guo H. Lokko K. Zhang Y. Yi W. Wu Z. Wang P.G. Overexpression and characterization of Wzz of Escherichia coli O86:H2.Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, eluted WaaL from the HisTrap HP column was applied to the PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) to desalt and then eluted with storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and 20% glycerol). Purified WaaL was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and kept at −20 °C. Lipid A-core was extracted from E. coli O86:B7 waaL knock-out cells using the phenol, chloroform, and petroleum ether method as described previously (25.Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. A new method for the extraction of R lipopolysaccharides.Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The WaaL ligation reaction was performed with a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 μm lipid A-core, 10 μm O-unit-PP-lipid, and purified WaaL (∼1–2 μg). The reaction was allowed to continue for 12 h at 37 °C and then quenched with the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteinase K was added to digest WaaL. 20 μl of reaction mixture was applied to a 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). LPS molecules were blotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane and visualized using the E. coli O86 O-antigen antiserum and the HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody. To plot the time course of the WaaL ligation reaction, the in vitro assays for different donor substrates were run at the same conditions (i.e. 2.5 μm lipid A-core, 10 μm glycan-PP-lipid, 1 μg of purified WaaL, and 37 °C). At each of eight time points (0 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h), an aliquot of reaction mixture was removed out and immediately quenched with the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples from all time points were applied to one SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Western blotting. The band intensities were quantified by using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare) and plotted over the reaction time. Three WaaL mutants, WaaLR209A, WaaLR268A, and WaaLH319A, were created by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table S1) were designed to create the desired amino acid change. The pBAD-waaL10×His plasmid was used as the DNA template. PCR products were digested with DpnI and transformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells. Plasmids were isolated and sequenced to confirm the desired substitution of amino acid residues. The WaaL mutants were expressed, purified, and applied to the in vitro ligation assay. Most of E. coli O-antigen polymers are ligated to Und-P using a GlcNAc or GalNAc reducing-end residue that is attached separately in the initial step(s) of the O-antigen biosynthesis. The WecA protein catalyzes the formation of GlcNAc-PP-Und by transferring GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc onto Und-P. GalNAc-PP-Und, however, is formed via a two-step pathway, i.e. the initial WecA-catalyzed synthesis of GlcNAc-PP-Und followed by the epimerization of the 4-OH of GlcNAc catalyzed by a novel epimerase (26.Rush J.S. Alaimo C. Robbiani R. Wacker M. Waechter C.J. A novel epimerase that converts GlcNAc-P-P-undecaprenol to GalNAc-P-P-undecaprenol in Escherichia coli O157.J. Biol.

Our initial attempts to express and purify integral membrane proteins WecA and the epimerase of E. coli to synthesize GlcNAc-PP-Und and GalNAc-PP-Und were not successful. Accordingly, an alternative methodology was employed for obtaining the O-unit-PP-Und molecule. Specifically, we exploited a chemoenzymatic approach in which the chemically synthesized GalNAc-PP-Und precursor was elaborated to the E. coli O86 pentasaccharide repeating unit via successive enzymatic glycosylation using four glycosyltransferases cloned from E. coli O86 following the established protocols (7.Woodward R.

Such flexibility allows for the in vitro construction of an oligosaccharide on an unnatural lipid mimic rather than Und. Herein, a total of seven other unique O-unit-PP-lipid molecules were synthesized on a milligram scale, wherein the lipid moieties exhibit variations in the isoprenyl geometry (i.e. cis or trans double bond configuration), the saturation degree, and the chain length (Table 1). The acquisition of these various lipids appended with the same oligosaccharide moiety provided us with a comprehensive library to probe the donor-lipid specificity of WaaL using an in vitro ligation assay. It should be noted that the enzymatic glycosylation reactions are routinely highly efficient with all the intermediates nearly completely converted into products as monitored by ESI-MS analysis of each reaction step.TABLE 1O-unit-PP-lipid compounds used in this study Open table in a new tab In E. coli, five core oligosaccharide variants have been identified, termed R1–R4 and K12, in which structural differences are primarily located in the outer core region (4.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). Each of the five core variants has its own specific WaaL ligase. The waaL gene of E. coli O86:B7 was sequenced in our laboratory. The sequence BLAST analysis indicated that the strain encodes R3 WaaL. A recombinant plasmid (pBAD-waaL10×His) was prepared to overexpress this WaaL, and the construct encodes full-length E. coli O86:B7 WaaL with a C terminus 10×His epitope. The pBAD-waaL10×His recombinant plasmid and the pGro7 GroES/EL chaperone expression vector were co-transformed into E. coli C43(DE3). The use of E. coli C43(DE3), in combination with the co-expression of chaperones, provided sufficient active WaaL-His10 fusion protein that was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 3). Purified WaaL was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3). Two main bands were found on SDS-PAGE, and further analysis using Western blotting indicated that both bands contain the His epitope. One band (32 kDa) corresponds to the monomer of WaaL, and the other band (64 kDa) was believed to be the dimer of WaaL. The finding that WaaL forms a dimer agrees with previously observed dimer formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 WaaL (16.Abeyrathne P.D. Lam J.S. WaaL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes ATP in in vitro ligation of O-antigen onto lipid A-core.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa for the monomer is obviously considerably lower than the predicted value of 47.7 kDa, such aberrations in molecular masses have frequently been encountered in SDS-PAGE analyses of integral membrane proteins (16.Abeyrathne P.D. Lam J.S. WaaL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes ATP in in vitro ligation of O-antigen onto lipid A-core.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The lipid A-core molecule was extracted from E. coli O86:B7 waaL knock-out cells. Upon the acquisition of the synthesized donor substrate, isolated lipid A-core, and purified WaaL, we then sought to develop an in vitro WaaL assay. A series of reactions was accordingly performed in which all components were present or one or more were absent. Following these reactions, the samples were analyzed using Western blotting that employed the E. coli O86 O-antigen antiserum to visualize LPS molecules. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The band observed in lane 3 of Fig. 4 represents the lipid A-core acceptor (hereafter referred to as lipid A-coreR3). The observation that the O-antigen antiserum can visualize LPS molecules indicates that the antiserum also contains core epitope-specific antibodies. This phenomenon is also observed with an E. coli O86 O-antigen antiserum from a different manufacturer (Statens Serum Institute of Denmark). Interestingly, a band migrating slightly faster than lipid A-coreR3 was observed when only WaaL, ATP, and MgCl2 were present (Fig. 4, lane 2). We reasoned that it is most likely that it corresponds to lipid A-core produced by E. coli C43(DE3) (hereafter referred to as lipid A-corehost). Lipid A-corehost might bind to WaaL and be co-purified with WaaL. The migration discrepancy observed between lipid A-coreR3 and lipid A-host host might be ascribed to the molecular weight difference of these two molecules. Surprisingly, we also observed that lipid A-corehost migrates slightly slower when O-unit-PP-Und is included in the reaction mixture, as can be seen by comparison of lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 4. This trend was also observed in all of the reactions where the O-unit-PP-Und donor is present (Fig. 4, lanes 7–9; Fig. 5A, lane 9; Fig. 5B, lanes 1–5). However, the migration of lipid A-coreh"

Using affinity chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools, we identified mucin 16 (MUC16) as a novel selectin ligand expressed by metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. While up-regulated in many pancreatic cancers, the biological function of sialofucosylated MUC16 has yet to be fully elucidated. To address this, we employed blot rolling and cell-free flow-based adhesion assays using MUC16 immunopurified from pancreatic cancer cells and found that it efficiently binds E- and L- but not P-selectin. The selectin-binding determinants are sialofucosylated structures displayed on O-and N-linked glycans. Silencing MUC16 expression by RNAi markedly reduces pancreatic cancer cell binding to E- and L-selectin under flow. These findings provide a novel integrated perspective on the enhanced metastatic potential associated with MUC16 overexpression and the role of selectins in metastasis.—Chen, S.-H., Dallas, M.

Combination therapy may be the only viable therapeutic option until new antibiotics become available. The objective of this study is to assess the in vitro activity of various antibiotics against local XDR-PA isolates.PA isolates from all public hospitals in Singapore were systematically collected between 2006 and 2007. MICs were determined according to CLSI guidelines. All XDR-PA isolates identified were genotyped using a PCR-based method. Time-kill studies (TKS) were performed with approximately 10(5) CFU/ml at baseline using clinically achievable unbound concentrations of amikacin (A), levofloxacin (L), meropenem (M), rifampicin (R) and PB alone and in combination. Bactericidal activity (primary endpoint) was defined as a ≥3 log(10) CFU/ml decrease in the colony count from the initial inoculum at 24 hours.22 clinical XDR-PA isolates with PB MIC 2-16 µg/ml were collected. From clonal typing, 5 clonal groups were identified and nine isolates exhibited clonal diversity. In TKS, meropenem plus PB, amikacin plus meropenem, amikacin plus rifampicin, amikacin plus PB exhibited bactericidal activity in 8/22, 3/22, 1/22 and 6/22 isolates at 24 hours respectively. Against the remaining ten isolates where none of the dual-drug combination achieved bactericidal activity against, only the triple-antibiotic combinations of ARP and AMP achieved bactericidal activity against 7/10 and 6/10 isolates respectively.Bactericidal activity with sustained killing effect of ≥99.9% is critical for eradicating XDR-PA infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts. These findings underscore the difficulty of developing combination therapeutic options against XDR-PA, demonstrating that at least 3 antibiotics are required in combination and that efficacy is strain dependant."
https://openalex.org/W2141380548,"Increasing settlement and post-settlement survival during the critical transition from planktonic larvae to benthic juveniles will increase efficiency for sea urchin aquaculture. This study investigated the effects of temperature and settlement cues on the settlement and post-settlement survival of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla during this phase. The current commercial methodology, which utilises natural biofilm settlement plates, was tested and resulted in low settlement (<2%) and poor post-settlement survival (<1% of settled urchins). In laboratory trials, settlement was high and unaffected by temperatures between 24 and 30°C, but significantly decreased at 33°C. Development of spines, however, was significantly affected by temperatures over 29°C. Mirroring this result, post-settlement survival was optimal between 24–28°C. In laboratory assays, the macroalgae Sargassum linearifolium and Corallina officinalis, and seawater conditioned with these algae, induced significantly higher settlement (>90%) than a natural biofilm (∼25%). The addition of macroalgae-conditioned seawater to natural biofilm significantly increased settlement rates (>85%). Mixed consortia and single strains of bacteria isolated from macroalgae, biofilms and adult conspecifics all induced significant settlement, but at significantly lower rates than macroalgae. No evidence was found that higher rates of settlement to bacteria on macroalgae were generated by a cofactor from the macroalgae. Age of bacterial cultures, culturing bacteria on solid and liquid media and concentration of nutrients in cultures had little effect on settlement rates. Finally, macroalgae-conditioned seawater combined with natural biofilm settlement plates induced significantly higher settlement than to the biofilm plates alone in a commercial scale trial. However, high post-settlement mortality resulted in equivalent survival between treatments after 25 days. This study highlights that settlement studies should extend to post-settlement survival, which remains poor for T. gratilla and is a significant obstacle to increasing efficiency for aquaculture."

Chemokines are small pro-inflammatory proteins that mediate the selective recruitment and trafficking of leukocytes to inflammatory sites. They signal through seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors expressed by the migrating cell (1Rossi D. Zlotnik A. The biology of chemokines and their receptors.Annu. Rev.

Given these findings and the characteristic nodal metastases observed in SCCHN, CCR7 appears to be a key contributor of SCCHN tumorigenesis, highlighting the need to understand its regulation and contribution to patient outcome. Chemokines and their receptors are induced by inflammatory stimuli in the tumor microenvironment, which are often potent activators of NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factors, thereby linking chronic inflammation to cancer progression (5Karin M.

In SCCHN, NF-κB is constitutively active and facilitates tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. On the other hand, the AP1 transcription factor complex consists of Jun and Fos protein families. Typically, inflammatory mediators, hormonal/growth factors, and physical/chemical stressors activate downstream MAPK cascades, which enhance the activation of AP1.

Thus, we investigated the biological contribution of inflammatory NF-κB and AP1 in regulating CCR7 expression in metastatic SCCHN and the clinical impact of this oncogene. Human metastatic SCCHN cell lines PCI-6B, PCI-15B, and PCI-37B were derived and characterized at the University of Pittsburgh (17Heo D.S. Snyderman C. Gollin S.M. Pan S. Walker E. Deka R. Barnes E.L.

Biology, cytogenetics, and sensitivity to immunological effector cells of new head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5167-5175PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio, Ingram, TX), 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma to ensure that only mycoplasma-free cell lines were studied in our assays. The cells were also cytogenetically reconfirmed, and the data remained consistent. Anti-human NF-κB p65 (CT) and normal mouse IgG for the ChIP assays were purchased from Upstate (Temecula, CA). The p50 and p65 antibodies (used for EMSA supershift) and c-Fos antibody (for ChIP assays) were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Human TNFα was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The inhibitors: BAY 11-7082, SB203580, and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem, whereas PD98059 was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Applied Science, whereas phosphatase inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich. Tumor levels of NF-κB and CCR7 were evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of primary tumor and adjacent mucosal specimens arrayed in a previously described tissue microarray (TMA) that was obtained using an institutional review board-approved study and informed consent (18Knowles L.M. Stabile L.P. Egloff A.M. Rothstein M.E. Thomas S.M. Gubish C.T. Lerner E.C. Seethala R.R. Suzuki S. Quesnelle K.M. Morgan S. Ferris R.L. Grandis J.R. Siegfried J.M.

For the studies presented here, there were 47 evaluable tumor specimens, of which 13 tumors on the TMA had adjacent mucosal tissues available for analysis. A summary of patient and tumor characteristics is provided in Table 1. The human papilloma virus (HPV) status of arrayed tumors was assessed using an HPV pan-specific DNA probe (Dako, wide spectrum HPV DNA probe mixture, biotinylated), which recognizes HPV subtypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, and 52, and bright field in situ hybridization. 3S.

Open table in a new tab Prior to incubation with anti-CCR7 antibody (1:100) (Gene Tex Inc., Irvine, CA), antigen retrieval was performed using Dako citrate pH 6 buffer (Carpinteria, CA) in the Biocare Decloaking chamber. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and slides were blocked with CAS block (Invitrogen). CCR7 staining was developed using rabbit Envision polymer (Dako) followed by incubation with Substrate Chromagen (Dako). The slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. The plasma membrane and cytoplasmic staining intensity (intensity scores of 0–3), as well as percentage of tumor to the nearest 5% were determined by a head and neck cancer pathologist (L. W. and R. R. S.). An IHC score was derived from the product of the intensity and percentage of tumor stained, and IHC scores for each core of a specimen were averaged. For the NF-κB staining, prior to incubation with anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (1:200) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), antigen retrieval was performed using Borg buffer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) in a Biocare Decloaking chamber, and quenching and blocking were performed as for CCR7 staining. Staining was developed by incubation with Mach 2 rabbit polymer (Biocare Medical) followed by incubation with Substrate Chromagen. NF-κB nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were evaluated separately, and the IHC scores were derived separately. IHC staining was evaluated and scored as described for CCR7. The cells were serum-starved for 48 h prior to stimulation. Following treatment, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and then quenched with 0.125 m glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and collected. After centrifugation, the cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (Upstate, Temecula, CA) containing protease inhibitors. Chromatin was sheared by sonication 5 times for 10 s each (at 25% of the maximum potency) to generate sheared DNA with an average length between 200 and 1000 base pairs. The immunoprecipitation of NF-κB p65-bound chromatin, washes, and elution steps were performed using the Ez-ChIPTM kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according to the instructions provided. Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight. After RNase (10 μg, 30 min, 37 °C) and proteinase K (10 μg, 2 h, 45 °C) (Sigma-Aldrich) digestion, DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). About 110of the purified DNA was used in each PCR using these primers: GAPDH, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ (s) and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′ (as); IκBα, 5′-GACGACCCCAATTCAAATCG-3′ (s) and 5′-TCAGGCTCGGGGAATTTCC-3′ (as); CCR7 κB0–1, 5′-CTGAAAGAAGCCAGATGTGAAGGTCA-3′ (s) and 5′-AATATCACATGCCAGGCCATGGGT-3′ (as); CCR7 κB1–2, 5′-TTGGCCTAAACTACCCAGAAGCCA-3′ (s) and 5′-AGAAAGGTGACAGAGGGTGACAGT-3′ (as); and CCR7 κB2–3, 5′-ACCCATGGCCTGGCATGTGATATT-3′ (s) and 5′-TTAAGTTGTCGGAGAAGCCACCCT-3′ (as). Following stimulation of PCI-6B, PCI-15B, and PCI-37B, the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, scraped, collected, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After allowing cells to swell on ice for 15 min, 1% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the cells were vortexed. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was collected and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Samples were vortexed at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Nuclear extract supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was examined using radiolabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide probes in an EMSA. Following the identification of NF-κB binding sites on the CCR7 promoter using promoter scanning techniques, we designed probe sequences that included the 10-bp flanking nucleotides on either side of each κB site as follows: CCR7 κB0, GTGGTTGCCAGGGGCTTTCGATGACAGGAG; CCR7 κB1, GGGAAGGATGGGGACACTTCTCTCACACAT; CCR7 κB2, AGGCAGCGCAGGGGGCTTTTTGAATGTAAA; CCR7 κB3, AGGCATTGAAGGGGCCCTGCATGAGTCAGG; κB consensus, CGACACCCCTCGGGAATTTCCCCACTGGGCC; CRE motif, GATCCGGCTGACGTCATCAAGCTAGATC. 6–10 μg of nuclear extract was added to buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 μg BSA) and incubated with 0.1 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA binding activity to the “κB consensus” probe was examined as a positive control, whereas that to the “CREB motif” was a loading control. In the competition and antibody supershift analyses, the respective unlabeled oligonucleotides or antibodies were added to the reaction for 10 min before the addition of radiolabeled probe. All of the samples were run on 5% native gels and developed by autoradiography. The CCR7 promoter regions were amplified by PCR primers designed to encompass each κB region and the 150–200 flanking nucleotides: κB0, 5′-GGGGGTACCCTGAAAGAAGCCAGATGTGAAGGTCA-3′ (s) and 5′-GGGAAGCTTCACAGAGTTATGCAACCATCACCAC-3′ (as); κB1, 5′-GGGGGTACCTTGGCCTAAACTACCCAGAAGCCA-3′ (s) and 5′-GGGAAGCTTAATATCACATGCCAGGCCATGGGT-3′ (as); κB2, 5′-GGGGGTACCACCCATGGCCTGGCATGTGATATT-3′ (s) and 5′-GGGAAGCTTAGAAAGGTGACAGAGGGTGACGT-3′ (as); and κB3, 5′-GGGGGTACCACTGTCACCCTCTGTCACCTTTCT-3′ (s) and 5′-GGGAAGCTTTTAAGTTGTCGGAGAAGCCACCCT-3′ (as). The constructs were then cloned upstream of the TATA box in the pGL4.26 firefly luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using KpnI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. Deletion mutants were obtained by using PCR primers that encompassed successively smaller portions of the κB3 region. To knock out the TPE site using site-directed mutagenesis, a primer sequence containing CAAGTAC to replace TGAGTCA was utilized, and the mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Transient co-transfections along with a Renilla luciferase control were performed using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen). After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with relevant cytokine for another 24 h, and the luciferase activity was measured. Where applicable, firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase. RNA was isolated from metastatic SCCHN tumor cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNA CleanUp (Qiagen), followed by DNase digestion (Ambion). The concentration and purity of RNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. RNA (2000 ng) was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamers and MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (19Godfrey T.E. Kim S.H. Chavira M. Ruff D.W. Warren R.S. Gray J.W. Jensen R.H.

Diagn. 2000; 2: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was then performed on the Applied Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detection Instrument, using TaqMan predeveloped assay reagent for human CCR7 (Applied Biosystems). Cycling parameters were: initial denaturation at 95 °C (12 min), 40 cycles of 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (1 min). All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Relative expression of the CCR7 target gene to endogenous control gene (β-glucuronidase (‘)) was calculated using the ΔCT method: relative expression = 2−ΔCT, where ΔCT = CT (CCR7) − CT (GUS) (2Wang J. Xi L. Hunt J.L. Gooding W. Whiteside T.L. Chen Z. Godfrey T.E. Ferris R.L. Expression pattern of chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and CCR7 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck identifies a novel metastatic phenotype.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the IHC analysis, the differences between paired tumor and adjacent mucosa levels of each protein were evaluated using the signed rank test. Correlations between proteins were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from first treatment to recurrent upper aerodigestive tumor, metastasis, or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first treatment to death. Patients who were event-free were censored at last follow-up. Log rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to evaluate association between tumor CCR7 levels (high versus low defined as median IHC score) and PFS or OS. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested by interrogation of scaled Schoenfeld residuals. In other experiments, the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three repeats. An unpaired t test was used to calculate whether observed differences were statistically significant. The threshold for significance was p < 0.05. To determine the biological and clinical significance of CCR7 expression, we utilized IHC on a TMA from a well characterized SCCHN cohort (n = 47 patient tumors) (20Egloff A.M. Rothstein M.E. Seethala R. Siegfried J.M. Grandis J.R. Stabile L.P. Cross-talk between estrogen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 6529-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to investigate the association of CCR7 expression with PFS and OS. In this TMA, 13 patient tumors had evaluable paired histologically normal, adjacent mucosa. Significantly higher CCR7 staining was found in tumor tissues as compared with surrounding squamous mucosa (p < 0.001). The log rank test indicated that higher tumor CCR7 expression levels were significantly associated with worse median PFS (p < 0.013) and OS (p < 0.026) (Fig. 1). Univariate Cox proportional hazards models confirmed that high tumor CCR7 was associated with decreased PFS (HR = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.20–6.30) and OS (HR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.09–6.09). When adjusted for other prognostic factors including nodal stage (N0 versus N+), age, and tumor HPV status, high tumor CCR7 levels remained weakly associated with shorter PFS (HR = 2.52; 95% CI = 0.94–6.69, p < 0.06) and OS (HR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.81–6.21, p < 0.12). These findings indicate that CCR7 is a candidate molecular marker of poor prognosis in SCCHN and a co-variate of nodal metastasis, highlighting the importance of understanding CCR7 regulatory mechanisms. Given previous evidence that CCR7 is an NF-κB modulated gene (14Höpken U.E. Foss H.D. Meyer D. Hinz M. Leder K. Stein H. Lipp M.

Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and that aberrant activation of NF-κB is observed frequently in SCCHN tumors, we evaluated the relationship between NF-κB activation and CCR7 expression in our SCCHN patient cohort. Using semi-quantitative IHC analysis, we first compared the expression of NF-κB p65 between paired samples of tumor and adjacent mucosa (Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with previous reports of constitutive NF-κB activation in SCCHN, we observed significantly higher cytoplasmic NF-κB expression in the tumors as compared with adjacent mucosa (n = 13, p < 0.001). When correlated to CCR7 expression, we observed a significant correlation between NF-κB and CCR7 immunostaining (Fig. 1E) (r = 0.508, p < 0.001). These data confirm the constitutive activation of NF-κB in SCCHN. The observed positive correlation between NF-κB and CCR7 expression indicates that NF-κB might be a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of CCR7 expression. To determine whether NF-κB binding sites are encoded in the CCR7 promoter, we used promoter scanning techniques to analyze the 1000-bp upstream promoter region. At least four potential κB sites were identified by virtue of their homology to the κB consensus binding sequence motif, albeit with some deviation from the canonical motif (Fig. 2A). Of the four sites, two (κB1 and κB2) were previously identified (15Hinz M. Lemke P. Anagnostopoulos I. Hacker C. Krappmann D. Mathas S. Dörken B. Zenke M. Stein H. Scheidereit C. Nuclear factor κB-dependent gene expression profiling of Hodgkin's disease tumor cells, pathogenetic significance, and link to constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a activity.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) but not confirmed functionally, and two were novel (κB0 and κB3). Interestingly, we also identified a canonical AP1 transcription factor binding site (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TPE)) directly adjacent to the κB3 site (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the κB sites could bind to activated NF-κB in nuclear extracts, oligonucleotide probes were constructed encompassing each CCR7 κB site and the 10 flanking nucleotides on either side. Nuclear extracts were prepared from TNFα-stimulated cells, incubated with 32P radiolabeled κB sequence probes, and binding was analyzed by gel shift assay (Fig. 2B). The κB0, κB1, and κB2 probes bound nuclear proteins from the TNFα-stimulated cells. This"
https://openalex.org/W2143877664,"The β-class carbonic anhydrases (β-CAs) are widely distributed among lower eukaryotes, prokaryotes, archaea, and plants. Like all CAs, the β-enzymes catalyze an important physiological reaction, namely the interconversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. In plants the enzyme plays an important role in carbon fixation and metabolism. To further explore the structure-function relationship of β-CA, we have determined the crystal structures of the photoautotroph unicellular green alga Coccomyxa β-CA in complex with five different inhibitors: acetazolamide, thiocyanate, azide, iodide, and phosphate ions. The tetrameric Coccomyxa β-CA structure is similar to other β-CAs but it has a 15 amino acid extension in the C-terminal end, which stabilizes the tetramer by strengthening the interface. Four of the five inhibitors bind in a manner similar to what is found in complexes with α-type CAs. Iodide ions, however, make contact to the zinc ion via a zinc-bound water molecule or hydroxide ion — a type of binding mode not previously observed in any CA. Binding of inhibitors to Coccomyxa β-CA is mediated by side-chain movements of the conserved residue Tyr-88, extending the width of the active site cavity with 1.5-1.8 Å. Structural analysis and comparisons with other α- and β-class members suggest a catalytic mechanism in which the movements of Tyr-88 are important for the CO2-HCO3- interconversion, whereas a structurally conserved water molecule that bridges residues Tyr-88 and Gln-38, seems important for proton transfer, linking water molecules from the zinc-bound water to His-92 and buffer molecules."

Using a recently developed model of ocular tuberculosis following aerosol infection of guinea pigs with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we studied the microbiological, histological, and clinical features of intraocular tuberculosis infection. Viable tubercle bacilli were cultivated from all eyes by Day 56 after aerosol delivery of ∼200 bacilli to guinea pig lungs. Choroidal tuberculous granulomas showed reduced oxygen tension, as evidenced by staining with the hypoxia-specific probe pimonidazole, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors. Fundoscopic examination of M. tuberculosis-infected guinea pig eyes revealed altered vascular architecture and chorioretinal hemorrhage by Day 56 after infection. This model may be useful in further elucidating the pathogenesis of ocular tuberculosis, as well as in developing tools for diagnosis and assessment of antituberculosis treatment responses in the eye."

The gene transcription of IL-10 was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and promoter accessibility assay. The levels of IgA and IL-10 were significantly lower, whereas the levels of IL-23 were higher, in IBD specimens than in normal controls. The levels of IgA and IL-10 were negatively correlated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the IBD mucosa. The production of IL-10 by lamina propria mononuclear cells was lower in the IBD group than in the control group, and these levels could be enhanced by blocking IL-23. The gene transcription of IL-10 was significantly suppressed in CD4+ T cells of IBD mucosa; this phenomenon could be replicated in vitro by adding IL-23 in the culture of polarized Th2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1969576895,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity mediated, in part, by polymicrobial communities of bacteria. Recent molecular studies have confirmed the importance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in CRS. Here, we hypothesize that interaction between S. pneumoniae and NTHi mixed-species communities cause a change in bacterial virulence gene expression. We examined CRS as a model human disease to validate these polymicrobial interactions. Clinical strains of S. pneumoniae and NTHi were grown in mono- and co-culture in a standard biofilm assay. Reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RTqPCR) was used to measure gene expression of key virulence factors. To validate these results, we investigated the presence of the bacterial RNA transcripts in excised human tissue from patients with CRS. Consequences of physical or chemical interactions between microbes were also investigated. Transcription of NTHi type IV pili was only expressed in co-culture in vitro, and expression could be detected ex vivo in diseased tissue. S. pneumoniae pyruvate oxidase was up-regulated in co-culture, while pneumolysin and pneumococcal adherence factor A were down-regulated. These results were confirmed in excised human CRS tissue. Gene expression was differentially regulated by physical contact and secreted factors. Overall, these data suggest that interactions between H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae involve physical and chemical mechanisms that influence virulence gene expression of mixed-species biofilm communities present in chronically diseased human tissue. These results extend previous studies of population-level virulence and provide novel insight into the importance of S. pneumoniae and NTHi in CRS."
https://openalex.org/W2037574265,"The bone-degrading activity of osteoclasts depends on the formation of a cytoskeletal-adhesive super-structure known as the sealing zone (SZ). The SZ is a dynamic structure, consisting of a condensed array of podosomes, the elementary adhesion-mediating structures of osteoclasts, interconnected by F-actin filaments. The molecular composition and structure of the SZ were extensively investigated, yet despite its major importance for bone formation and remodelling, the mechanisms underlying its assembly and dynamics are still poorly understood. Here we determine the relations between matrix adhesiveness and the formation, stability and expansion of the SZ. By growing differentiated osteoclasts on micro-patterned glass substrates, where adhesive areas are separated by non-adhesive PLL-g-PEG barriers, we show that SZ growth and fusion strictly depend on the continuity of substrate adhesiveness, at the micrometer scale. We present a possible model for the role of mechanical forces in SZ formation and reorganization, inspired by the current data."
https://openalex.org/W1990158428,"Anopheles mosquitoes are important vectors of malaria and lymphatic filariasis (LF), which are major public health diseases in Nigeria. Malaria is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium and LF by the parasitic worm Wuchereria bancrofti. Updating our knowledge of the Anopheles species is vital in planning and implementing evidence based vector control programs. To present a comprehensive report on the spatial distribution and composition of these vectors, all published data available were collated into a database. Details recorded for each source were the locality, latitude/longitude, time/period of study, species, abundance, sampling/collection methods, morphological and molecular species identification methods, insecticide resistance status, including evidence of the kdr allele, and P. falciparum sporozoite rate and W. bancrofti microfilaria prevalence. This collation resulted in a total of 110 publications, encompassing 484,747 Anopheles mosquitoes in 632 spatially unique descriptions at 142 georeferenced locations being identified across Nigeria from 1900 to 2010. Overall, the highest number of vector species reported included An. gambiae complex (65.2%), An. funestus complex (17.3%), An. gambiae s.s. (6.5%). An. arabiensis (5.0%) and An. funestus s.s. (2.5%), with the molecular forms An. gambiae M and S identified at 120 locations. A variety of sampling/collection and species identification methods were used with an increase in molecular techniques in recent decades. Insecticide resistance to pyrethroids and organochlorines was found in the main Anopheles species across 45 locations. Presence of P. falciparum and W. bancrofti varied between species with the highest sporozoite rates found in An. gambiae s.s, An. funestus s.s. and An. moucheti, and the highest microfilaria prevalence in An. gambiae s.l., An. arabiensis, and An. gambiae s.s. This comprehensive geo-referenced database provides an essential baseline on Anopheles vectors and will be an important resource for malaria and LF vector control programmes in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2014946273,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has potent anti-inflammatory activity and recognized vascular protective effects. We have recently described the expression and vascular protective effects of an anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL-19), in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and injured arteries. The objective of this study was to link the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-19 with HO-1 expression in resident vascular cells. IL-19 induced HO-1 mRNA and protein in cultured human VSMC, as assayed by quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblot, and ELISA. IL-19 does not induce HO-1 mRNA or protein in human endothelial cells. IL-19 activates STAT3 in VSMC, and IL-19-induced HO-1 expression is significantly reduced by transfection of VSMC with STAT3 siRNA or mutation of the consensus STAT binding site in the HO-1 promoter. IL-19 treatment can significantly reduce ROS-induced apoptosis, as assayed by Annexin V flow cytometry. IL-19 significantly reduced ROS concentrations in cultured VSMC. The IL-19-induced reduction in ROS concentration is attenuated when HO-1 is reduced by siRNA, indicating that the IL-19-driven decrease in ROS is mediated by HO-1 expression. IL-19 reduces vascular ROS in vivo in mice treated with TNFα. This points to IL-19 as a potential therapeutic for vascular inflammatory diseases and a link for two previously unassociated protective processes: Th2 cytokine-induced anti-inflammation and ROS reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2027728493,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency of premature infants, but its etiology remains unclear. We have previously shown that mucin 2 (Muc2) positive goblet cells are significantly decreased in NEC. We have also shown that ileal bile acids (BAs) are significantly increased during the development of this disease. Because BAs can affect mucins, we hypothesized that elevated ileal BAs contribute to decreased Muc2 in experimental NEC. The role of Muc2 in NEC was evaluated in Winnie +/+ mice, a strain that produces aberrant Muc2. Muc2 and trefoil factor 3 (Tff3) were assessed in neonatal rats subjected to the NEC protocol when bile acids were removed, and in ileal explants from newborn and older rats cultured with and without BAs. Further, the role of active transport of BAs was determined using neonatal rats given the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) inhibitor SC-435 and in neonatal Asbt knockout mice subjected to the NEC protocol. Mice with aberrant Muc2 had significantly greater incidence and severity of NEC. Using both in vivo and ex vivo techniques, we determined that BAs decrease Muc2 positive cells in neonatal but not older ileum. However, Tff3 positive cells are not decreased by BAs. In addition, active transport of BAs is required for BAs to decrease Muc2 in immature ileum. These data show that functional Muc2 plays a critical role in the prevention of NEC and BAs can potentiate the decreased Muc2 in disease development. Further, BAs have a more profound effect on Muc2 in immature versus older ileum, which may explain at least in part why NEC occurs almost exclusively in premature infants."
https://openalex.org/W2157445487,"The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5 is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in mice, whereas less is known in humans. We hypothesised that its relevance for atherosclerosis should be reflected by associations between CCL5 gene variants, RANTES serum concentrations and protein levels in atherosclerotic plaques and risk for coronary events.We conducted a case-cohort study within the population-based MONICA/KORA Augsburg studies. Baseline RANTES serum levels were measured in 363 individuals with incident coronary events and 1,908 non-cases (mean follow-up: 10.2±4.8 years). Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, metabolic factors and lifestyle factors revealed no significant association between RANTES and incident coronary events (HR [95% CI] for increasing RANTES tertiles 1.0, 1.03 [0.75-1.42] and 1.11 [0.81-1.54]). None of six CCL5 single nucleotide polymorphisms and no common haplotype showed significant associations with coronary events. Also in the CARDIoGRAM study (>22,000 cases, >60,000 controls), none of these CCL5 SNPs was significantly associated with coronary artery disease. In the prospective Athero-Express biobank study, RANTES plaque levels were measured in 606 atherosclerotic lesions from patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. RANTES content in atherosclerotic plaques was positively associated with macrophage infiltration and inversely associated with plaque calcification. However, there was no significant association between RANTES content in plaques and risk for coronary events (mean follow-up 2.8±0.8 years).High RANTES plaque levels were associated with an unstable plaque phenotype. However, the absence of associations between (i) RANTES serum levels, (ii) CCL5 genotypes and (iii) RANTES content in carotid plaques and either coronary artery disease or incident coronary events in our cohorts suggests that RANTES may not be a novel coronary risk biomarker. However, the potential relevance of RANTES levels in platelet-poor plasma needs to be investigated in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036589988,"Cell-based high-throughput RNAi screening has become a powerful research tool in addressing a variety of biological questions. In RNAi screening, one of the most commonly applied assay system is measuring the fitness of cells that is usually quantified using fluorescence, luminescence and absorption-based readouts. These methods, typically implemented and scaled to large-scale screening format, however often only yield limited information on the cell fitness phenotype due to evaluation of a single and indirect physiological indicator. To address this problem, we have established a cell fitness multiplexing assay which combines a biochemical approach and two fluorescence-based assaying methods. We applied this assay in a large-scale RNAi screening experiment with siRNA pools targeting the human kinome in different modified HEK293 cell lines. Subsequent analysis of ranked fitness phenotypes assessed by the different assaying methods revealed average phenotype intersections of 50.7±2.3%-58.7±14.4% when two indicators were combined and 40-48% when a third indicator was taken into account. From these observations we conclude that combination of multiple fitness measures may decrease false-positive rates and increases confidence for hit selection. Our robust experimental and analytical method improves the classical approach in terms of time, data comprehensiveness and cost."
https://openalex.org/W2158310129,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are known to regulate transposon activity in germ cells of several animal models that propagate sexually. However, the role of piRNAs during asexual reproduction remains almost unknown. Aphids that can alternate sexual and asexual reproduction cycles in response to seasonal changes of photoperiod provide a unique opportunity to study piRNAs and the piRNA pathway in both reproductive modes. Taking advantage of the recently sequenced genome of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, we found an unusually large lineage-specific expansion of genes encoding the Piwi sub-clade of Argonaute proteins. In situ hybridisation showed differential expressions between the duplicated piwi copies: while Api-piwi2 and Api-piwi6 are ""specialised"" in germ cells their most closely related copy, respectively Api-piwi5 and Api-piwi3, are expressed in the somatic cells. The differential expression was also identified in duplicated ago3: Api-ago3a in germ cells and Api-ago3b in somatic cells. Moreover, analyses of expression profiles of the expanded piwi and ago3 genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that expressions varied according to the reproductive types. These specific expression patterns suggest that expanded aphid piwi and ago3 genes have distinct roles in asexual and sexual reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W1988621352,"Replacement of proinsulin C-peptide in type 1 diabetes ameliorates nerve and kidney dysfunction, conditions which are associated with a decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity. We determined the molecular mechanism by which long term exposure to C-peptide stimulates Na,K-ATPase expression and activity in primary human renal tubular cells (HRTC) in control and hyperglycemic conditions.HRTC were cultured from the outer cortex obtained from patients undergoing elective nephrectomy. Ouabain-sensitive rubidium ((86)Rb(+)) uptake and Na,K-ATPase activity were determined. Abundance of Na,K-ATPase was determined by Western blotting in intact cells or isolated basolateral membranes (BLM). DNA binding activity was determined by electrical mobility shift assay (EMSA). Culturing of HRTCs for 5 days with 1 nM, but not 10 nM of human C-peptide leads to increase in Na,K-ATPase α(1)-subunit protein expression, accompanied with increase in (86)Rb(+) uptake, both in normal- and hyperglycemic conditions. Na,K-ATPase α(1)-subunit expression and Na,K-ATPase activity were reduced in BLM isolated from cells cultured in presence of high glucose. Exposure to1 nM, but not 10 nM of C-peptide increased PKCε phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation and abundance of nuclear ERK1/2 regardless of glucose concentration. Exposure to 1 nM of C-peptide increased DNA binding activity of transcription factor ZEB (AREB6), concomitant with Na,K-ATPase α(1)-subunit mRNA expression. Effects of 1 nM C-peptide on Na,K-ATPase α(1)-subunit expression and/or ZEB DNA binding activity in HRTC were abolished by incubation with PKC or MEK1/2 inhibitors and ZEB siRNA silencing.Despite activation of ERK1/2 and PKC by hyperglycemia, a distinct pool of PKCs and ERK1/2 is involved in regulation of Na,K-ATPase expression and activity by C-peptide. Most likely C-peptide stimulates sodium pump expression via activation of ZEB, a transcription factor that has not been previously implicated in C-peptide-mediated signaling. Importantly, only physiological concentrations of C-peptide elicit this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2038051059,"Mosquitoes require blood for egg development, and, as a consequence, they transmit pathogens of devastating diseases. Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a key pathway linking blood feeding and egg development in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. We show that the regulation of the TOR effector translational repressor 4E-BP is finely tuned to the nutritional requirements of the female mosquito, and it occurs at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Immediately after blood feeding, 4E-BP became hyperphosphorylated, suggesting rapid inhibition of its translational repression function. 4E-BP was highly phosphorylated after in vitro incubation of the fat body in the presence of amino acids; this phosphorylation was rapamycin insensitive, in contrast to another TOR target, S6K, phosphorylation of which was rapamycin sensitive. A high level of 4E-BP phosphorylation was also elicited by insulin. Rapamycin and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked insulin-mediated 4E-BP phosphorylation. RNA-interference depletion of the insulin receptor or Akt resulted in severe reduction of 4E-BP phosphorylation. Phosphorylation and stability of 4E-BP was dependent on its partner eIF4E translation initiation factor. Silencing of 4E-BP resulted in reduction of the life span of adult female mosquitoes. This study demonstrates a dual nutritional and hormonal control of 4E-BP and its role in mosquito egg development."
https://openalex.org/W2112947428,"Pathogenic bacteria can resist their microenvironment by changing the expression of virulence genes. In Salmonella typhimurium, some of these genes are controlled by the two-component system PhoP-PhoQ. Studies have shown that activation of the system by cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) results, among other changes, in outer membrane remodeling. However, it is not fully clear what characteristics of AMPs are required to activate the PhoP-PhoQ system and whether activation can induce resistance to the various AMPs. For that purpose, we investigated the ability of a broad repertoire of AMPs to traverse the inner membrane, to activate the PhoP-PhoQ system, and to induce bacterial resistance. The AMPs differ in length, composition, and net positive charge, and the tested bacteria include two wild-type (WT) Salmonella strains and their corresponding PhoP-PhoQ knock-out mutants. A lacZ-reporting system was adapted to follow PhoP-PhoQ activation. The data revealed that: (i) a good correlation exists among the extent of the positive charge, hydrophobicity, and amphipathicity of an AMP and its potency to activate PhoP-PhoQ; (ii) a +1 charged peptide containing histidines was highly potent, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism independent of the peptide charge; (iii) the WT bacteria are more resistant to AMPs that are potent activators of PhoP-PhoQ; (iv) only a subset of AMPs, independent of their potency to activate the system, is more toxic to the mutated bacteria compared with the WT strains; and (v) short term exposure of WT bacteria to these AMPs does not enhance resistance. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which AMPs activate PhoP-PhoQ and induce bacterial resistance. It also reveals that some AMPs can overcome such a resistance mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2147995278,"Aberrant miR-21 expression is closely associated with cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration, invasion, and metastasis in various cancers. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-21 biogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressor PTEN negatively regulates the expression of oncogenic miR-21 at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, our results suggest that PTEN plays such a role through the indirect interaction with the Drosha complex. To elucidate how PTEN regulates pri- to pre-miR-21 processing, we attempted to find PTEN-interacting proteins and identified an RNA-regulatory protein, RNH1. Using the sensor to monitor pri-miR-21 processing, we demonstrated that RNH1 is necessary and sufficient for pri-miR-21 processing. Moreover, our results propose that the nuclear localization of RNH1 is important for this function. Further analysis showed that RNH1 directly interacts with the Drosha complex and that PTEN blocks this interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the PTEN-mediated miR-21 regulation is achieved by inhibiting the interaction between the Drosha complex and RNH1, revealing previously unidentified role of PTEN in the oncogenic miR-21 biogenesis."

This study assessed the effects of a stress management intervention on the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Seventy-four patients with RA, who were randomly assigned to either a control group or a group that received short-term stress management training, performed a standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) 1 week after the stress management training and at a 9-week follow-up. Psychological and physical functioning, and the acute psychophysiological response to the stress test were assessed.Patients in the intervention group showed significantly lower psychological distress levels of anxiety after the training than did the controls. While there were no between-group differences in stress-induced tension levels, and autonomic (α-amylase) or endocrine (cortisol) responses to the stress test 1 week after the intervention, levels of stress-induced tension and cortisol were significantly lower in the intervention group at the 9-week follow-up. Overall, the response to the intervention was particularly evident in a subgroup of patients with a psychological risk profile.A relatively short stress management intervention can improve psychological functioning and influences the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with RA, particularly those psychologically at risk. These findings might help understand how stress can affect health and the role of individual differences in stress responsiveness.TrialRegister.nl NTR1193."
https://openalex.org/W2112600921,"Much life science and biology research requires an understanding of complex relationships between biological entities (genes, compounds, pathways, diseases, and so on). There is a wealth of data on such relationships in publicly available datasets and publications, but these sources are overlapped and distributed so that finding pertinent relational data is increasingly difficult. Whilst most public datasets have associated tools for searching, there is a lack of searching methods that can cross data sources and that in particular search not only based on the biological entities themselves but also on the relationships between them. In this paper, we demonstrate how graph-theoretic algorithms for mining relational paths can be used together with a previous integrative data resource we developed called Chem2Bio2RDF to extract new biological insights about the relationships between such entities. In particular, we use these methods to investigate the genetic basis of side-effects of thiazolinedione drugs, and in particular make a hypothesis for the recently discovered cardiac side-effects of Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and a prediction for Pioglitazone which is backed up by recent clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2101759568,"Inhibition of unwanted response is an important function of the executive system. Since the inhibitory system is impaired in patients with dysregulated dopamine system, we examined dopamine neurotransmission in the human brain during processing of a task of executive inhibition. The experiment used a recently developed dynamic molecular imaging technique to detect and map dopamine released during performance of a modified Eriksen's flanker task. In this study, young healthy volunteers received an intravenous injection of a dopamine receptor ligand (11C-raclopride) after they were positioned in the PET camera. After the injection, volunteers performed the flanker task under Congruent and Incongruent conditions in a single scan session. They were required to inhibit competing options to select an appropriate response in the Incongruent but not in the Congruent condition. The PET data were dynamically acquired during the experiment and analyzed using two variants of the simplified reference region model. The analysis included estimation of a number of receptor kinetic parameters before and after initiation of the Incongruent condition. We found increase in the rate of ligand displacement (from receptor sites) and decrease in the ligand binding potential in the Incongruent condition, suggesting dopamine release during task performance. These changes were observed in small areas of the putamen and caudate bilaterally but were most significant on the dorsal aspect of the body of left caudate. The results provide evidence of dopaminergic processing of executive inhibition and demonstrate that neurochemical changes associated with cognitive processing can be detected and mapped in a single scan session using dynamic molecular imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2137969165,"Background Bro1 domains are elongated, banana-shaped domains that were first identified in the yeast ESCRT pathway protein, Bro1p. Humans express three Bro1 domain-containing proteins: ALIX, BROX, and HD-PTP, which function in association with the ESCRT pathway to help mediate intraluminal vesicle formation at multivesicular bodies, the abscission stage of cytokinesis, and/or enveloped virus budding. Human Bro1 domains share the ability to bind the CHMP4 subset of ESCRT-III proteins, associate with the HIV-1 NCGag protein, and stimulate the budding of viral Gag proteins. The curved Bro1 domain structure has also been proposed to mediate membrane bending. To date, crystal structures have only been available for the related Bro1 domains from the Bro1p and ALIX proteins, and structures of additional family members should therefore aid in the identification of key structural and functional elements. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the crystal structure of the human BROX protein, which comprises a single Bro1 domain. The Bro1 domains from BROX, Bro1p and ALIX adopt similar overall structures and share two common exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Surface 1 is located on the concave face and forms the CHMP4 binding site, whereas Surface 2 is located at the narrow end of the domain. The structures differ in that only ALIX has an extended loop that projects away from the convex face to expose the hydrophobic Phe105 side chain at its tip. Functional studies demonstrated that mutations in Surface 1, Surface 2, or Phe105 all impair the ability of ALIX to stimulate HIV-1 budding. Conclusions/Significance Our studies reveal similarities in the overall folds and hydrophobic protein interaction sites of different Bro1 domains, and show that a unique extended loop contributes to the ability of ALIX to function in HIV-1 budding."
https://openalex.org/W2150590969,"The Beijing strain is one of the most successful genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis worldwide and appears to be highly homogenous according to existing genotyping methods. To type Beijing strains reliably we developed a robust typing scheme using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and regions of difference (RDs) derived from whole-genome sequencing data of eight Beijing strains. SNP/RD typing of 259 M. tuberculosis isolates originating from 45 countries worldwide discriminated 27 clonal complexes within the Beijing genotype family. A total of 16 Beijing clonal complexes contained more than one isolate of known origin, of which two clonal complexes were strongly associated with South African origin. The remaining 14 clonal complexes encompassed isolates from different countries. Even highly resolved clonal complexes comprised isolates from distinct geographical sites. Our results suggest that Beijing strains spread globally on multiple occasions and that the tuberculosis epidemic caused by the Beijing genotype is at least partially driven by modern migration patterns. The SNPs and RDs presented in this study will facilitate future molecular epidemiological and phylogenetic studies on Beijing strains."
https://openalex.org/W2132805085,"The JAK/STAT pathway is essential for organogenesis, innate immunity, and stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster. The JAK/STAT pathway and its associated regulators have been highly conserved in evolution from flies to humans. We have used a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway, and here we report the characterization of Not4 as a positive regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. Overexpression of Not4 enhanced Stat92E-mediated gene responses in vitro and in vivo in Drosophila. Specifically, Not4 increased Stat92E-mediated reporter gene activation in S2 cells; and in flies, Not4 overexpression resulted in an 8-fold increase in Turandot M (TotM) and in a 4-fold increase in Turandot A (TotA) stress gene activation when compared to wild-type flies. Drosophila Not4 is structurally related to human CNOT4, which was found to regulate interferon-γ- and interleukin-4-induced STAT-mediated gene responses in human HeLa cells. Not4 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Stat92E but not to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat92E in Drosophila cells. However, Not4 is required for binding of Stat92E to its DNA recognition sequence in the TotM gene promoter. In summary, Not4/CNOT4 is a novel positive regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway in Drosophila and in humans.—Grönholm, J., Kaustio, M., Myllymäki, H., Kallio, J., Saarikettu, J., Kronhamn, J., Valanne, S., Silvennoinen, O., Rämet, M.

Although some target genes and interacting partners of STAT6 have been identified, its exact mechanism of action needs to be elucidated. In this study, we sought to further characterize the molecular interactions, networks, and functions of STAT6 by profiling the mRNA expression of STAT6 silenced human lung cells (NCI-H460) using microarrays. Our analysis revealed 273 differentially expressed genes after STAT6 silencing. Analysis of the gene expression data with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software revealed Gene expression, Cell death, Lipid metabolism as the functions associated with highest rated network. Cholesterol biosynthesis was among the most enriched pathways in IPA as well as in PANTHER analysis. These results have been validated by real-time PCR and cholesterol assay using scrambled siRNA as a negative control. Similar findings were also observed with human type II pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells, A549. In the present study we have, for the first time, shown the inverse relationship of STAT6 with the cholesterol biosynthesis in lung cancer cells. The present findings are potentially significant to advance the understanding and design of therapeutics for the pathological conditions where both STAT6 and cholesterol biosynthesis are implicated viz. asthma, atherosclerosis etc."
https://openalex.org/W2137304297,"The evolution of dark human skin colors in tropical areas is possibly related to photoprotection of folates. However, natural folates absorb mainly UVB radiation, and too little UVB can penetrate down to folates in dermal vessels to cause serious damage. However, endogenous photosensitizers, like riboflavin and uroporphyrin, absorbing UVA and visible light, can cause photosensitization of folates. Immediate pigment darkening (IPD), generated by UVA, has an absorption spectrum covering those of the endogenous photosensitizers. IPD is most prominent for darker skin types, which were typical for populations living under tropical solar fluences. We here propose that the biological role of IPD is protection of folates against photodegradation, which would be of large evolutionary importance for early hominids."
https://openalex.org/W2151530344,"Recent studies as well as theoretical models of error processing assign fundamental importance to the brain's dopaminergic system. Research about how the electrophysiological correlates of error processing—the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe)—are influenced by variations of common dopaminergic genes, however, is still relatively scarce. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether polymorphisms in the DAT1 gene and in the DRD4 gene, respectively, lead to interindividual differences in these error processing correlates. One hundred sixty participants completed a version of the Eriksen Flanker Task while a 26-channel EEG was recorded. The task was slightly modified in order to increase error rates. During data analysis, participants were split into two groups depending on their DAT1 and their DRD4 genotypes, respectively. ERN and Pe amplitudes after correct responses and after errors as well as difference amplitudes between errors and correct responses were analyzed. We found a differential effect of DAT1 genotype on the Pe difference amplitude but not on the ERN difference amplitude, while the reverse was true for DRD4 genotype. These findings are in line with predictions from theoretical models of dopaminergic transmission in the brain. They furthermore tie results from clinical investigations of disorders impacting on the dopamine system to genetic variations known to be at-risk genotypes."

Classically they are used as serum markers, however, CEACAMs could serve as targets for molecular imaging as well. In order to test the anti CEACAM monoclonal antibody T84.1 for imaging purposes, CEACAM expression was analysed using this antibody. Twelve human cancer cell lines from different entities were screened for their CEACAM expression using qPCR, Western Blot and FACS analysis. In addition, CEACAM expression was analyzed in primary tumour xenografts of these cells. Nine of 12 tumour cell lines expressed CEACAM mRNA and protein when grown in vitro. Pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines showed the highest expression levels with good correlation of mRNA and protein level. However, when grown in vivo, the CEACAM expression was generally downregulated except for the melanoma cell lines. As the CEACAM expression showed pronounced expression in FemX-1 primary tumours, this model system was used for further experiments. As the accessibility of the antibody after i.v. application is critical for its use in molecular imaging, the binding of the T84.1 monoclonal antibody was assessed after i.v. injection into SCID mice harbouring a FemX-1 primary tumour. When applied i.v., the CEACAM specific T84.1 antibody bound to tumour cells in the vicinity of blood vessels. This binding pattern was particularly pronounced in the periphery of the tumour xenograft, however, some antibody binding was also observed in the central areas of the tumour around blood vessels. Still, a general penetration of the tumour by i.v. application of the anti CEACAM antibody could not be achieved despite homogenous CEACAM expression of all melanoma cells when analysed in tissue sections. This lack of penetration is probably due to the increased interstitial fluid pressure in tumours caused by the absence of functional lymphatic vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2040747958,"Background Subjective functional outcomes measurements, such as vision health-related quality of life (VRQoL) and self-rated satisfaction measures can provide helpful multidimensional vision health information that is more comprehensive than traditional objective measures, such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The purpose of this study is to demonstrate 3-year longitudinal postoperative VRQoL and self-rated satisfaction changes after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective case series report was conducted in 92 RRD patients who underwent surgery during January 2004 through December 2006. Preoperative, 3-month, 1-year and 3-year postoperative patient VRQoL and self-rated satisfaction were assessed by face-to-face interviews. The importance of objective variables for predicting three dependent variables: CLVQOL composite scores change, 3-year postoperative CVLQOL composite score and self-rated satisfaction degree scores were calculated by stepwise multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis methods. Results The total CLVQOL composite scores change ranged between -48 and 90 (mean±standard deviation: 19.48±31.34), including positive changes in 62 patients. The self-rated satisfaction degree scores ultimately improved in 86 patients as compared with preoperative degrees. Statistically significant increases occurred only in the composite scores of subscale mobility and self-rated satisfaction degrees in the first 3 months, while the composite scores of the remaining subscales, and the total CLVQOL, BCVA in the RRD eye and weighted average BCVA, increased steadily throughout the first postoperative year. A better 3-year postoperative weighted average BCVA was associated with all of the 3 dependent outcome variables. Conclusions VRQoL of RRD patients improved substantially after surgery and they were satisfied with their postoperative vision. The BCVA, VRQoL and self-rated satisfactory degree scores recovered in different patterns, and supplemented each other in the RRD surgery outcomes evaluated. Surgeons are advised to pay closer attention to binocular vision in RRD patients, and make efforts to explain the results of surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2116732514,"Administration of erythropoietin (EPO) has been linked to cerebrovascular events. EPO reduces vascular conductance, possibly because of the increase in hematocrit. Whether EPO in itself affects the vasculature remains unknown; here it was evaluated in healthy males by determining systemic and cerebrovascular variables following acute (30,000 IU/d for 3 d; n=8) and chronic (5000 IU/week for 13 wk; n=8) administration of EPO, while the responsiveness of the vasculature was challenged during cycling exercise, with and without hypoxia. Prolonged administration of EPO increased hematocrit from 42.5 ± 3.7 to 47.6 ± 4.1% (P<0.01), whereas hematocrit was unaffected following acute EPO administration. Yet, the two EPO regimes increased arterial pressure similarly (by 8±4 and 7±3 mmHg, respectively; P=0.01) through reduced vascular conductance (by 7±3 and 5±2%; P<0.05). Also, both EPO regimes widened the arterial-to-jugular O(2) differences at rest as well as during normoxic and hypoxic exercise (P<0.01), which indicated reduced cerebral blood flow despite preserved dynamic cerebral autoregulation, and an increase in middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity (P<0.05), therefore, reflected vasoconstriction. Thus, administration of EPO to healthy humans lowers systemic and cerebral conductance independent of its effect on hematocrit."

Previous studies have shown that over-expression of this protein induces various cellular protrusions, such as neurites, filopodia, and dendritic spines. In this detailed characterization of M6a-induced structures, we found their varied and peculiar characteristics. Notably, the M6a-induced protrusions were mostly devoid of actin filaments or microtubules and exhibited free random vibrating motion. Moreover, when an antibody bound to M6a, the membrane-wrapped protrusions were suddenly disrupted, leading to perturbation of the surrounding membrane dynamics involving phosphoinositide signaling. During single-molecule analysis, M6a exhibited cytoskeleton-independent movement and became selectively entrapped along the cell perimeter in an actin-independent manner. These observations highlight the unusual characteristics of M6a, which may have a significant yet unappreciated role in biological systems."

Caenorhabditis elegans has widely accelerated the discovery of new genes important to maintain organismic metabolic homeostasis. Various methods exist to assess the metabolic state in worms, yet they often require large animal numbers and tend to be performed as bulk analyses of whole worm homogenates, thereby largely precluding a detailed studies of metabolic changes in specific worm tissues. Here, we have adapted well-established histochemical methods for the use on C. elegans fresh frozen sections and demonstrate their validity for analyses of morphological and metabolic changes on tissue level in wild type and various mutant strains. We show how the worm presents on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and demonstrate their usefulness in monitoring and the identification of morphological abnormalities. In addition, we demonstrate how Oil-Red-O staining on frozen worm cross-sections permits quantification of lipid storage, avoiding the artifact-prone fixation and permeabilization procedures of traditional whole-mount protocols. We also adjusted standard enzymatic stains for respiratory chain subunits (NADH, SDH, and COX) to monitor metabolic states of various C. elegans tissues. In summary, the protocols presented here provide technical guidance to obtain robust, reproducible and quantifiable tissue-specific data on worm morphology as well as carbohydrate, lipid and mitochondrial energy metabolism that cannot be obtained through traditional biochemical bulk analyses of worm homogenates. Furthermore, analysis of worm cross-sections overcomes the common problem with quantification in three-dimensional whole-mount specimens."
https://openalex.org/W1972005767,"Our understanding of the correlation of Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-mediated immune responses and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is still limited. We have recently characterized a Wistar rat model of experimental tuberculosis (TB). In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of BCG vaccination in this model. Upon Mtb challenge, BCG vaccinated rats controlled growth of the bacilli earlier than unvaccinated rats. Histopathology analysis of infected lungs demonstrated a reduced number of granulomatous lesions and lower parenchymal inflammation in vaccinated animals. Vaccine-mediated protection correlated with the rapid accumulation of antigen specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the infected lungs. Immunohistochemistry further revealed higher number of CD8(+) cells in the pulmonary granulomas of vaccinated animals. Evaluation of pulmonary immune responses in vaccinated and Mtb infected rats by real time PCR at day 15 post-challenge showed reduced expression of genes responsible for negative regulation of Th1 immune responses. Thus, early protection observed in BCG vaccinated rats correlated with a similarly timed shift of immunity towards the Th1 type response. Our data support the importance of (i) the Th1-Th2 balance in the control of mycobacterial infection and (ii) the value of the Wistar rats in understanding the biology of TB."
https://openalex.org/W2011336002,"The ratio between lengths of digit II and IV (digit ratio 2D:4D) is a morphological feature that likely affects tetrapod locomotor performances in different microhabitats. Modifications of this trait may be triggered by changes in steroids concentrations during embryo development, which might reflect direct selection acting on digit ratio or be solely a consequence of hormonal differences related for example to body size. Here we apply both conventional and phylogenetic analyses on morphological data from 25 lizard species of 3 families of Iguania (Iguanidae, Polychrotidae, and Tropiduridae), in order to verify whether selective pressures related to locomotion in different microhabitats could override the prenatal developmental cues imposed on the digit ratio 2D:4D by differences in body size between males and females. Data suggest that this trait evolved in association with ecological divergence in the species studied, despite the clear effect of body size on the digit ratio 2D:4D. The ecological associations of size-corrected digit ratios were restricted to one sex, and females of species that often use perches exhibited small digit ratios in the front limbs, which translated into larger sexual dimorphism indexes of arboreal species. The results, together with the subsequent discussion, provide outlines for further investigation about possible developmental mechanisms related to the evolution of adaptive changes in digit lengths that may have occurred during the evolution of ecological divergence in squamates."
https://openalex.org/W2056467711,"Purpose Age-related macular degeneration caused by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) remains difficult to be treated despite the recent advent of several treatment options. In this study, we investigated the in vivo angiogenic control by intravenous injection of polyion complex (PIC) micelle encapsulating plasmid DNA (pDNA) using a mice CNV model. Methods The transfection efficiency of the PIC micelle was investigated using the laser-induced CNV in eight-week-old male C57 BJ/6 mice. Firstly, each mouse received intravenous injection of micelle encapsulating pDNA of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (pYFP) on days 1,3 and 5. The expression of YFP was analyzed using fluorescein microscopy and western blotting analysis. In the next experiments, each mouse received intravenous injection of micelle encapsulating pDNA of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (psFlt-1) 1,3 and 5 days after the induction of CNV and the CNV lesion was analyzed by choroidal flatmounts on day 7. Results Fluorescein microscopy and western blotting analysis revealed that the expression of YFP was confirmed in the CNV area after injection of the PIC micelle, but the expression was not detected neither in mice that received naked pDNA nor those without CNV. Furthermore, the CNV area in the mice that received intravenous injection of the psFlt-1-encapsulated PIC micelle was significantly reduced by 65% compared to that in control mice (p<0.01). Conclusions Transfection of sFlt-1 with the PIC micelle by intravenous injection to mice CNV models showed significant inhibition of CNV. The current results revealed the significant potential of nonviral gene therapy for regulation of CNV using the PIC micelle encapsulating pDNA."

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of three alternative influenza vaccine dosing strategies intended to increase immunogenicity in those patients.A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine trial was conducted at 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites. Three dosing strategies with seasonal, inactivated trivalent, non-adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine were used in HIV infected adults: two standard doses over 28 days (Strategy A), two double doses over 28 days (Strategy B) and a single standard dose of influenza vaccine (Strategy C), administered prior to the 2008 influenza season. The comparator in our analysis was practice in the previous year, in which 82.8% of HIV/AIDS received standard-dose vaccination (Strategy D). A Markov cohort model was developed to estimate the monthly probability of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over one influenza season. Costs and quality-adjusted life years, extrapolated to the lifetime of the hypothetical study cohorts, were estimated in calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and EVPI in conducting further research.298 patients with median CD4 of 470 cells/µl and 76% with viral load suppression were randomized. Strategy C was the most cost-effective strategy for the overall trial population and for suppressed and unsuppressed individuals. Mean ICERs for Strategy A for unsuppressed patients could also be considered cost-effective. The level of uncertainty regarding the decision to implement strategy A versus C for unsuppressed individuals was high. The maximum acceptable cost of reducing decision uncertainty in implementing strategy A for individuals with unsuppressed pVL was $418,000--below the cost of conducting a larger-scale trial.Our results do not support a policy to implement increased antigen dose or booster dosing strategies with seasonal, inactivated trivalent, non-adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine for individuals with HIV in Canada.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00764998."
https://openalex.org/W2071013570,"Exposure of J774 mouse macrophages to stepwise increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic inhibiting bacterial topoisomerases, selects for resistant cells that overexpress the efflux transporter Abcc4 (Marquez et al. [2009] Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 53: 2410–2416), encoded by the Abcc4 gene located on Chromosome 14qE4. In this study, we report the genomic alterations occurring along the selection process. Abcc4 expression progressively increased upon selection rounds, with exponential changes observed between cells exposed to 150 and 200 µM of ciprofloxacin, accompanied by a commensurate decrease in ciprofloxacin accumulation. Molecular cytogenetics experiments showed that this overexpression is linked to Abcc4 gene overrepresentation, grading from a partial trisomy of Chr 14 at the first step of selection (cells exposed to 100 µM ciprofloxacin), to low-level amplifications (around three copies) of Abcc4 locus on 1 or 2 Chr 14 (cells exposed to 150 µM ciprofloxacin), followed by high-level amplification of Abcc4 as homogeneous staining region (hsr), inserted on 3 different derivative Chromosomes (cells exposed to 200 µM ciprofloxacin). In revertant cells obtained after more than 60 passages of culture without drug, the Abcc4 hsr amplification was lost in approx. 70% of the population. These data suggest that exposing cells to sufficient concentrations of an antibiotic with low affinity for eukaryotic topoisomerases can cause major genomic alterations that may lead to the overexpression of the transporter responsible for its efflux. Gene amplification appears therefore as a mechanism of resistance that can be triggered by non-anticancer agents but contribute to cross-resistance, and is partially and slowly reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1992377823,"Heat shock protein 22 is a member of small heat shock proteins with molecular chaperone activity. Though their multiple functions have been well characterized, there is no report about the association between the polymorphisms of HSP22 and heat tolerance.Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in HSP22 from scallop Chlamys farreri (CfHSP22), and the +94 C-A locus was found to be nonsynonymous. Three genotypes at locus +94, A/A, A/C and C/C, were revealed by using Bi-PASA PCR analysis, and their frequencies were 19.5%, 27.6% and 52.9% in the heat resistant stock, while 9.3%, 17.4% and 73.3% in the heat susceptible stock, respectively. The frequency differences of the three genotypes were significant (P<0.05) between the two stocks. After incubating at 30°C for 84 h, the cumulative mortality of scallops with +94 C/C genotype and +94 A/C genotypes was 95% and 90%, respectively, which was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of scallops with +94 A/A genotype (70%). The molecular chaperone activity of two His-tagged fusion proteins, rCfHSP22Q with +94 C/C genotype and rCfHSP22K with +94 A/A genotype were analyzed by testing the ability of protecting citrate synthase (CS) against thermal inactivation in vitro. After incubated with rCfHSP22Q or rCfHSP22K at 38°C for 1 h, the activity of CS lost 50% and 45%, and then recovered to 89% and 95% of the original activity following 1 h restoration at 22°C, respectively, indicating that the mutation from Gln to Lys at this site might have an impact on molecular chaperone activities of CfHSP22.These results implied that the polymorphism at locus +94 of CfHSP22 was associated with heat tolerance of scallop, and the +94 A/A genotype could be a potential marker available in future selection of Zhikong scallop with heat tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2042614910,"Hypoglycemia or glucoprivation triggers protective hormonal counterregulatory and feeding responses to aid the restoration of normoglycemia. Increasing evidence suggests pertinent roles for the brain in sensing glucoprivation and mediating counterregulation, however, the precise nature of the metabolic signals and molecular mediators linking central glucose sensing to effector functions are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that protective hormonal and feeding responses to hypoglycemia are regulated by BAD, a BCL-2 family protein with dual functions in apoptosis and metabolism. BAD-deficient mice display impaired glycemic and hormonal counterregulatory responses to systemic glucoprivation induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose. BAD is also required for proper counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia as evident from significantly higher glucose infusion rates and lower plasma epinephrine levels during hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamps. Importantly, RNA interference-mediated acute knockdown of Bad in the brain provided independent genetic evidence for its relevance in central glucose sensing and proper neurohumoral responses to glucoprivation. Moreover, BAD deficiency is associated with impaired glucoprivic feeding, suggesting that its role in adaptive responses to hypoglycemia extends beyond hormonal responses to regulation of feeding behavior. Together, these data indicate a previously unappreciated role for BAD in the control of central glucose sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2023819240,"Numerous studies have suggested that the deployment of attention is linked to saliency. In contrast, very little is known about how salient objects are perceived. To probe the perception of salient elements, observers compared two horizontally aligned stimuli in an array of eight elements. One of them was salient because of its orientation or direction of motion. We observed that the perceived luminance contrast or color saturation of the salient element increased: the salient stimulus looked even more salient. We explored the possibility that changes in appearance were caused by attention. We chose an event-related potential indexing attentional selection, the N2pc, to answer this question. The absence of an N2pc to the salient object provides preliminary evidence against involuntary attentional capture by the salient element. We suggest that signals from a master saliency map flow back into individual feature maps. These signals boost the perceived feature contrast of salient objects, even on perceptual dimensions different from the one that initially defined saliency."
https://openalex.org/W2049991606,"To assess the efficacy of the D-R model for defining trends in the appearance of Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli.Actual data related to the manifestation of Ceftazidime-resistant E. coli spanning years 1996-2009 were collected from the China National Knowledge Internet. These data originated from 430 publications encompassing 1004 citations of resistance. The GM(1,1) and the novel D-R models were used to fit current data and from this, predict trends in the appearance of the drug-resistant phenotype. The results were evaluated by Relative Standard Error (RSE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).Results from the D-R model showed a rapid increase in the appearance of Ceftazidime-resistant E. coli in this region of the world. These results were considered accurate based upon the minor values calculated for RSE, MAD and MAE, and were equivalent to or better than those generated by the GM(1,1) model.The D-R model which was originally created to define trends in the transmission of swine viral diseases can be adapted to evaluating trends in the appearance of Ceftazidime-resistant E. coli. Using only a limited amount of data to initiate the study, our predictions closely mirrored the changes in drug resistance rates which showed a steady increase through 2005, a decrease between 2005 and 2008, and a dramatic inflection point and abrupt increase beginning in 2008. This is consistent with a resistance profile where changes in drug intervention temporarily delayed the upward trend in the appearance of the resistant phenotype; however, resistance quickly resumed its upward momentum in 2008 and this change was better predicted using the D-R model. Additional work is needed to determine if this pattern of ""increase-control-increase"" is indicative of Ceftazidime-resistant E. coli or can be generally ascribed to bacteria acquiring resistance to drugs in the absence of alternative intervention."
