Fan et al. synthesized an ultraflat biphenylene carbon sheet consisting of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms forming four-, six-, and eight-membered rings on a gold surface. An adsorbed halogenated terphenyl molecule undergoes a two-step interpolymer dehydrofluorination polymerization that creates the four- and eight-membered rings through carbon–carbon bond formation.

https://openalex.org/W3162800482,"Genome-wide association analysis of cohorts with thousands of phenotypes is computationally expensive, particularly when accounting for sample relatedness or population structure. Here we present a novel machine-learning method called REGENIE for fitting a whole-genome regression model for quantitative and binary phenotypes that is substantially faster than alternatives in multi-trait analyses while maintaining statistical efficiency. The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test for unbalanced case-control phenotypes. The method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of this approach using the UK Biobank dataset with up to 407,746 individuals."

RBS residues Glu484, Lys417, and Asn501 are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding, as well as the effects of two of these mutations (K417N and E484K) on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternative binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3160747020,"Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing."

However, vision provides limited feedback because information about grasping objects is best relayed through tactile feedback. We supplemented vision with tactile percepts evoked using a bidirectional brain-computer interface that records neural activity from the motor cortex and generates tactile sensations through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex. This enabled a person with tetraplegia to substantially improve performance with a robotic limb; trial times on a clinical upper-limb assessment were reduced by half, from a median time of 20.9 to 10.2 seconds. Faster times were primarily due to less time spent attempting to grasp objects, revealing that mimicking known biological control principles results in task performance that is closer to able-bodied human abilities."

Yang et al. reinvestigated a photoinduced alkane oxidation reaction for which a trapping study had previously implicated alkoxy radicals. Their spectroscopic, kinetic, and isotopic labeling studies revealed that chlorine, rather than alkoxy, was the key radical intermediate; the prior trapping results had stemmed from its complexation with alcohols.

Feng et al. used “molecular engineering” to modify an inexpensive precursor (9-fluorenone) as the basis for an organic-based redox flow battery (see the Perspective by Hu and Liu). The authors tested a series of variant molecules in a redox flow battery in which the reactions involve reversible ketone hydrogenation and dehydrogenation in an aqueous electrolyte. These reactions have advantageous features, including two-electron redox and operation in air and at elevated temperatures (50°C), that are more suitable for real-world applications.

The authors show that the rates of change accelerated markedly during the Late Holocene (∼4.6 to 2.9 thousand years ago), even more rapidly than the climate-driven vegetation changes associated with the end of the last glacial period. In addition, the Late Holocene acceleration began for terrestrial communities as a whole, suggesting that the acceleration in turnover over the past two centuries is the tip of a deeper trend.

https://openalex.org/W3160603270,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are prevalent liver conditions that underlie the development of life-threatening cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic necro-inflammation is a critical factor in development of NASH, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disease are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we comprehensively profiled the immune composition of the mouse liver during NASH. We identified a significant pathology-associated increase in hepatic conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and further defined their source as NASH-induced boost in cycling of cDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Analysis of blood and liver from patients on the NAFLD/NASH spectrum showed that type 1 cDCs (cDC1) were more abundant and activated in disease. Sequencing of physically interacting cDC-T cell pairs from liver-draining lymph nodes revealed that cDCs in NASH promote inflammatory T cell reprogramming, previously associated with NASH worsening. Finally, depletion of cDC1 in XCR1DTA mice or using anti-XCL1-blocking antibody attenuated liver pathology in NASH mouse models. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of cDC biology in NASH and identifies XCR1+ cDC1 as an important driver of liver pathology."

For this, we need additional mechanisms that bridge time and space. In rodents, hippocampal replay is hypothesized to promote this function. Liu et al. measured high-temporal-resolution brain signals using human magnetoencephalography combined with a new model-based, visually oriented, multipath reinforcement memory task. This task was designed to differentiate local versus nonlocal learning episodes within the subject. They found that reverse sequential replay in the human medial temporal lobe supports nonlocal reinforcement learning and is the underlying mechanism for solving complex credit assignment problems such as value learning.

https://openalex.org/W3160334326,"Boron functional groups are often introduced in place of aromatic carbon-hydrogen bonds to expedite small-molecule diversification through coupling of molecular fragments1-3. Current approaches based on transition-metal-catalysed activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds are effective for the borylation of many (hetero)aromatic derivatives4,5 but show narrow applicability to azines (nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles), which are key components of many pharmaceutical and agrochemical products6. Here we report an azine borylation strategy using stable and inexpensive amine-borane7 reagents. Photocatalysis converts these low-molecular-weight materials into highly reactive boryl radicals8 that undergo efficient addition to azine building blocks. This reactivity provides a mechanistically alternative tactic for sp2 carbon-boron bond assembly, where the elementary steps of transition-metal-mediated carbon-hydrogen bond activation and reductive elimination from azine-organometallic intermediates are replaced by a direct, Minisci9-style, radical addition. The strongly nucleophilic character of the amine-boryl radicals enables predictable and site-selective carbon-boron bond formation by targeting the azine's most activated position, including the challenging sites adjacent to the basic nitrogen atom. This approach enables access to aromatic sites that elude current strategies based on carbon-hydrogen bond activation, and has led to borylated materials that would otherwise be difficult to prepare. We have applied this process to the introduction of amine-borane functionalities to complex and industrially relevant products. The diversification of the borylated azine products by mainstream cross-coupling technologies establishes aromatic amino-boranes as a powerful class of building blocks for chemical synthesis."

Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. One of these mAbs, BG10-19, locks the spike trimer in a closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the recently arising mutants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together, our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and therapeutic design against coronaviruses."

However, it remains poorly understood as to how these variants influence gene regulation. To model the functional impact of common genetic variation on the noncoding genome during human cortical development, we performed the assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and analyzed chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (QTL) in cultured human neural progenitor cells and their differentiated neuronal progeny from 87 donors. We identified significant genetic effects on 988/1,839 neuron/progenitor regulatory elements, with highly cell-type and temporally specific effects. A subset (roughly 30%) of chromatin accessibility-QTL were also associated with changes in gene expression. Motif-disrupting alleles of transcriptional activators generally led to decreases in chromatin accessibility, whereas motif-disrupting alleles of repressors led to increases in chromatin accessibility. By integrating cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility-QTL and brain-relevant genome-wide association data, we were able to fine-map and identify regulatory mechanisms underlying noncoding neuropsychiatric disorder risk loci. Cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility QTL during neurogenesis allow fine mapping of causal variants and more complete underlying of regulatory mechanisms underlying noncoding loci associated with gene expression and neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3162809124,"Fear and trauma generate some of the longest-lived memories. Despite the corresponding need to understand how such memories can be attenuated, the underlying brain circuits remain unknown. Here, combining viral tracing, neuronal activity mapping, fiber photometry, chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic manipulations in mice, we show that the extinction of remote (30-day-old) fear memories depends on thalamic nucleus reuniens (NRe) inputs to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found that remote, but not recent (1-day-old), fear extinction activates NRe-to-BLA inputs, which become potentiated upon fear reduction. Furthermore, both monosynaptic NRe-to-BLA and total NRe activity increase shortly before freezing cessation, suggesting that the NRe registers and transmits safety signals to the BLA. Accordingly, pan-NRe and pathway-specific NRe-to-BLA inhibition impairs, whereas their activation facilitates, remote fear extinction. These findings identify the NRe as a crucial BLA regulator for extinction and provide the first functional description of the circuits underlying the attenuation of consolidated fear memories. Silva et al. reveal distinct circuits for the extinction of remote fear memories, with the thalamic nucleus reuniens and its outputs to the basolateral amygdala taking center stage."

Here, we identified two satiety signals that inhibit DH44 neurons: (1) Piezo-mediated stomach/crop stretch after food ingestion and (2) Neuromedin/Hugin neurosecretory neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) activated by an increase in the internal glucose level. A subset of Piezo+ neurons that express DH44 neuropeptide project to the crop. We found that DH44 neuronal activity and food intake were stimulated following a knockdown of piezo in DH44 neurons or silencing of Hugin neurons in the VNC, even in fed flies. Together, we propose that these two qualitatively distinct peripheral signals work in concert to regulate the DH44 nutrient sensor during the fed state."

https://openalex.org/W3160503265,"The ability to adapt to changes in stimulus statistics is a hallmark of sensory systems. Here, we developed a theoretical framework that can account for the dynamics of adaptation from an information processing perspective. We use this framework to optimize and analyze adaptive sensory codes, and we show that codes optimized for stationary environments can suffer from prolonged periods of poor performance when the environment changes. To mitigate the adversarial effects of these environmental changes, sensory systems must navigate tradeoffs between the ability to accurately encode incoming stimuli and the ability to rapidly detect and adapt to changes in the distribution of these stimuli. We derive families of codes that balance these objectives, and we demonstrate their close match to experimentally observed neural dynamics during mean and variance adaptation. Our results provide a unifying perspective on adaptation across a range of sensory systems, environments, and sensory tasks."

While many studies have examined the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) as the primary mechanism behind these relationships, emerging research on the brain-gut axis suggests that the microbiome may play a role. In this study, we tested the relationships among maternal precarity and HPA axis dysregulation during the peripartum period, infant gut microbiome composition, and infant HPA axis functioning.Data come from 25 mother-infant dyads in the Galápagos, Ecuador. Women completed surveys on precarity measures (food insecurity, low social support, depression, and stress) and gave salivary cortisol samples during and after pregnancy. Infant salivary cortisol and stool were collected in the postpartum. Statistical significance of differences in microbial diversity and relative abundance were assessed with respect to adjusted linear regression models.Maternal precarity was associated with lower diversity and higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae and a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. These patterns of colonization for Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium mirrored those found in infants with HPA axis dysregulation. Maternal HPA axis dysregulation during pregnancy was also associated with a greater relative abundance of Veillonella.Overall, exposures to precarity and HPA axis dysregulation were associated with an increase in groups that include potentially pathogenic bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonella, and a decrease in potentially protective bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae, as well as a decrease in overall diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3160488916,"Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid in the human body controlling blood pressure and salt homeostasis. Overproduction of aldosterone leads to primary aldosteronism, which is the most common form of secondary hypertension with limited treatment options. Production of aldosterone by cytochrome P450 11B2 (CYP11B2, aldosterone synthase) requires two reduction events with the electrons delivered by the iron/sulfur protein adrenodoxin. Very limited information is available about the structural and functional basis of adrenodoxin/CYP11B2 interaction, which impedes the development of new treatment options for primary aldosteronism. A systematic study was carried out to determine if adrenodoxin interaction with CYP11B2 might also have an allosteric component in addition to electron transfer. Indeed, local increases in adrenodoxin concentration promote binding of the substrate 11-deoxycorticosterone and the inhibitor osilodrostat (LCI699) in the active site—over 17 A away—as well as enhance the inhibitory effect of this latter drug. The CYP11B2 structure in complex with adrenodoxin identified specific residues at the protein–protein interface interacting via five salt bridges and four hydrogen bonds. Comparisons with cholesterol-metabolizing CYP11A1 and cortisol-producing CYP11B1, which also bind adrenodoxin, revealed substantial structural differences in these regions. The structural and functional differences between different P450 interactions with adrenodoxin may provide valuable clues for an orthogonal treatment approach for primary aldosteronism by specifically targeting the interaction between CYP11B2 and adrenodoxin."

This study is a descriptive epidemiological analysis of Australian coastal suicide deaths. The results will be used to inform training and support surf lifesaving personnel and suicide prevention organisations. This is a population-based cross-sectional study of suicide deaths at Australian coastal locations (between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2019). Data were sourced from the National Coronial Information System and SLS Australia's Incident Report Database. Analyses explored decedent, incident, and risk factors by sex and method. Across the study period, there were 666 coastal suicide deaths (71.0% male, 43.4% jumping from high places [X80]). Males were more likely to suicide by other means (hanging, self-poisoning, firearm discharge; n = 145, 83.8%), compared to females who were more likely to suicide by drowning ([X71]; n = 77, 37.7%). In one third (n = 225, 38.3%) toxicology was a contributing factor. The risk of coastal suicides was 10.3 times higher during the seven-days prior to their birthday (p<0.001). Evidence of mental ill health was reported in 61.4% (n = 409) of cases and evidence of suicidal behaviour was reported for 37.4% of decedents (n = 249), more prevalent in females. SLS responded in 10.7% (n = 71) of coastal suicides (most jumps from high places; n = 36, 50.7%). Coastal suicides differ to national trends suggesting that location-based differences should be considered during development of preventative and protective measures, especially at a community level. Accessibility, availability, perceived lethality and symbolic qualities are proposed to influence suicide location decisions.

https://openalex.org/W3161123663,"Attalea palms provide primary habitat to Rhodnius spp., vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. Flying from palms, these blood-sucking bugs often invade houses and can infect people directly or via food contamination. Chagas disease (CD) risk may therefore increase when Attalea palms thrive near houses. For example, Attalea dominate many deforested landscapes of eastern Amazonia, where acute-CD outbreaks are disturbingly frequent. Despite this possible link between deforestation and CD risk, the population-level responses of Amazonian Attalea and their resident Rhodnius to anthropogenic landscape disturbance remain largely uncharted. We studied adult Attalea palms in old-growth forest (OGF), young secondary forest (YSF), and cattle pasture (CP) in two localities of eastern Amazonia. We recorded 1856 Attalea along 10 transects (153.6 ha), and detected infestation by Rhodnius spp. in 18 of 280 systematically-sampled palms (33 bugs caught). Distance-sampling models suggest that, relative to OGF, adult Attalea density declined by 70-80% in CP and then recovered in YSF. Site-occupancy models estimate a strong positive effect of deforestation on palm-infestation odds (βCP-infestation = 4.82±1.14 SE), with a moderate decline in recovering YSF (βYSF-infestation = 2.66±1.10 SE). Similarly, N-mixture models suggest that, relative to OGF, mean vector density sharply increased in CP palms (βCP-density = 3.20±0.62 SE) and then tapered in YSF (βYSF-density = 1.61±0.76 SE). Together, these results indicate that disturbed landscapes may support between ~2.5 (YSF) and ~5.1 (CP) times more Attalea-dwelling Rhodnius spp. per unit area than OGF. We provide evidence that deforestation may favor palm-dwelling CD vectors in eastern Amazonia. Importantly, our landscape-disturbance effect estimates explicitly take account of (i) imperfect palm and bug detection and (ii) the uncertainties about infestation and vector density arising from sparse bug data. These results suggest that incorporating landscape-disturbance metrics into the spatial stratification of transmission risk could help enhance CD surveillance and prevention in Amazonia."

Although some clinicopathological parameters can be prognostic factors for iCCA, the molecular prognostic markers and potential mechanisms of iCCA have not been well investigated. Here, we report that the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a RNA binding protein functionally absent in patients with the Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and also involved in several types of cancers, is overexpressed in human iCCA and its expression is significantly increased in iCCA metastatic tissues. The silencing of FMRP in metastatic iCCA cell lines affects cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role of FMRP in iCCA progression. Moreover, we show evidence that FMRP is localized at the invasive front of human iCCA neoplastic nests and in pseudopodia and invadopodia protrusions of migrating and invading iCCA cancer cells. Here FMRP binds several mRNAs encoding key proteins involved in the formation and/or function of these protrusions. In particular, we find that FMRP binds to and regulates the expression of Cortactin, a critical regulator of invadopodia formation. Altogether, our findings suggest that FMRP could promote cell invasiveness modulating membrane plasticity and invadopodia formation at the leading edges of invading iCCA cells."

The primary outcome measure was cure rate, and secondary outcome included need for additional antibiotics, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, exacerbation rates and exacerbation free interval (EFI) within one-year follow-up.In intention to treat (ITT) analysis, cure rate was 76.1% (n = 118) and 79.3% (n = 123) respectively in 2-day and CRP-guided groups.

https://openalex.org/W3162148391,"The glycoprotein α-dystroglycan helps to link the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. A unique glycan structure attached to this protein is required for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. Up to now, this is the only mammalian glycan known to contain ribitol phosphate groups. Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus use CDP-ribitol to incorporate ribitol phosphate into the glycan chain of α-dystroglycan. Since CDP-ribitol is synthesized in the cytoplasm, we hypothesized that an unknown transporter must be required for its import into the Golgi apparatus. We discovered that CDP-ribitol transport relies on the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and the transporter SLC35A4 in a redundant manner. These two transporters are closely related, but bulky residues in the predicted binding pocket of SLC35A4 limit its size. We hypothesized that the large binding pocket SLC35A1 might accommodate the bulky CMP-sialic acid and the smaller CDP-ribitol, whereas SLC35A4 might only accept CDP-ribitol. To test this, we expressed SLC35A1 with mutations in its binding pocket in SLC35A1 KO cell lines. When we restricted the binding site of SLC35A1 by introducing the bulky residues present in SLC35A4, the mutant transporter was unable to support sialylation of proteins in cells but still supported ribitol phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the size of the binding pocket determines the substrate specificity of SLC35A1, allowing a variety of cytosine nucleotide conjugates to be transported. The redundancy with SLC35A4 also explains why patients with SLC35A1 mutations do not show symptoms of α-dystroglycan deficiency."

The intervention consisted of home visits by specifically trained registered nurses who assessed participants' health, discussed their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan in collaboration with participants' GPs and adjunct clinical pharmacist. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview data. The feasibility cRCT involved eight general practitioner (GP) practices as cluster sites, stratified by jurisdiction, four in Northern Ireland (NI) (two intervention, two control), and four in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (two intervention, two control). Participants were assessed for risk of functional decline. A total of 34 patients received the intervention and 31 received usual care.Thematic analysis resulted in five main themes: timing of intervention, understanding of ACP, personality & individual differences, loneliness & social isolation, and views on healthcare provision. These map across the Four Factor Model of Acceptability ('4FMA'), a newly developed conceptual framework comprising four components: intervention factors, personal factors, social support factors, and healthcare provision factors.Acceptability of this primary care based ACP intervention was high, with nurses' home visits, GP anchorage, multidisciplinary working, personalized approach, and active listening regarded as beneficial. Appropriate timing, and patient health education emerged as vital."

Methods 166 eyes from 166 participants were imaged using CASIA2 anterior chamber optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and LenStar LS 900 optical biometer. The horizontal ATA and STS were measured using the swept-source Fourier-domain AS-OCT (CASIA2). The horizontal WTW was automatically measured using LenStar. The displacement lengths (DL) between WTW-STS and WTW-ATA were calculated. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation were performed. Results The study showed that WTW has a positive correlation with STS (ICC = 0.82, p&lt;0.001) and ATA (ICC = 0.82, p&lt;0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the mean difference of WTW-STS is 0.10 mm (95% CI 0.06 to 0.14 mm) with limits of agreement of -0.42 to 0.63 mm between WTW and STS, and the mean difference of WTW-ATA is 0.10 mm (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15 mm) with limits of agreement of -0.48 to 0.64 mm between WTW and ATA. Linear regression with adjustment showed that a WTW value greater than 12.07 mm is associated with a greater DL (WTW-STS DL ß 0.18, p = 0.003; WTW-ATA DL ß 0.14, p = 0.03). Conclusions Greater WTW was significantly associated with higher displacement of WTW from the two distances representing anterior chamber width. External limbal location may not accurately represent the actual angle location in eyes with larger WTW."

Psychostimulants, methamphetamine and cocaine, have been reported to induce the formation of DAT multimeric complexes in vivo and in vitro. The interpretation of DAT multimer function has been primarily in the context of compounds that induce structural and functional modifications of the DAT, complicating the understanding of the significance of DAT multimers. To examine multimerization in the absence of DAT ligands as well as in their presence, we developed a novel, optogenetic fusion chimera of cryptochrome 2 and DAT with an mCherry fluorescent reporter (Cry2–DAT). Using blue light to induce Cry2–DAT multimeric protein complex formation, we were able to simultaneously test the functional contributions of DAT multimerization in the absence or presence of substrates or inhibitors with high spatiotemporal precision. We found that blue light–stimulated Cry2–DAT multimers significantly increased IDT307 uptake and MFZ 9-18 binding in the absence of ligands as well as after methamphetamine and nomifensine treatment. Blue light–induced Cry2–DAT multimerization increased colocalization with recycling endosomal marker Rab11 and had decreased presence in Rab5-positive early endosomes and Rab7-positive late endosomes. Our data suggest that the increased uptake and binding results from induced and rapid trafficking of DAT multimers to the plasma membrane.

METH and AIM-100, an Ack1 inhibitor, have been shown to induce higher order DAT multimers, and both compounds increase DAT trafficking away from the PM, decreasing DAT uptake function (13Chang J.C.

If photostimulation is not maintained, the induced multimers naturally revert to the preactivated state, providing a tightly controlled reversible model to probe cellular functions (29Taslimi A.

We created an optogenetic fusion chimera of cryptochrome 2 and DAT with an mCherry (mCh) fluorescent reporter (referred to as Cry2–DAT), to finely control DAT multimeric protein complex formation to test the functional importance of DAT multimerization in both the absence and presence of ligands for the DAT. This model provided a means to test functional contributions of DAT multimerization in the absence of chemical modulation or structural manipulation, while preserving spatiotemporal dynamics (31Mühlhäuser W.W.D. Fischer A. Weber W. Radziwill G. Optogenetics - Bringing light into the darkness of mammalian signal transduction.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2017; 1864: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found that when stimulated with blue light alone, Cry2–DAT rapidly multimerized and induced a significant and robust increase in IDT307 uptake and MFZ 9 to 18 binding. Furthermore, decreases in uptake and binding due to pretreatment with METH or nomifensine (NOM) were recovered when Cry2–DAT multimerization was stimulated by blue light. Our data suggest that the robust increases in uptake and binding after stimulating DAT multimerization are due to upregulation of DAT trafficking through endocytic recycling pathways. We propose that DAT multimers are not formed as a direct result of binding ligands, nor induce downregulation at the PM, but that DAT multimerization induces rapid trafficking of the naïve DAT to the PM to facilitate DA uptake. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use an optogenetic approach to directly test the consequences of DAT multimerization in the absence of compounds that bind to DAT. To construct Cry2–DAT, the DAT coding sequence was inserted into the Cry2–mCh vector to express Cry2–mCh at the N terminus of the DAT (Fig. 1A) in the same manner as YFP–DAT and FLAG DAT because these DAT chimeras with N-terminal YFP and FLAG tags resulted in normal DAT function (9Sorkina T.

Next, we expressed Cry2–DAT or Cry2–mCh empty vector in HEK293 cells to test the localization of these constructs in the cell. Cry2–DAT was expressed at the PM, while Cry2–mCh expression was cytoplasmic (Fig. 1B). Coexpression of Cry2–DAT and YFP–DAT showed strong colocalization (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.87), particularly at the PM (Fig. 1C). To ensure the Cry2–DAT construct encoded a DAT protein with normal function, the uptake activities of FLAG–DAT and Cry2–DAT were tested. Cry2–DAT–expressing cells had uptake activity comparable with FLAG–DAT–expressing cells, and cells expressing the DAT construct had significantly more uptake than cells expressing the vector alone (Fig. 1D). These data show that Cry2–DAT has expression and function comparable with YFP–DAT and FLAG–DAT. A baseline time course for YFP–DAT multimer formation was established for the DAT substrates, DA and METH, using the cross-linking agent copper phenanthroline and membrane enrichment to detect DAT multimer formation (15Hastrup H. Sen N. Javitch J.A. The human dopamine transporter forms a tetramer in the plasma membrane: Cross-linking of a cysteine in the fourth transmembrane segment is sensitive to cocaine analogs.J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2018; 144: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). DAT dimers were detected under control conditions, as previously reported (14Daws L.C. Callaghan P.D. Morón J.A. Kahlig K.M. Shippenberg T.S. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Cocaine increases dopamine uptake and cell surface expression of dopamine transporters.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1545-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DA treatment induced a DAT multimer banding pattern corresponding to a tetramer after 30 s of treatment; after 2 min, the DAT tetramers dissipated to dimers (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment with METH induced DAT trimers at 2 min, and this multimer pattern was maintained up to 60 min (Fig. 2B). Using biotinylation to detect cell surface Cry2–DAT (~130 kDa), monomer and dimer bands were detected for control conditions. Using blue light to stimulate Cry2–DAT multimers, we detected DAT multimer expression at the cell surface. Although the resolution of the higher order Cry2–DAT multimer pattern could not be accurately determined using biotinylation to isolate cell surface DAT, the multimers are in a MW range corresponding to higher order Cry2–DAT multimeric complexes (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data establish that in control conditions, YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT form dimers and that blue light stimulation of Cry2–DAT allows for the detection of higher order complexes without the addition of DA or METH. Previous studies have shown that functional optogenetic complexes can kinetically trap nonoptogenetic binding partners of the complex upon blue light stimulation, which can be detected by using FRET and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (29Taslimi A. Vrana J.D. Chen D. Borinskaya S. Mayer B.J. Kennedy M.J. Tucker C.L. An optimized optogenetic clustering tool for probing protein interaction and function.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We tested if blue light–stimulated Cry2–DAT could kinetically trap YFP–DAT into multimer complexes using FRAP to evaluate codiffusion and FRET to assess proximity of the two DAT constructs (Fig. 3A). Two nonoptogenetic proteins, CFP–DAT and YFP–DAT, were used as a comparison for DAT multimerization, as previously reported (9Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A.

The FRET efficiencies for CFP–DAT and YFP–DAT treated with the vehicle or 10 μM METH were similar to previously published data (36Butler B. Saha K. Rana T. Becker J.P. Sambo D. Davari P. Goodwin J.S. Khoshbouei H. Dopamine transporter activity is modulated by α-synuclein.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 29542-29554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B and S1A). YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT FRET efficiencies increased with 10 μM METH treatment and with blue light stimulation to induce Cry2–DAT multimerization. These data were similar to the FRET efficiencies of CFP–DAT and YFP–DAT with METH treatment. There were no statistical differences for the FRET efficiencies of YFP–DAT and CFP–DAT treated with METH compared with the FRET efficiencies of YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT with METH treatment or blue light stimulation. The FRET efficiencies of YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT in samples pretreated with METH and subsequent blue light stimulation increased robustly compared with METH or blue light stimulation alone (Fig. 3B). Live-cell FRAP was performed to test the ability of Cry2–DAT to kinetically trap YFP–DAT into blue light–induced multimers. The diffusion coefficient (D) of YFP–DAT decreased (Fig. 3C and S1B) and the mobile fraction (Mf) (Fig. 3D and S1C) increased significantly upon blue light stimulation in cells coexpressing YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT compared with cells expressing YFP–DAT alone. The D and Mf for YFP–DAT in the presence of 10 μM METH in coexpressing YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT cells also decreased significantly compared with control. METH and subsequent blue light stimulation of cells coexpressing YFP–DAT and Cry2–DAT resulted in a significant reduction in D for YFP–DAT compared with controls and to METH treatment alone, although Mf was unchanged (Fig. 3D). The FRET and FRAP data establish that YFP–DAT is kinetically trapped into Cry2–DAT multimers induced by blue light. The incorporation of the nonoptogenetic YFP–DAT into Cry2–DAT light-induced multimers implies that the photosensitive portion of Cry2–DAT is a means to induce DAT oligomerization. Prior studies have shown that agents known to induce multimerization of DAT, such as METH and COC, reduce the uptake of DA (3Fleckenstein A.E. Metzger R.R. Wilkins D.G. Gibb J.W. Hanson G.R.

We tested the effects of METH, a DAT substrate, and NOM, a DAT blocker, to evaluate how blue light–induced multimerization may affect the uptake of IDT307 or [3H]-DA and MFZ 9-18 binding in FLAG–DAT– and Cry2–DAT–expressing cells (Fig. 4). For experiments testing the effects of METH or NOM, we pretreated for 2 min because this timepoint will avoid significant downregulation of DAT induced by METH (41Cervinski M.A. Foster J.D.

To measure DAT uptake, we used [3H]-DA as done in the study by Hong and Amara (42Hong W.C. Amara S.G.

The blue light stimulation was done at 4% of the 488-nm laser power (12.5–13 μW) immediately before performing the uptake experiment. After the addition of IDT307, uptake was assessed using 1.5% of the 488-nm laser power. Continuous monitoring of IDT307 using 1.5% of the 488-nm laser power did not affect Cry2–DAT multimerization or the uptake measurements (data not shown). HEK293 cells expressing Cry2–mCh empty vector had minimal to no uptake activity as measured using IDT307 (Fig. 1D). FLAG–DAT was used as a positive control for uptake activity, but as a negative control for blue light–induced multimerization of DAT. FLAG–DAT–expressing cells treated with METH and NOM had significantly reduced uptake compared with the control cells (Fig. 4, A and C). The uptake activity of"

In total, 61 pregnant patients diagnosed with pre-eclampsia were recruited during their hospital stay. The authors investigated the relationship between urine protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) and chorioretinal measurements including choroidal thickness (CT), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), foveal avascular zone (FAZ), vascular density (VD), ganglion cell layer+ (GCL+) and GCL++. The associations between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ophthalmologic factors were also evaluated. Central subfield CT of the right eye (p = 0.031) and paracentral CT of both eyes were related to higher PCR (≥1.35 mg/mg). A significant association with PCR after logarithm transformation was noted (r = 0.284, p = 0.026). Retinal measurements (FAZ, VD, GCL+ and GCL++) and CVI were not related with PCR. There was a positive association between MAP and PCR after logarithm transformation (r = 0.296, p = 0.021); however, chorioretinal factors were not related with MAP. In pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, CT using OCT is a novel factor that is correlated with PCR. Ocular structural alteration in patients with pre-eclampsia may be one of systemic vascular changes caused by pre-eclampsia rather than hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3162065534,"Model tests were performed to investigate the lateral earth pressure acting on the retaining structure adjacent to both natural ground (NG) and composite foundation (CFRLP), which were supported with rigid-flexible and long-short piles. Two testing procedures, namely, applying a load to the foundation and rotating the retaining structure along its toe, were considered. The results indicate that the additional lateral earth pressure acting on the retaining structure adjacent to the CFRLP is less than that of the NG in the depth of the reinforcement area strengthened by flexible piles. Compared with NG, the CFRLP yielded a smaller normalized height of application of the lateral earth pressure, suggesting that the CFRLP blocked the horizontal diffusion of the load and had a strong ability to transfer the surcharge load to the deep soil. When rotating the retaining structure, the lateral earth pressure acting on the upper part of the retaining structure experienced limited reduction once the displacement at the top of the retaining structure was greater than 8 mm, whereas the pressure acting on the lower part of the retaining structure continued to decrease with increasing displacement. In addition, a three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) was used to investigate the influence of the pile parameter and the wall-soil friction angle on the additional lateral earth pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3162433506,"Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool getting into the field of clinical examination. Its preliminary application in pre-implantation comprehensive chromosomal screening (PCCS) of assisted reproduction (test-tube baby) has shown encouraging outcomes that improves the success rate of in vitro fertilization. However, the conventional NGS library construction is time consuming. In addition with the whole genome amplification (WGA) procedure in prior, makes the single cell NGS assay hardly be accomplished within an adequately short turnover time in supporting fresh embryo implantation. In this work, we established a concise single cell sequencing protocol, ChromInst, in which the single cell WGA and NGS library construction were integrated into a two-step PCR procedure of ~ 2.5hours reaction time. We then validated the feasibility of ChromInst for overnight PCCS assay by examining 14 voluntary donated embryo biopsy samples in a single sequencing run of Miseq with merely 13M reads production. The good compatibility of ChromInst with the restriction of Illumina sequencing technique along with the good library yield uniformity resulted superior data usage efficiency and reads distribution evenness that ensures precisely distinguish of 6 normal embryos from 8 abnormal one with variable chromosomal aneuploidy. The superior succinctness and effectiveness of this protocol permits its utilization in other time limited single cell NGS applications."

Data on demographics, sexual behaviors and the laboratory test results of HIV, syphilis, HSV-2 were collected. The χ2 trend test was used to analyze the trends of HIV/syphilis/HSV-2 seropositive rate. The binary logistic regression model was used to explore the factors associated with HSV-2 infection.The seropositive rate of HIV fell significantly from 15.9% in 2012 to 8.7% in 2018 (Ptrend = 0.003), syphilis seropositive rate was significantly decreased from 20.4% in 2012 to 14.8% in 2018 (Ptrend = 0.025), HSV-2 seropositive rate had no significant change (16.7% in 2012 to 14.0% in 2018; Ptrend = 0.617). In principal component logistic regression analysis showed that FAC1_1 (X1 = Ever had sex with female, X2 = Gender of first sexual partner, X3 = Marital status, X4 = Age group), FAC2_1 (X5 = Education, X6 = Monthly income (RMB), X7 = Frequency of condom use in anal sex with men in the past 6 months), and FAC4_1 (X9 = History of STDs) were significantly associated with HSV-2 infection.The seropositive rates of HIV and syphilis have dropped significantly but are still high. HSV-2 seropositive rate had no significant change and maintained a high level. It is necessary to continue strengthening HIV and syphilis interventions among MSM in Shenzhen. HSV-2 detection and intervention are urgently required for MSM, which might be another effective biological strategy further to control the HIV epidemic among MSM in Shenzhen."

It reiterated what I had heard so many times before: I should follow my dream, and if I didn't yet know what that was, I should live with career uncertainty until I figured it out. But as an international student working in the United States, taking time to explore wasn't an option for me. After listening to me rant, my adviser calmly looked across his desk. He told me that instead of focusing on finding a dream job, I should think about what I am good at and what makes me happy at least 80% of the time. This advice surprised me at first, but it ended up being exactly what I needed to hear."
https://openalex.org/W3161658204,"Regional analgesic techniques such as paravertebral blocks (PVBs) have been popularized for analgesia following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). In this single center retrospective propensity matched cohort of subjects, we investigate the impact of paravertebral blocks on the analgesic and non-analgesic outcomes.Institutional database was queried to identify all patients undergoing VATS between January 2013 and July 2019 and these patients were divided into those who received paravertebral blocks in combination with general anesthesia (GA) [PVB group] and those who received GA without paravertebral blocks [GA group]. Propensity score matching based on common patient confounders were used to identify patients in each group. Primary outcomes of the study were average pain scores and opioid consumption in the first 24 hours. Secondary analgesic outcomes included pain scores and opioid requirements at other timepoints over the first 48 hours. Non analgesic outcomes were obtained from STS General Thoracic Surgery Database and included length of hospital stay, need for ICU admission, composite outcome of any complication during the hospital course and 30-day mortality. Exploratory analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of PVB on analgesia following different types of surgery and as to whether any other covariates had a greater influence on the included patient centered outcomes.After propensity score matching, a total of 520 patients (260 per group) were selected for the study out of 1095 patients. The opioid consumption in terms of oral morphine milligram equivalent (MME) [Median (IQR)] for the first 24 hours was significantly lower with the use of PVB [PVB group- 78.5 (96.75); GA group-127.0 (111.5); p<0.001] while the average pain scores in the first 24 hours did not differ significantly [PVB group-4.71 (2.28); GA group-4.85 (2.30); p = 0.70]. The length of hospital stay, opioid requirements at other timepoints, need for ICU admission in the immediate post-operative period and the composite outcome-'any complication' (35% vs 48%) were significantly lower with the use of PVB. Subgroup analysis showed a longer duration of benefit following major lung surgeries compared to others.Paravertebral blocks reduced the length of stay and opioid consumption up to 48 hours after VATS without significantly impacting pain scores."
https://openalex.org/W3162264443,"Presence of inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment is well-documented yet their specific role in tumorigenesis is elusive. The core inflammatory pathways like the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) and the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) pathway are conserved in Drosophila. We induced GFP-marked epithelial tumors by expressing activated oncogenic forms of RasV12 or Yorkie (Yki3SA, mammalian YAP) in scribble deficient cells (scribRNAi, mammalian SCRIB) to study the role of inflammatory factors in tumorigenesis. Similar to RasV12scribRNAi, we found that Yki3SAscribRNAi form invasive neoplastic lethal tumors that induce a systemic inflammatory response. We identified Cactus (Cact, mammalian IκBα), the negative regulator of TLR, as a key player in tumor growth. Cact accumulates in the cytoplasm in Drosophila tumor models, similar to squamous cell carcinoma in mice models and human patients where cytoplasmic IκBα favors oncogenic transformation. Further, cact is transcriptionally upregulated in tumors, and downregulation of Cact affects tumor growth. We investigated if TLR or TNF pathway affect tumor growth through activation of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway and its target Matrix Metalloprotease1 (MMP1). Genetically manipulating levels of TLR components or TNF receptors showed that Cact acts upstream of JNK signaling and regulates JNK via a non-canonical mechanism during tumorigenesis. Further, Hippo coactivator Yki transcriptionally regulates cact expression, and downregulation of Yki or Cact is sufficient to cause downregulation of JNK-mediated signaling that promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we report a link between Hippo, IκBα and JNK signaling that may induce inflammation and innate immune response in tumorigenesis."
