https://openalex.org/W1981006945,"Metals such as silver support surface plasmons: electromagnetic surface excitations localized near the surface that originate from the free electrons of the metal. Surface modes are also observed on highly conducting surfaces perforated by holes. We establish a close connection between the two, showing that electromagnetic waves in both materials are governed by an effective permittivity of the same plasma form. The size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, which allows the creation of designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics."

We generated receptor subtype–selective ligands allowing the separation of EPO's bioactivities at the cellular level and in animals. Carbamylated EPO (CEPO) or certain EPO mutants did not bind to the classical EPO receptor (EPOR) and did not show any hematopoietic activity in human cell signaling assays or upon chronic dosing in different animal species. Nevertheless, CEPO and various nonhematopoietic mutants were cytoprotective in vitro and conferred neuroprotection against stroke, spinal cord compression, diabetic neuropathy, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis at a potency and efficacy comparable to EPO."

We now report the identity of a germination-promoting compound present in plant- and cellulose-derived smoke. The structure of this compound, deduced from spectroscopic analysis and confirmed by synthesis, was shown to be that of the butenolide 3-methyl-2 H -furo[2,3- c ]pyran-2-one ( 1 ). Here we show that 1 promotes germination of a number of plant species at a level similar to that observed with plant-derived smoke water."

We have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells. We used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins, including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10(-8)M to 10(-11)M. One such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. These results show that it is possible to interrogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection."

Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2), rather than Tph1, is preferentially expressed in the brain. We report a functional (C1473G) single-nucleotide polymorphism in mouse Tph2 that results in the substitution of Pro 447 with Arg 447 and leads to decreased serotonin levels in PC12 cells. Moreover, in BALB/cJ and DBA/2 mice that are homozygous for the 1473G allele, brain serotonin tissue content and synthesis are reduced in comparison to C57Bl/6 and 129X1/SvJ mice that are homozygous for the 1473C allele. Our data provide direct evidence for a fundamental role of Tph2 in brain serotonin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4237805535,"Recent development of neural prosthetics for assisting paralyzed patients has focused on decoding intended hand trajectories from motor cortical neurons and using this signal to control external devices. In this study, higher level signals related to the goals of movements were decoded from three monkeys and used to position cursors on a computer screen without the animals emitting any behavior. Their performance in this task improved over a period of weeks. Expected value signals related to fluid preference, the expected magnitude, or probability of reward were decoded simultaneously with the intended goal. For neural prosthetic applications, the goal signals can be used to operate computers, robots, and vehicles, whereas the expected value signals can be used to continuously monitor a paralyzed patient's preferences and motivation."

We show here that IELs expressingthe αβ T cell receptor are derived from precursors that express RORγt, an orphan nuclear hormone receptor detected only in immature CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes, fetal lymphoid tissue–inducer (LTi) cells, and LTi-like cells in cryptopatches within the adult intestinal lamina propria. Using cell fate mapping, we found that all intestinal αβ T cells are progeny of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes, indicatingthat the adult intestine is not a significant site for αβ T cell development. Our results suggest that intestinal RORγt + cells are local organizers of mucosal lymphoid tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2060687897,"The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata possesses a diverse family of fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), hemolymph polypeptides that consist of one or two amino-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen domain. Here, we show that the IgSF1 domain of the FREP3 subfamily is diversified at the genomic level at higher rates than those recorded for control genes. All sequence variants are derived from a small set of nine source sequences by point mutation and recombinatorial processes. Diverse FREP3 transcripts are also produced. We hypothesize a mechanism present in snails that is capable of diversifying molecules involved in internal defense."
https://openalex.org/W2154254146,"Numerous degenerative disorders are associated with elevated levels of prooxidants and declines in mitochondrial aconitase activity. Deficiency in the mitochondrial iron-binding protein frataxin results in diminished activity of various mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins including aconitase. We found that aconitase can undergo reversible citrate-dependent modulation in activity in response to pro-oxidants. Frataxin interacted with aconitase in a citrate-dependent fashion, reduced the level of oxidant-induced inactivation, and converted inactive [3Fe-4S] 1+ enzyme to the active [4Fe-4S] 2+ form of the protein. Thus, frataxin is an iron chaperone protein that protects the aconitase [4Fe-4S] 2+ cluster from disassembly and promotes enzyme reactivation."

When initiated before CD4 cell depletion, L-870812 therapy mediated a sustained suppression of viremia, preserving CD4 levels and permitting the induction of virus-specific cellular immunity. L-870812 was also active in chronic infection; however, the magnitude and durability of the effect varied in conjunction with the pretreatment immune response and viral load. These studies demonstrate integrase inhibitor activity in vivo and suggest that cellular immunity facilitates chemotherapeutic efficacy in retroviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2148418336,"Intermediate-period Rayleigh and Love waves propagating across Tibet indicate marked radial anisotropy within the middle-to-lower crust, consistent with a thinning of the middle crust by about 30%. The anisotropy is largest in the western part of the plateau, where moment tensors of earthquakes indicate active crustal thinning. The preferred orientation of mica crystals resulting from the crustal thinning can account for the observed anisotropy. The middle-to-lower crust of Tibet appears to have thinned more than the upper crust, consistent with deformation of a mechanically weak layer that flows as if confined to a channel."
https://openalex.org/W1995169362,"Two contrasting views of the active deformation of Asia dominate the debate about how continents deform: (i) The deformation is primarily localized on major faults separating crustal blocks or (ii) deformation is distributed throughout the continental lithosphere. In the first model, western Tibet is being extruded eastward between the major faults bounding the region. Surface displacement measurements across the western Tibetan plateau using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) indicate that slip rates on the Karakoram and Altyn Tagh faults are lower than would be expected for the extrusion model and suggest a significant amount of internal deformation in Tibet."
https://openalex.org/W2078526836,"We observed the in situ growth of a grain during recrystallization in the bulk of a deformed sample. We used the three-dimensional x-ray diffraction microscope located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The results showed a very heterogeneous growth pattern, contradicting the classical assumption of smooth and spherical growth of new grains during recrystallization. This type of in situ bulk measurement opens up the possibility of obtaining experimental data on scientific topics that before could only be analyzed theoretically on the basis of the statistical characterization of microstructures. For recrystallization, the in situ method includes direct measurements of nucleation and boundary migration through a deformed matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1970306975,"Recent studies have implicated inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) in mediating fatty acid (FA)-induced insulin resistance. How IKK causes these effects is unknown. The present study addressed the role of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), the distal target of IKK activity, in FA-induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes, an in vitro skeletal muscle model. A 6-h exposure of myotubes to the saturated FA palmitate reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by ∼30%, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase B phosphorylation by ∼40%, and stimulated inhibitor of κBα degradation and the nuclear translocation of NFκB. On the other hand, the Ω-3 polyunsaturated FA linolenate neither induced insulin resistance nor promoted nuclear localization of NFκB. Supporting the hypothesis that IKK acts through NFκB to cause insulin resistance, the IKK inhibitors acetylsalicylate and parthenolide prevented FA-induced reductions in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and NFκB nuclear translocation. Most importantly, NFκB SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits NFκB nuclear translocation downstream of IKK, was sufficient to prevent palmitate-induced reductions in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Acetylsalicylate, but not NFκB SN50, prevented FA effects on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity and protein kinase B phosphorylation. We conclude that FAs induce insulin resistance and activates NFκB in L6 cells.

Thus, inhibition of IKK activity by salicylates prevents the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance caused by short-term lipid infusions in rats and mice (17Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J.

Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which increased IKK activity mediates lipid-induced insulin resistance are poorly understood. IKK is a serine kinase identified as a proximal element of the pro-inflammatory IKK/IκB/NFκB pathway (19Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 20Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Activated IKK phosphorylates inhibitor of κB(IκB), a cytoplasmic protein that inhibits nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), a family of transcription factors that function as homo- or heterodimers in the regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiapoptotic genes (19Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 20Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteosome, thus releasing NFκB for translocation to the nucleus and activation of gene expression. It has been proposed that elevated NFκB activity may play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis, and chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis (21Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 22Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). It is interesting that recent studies have also postulated a role for long-term low grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of diseases that include obesity and type 2 diabetes (23Wilson P.W. Grundy S.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1537-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Wilson P.W. Grundy S.M.

Indeed, a recent study in humans (11Itani S.I. Ruderman N.B. Schmieder F. Boden G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a short-term lipid infusion that induces skeletal muscle insulin resistance also reduces skeletal muscle IκB levels, suggesting that NFκB is activated in insulin-resistant states. The studies discussed above support the hypothesis that lipid-induced insulin resistance is associated with, and may require, the activation of NFκB. However, neither the effects of lipids on NFκB activation nor the role of NFκB activation in fatty acid-induced insulin resistance has been determined. The current study addressed each of these issues in an in vitro skeletal muscle model, the L6 myotube. The data demonstrate a critical role for the IKK/IκB/NFκB pathway in lipid-induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. Thus, fatty acids induce insulin resistance and stimulate nuclear translocation of NFκB in a dose- and time-dependent manner consistent with a mechanistic role for NFκB in lipid-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of nuclear translocation of NFκB by three independent methods blocks the effects of palmitate on insulin action. One of these inhibitors blocks NFκB nuclear translocation downstream of IKK activation and IκB degradation, demonstrating that NFκB activation is an important mechanism of lipid-induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. L6 Cell Culture—A line of insulin-sensitive L6 skeletal muscle cells (28Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ramlal T. Sarabia V. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used in the present study (a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada). Stock myoblasts were grown and maintained in monolayer culture in αMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C until they reached ∼40–50% confluence. To obtained fully differentiated myotubes, stock myoblasts were reseeded at a density of 4000 cells/cm2 into 6-well plates, in 10% fetal bovine serum-αMEM for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with 2% fetal bovine serum-αMEM and antibiotics. The cells were maintained for 7–8 days, with a medium change every 24–48 h, before use in experiments. Experimental Design—L6 myotubes underwent a short-term (0.2–6.0 h) exposure to BSA-conjugated FAs (0.025–0.4 mm) in the absence or presence of inhibitors of the IKK/IκB/NFκB pathway. Where used, IKK/IκB/NFκB inhibitors were added 1 h before FAs. Control cells were exposed to BSA alone. Thereafter, the effects of these exposures on [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin, PI3-kinase activity, and PKB phosphorylation in the presence of 100 nm insulin, IκBα levels, and nuclear localization and DNA binding of NFκB were determined. Fatty Acid Solution Preparations—Stock FA solutions were prepared by conjugating FA with FA-free BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). In brief, sufficient FAs were dissolved in preheated 0.1 n NaOH and diluted 1:10 in prewarmed (45–50 °C) αMEM containing 12% (w/v) BSA, to give a final FA concentration of 2.0 mm. This gave a final molar ratio of free FA/BSA of 1.5:1.0, near that observed in human serum (30Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 165-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Spector A.A.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock FA solutions were filter-sterilized and diluted with cell culture media for use in experiments. Control media contained 0.1 n NaOH and BSA but no lipid. Where required, the pH of preparations was adjusted to 7.4. [3H]2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—2-Deoxyglucose uptake was determined as described previously (33Tremblay F. Marette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38052-38060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, after experimental treatments, the myotubes were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin, rinsed 2× in HEPES-buffered solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm CaCl2) and then incubated for 5 min in a HEPES-buffered solution containing 10 μm [3H]2-deoxyglucose (0.5 μCi/ml [3H]-2-deoxyglucose). Glucose transport was stopped by washing three times with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, and cells were collected in 1.25 ml of 0.05 n NaOH. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a kit from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA), and the results were expressed as picomoles of 2-deoxyglucose transported per minute per milligram of protein. Nuclear Protein Extracts, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs), and Measurement of IκBα and Nuclear NFκB—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared for the analysis of DNA binding of NFκB and nuclear levels of NFκB. In brief, after experimental treatment, cells were pelleted and incubated on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min followed by addition of Igepal to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Cells were vortexed for 10 s, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 s). The supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins was discarded. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with the buffer described above and then resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 0.5 ng/ml pepstatin A and 5 ng/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin. The nuclei were mixed vigorously on a shaking platform (4 °C, 15 min), centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant containing nuclear protein was snap-frozen on dry ice. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method as described above. For EMSAs, radiolabeled DNA probes were generated by annealing a template containing the κB-palindromic binding sequence (5′CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3′) to a complementary 10-base primer (5′-AAGGAGAGGG-3′) (34Ballard D.W.

The overhang was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, and 5 mm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. EMSAs were performed as described by Ballard et al. (34Ballard D.W. Walker W.H. Doerre S. Sista P. Molitor J.A. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Hannink M. Greene W.C. Cell. 1990; 63: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In brief, 32P-labeled κB probes were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract for 15 min at RT in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μgofBSA, 5mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCL, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturating conditions in a Tris-borate/EDTA buffer. After drying the gel, the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with α-p65 or α-p50 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) for 30 min before use in EMSAs. Nuclear levels of p65 (using nuclear protein extracts) and IκBα (Cell Signaling) levels (using whole cell extracts) were determined by a standard immunoblotting technique. PI3-kinase Activity and Akt Immunoblots—For experiments requiring measurement of PI3-kinase activity and PKB phosphorylation, myotubes were exposed to 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, media were aspirated, an excess volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added and aspirated, and the cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extracts were prepared in 200 μl of a buffer containing, as final concentrations, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. PI3-kinase activity was assayed according to a standard protocol. In brief, immunoprecipitation of active PI3-kinase was achieved by incubating 250 μg of cell protein with 1.5 μg of α-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose for 2.0 h (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C with phosphatidylinositol (10 μg; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc, Alabaster, AL) in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). 32P-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate was separated by thin layer chromatography and was quantitated by scraping the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate spot from the TLC plate, followed by scintillation counting. Total PKB and phosphorylated PKB (serine-473) were measured with commercially available antibodies (Cell Signaling) using a standard immunoblot protocol. Materials—α-MEM and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Bovine fetal bovine serum was from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Trypsin/EDTA was from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). The FAs palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, and BSA, insulin, and acetylsalicylate were obtained from Sigma Chemical. Palmitic acid from NU-CHEK (Elysian, MN) was used for some NFκB experiments to rule out the possibility of nonspecific effects of the fatty acid preparation. Reagents for PAGE were from Bio-Rad. [α-32P]ATP and [3H]2-deoxyglucose were obtained from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. NFκB SN50 and mutant NFκB SN50 cell-permeable peptides were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). NFκB SN50, containing the nuclear localization signal of the p50 subunit of NFκB and the hydrophobic region of astrocyte fibroblast growth factor, competitively inhibits NFκB nuclear translocation (35Lin Y.Z.

Parthenolide, a sesquiterpene and specific inhibitor of IKK, was obtained from Sigma (36Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J.

Statistical significance was determined by unpaired or paired t tests where appropriate, using the statistics module of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Palmitate and Linoleate, but Not the Ω-3 Polyunsaturated FA Linolenate, Induce Insulin Resistance and Stimulate the Nuclear Translocation of NFκB in L6 Myotubes—We first determined the effects of fatty acids on insulin sensitivity and NFκB nuclear translocation in L6 myotubes. Three long chain fatty acids were chosen for study: palmitate, a C16:0 saturated fatty acid; linoleate, a C18:2 Ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid; and linolenate, a C18:3 Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. A 6-h incubation of L6 myotubes with 0.4 mm palmitate or linoleate conjugated with 2.4% BSA (1.5:1.0 molar ratio) decreased absolute insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake by ∼30% compared with myotubes incubated with 2.4% BSA alone (Fig. 1A), and decreased net insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake by ∼80 and ∼60%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Unlike palmitate and linoleate, linolenate had no effects on insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake compared with control cells. Similar to their effects on insulin sensitivity, palmitate and linoleate, but not linolenate, stimulated DNA binding of NFκB (Fig. 1C). As expected, palmitate also decreased cytosolic IkBα levels and increased nuclear levels of p65 (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, using supershift assays p65 and p50 were determined to be the NFκB family members comprising the heterodimer binding to DNA (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that fatty-acid induced insulin resistance and NFκB activation are coincident in L6 myotubes. Furthermore, fatty acids that do not induce insulin resistance do not activate NFκB.Fig. 2Effects of palmitate on total IκBα levels, nuclear NFκB p65 levels, and the identification of the NFκB subunits present in DNA-NFκB complexes. L6 myotubes were exposed to palmitate/BSA or BSA alone as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Thereafter, cellular extracts were prepared for the analysis of total IκBα (A), nuclear NFκB p65 (B), and identification of the specific NFκB subunits binding DNA (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative immunoblot of IκBα in BSA- or palmitate-treated (1, 2, 4, or 6 h) cells.

C, a representative EMSA is shown depicting the effects of palmitate on DNA binding of nuclear NFκB and the effects of preincubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies to the p50 and p65 subunits of NFκB before performance of an EMSA (lanes 3 and 4).

Second, we hypothesized that nuclear translocation of NFκB would precede the development of fatty acid-induced insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was present after a 6-h incubation of L6 myotubes with palmitate but was not present at the earlier time-points measured, although a trend toward decreased insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake was evident from 2 h onward (Fig. 3, A and B). It is noteworthy that palmitate-stimulated nuclear translocation of NFκB was evident as early as 1 h after addition of the fatty acid and increased nuclear translocation was present at 4 and 6 h. (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that activation of the IKK/IκB/NFκB pathway occurs before the development of fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in L6 cells. We next determined the concentration-dependence of fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and NFκB translocation, reasoning that similar concentrations of fatty acids would be required to induce insulin resistance and nuclear translocation of NFκB. L6 myotubes were incubated for 6 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of palmitate before the measurement of glucose uptake and NFκB translocation. Palmitate concentrations of 0.1 mm or below did not significantly decrease absolute or net insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake or activate NFκB compared with controls (Fig. 4, A–C). However, increasing the palmitate concentration to 0.2 or 0.4 mm reduced absolute 2DG uptake in the presence of insulin, decreased net insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and stimulated nuclear translocation of NFκB. The IKK Inhibitors Salicylate and Parthenolide Prevent Palmitate-induced Insulin Resistance and Nuclear Translocation of NFκB—Administration of salicylate prevents the development of lipid-induced insulin resistance in rodents (17Kim J.K.

Thus, we reasoned that if fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and activation of NFκB in L6 cells requires increased IKK activity, salicylates should prevent these events. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of salicylates and a second IKK inhibitor, parthenolide, on palmitate-induced insulin resistance and nuclear translocation of NFκB.

In contrast, the CNS environment in fish is permissive for growth, yet some neurons still cannot regenerate. Fish thus offer an opportunity to study molecules that might surmount the intrinsic limitations they share with mammals, without the complication of an inhibitory environment. We show by in vivo imaging in zebrafish that post-injury application of cyclic adenosine monophosphate can transform severed CNS neurons into ones that regenerate and restore function, thus overcoming intrinsic limitations to regeneration in a vertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W1985909253,"Induction of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) by xenobiotics may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions. In contrast with other CYP3A family members, studies on the inducibility of CYP3A5 indicate conflicting results. We report the induction of CYP3A5 mRNA in 13 of 16 hepatocyte preparations exposed to rifampin. Furthermore, induction of CYP3A5 mRNA was observed in intestinal biopsies in three of eight probands following exposure to the antibiotic. The highest absolute levels of CYP3A5 transcripts were found following rifampin treatment in hepatocytes and intestines from carriers of CYP3A5*1 alleles. Elucidation of the mechanism involved in CYP3A5 induction revealed that constitutively activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) transactivated the CYP3A5 promoter (–688 to +49) and that the transactivation was dependent on an everted repeat separated by 6 bp (ER6-dependent). Treatment with the prototypical PXR ligand rifampin led to a 2-fold induction of the CYP3A5 promoter activity. In agreement with these observations, PXR and CAR bound specifically to the ER6 motif. Hepatic expression of PXR correlated with that of CYP3A5 mRNA levels in a bank of liver samples. Taken together, studies here revealed the presence of a functional ER6 motif in the CYP3A5 promoter located –100 bp upstream from the transcription start site, suggesting that CYP3A5 is inducible by mechanisms similar to those involved in CYP3A4 induction. Enhanced expression of CYP3A5 caused by exposure to inducers may phenocopy the effects of the high expression allele CYP3A5*1. In this manner, induction of CYP3A5 may contribute to the overall importance of this P450 in drug metabolism and drug interactions.

In this manner, induction of CYP3A5 may contribute to the overall importance of this P450 in drug metabolism and drug interactions. Members of the human cytochrome 3A subfamily of P450 monooxygenases (CYP3A) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome(s) P450; CAR, constitutively activated receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor; ER6, everted repeat separated by 6 bp; RXRα, retinoid X receptor-α; XREM, xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module; HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4; CITCO, 6-(4-chloropheny-l)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime. play an important role in drug metabolism because of their hepatic and intestinal abundance and because of the large substrate spectrum. CYP3A enzymes account for 50% of the total P450 in an average human liver, and these enzymes participate in the metabolism of up to 50% of the drugs currently in use (1Li A.P. Kaminski D.L. Rasmussen A. Toxicology. 1995; 104: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Evans W.E. Relling M.V. Science. 1999; 286: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, CYP3A are frequently involved in drug-drug interactions. CYP3A inhibition by drugs such as ketoconazole or erythromycin is considered the most relevant mechanism. For example, the resulting increased levels of the co-administered nonsedating antihistamine terfenadine in the presence of ketoconazole inhibited a cardiac potassium channel, leading to serious and, in some cases, fatal cardiac arrhythmias (3Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition, many drugs and other environmental substances increase the activity of CYP3A through transcriptional activation (induction) (4Gibson G.G. Plant N.J. Swales K.E. Ayrton A. El-Sankary W. Xenobiotica. 2002; 32: 165-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CYP3A induction is frequently considered clinically less important than inhibition because it is expected to reduce the efficacy of co-administered CYP3A substrate drugs rather than to affect their safety. However, CYP3A inducers such as rifampin and rifabutin can reduce plasma concentrations of certain drugs up to 40-fold, effectively abolishing their efficacy (5Gillum J.G. Israel D.S. Polk R.E. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1993; 25: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Grange J.M. Winstanley P.A. Davies P.D. Drug Saf. 1994; 11: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, enhanced metabolism of the CYP3A substrate cyclosporine by rifampin has resulted in organ graft rejections (7Lucey M.R. Kolars J.C. Merion R.M. Campbell D.A. Aldrich M. Watkins P.B. Lancet. 1990; 335: 11-15Abstract PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas rifampin and the widely used herbal antidepressant St. John's wort have attenuated the efficacy of human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (8Cvetkovic R. Goa K. Drugs. 2003; 63: 769-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In addition, CYP3A4 induction by rifampicin is responsible for a large portion of the up to 400-fold variation in the area under the curve for midazolam (9Backman J.T. Kivisto K.T. Olkkola K.T. Neuvonen P.J. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For most compounds tested, induction is mediated by the nuclear receptors PXR and/or CAR. The transcriptional activation by PXR is triggered by the binding of an inducer to the receptor and involves specific binding sites in the respective CYP3A promoter. There are four CYP3A genes in humans, although only two protein products (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) have been identified unequivocally in adult liver in vivo. Xenobiotic-mediated increases in expression of CYP3A4 mRNA and protein and CYP3A7 and CYP3A43 mRNA have been reported (4Gibson G.G. Plant N.J. Swales K.E. Ayrton A. El-Sankary W. Xenobiotica. 2002; 32: 165-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O. Buntefuss D. Escher S. Bishop C. Koebe H.G. Brinkmann U. Klenk H.P. Kleine K. Meyer U.A. Wojnowski L. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). With regards to CYP3A5, Wrighton et al. (11Wrighton S.A. Ring B.J. Watkins P.B. VandenBranden M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar) found negligible induction of this protein in humans treated with prototypical CYP3A inducers. Schuetz et al. (12Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Strom S.C. Thompson M.T. Fisher R.A. Molowa D.T. Li D. Guzelian P.S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) reported a similar result for both primary human hepatocytes and for the hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line TONG/HCC. On the other hand, two other more recent studies showed that CYP3A5 was inducible in human hepatocytes by rifampin and phenobarbital (13Rodriguez-Antona C. Jover R. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Castell J.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Rae J.M. Johnson M.D. Lippman M.E. Flockhart D.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 849-857PubMed Google Scholar). The initial characterizations of the CYP3A5 promoter failed to demonstrate rifampicin responsiveness (15Jounaidi Y. Guzelian P.S. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Thottassery J.V. Guzelian P.S. Strom S. Sun D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar). These results are, however, invalid because of the confusion of the CYP3A5 5′-region with the sequence far more upstream in the CYP3A gene locus (10Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O. Buntefuss D. Escher S. Bishop C. Koebe H.G. Brinkmann U. Klenk H.P. Kleine K. Meyer U.A. Wojnowski L.

Although a more recent analysis of the authentic regulatory region of CYP3A5 similarly failed to demonstrate a responsiveness to rifampin, the lung cell line used did not express PXR (18Hukkanen J. Vaisanen T. Lassila A. Piipari R. Anttila S. Pelkonen O. Raunio H. Hakkola J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Altogether, the data on the inducibility of CYP3A5 by typical CYP3A inducers are still conflicting. A clarification of the inducibility of CYP3A5 is important for the assessment of the overall importance of CYP3A5 in hepatic and intestinal drug metabolism. The dominant position of CYP3A4 within the CYP3A family has been challenged recently in favor of CYP3A5, especially in individuals with increased expression of CYP3A5 because of the inheritance of CYP3A5*1 alleles (19Kuehl P. Zhang J. Lin Y. Lamba J. Assem M. Schuetz J. Watkins P.B. Daly A. Wrighton S.A. Hall S.D. Maurel P. Relling M. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Venkataramanan R. Strom S. Thummel K. Boguski M.S. Schuetz E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). However, this has been contested by findings of a much lower CYP3A5 contribution to the CYP3A pool (20Koch I. Weil R. Wolbold R. Brockmoller J. Hustert E. Burk O. Nuessler A. Neuhaus P. Eichelbaum M. Zanger U. Wojnowski L. Drug Metab.

In the following report, we present the results of our analysis of CYP3A5 induction, which involved ex vivo, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. Hepatocytes—The two sources and preparations of primary human hepatocytes were as described previously (10Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O.

GH series were isolated from normal hepatic tissue surrounding a resected liver tumor, whereas HH samples were from transplant donors. The culture conditions were as described previously (10Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O. Buntefuss D. Escher S. Bishop C. Koebe H.G. Brinkmann U.

Dispos. 2003; 31: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) for HH livers. Drugs to be tested were dissolved in Me2SO (final concentration of Me2SO in the cell culture medium, 0.1%). Following the appropriate incubation time, cells were lysed as described, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Intestinal Biopsies—Biopsy specimens of the duodenal mucosa were obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analysis. The details of the study have been described elsewhere (23Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). After 9 days of oral treatment with 600 mg/day rifampin, a second biopsy was obtained and treated as described above. Liver Samples—Liver samples were collected during surgical interventions conducted at the Department of Surgery, University Medical Center Charité, Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany. The donors were white Europeans. The liver samples included nontumorous tissue surrounding primary liver tumors and metastases of various tumors or liver material surgically removed for other reasons. Medical histories were evaluated in respect to treatment with known CYP3A inducers. The preparations of total RNA for these liver samples have been described in a previous study (24Wolbold R. Klein K. Burk O. Nussler A.K. Neuhaus P. Eichelbaum M. Schwab M. Zanger U.M. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Ethics—All studies were approved by the local ethics boards, and written consent was obtained from all patients and probands. TaqMan Assays and Genotyping—Total RNA was isolated from lysed hepatocytes and intestinal biopsies using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). The concentration of total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically, and the quality was evaluated by inspection of the integrity of 28 S and 18 S rRNA bands on agarose gels. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primers following a procedure described previously (20Koch I. Weil R. Wolbold R. Brockmoller J. Hustert E. Burk O. Nuessler A. Neuhaus P. Eichelbaum M. Zanger U. Wojnowski L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The cDNA used for one TaqMan reaction was derived from 10 ng of total RNA. Primers, probes, and conditions of the assays were as described previously (20Koch I. Weil R. Wolbold R. Brockmoller J. Hustert E. Burk O. Nuessler A. Neuhaus P. Eichelbaum M. Zanger U. Wojnowski L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An increase in transcript numbers by a factor of 1.5 or more was considered induction. The genotype of the CYP3A5*1 allele, predictive of increased CYP3A5 expression, was determined as described previously (25Hustert E. Haberl M. Burk O. Wolbold R. He Y.Q. Klein K. Nuessler A.C. Neuhaus P. Klattig J. Eiselt R. Koch I. Zibat A. Brockmoller J. Halpert J.R. Zanger U.M. Wojnowski L.

Plasmid Constructs—The eukaryotic expression plasmids for human PXR and human CAR have been described previously (26Hustert E. Zibat A. Presecan-Siedel E. Eiselt R. Mueller R. Fuss C. Brehm I.

The proximal CYP3A5 promoter (–688 to +49, with respect to the transcription start site) was amplified out of human genomic DNA by PCR with the forward oligonucleotide 5′-ACA GGT ACC ATC ACC ACA GAG TCA GAG GGG ATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACA AGA TCT GCT GTT TGC TGG GCT GTT TGC CTG G-3′. The oligonucleotides introduce, respectively, a KpnI and a BglII restriction site on the 5′- and 3′-end of the amplified fragment. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BglII and cloned into appropriately digested luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). The identity of the CYP3A5 promoter within the cloned DNA fragment and the absence of mutations introduced by PCR were verified by sequencing of the resulting plasmid p3A5(–688). Mutagenesis of the ER6 motif was performed within plasmid p3A5(–688) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide 5′-CCT CAT AGA ACA TGTTCT CAA AAG AGAACA GCA AAG GGG TGT GTG-3′ (half-sites of ER6 are shown in bold, and mutated bases are in italics and underlined). The introduction of the mutations and the absence of other undesired mutations were verified by sequencing of the resulting plasmid p3A5(–688/mER6). A reporter gene plasmid of CYP3A4 comparable in size to p3A5(–688) was generated by unidirectional deletion of pGL3-CYP3A4(–1105) (26Hustert E. Zibat A. Presecan-Siedel E. Eiselt R. Mueller R. Fuss C. Brehm I. Brinkmann U. Eichelbaum M. Wojnowski L. Burk O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1454-1459PubMed Google Scholar) with the double-stranded nested deletion kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing identified a clone encompassing the CYP3A4 promoter region from –702 to +51 of the transcription start site, p3A4(–702). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transient co-transfection experiments in LS174T cells were performed as described previously (28Burk O. Tegude H. Koch I. Hustert E. Wolbold R. Glaeser H. Klein K. Fromm M.F. Nuessler A.K. Neuhaus P. Zanger U.M. Eichelbaum M. Wojnowski L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24280-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 6–7 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, supplied with fresh medium (without phenol red and supplemented with fetal calf serum that was pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal), and treated with 1 μm CITCO or 10 μm rifampin, both dissolved in Me2SO, or with an equivalent amount (final concentration, 0.1%) of Me2SO only. Reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (28Burk O. Tegude H. Koch I. Hustert E. Wolbold R. Glaeser H. Klein K. Fromm M.F. Nuessler A.K. Neuhaus P. Zanger U.M. Eichelbaum M.

To identify statistically significant differences, one-way analysis of variance was performed with mean values of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate using GraphPAD InStat version 3.05 for Windows 95. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The human PXR, CAR, and RXRα proteins were synthesized using the appropriate expression plasmids and the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (27Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for the CYP3A5 wild-type and mutated ER6 motifs were as follows: ER6 wild-type sense, 5′-GAT CCG AAC ATG AAC TCA AAA GAG GTC AGC AAA-3′; ER6 wild-type antisense, 5′-GAT CTT TGC TGA CCT CTT TTG AGT TCA TGT TCG-3′; ER6-mutated sense, 5′-GAT CCG AAC ATGTTC TCA AAA GAGAAC AGC AAA-3′; and ER6-mutated antisense, 5′-GAT CTT TGC TGTTCT CTT TTG AGAACA TGT TCG-3′. Half-sites of ER6 are shown in bold, and mutated bases are in italics and underlined. Retarded complexes were quantified with the BAS1800 II phosphor-storage scanner (Fuji) and AIDA software (Raytest). Hepatocytes from a total of 18 donors (10 GH and eight HH series) were used in this study. The expression of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 prior to culturing was investigated in five livers of the GH series (all CYP3A5*3 homozygotes). On average, CYP3A5 transcripts (3829 ± 3541/ng of total RNA (range of 812–9754)) accounted for 5.9 ± 0.06% of CYP3A4 transcripts (228,176 ± 307,507/ng of total RNA (range of 27,847–841,279)). After 24 h of culture in 5% fetal calf serum, hepatocytes were serumstarved for 48 h. Subsequently, the hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h in the same serum-free medium in the presence of an inducer or solvent only. A comparison of the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expression levels in solvent-treated hepatocytes with those prior to culturing revealed a differential effect of culturing on the expression of these genes. Although the expression of CYP3A5 dropped only in hepatocytes from one liver (GH4, 4-fold), the decrease in CYP3A4 expression was observed in all five livers, and it was much more pronounced (3418 ± 3552-fold (range of 479–8803-fold). Consequently, cell culturing led to a reversal of the initial expression ratio, with CYP3A4 accounting for less than 2% of CYP3A5 transcripts. The spectra of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 inducers were similar in that induction of either gene was observed with phenobarbital, mifepristone, clotrimazole, omeprazole, and rifampin. Although hepatocytes from subject GH9 exhibited induction of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 by the aforementioned compounds, enhanced expression of these P450s was not observed with 2–25 μm 3-methylcholanthrene or 2–50 μm β-naphthoflavone. The extent of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 induction among the GH hepatocyte samples was liver- and drug-specific. For example, when compared with other samples, hepatocytes from liver GH12 exhibited the greatest CYP3A5 induction following treatment with phenobarbital, mifepristone, clotrimazole, and omeprazole. However, rifampin produced a negligible affect on CYP3A5 expression in these same hepatocytes (Fig. 1). Conversely, CYP3A4 expression in hepatocytes from livers GH6 and GH8 was only weakly increased by drugs examined here. The strongest inducer of either gene in hepatocytes from GH livers was 1 mm phenobarbital (12.1 ± 9.5-fold for CYP3A5 and 262 ± 345-fold for CYP3A4; see Fig. 1 for induction values from individual livers), and the weakest was 10 μm mifepristone (3.0 ± 1.7-fold for CYP3A5 and 52 ± 99-fold for CYP3A4). Clotrimazole (100 μm) and 10 μm rifampin produced intermediate increases in CYP3A4 (126 ± 150-fold and 195 ± 263-fold, respectively) and CYP3A5 (10.9 ± 9.1-fold and 3.3 ± 1.7-fold, respectively). There was a statistically significant correlation between enhancement of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 among the livers following treatment with 10 μm rifampin (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Liver GH3 was heterozygous for the CYP3A5*1 allele. Hepatocytes from this liver had the highest levels of CYP3A5 transcripts in comparison with all other GH livers both prior to (32,129 versus 5215 ± 4466) and following (88,000 versus 17,218 ± 17,248) treatment with 10 μm rifampin. We identified one additional CYP3A5*1 carrier among rifampicin-treated hepatocytes derived from eight livers of the HH series. In the HH hepatocytes, rifampin-mediated CYP3A4 induction was less than in GH hepatocytes (on average 63-fold and 195-fold, respectively), most likely because of differences in cell preparation and culturing. CYP3A5 transcripts in the HH hepatocytes were induced by rifampicin more than 1.5-fold in six of eight livers (mean, 3.7 ± 4.0-fold). The highest increase in CYP3A5 transcripts (12-fold) was observed in hepatocytes from the heterozygous CYP3A5*1 liver (HH997). Because cell culturing may influence the -fold increase in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 by differentially influencing basal expression levels, we investigated the induction of these genes in vivo. Biopsies of the duodenum were taken from eight healthy probands prior to and following 9 days of treatment with rifampin (600 mg/day). Genotyping revealed that proband number 6 was a heterozygous CYP3A5*1 allele carrier, whereas the other seven probands were CYP3A5*3 homozygotes. CYP3A5 transcripts were detected in all biopsies (Fig. 2), and as expected, the seven samples homozygous for CYP3A5*3 expressed the lowest levels of CYP3A5 mRNA with a mean of 1550 transcripts/ng of total RNA (range of 670–3500). In contrast, the sole CYP3A5*1 carrier (proband number 6) expressed 5750 transcripts/ng of total RNA. Following treatment with rifampin, three probands (numbers 6, 7, and 8) exhibited greater than a 2-fold enhancement of CYP3A5 mRNA expression. The highest transcript level following rifampin treatment (37,000/ng of total RNA) was again measured in the proband heterozygous for CYP3A5*1 (number 6) corresponding to a 6.4-fold increase in CYP3A5 transcript levels. The –fold induction of CYP3A5 was even higher in the CYP3A5*3-homozygous proband number 7 (9.7-fold), but the absolute transcript level was much lower (6500/ng of total RNA). Probands 6 and 7 as well as proband 2 also exhibited the highest increases in the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA (3.7-, 6.6-, and 7.9-fold, respectively) when compared with the remaining proband samples. The increase in the CYP3A4 mRNA expression in the other five probands was between 1-fold (no induction) and 4.2-fold (data not shown). The similarities in inductive response between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 suggested the involvement of the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR in CYP3A5 expression. These nuclear receptors mediate P450 expression by binding to specific motifs in the 5′-upstream regulatory regions of target genes. Inspection of the CYP3A5 5′-upstream region revealed the presence of a putative PXR/CAR binding site of the ER6 type around the position –100 bp from the transcription start site (29Burk O. Wojnowski L. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With respect to the sequence and position, this motif is identical to the proximal ER6 motif of CYP3A4, for which binding of PXR and CAR has been demonstrated. An enhancer element homologous to the xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module (XREM) of CYP3A4 is absent from the CYP3A5 promoter (29Burk O. Wojnowski L. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine the role of PXR in the inducibility of CYP3A4, we first investigated the binding of PXR and CAR to the ER6 motif of CYP3A5 in vitro. Fig. 3A demonstrates that PXR and CAR both bound to the ER6 motif of CYP3A5 as heterodimers with RXRα. In contrast, neither nuclear receptor bound to a mutated ER6 element (Fig. 3A). Competition gel shift experiments further demonstrated the specificity of binding; the wild-type ER6 element was able to compete for binding, and the mutated element had no effect on nuclear receptor binding to the CYP3A5 element (Fig. 3). Thus, the ER6 motif in the CYP3A5 promoter proved to be a true PXR/CAR binding site. In subsequent experiments we determined whether the identified ER6 PXR/CAR binding site of CYP3A5 mediated enhanced activation of the CYP3A5 promoter by these nuclear receptors. LS174T cells were transiently transfected with PXR or CAR expression plasmids and luciferase reporter gene plasmids under the control of either the CYP3A5 promoter or the corresponding region of the CYP3A4 promoter takes for comparison. Activation of endogenous PXR in LS174T cells by treatment with rifampin induced CYP3A5 promoter activity 1.6-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Co-transfection of PXR stimulated the CYP3A5 promoter 1.9-fold (p < 0.01), thereby demonstrating basal activity of PXR. Treatment of PXR-transfected cells with rifampin resulted in a further increase in CYP3A5 promoter activity by 2.1-fold (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4). Mutation of the ER6 PXR binding site in the CYP3A5 promoter abolished PXR-dependent induction by rifampin. Co-transfection of CAR resulted in a 3.1-fold (p < 0.05) activation of CYP3A5 promoter activity, which was only slightly enhanced by the human CAR-specific agonist CITCO. Again, activation by CAR was dependent on a functional ER6 motif (Fig. 4). Because we confirmed that mutation of the ER6 motif totally abolished binding of PXR and CAR (see Fig. 3), nuclear receptors PXR and CAR clearly activated the CYP3A5 promoter via the ER6 motif. For comparison, we also analyzed induction/activation of a homologous region of the CYP3A4 promoter by PXR and CAR. The CYP3A4 construct was activated 2–3-fold greater than CYP3A5 by CAR and PXR. Similarly, induction by rifampin was ∼2-fold stronger. As with CYP3A5, treatment with CITCO only weakly enhanced the activation of CYP3A4 by CAR (1.3-fold, p < 0.05). Finally, we investigated the expression of PXR and CYP3A5 mRNA species in a bank of liver samples. The expression of CYP3A5 in these samples had been reported previously (20Koch I. Weil R. Wolbold R. Brockmoller J. Hustert E. Burk O. Nuessler A. Neuhaus P. Eichelbaum M. Zanger U. Wojnowski L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and it was on average 5100 transcripts/ng of total RNA (range between 2000 and 11,000 copies) for *3/*3 livers and 41,200 transcripts (range of 21,500–62,600 transcripts/ng of RNA) in *1/*3 livers. The PXR expression was on average 11,454 transcripts/ng of total RNA and varied 10-fold within the sample set (range of 2283–23,331 transcripts/ng of total RNA). Without consideration of the CYP3A5*1 allele status, there was a weak (r = 0.22), albeit statistically significant (p < 0.05, n = 64), correlation between the PXR and CYP3A5 mRNA expression levels. The correlation coefficients increased upon inclusion of the CYP3A5*1 allele status, and they were 0.61 for *3/*3 livers (p < 0.001, n = 56) and 0.4 for *1/*3 livers (p < 0.16, n = 8) (Fig. 5)"

https://openalex.org/W2006309936,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) synthesizes the deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. The R2 protein of normal class I ribonucleotide reductases contains a diiron site that produces a stable tyrosyl free radical, essential for enzymatic activity. Structural and electron paramagnetic resonance studies of R2 from Chlamydia trachomatis reveal a protein lacking a tyrosyl radical site. Instead, the protein yields an iron-coupled radical upon reconstitution. The coordinating structure of the diiron site is similar to that of diiron oxidases/monoxygenases and supports a role for this radical in the RNR mechanism. The specific ligand pattern in the C. trachomatis R2 metal site characterizes a new group of R2 proteins that so far has been found in eight organisms, three of which are human pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2028075573,"We cloned an aquaporin gene from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcAQP) that encodes a protein of 231 amino acids, which is highly hydrophobic. The protein has six putative transmembrane domains and the two signature motifs asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) which have been shown, in other aquaporins, to be involved in the formation of an aqueous channel spanning the bilayer. TcAQP was sensitive to endo H treatment, suggesting that the protein is N-glycosylated. Oocytes of Xenopus laevis expressing TcAQP swelled under hyposmotic conditions indicating water permeability, which was abolished after preincubating oocytes with very low concentrations of the AQP inhibitors HgCl2 and AgNO3. glycerol transport was detected. No Immunofluorescence microscopy of T. cruzi expressing GFP-TcAQP showed co-localization of TcAQP with the vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase), a marker of acidocalcisomes. This localization was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining using polyclonal antibodies against a C-terminal peptide of TcAQP. In addition, there was a strong anterior labeling in a vacuole, close to the flagellar pocket, that was distinct from the acidocalcisomes and that was identified by immunogold electron microscopy as the contractile vacuole complex. Taking together, the presence of an aquaporin in acidocalcisomes and the contractile vacuole complex of T. cruzi, provides support for the role of these organelles in osmotic adaptations of these parasites."

The plasma membrane changes its structure dynamically in response to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli that alter cell shape. Membrane extension, including the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, is controlled by the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, respectively (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 are involved in forming membrane protrusions essential for phagocytosis and macropinocytosis (2Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar), whereas another GTPase, dynamin, has been implicated in producing membrane invaginations and vesicles from the plasma membrane (3Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Dynamin is a multidomain GTPase; it consists of a GTPase domain followed by a central domain lacking homology to any other proteins, a pleckstrin homology domain, an effector domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich motif (4Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar).

Formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) consists of an N-terminal Fer/Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) homology (FCH) domain followed by the first coiled-coil domain, a proline-rich motif, the second coiled-coil domain, a Rho family protein-binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal SH3 domain. FBP17 was originally isolated as a molecule that binds to the proline-rich region of formin (12Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). FBP17 is fused to mixed-lineage leukemia in acute myeloid leukemia (13Fuchs U. Rehkamp G. Haas O.A. Slany R. Konig M. Bojesen S. Bohle R.M. Damm-Welk C. Ludwig W.D. Harbott J. Borkhardt A. Proc.

Based on domain structure, it is evident that FBP17 is closely related to CIP4.

Rapostlin has been identified as an effector that binds to the Rho family GTPase Rnd2 (15Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rapostlin shares 93% amino acid identity with FBP17, indicating that FBP17 is likely to be an ortholog of Rapostlin. Like CIP4, Rapostlin partially localizes to microtubules via its N-terminal FCH domain (15Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the FCH domain is thought to be a microtubule-targeting domain (16Greer P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we have previously shown that the FCH domain of Fer tyrosine kinase is not required for localization of Fer to microtubules (17Kogata N. Masuda M. Kamioka Y. Yamagishi A. Endo A. Okada M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3553-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the dynamin-associating molecule PACSIN/syndapin, which contains an N-terminal FCH domain, does not localize to microtubules (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since both FBP17 and PACSIN contain an N-terminal FCH domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain, it seems probable that FBP17 is also involved in dynamin-regulated endocytosis. In this study, we demonstrate that FBP17 induces the plasma membrane to form tubular structures and that FBP17 associates with a C-terminal proline-rich motif of dynamin. Transferrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) are taken up along with FBP17-induced tubules in COS-1 cells expressing FBP17, suggesting that FBP17 is involved in dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Plasmids—Full-length FBP17 and PACSIN-1 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech). PCR-amplified DNAs encoding FBP17 and its truncated mutants FBP17-N1 (amino acids 1-250), FBP17-N2 (amino acids 1-377), FBP17-C1 (amino acids 291-616), FBP17-dFCH (amino acids 80-616) were inserted into pCA-EGFP, a protein expression vector tagged at its N terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and derived from vector pCAGGS (19Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding a modified form of FBP17 referred to as FBP17-P597L, in which Leu is substituted for Pro597 in the SH3 domain, was amplified by PCR-based mutagenesis and ligated into pCA-EGFP. Full-length PACSIN-1 cDNA was likewise inserted into pCA-EGFP. pCXN2-FLAG-FBP17-N2 is derived from pCAGGS and expresses N-terminally FLAG-tagged FBP17-N2. A cDNA encoding the SH3 motif of FBP17 (amino acids 534-616) and a cDNA encoding a nonfunctional SH3 domain (P597L) of FBP17 were amplified by PCR and ligated into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Full-length dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 cDNAs were obtained by PCR from a human heart cDNA library and ligated into pCA-EGFP and pCXN2-FLAG. Full-length dynamin-3 cDNA was amplified by PCR using KIAA0820 (a kind gift from Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) as a template and ligated into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). cDNA encoding a GTPase-deficient mutant of dynamin-1 with Ala substituted for Lys44 (K44A) was amplified by PCR-based mutagenesis and ligated into pERed-NLS. pERed-NLS-dynamin-1-K44A expresses both FLAG-tagged dynamin-1-K44A and internal ribosomal entry signal-driven DsRed-Express fused with a nuclear localization signal (Clontech). pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing nucleotides 809-1851 of FBP17 was used to produce both antisense and sense riboprobes for in situ hybridization. All of the DNA fragments amplified by PCR were ligated into the pCR4blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing with an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 3700 sequencer. Reagents and Antibodies—DiIC16(3), Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin, Texas Red-conjugated EGF, Alexa 555-conjugated CTB, Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-β-tubulin antibody, anti-vimentin antibody, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and anti-FLAG antibody M2 were from Sigma. Anti-KDEL antibody was from Stressgen Biotech Corp. Anti-dynamin-2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-Sepharose, protein G-Sepharose, and glutathione-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences. The digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe synthesis kit and the random-primed DNA labeling kit were from Roche Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland). [α-32P]dCTP (EasyTides™) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was developed in our laboratory, and anti-FBP17 antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptide (CAQDRESPDGSYTEEQSQES) corresponding to amino acids 506-525 of FBP17. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells (a gift from B. J. Meyer, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT) and COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell Membrane Staining—COS-1 cells cultured on glass-bottom dishes were washed three times with DMEM without phenol red, incubated with DMEM containing 10 μg/ml DiIC16(3) for 10 min, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and examined by confocal fluorescence imaging. Transferrin, EGF, and CTB Uptake—COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-FBP17 were serum-starved in DMEM for 1 h and incubated with 25 μg/ml Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin for 20 min at either 37 °C or 4 °C and with 1 ng/ml Texas Red-conjugated EGF or 1 μg/ml Alexa 555-conjugated CTB at 37 °C. After rinsing three times with PBS and reducing surface labeling using 50 mm deferoxamine mesylate-containing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, pH 4.5), the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS and subjected to fluorescence imaging. Images of fluorescence-conjugated transferrin, EGF, or CTB were obtained with an Olympus IX-71 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled camera (CoolSNAP-HQ, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (17Kogata N. Masuda M. Kamioka Y. Yamagishi A. Endo A. Okada M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3553-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were washed with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Pre-cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies as indicated together with protein A- or G-Sepharose. Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated. Proteins that reacted with the primary antibody recognized by the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and that were species-matched were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and a LAS-1000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Tissues from BALB/c mice were rinsed with PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and bromphenol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FBP17 antibody. Immunohistochemistry and Electron Microcopy—Human testis fixed with Bouin's solution and embedded in paraffin was sectioned, deparaffinized, and immunostained with anti-FBP17 antibody. Immunoreactivity detected by the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was visualized with 1 mg/ml diaminobenzidine. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. For electron microscopy, COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-FBP17 were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and postfixed in 1% OsO4 followed by embedding in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections on nickel grids were immersed in target retrieval solution (DakoCytomation, Kyoto, Japan). After washing with distilled water and drying, sections were stained with both uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope. Northern Blot Analysis and in Situ Hybridization—A multiple-tissue Northern blot membrane (Human Brain II, Clontech) was prehybridized, followed by high stringency hybridization with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled FBP17 probe and washing with buffer containing appropriate concentrations of SSC and SDS. RNA hybridized with the radiolabeled probe was detected with a BAS-5000 imaging system (Fuji Film). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (20Ohnishi J. Ohnishi E. Jin M. Hirano W. Nakane D. Matsui H. Kimura A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Shibuya H. Nagashima K. Takahashi T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 747-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse testis and human brain were embedded in Tissue-Tec OCT compound and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, prehybridized, and hybridized overnight at 72 °C with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 500 μg/ml tRNA). The sections were washed with 0.2× SSC and incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody. The signal was visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution containing 0.24 mg/ml levamisole. Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Imaging—Cells cultured on glass-bottom dishes and transfected with pCA-EGFP-FBP17 for 24 h were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. For anti-vimentin antibody immunostaining, cells were fixed with methanol. The permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-β-tubulin, anti-KDEL, or anti-vimentin antibody followed by Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG to visualize tubulin, the endoplasmic reticulum, and vimentin. Actin was visualized with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Fluorescent images of EGFP and of Alexa 546 or rhodamine were obtained with an Olympus BX50EI confocal microscope controlled by Fluoview (Olympus, Tokyo) as described previously (21Nagashima K. Endo A. Ogita H. Kawana A. Yamagishi A. Kitabatake A. Matsuda M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4231-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Time-lapse fluorescence imaging was performed as described previously (21Nagashima K. Endo A. Ogita H. Kawana A. Yamagishi A. Kitabatake A. Matsuda M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4231-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-FBP17 were cultured on a collagen-coated glass-bottom dish in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES without phenol red. The cells were imaged using an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp equipped with a CoolSNAP-HQ cooled charge-coupled camera and two shutters, controlled by MetaMorph Version 5.0 software (Roper Scientific). To localize EGFP-tagged proteins, we obtained a fluorescent image every 20 s. Time-lapse images were converted to video format with MetaMorph Version 5.0 software. Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of Dynamin-1-K44A on Internalization of FBP17-induced Tubules—To examine the effect of dynamin-1-K44A on FBP17-induced tubule formation, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with either pCA-EGFP-FBP17 or pCA-EGFP-FBP17-P597L and pERed-NLS-dynamin-1-K44A. Both EGFP images and DsRed images were obtained using an Olympus IX-71 epifluorescence microscope. EGFP intensity, which reflects the intracellular accumulation of all tubular invaginations that were not processed in the endocytic pathway, was calculated by measuring the total intensity of the cell divided by the total cell area using MetaMorph Version 5.0 software. Data obtained from 50 cells were averaged, and statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test. FBP17 Forms Tubular Invaginations in Living Cells—FBP17 has an N-terminal FCH domain. It has been suggested that this domain is a microtubule-targeting domain (16Greer P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Indeed, a previous study revealed that Rapostlin, a rat ortholog of human FBP17, partially localizes to microtubules (15Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the localization of EGFP-tagged FBP17 in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1A) and found that it was located in cylindrical fiber structures of the cytoplasm. It was not present in the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin stress fibers, and intermediate filaments, or in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). When FLAG-tagged FBP17 was expressed in the cells, similar cylindrical fiber-like immunostaining was observed in the cytoplasm (Supplemental Fig. 2B). We examined whether the cylindrical fiber structures are tubes. COS-1 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing EGFP-FBP17 were examined with an electron microscope. The open ends and the blind ends of the tubular structures induced by FBP17 were in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, respectively (Fig. 1B). To examine how cylindrical fiber-like structure developed in the living cells, we monitored EGFP-FBP17 in COS-1 cells by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The fibers arose from the cell periphery, grew toward the center of the cell, and sometimes contracted back toward the periphery (Fig. 1C and Supplemental Video 1). We further noticed that some EGFP-FBP17-marked tubules were internalized instead of being contracted (Fig. 1D and Supplemental Video 2). The GFP-expressing plasmid used as a negative control did not induce any tubule formation. These results indicate that FBP17 induces tubular plasma membrane invaginations. FBP17 Is Expressed in the Brain and Testis—We developed an anti-FBP17 antibody and examined the expression of FBP17 in human and mouse organs and tissues. Immunoblot analysis revealed that FBP17 was expressed in mouse testis and brain (Fig. 2A). We then examined the localization of FBP17 in the seminiferous tubules of human testis by immunohistochemistry. Germ cells were immunoreactive to anti-FBP17 antibody, whereas Sertoli's cells were negative. Of the germ cells, the secondary spermatocytes in the inner layer of the tubules exhibited strong immunoreactivity, whereas spermatogonia in the outermost layer and spermatozoa in the innermost layer showed no immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the expression of FBP17 is correlated with the maturation of germ cells. More detailed examination of the maturation stages revealed that germ cells, from secondary spermatocytes to elongated spermatids, were immunoreactive. 2Y. Kamioka, H. Sawa, and N. Mochizuki, unpublished data. We next asked whether FBP17 is expressed in the brain. Expression was examined by both Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. FBP17 mRNA was detected as a transcript of ∼6.0 kb in all regions of the human brain (Fig. 2C). It was also detected in situ in mouse testis and in the cortex of the cerebrum and in the granular layer of the cerebellum of human brain (Fig. 2D). FBP17-induced Invagination Originating from the Plasma Membrane—To examine whether FBP17-induced tubules are continuous with the plasma membrane, we used DiIC16(3). DiIC16(3) is a lipophilic fluorescent probe used for plasma membrane staining (22Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-tagged FBP17 were stained for DiIC16(3) and imaged for fluorescence (Fig. 3). EGFP-FBP17 expression and DiIC16(3) staining overlapped, supporting the idea that FBP17-generated tubules arise from the plasma membrane. The C-terminal SH3 Domain Is Not Required for FBP17-induced Tubular Invagination—To investigate the mechanism by which tubular invagination is induced by FBP17, we constructed a series of deletion or point mutants of EGFP-tagged FBP17 (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that the EGFP-tagged mutants were correctly constructed, as they had the expected molecular mass in immunoblots probed with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B). Full-length FBP17 and an SH3 domain mutant (FBP17-P597L) formed tubular structures (Fig. 4C), as did a derivative (FBP17-N2) with a deletion of the second coiled-coil region, the RBD, and the SH3 domain. In contrast, removal of the FCH domain in FBP17-dFCH or of both the FCH domain and the first coiled-coil domain in FBP17-C1 abolished tube formation. In addition, FBP17-N1, a derivative containing only the FCH domain and the first coiled-coil domain, was incapable of inducing tube formation. These results indicate that the FCH domain, the first coiled-coil domain, and the proline-rich region are essential for FBP17-induced tube formation. We also tested whether PACSIN-1, a molecule structurally related to FBP17, forms tubules like FBP17. Although PACSIN-1, like FBP17, contains an FCH domain followed by a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain, it did not generate tubular structure, in agreement with a previous report (23Wasiak S. Quinn C.C. Ritter B. de Heuvel E. Baranes D. Plomann M. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26622-26628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the self-assembly might contribute to the tube formation by FBP17. To test for self-assembly of FBP17, we expressed EGFP-tagged FBP17 and FLAG-tagged FBP17-N2 in 293T cells and examined their possible association by immunoprecipitation. Both EGFP-tagged full-length FBP17 and EGFP-tagged FBP17-N2 were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged FBP17-N2 (Fig. 4D, second and fourth lanes), whereas EGFP-tagged FBP17-N1, FBP17-C1, and FBP17-SH3 were not co-immunoprecipitated. These results indicate that the FCH domain followed by a coiled-coil domain and polyproline regions are required for self-assembly. FBP17 Associates with Dynamin via Its SH3 Domain—PACSIN-1 and its rat ortholog, syndapin, are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through an association with dynamin via their C-terminal SH3 domains (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We tested whether FBP17 associates with dynamin because FBP17 contains an SH3 domain in its C terminus like PACSIN. EGFP-tagged full-length FBP17 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged dynamin-1, as was PACSIN-1 (Fig. 5A). To examine whether the association of FBP17 with dynamin-1 depends on the SH3 domain, we used the derivative of FBP17 with a nonfunctional SH3 domain (FBP17-SH3-P597L) and FBP17-N2 lacking the SH3 domain. As expected, EGFP-tagged full-length FBP17 and FBP17-SH3 were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged dynamin-1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 5), whereas FBP17-N2 and FBP17-SH3-P597L were not (lanes 4 and 6), indicating that the association of FBP17 with dynamin-1 is dependent upon the SH3 domain of FBP17. Dynamin-2 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas dynamin-1 is expressed exclusively in neurons, and dynamin-3 is restricted to the testis, brain, and lung (5Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FBP17 is mostly expressed in the brain and testis (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we tested whether dynamin-2 and dynamin-3, in addition to dynamin-1, associate with FBP17 by pull-down assays using the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused SH3 domain of FBP17 (Supplemental Fig. 2A). EGFP-tagged dynamin-1, -2, and -3 bound to the GST-fused SH3 domain of FBP17 but not to GST alone or GST fused to the nonfunctional SH3 domain of FBP17 (FBP17-SH3-P597L). These results demonstrate that FBP17 associates with dynamin family proteins in an SH3 domain-dependent manner. FBP17 Co-localizes with Dynamin—We proceeded to examine the co-localization of FBP17 with dynamin in COS-1 cells. EGFP-FBP17 expressed in COS-1 cells co-localized with FLAG-tagged dynamin expressed in the same cells (Fig. 6, A-C), whereas an SH3 mutant incapable of associating with dynamin did not co-localize with dynamin (Fig. 6, D and E). Although dynamin-1 expressed alone in COS-1 cells exhibited a diffuse staining pattern (Fig. 6F), dynamin-1 coexpressed with FBP17 exhibited a tubular pattern (Fig. 6B), indicating that dynamin-1 co-localizes with FBP17. We further examined the co-localization of FBP17 with endogenous dynamin-2 in COS-1 cells. Endogenous dynamin-2 was detected as small dots using anti-dynamin-2 antibody (Fig. 6I), whereas it co-localized with FBP17 in COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-FBP17 (Fig. 6, G, H, and J-L). These results suggest that FBP17 may be involved in endocytic signaling via dynamin. Involvement of FBP17 in Dynamin-mediated Endocytosis—To assess the consequence of the association of FBP17 with dynamin, we compared the localization of the molecules processed in the endocytic pathways with that of FBP17. Transferrin and EGF are endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner. Alexa 546-labeled transferrin was internalized along with FBP17 in COS-1 cells expressing FBP17 at 37 °C (Fig. 7A), whereas it was taken up as vesicles in parental COS-1 cells (Fig. 7D). We further examined whether the transferrin distribution follows the endocytic pathway. Whereas transferrin was observed as internalized vesicles near the nucleus at 37 °C (Fig. 7D), it was not when incubated at 4 °C (Fig. 8A). Although COS-1 cells expressing FBP17 exhibited the tubular structure, transferrin was not observed along these tubules at 4 °C (Fig. 8, B and C). These results suggest that FBP17-induced tubules involve transferrin uptake in an endocytosis-dependent manner. Similarly, Texas Red-labeled EGF was found at the tubular structure in COS-1 cells expressing FBP17, although EGF was found in a vesicular pattern in parental COS-1 cells (Fig. 7, B and E). CTB has been used as a marker for caveolae-mediated endocytosis (25Parton R.G. Richards A.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Caveolin-mediated endocytosis is dependent upon dynamin (2Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the involvement of FBP17 in caveolin-mediated internalization of CTB in COS-1 cells expressing FBP17. Internalized CTB localized to FBP17-marked tubules, whereas CTB internalized in parental cells exhibited a vesicular pattern (Fig. 7, C and F). These data suggest that FBP17 is involved in dynamin-mediated endocytosis in both a clathrin-dependent and -independent manner.Fig. 8Transferrin uptake is mediated by endocytosis in COS-1 cells expressing FBP17. COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-tagged FBP17 were incubated with Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin at 4 °C instead of 37 °C. A, parental COS-1 cells were incubated with Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin at 4 °C and imaged as described in the legend to Fig. 7. Note that there was no vesicular uptake of transferrin at 4 °C, in contrast to 37 °C. Bar = 10 μm. B, COS-1 cells expressing FBP17 were imaged after incubation with Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin at 4 °C. The EGFP image (green) and the Alexa 546 image (red) are shown. Bar = 10 μm. C, the boxed area in B was enlarged. Note that transferrin did not co-localize with FBP17-induced tubules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Internalization of FBP17-induced Tubules Is Dependent upon Dynamin—Dynamin-1-K44A is a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin that is defective in GTP hydrolysis and GTP binding and therefore inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis and caveolin-mediated internalization (4Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We used this mutant to examine the mechanism by which dynamin is involved in the internalization of FBP17-induced tubes. The FBP17-induced tubular structure was internalized (Fig. 1D) and co-localized with dynamin (Fig. 6). Hence, we hypothesized that dynamin-1-K44A perturbs the internalization of the tubular structure. The EGFP intensity of COS-1 cells expressing both EGFP-FBP17 and dynamin-1-K44A was compared with that of COS-1 cells expressing only EGFP-FBP17. COS-1 cells expressing both FBP17 and dynamin-1-K44A were distinguished from those expressing only EGFP-FBP17 by internal ribosomal entry signal-driven red fluorescence in the nucleus. The cells expressing both FBP17 and dynamin-1-K44A were brighter than those expressing only FBP17 (Fig. 9A). The quantitative results are shown in Fig. 9B. Consistently, cells expressing EGFP-FBP17-P597L, which were incapable of associating with dynamin but capable of inducing tubules, were brighter than those expressing wild-type FBP17 (Fig. 9B), suggesting the involvement of endogenous dynamin-2 present in COS-1 cells. These results indicate that the internalization of FBP17-induced tubules is mediated by dynamin. We have demonstrated that FBP17 forms tubular invaginations when expressed in cultured cells. Although Rapostlin, a rat ortholog of human FBP17, partially localizes to microtubules when expressed in HeLa cells (15Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), FBP17 did not localize to any components of the cytoskeleton such as microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin fibers (Supplementary Fig. 1). FBP17-induced tubules originated from the plasma membrane and grew toward the cytoplasm, suggesting that FBP17 is involved in endocytosis. FBP17 associates with dynamin in an SH3 domain-dependent manner. Among dynamin-associating molecules, PACSIN/syndapin, like FBP17, has an N-terminal FCH domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). FBP17 containing a nonfunctional SH3 domain did not associate with dynamin, indicating that the association between FBP17 and dynamin depends on the interaction between the SH3 domain of FBP17 and the proline-rich motif of dynamin. Consistently, dynamin co-localized with the FBP17-induced tubular structure (Fig. 6). Our data are in agreement with results showing that dynamin localizes to the tubular structure formed by muscle amphiphysin-2 (M-amphiphysin-2) (26Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). FBP17-induced tubular invagination is strongly reminiscent of that generated by an isoform of amphiphysin, M-amphiphysin-2. GFP-tagged M-amphiphysin-2 induces massive tubulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells (26Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). There are common characteristics between M-amphiphysin-2 and FBP17. First, it is noteworthy that the SH3 domain in the C termini of both M-amphiphysin-2 and FBP17 are dispensable for tubulation (Fig. 4C). The BAR domain (Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs) of M-amphiphysin-2 is probably responsible for membrane targeting via membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphates and tubule formation (26Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 27Zhang B. Zelhof A.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Thus, the FCH domain of FBP17, like the BAR domain, may function as a membrane-targeting domain and also a plasma membrane-deforming domain. Second, the N termini of amphiphysin-2 and FBP17 are also essential for dimerization (29Ramjaun A.R. Philie J. de Heuvel E. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19785-19791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that the N terminus of FBP17 consisting of the FCH domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a proline-rich region was required for self-assembly to form tubular structures. Third, both FBP17 and M-amphiphysin-2 co-localize with dynamin in cultured cells. These results prompted us to examine the involvement of FBP17 in endocytosis since amphiphysin participates in endocytosis. The various SH3 domain-binding partners of dynamin affect vesiculation differently during endocytosis, which depends upon the pinch-off effect of dynamin when it hydrolyzes GTP (3Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 30Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that FBP17 associated and co-localized with dynamin and that FBP17 involved dynamin-mediated transferrin and EGF endocytosis (Fig. 7). In addition, the internalization of FBP17-induced tubules was regulated by dynamin (Fig. 9). These results are consistent with the observation that amphiphysin-dynamin interaction enhances dynamin-mediated endocytosis in a clathrin-dependent manner (28Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast, all PACSIN isoforms block clathrin-mediated transferrin endocytosis (18Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and endophilin perturbs dynamin-mediated vesiculation (31Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, dynamin-binding proteins such as syndapin, amphiphysin-2, endophilin, and intersectin appear to be involved at distinct stages of clathrin-mediated vesicle formation (32Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Accordingly, FBP17 may participate in the recruitment of dynamin, and the recruited dynamin may then pinch off the tubules or vesicles induced by FBP17 in vivo. Given that FBP17 was expressed in the testis (Fig. 2) and that dynamin-2 and dynamin-3 are expressed in the testis (7Kamitani A. Yamada H. Kinuta M. Watanabe M. Li S.A. Matsukawa T. McNiven M. Kumon H. Takei K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the association of FBP17 with dynamins in the testis is likely to be involved in spermatogenesis. The expression of Rnd2, which belongs to the Rho family of GTPases and is an RBD partner of Rapostlin, an ortholog of FBP17, is restricted to germ cells at the spermatocyte and spermatid stages (33Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 34Naud N. Toure A. Liu J. Pineau C. Morin L. Dorseuil O. Escalier D. Chardin P. Gacon G. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of FBP17 determined by immunohistochemistry paralleled Rnd2 expression in germ cells. Hence, the Rnd2-FBP17-dynamin complex may be involved in endocytosis required for sperm maturation in the testis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that FBP17 forms membrane invaginations originating from the plasma membrane and that FBP17 is likely to be involved in dynamin-dependent endocytosis.

Here, we report the crystal structure of the Fpg protein from Lactococcus lactis (LlFpg) bound to a carbocyclic FapydG (cFapydG)-containing DNA. The structure reveals that Fpg stabilizes the cFapydG nucleoside into an extrahelical conformation inside its substrate binding pocket. In contrast to the recognition of the 8-oxodG lesion, which is bound with the glycosidic bond in a syn conformation, the cFapydG lesion displays in the complex an anti conformation. Furthermore, Fpg establishes interactions with all the functional groups of the FapyG base lesion, which can be classified in two categories: (i) those specifying a purine-derived lesion (here a guanine) involved in the Watson-Crick face recognition of the lesion and probably contributing to an optimal orientation of the pyrimidine ring moiety in the binding pocket and (ii) those specifying the imidazole ring-opened moiety of FapyG and probably participating also in the rotameric selection of the FapydG nucleobase. These interactions involve strictly conserved Fpg residues and structural water molecules mediated interactions. The significant differences between the Fpg recognition modes of 8-oxodG and FapydG provide new insights into the Fpg substrate specificity.

The significant differences between the Fpg recognition modes of 8-oxodG and FapydG provide new insights into the Fpg substrate specificity. Reactive oxygen species generated in the cell during physiological processes or resulting from the cell exposure to exogenous chemical and physical agents can react with DNA to produce base lesions. The resulting DNA damages can interfere with both efficiency and fidelity of the DNA replication and transcription, thus participating in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and aging (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). Oxidation of guanine in DNA generates a plethora of oxidative bases lesions of which 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)1 and imidazole ring-opened purines (FapyG) are among the most abundant lesions (see Fig. 1) (2Cadet J.

Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). FapyG lesions are also generated in DNA as by-products of N7-alkylated purines (5Chetsanga C.J. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 3673-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Chetsanga C.J. Polidori G. Mainwaring M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2616-2621PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chetsanga C.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3079-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). 8-OxoG is a mutagenic DNA lesion because of alternative base-pairing possibility with dA, yielding G→T transversions in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells (10Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 11Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J.

The FapyG lesion is potentially lethal and mutagenic (14Tudek B. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 36: 12-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid the deleterious effects of oxidative DNA damage, prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved the mechanism of DNA base excision repair initiated by the DNA glycosylases (15Lindahl T. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 8-OxoG and FapyG residues are recognized and excised by the same DNA glycosylases, the bacterial formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg or MutM) and its eukaryote functional homologue, the Ogg1 proteins (5Chetsanga C.J.

A. 1997; 94: 8010-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N7-Me-FapyG lesion is also efficiently repaired by DNA glycosylases that exhibit low and even undetectable capacity to release 8-oxoG such as the yeast Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins (20Alseth I. Eide L. Pirovano M. Rognes T. Seeberg E. Bjoras M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3779-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fpg and Ogg1 proteins belong to the DNA glycosylases/abasic (AP) lyase family because they initiate the removal of the base lesions by a cleavage of the glycosidic bond between the damaged base and its associated sugar, which is followed by subsequent scission of the DNA backbone at the resulting AP site by a β-elimination (Ogg1) or a β,δ-elimination (Fpg) reaction (18van der Kemp P.A.

These enzymes use either the N-terminal amino group (Pro1 for Fpg) or the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine (Lys249 for the human Ogg1) to perform a nucleophilic attack on the C1′ of the damaged nucleoside leading to an imino enzyme-DNA covalent complex, which is now established to be a common reaction intermediate for the glycosylase and lyase activities (23Zharkov D.O.

Fpg has been characterized through biochemical, functional, and genomic sequencing studies and more recently by crystal structure analysis (16Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Laval J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Castaing B. Geiger A. Seliger H. Nehls P. Laval J. Zelwer C. Boiteux S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ability to study the recognition of damaged nucleotides by these enzymes at an atomic level became recently possible because of the progress of chemical synthesis, which now allows the design and synthesis of oligonucleotides containing defined lesions or even uncleavable lesion analogues at defined sites in DNA duplex (30Castaing B. Fourrey J.L. Hervouet N. Thomas M. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Schärer O.D. Jiricny J.

Four different bacterial Fpg proteins have been used for structural studies: TtFpg from Thermus thermophilus, LlFpg from Lactococcus lactis, EcFpg from Escherichia coli, and BstFpg from Bacillus stearothermophilus. In addition to the structure of the free TtFpg (29Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kuramitsu T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), two classes of Fpg/DNA complexes have been described: Fpg bound to AP sites (35Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G.

Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar) and Fpg bound to damaged bases such as 8-oxoG and dihydrouracil (DHU) (38Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51543-51548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These high resolution crystal structures allowed the depiction of the general strategy developed by Fpg to recognize and repair the damaged nucleoside. Fpg flips the recognized lesion out of the DNA helix through the major groove and stabilizes it in an extrahelical conformation inside the active site binding pocket. This nucleoside flipping out mechanism allows the exposure of the anomeric C1′-center of the damaged nucleoside (initially buried in DNA) to nucleophilic attack by the N-terminal Pro1 of the active site. The extrusion of the lesion is achieved by a strong torsion of DNA centered on the target site, which results from an intercalation in the minor groove of three conserved Fpg residues (Met75, Arg109, and Phe111 of LlFpg). The cytosine opposite the lesion is maintained by Arg109 in an intrahelical conformation preventing a local DNA collapse. In the present study, we report the crystallization and the structure determination at 1.8 Å resolution of a specific abortive complex between the L. lactis Fpg protein and a DNA double strand containing the synthetically stabilized carbocyclic FapydG (cFapydG) (34Ober M. Linne U. Gierlich J. Carell T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The synthetic stabilization of the lesion is essential because the lesion has a high tendency to anomerize and to decompose under DNA synthesis conditions, which compromises any attempts to prepare oligonucleotides containing this lesion with a purity as required for biomolecule crystallization. Our crystallization efforts with the stabilized lesions enabled us to obtain the first x-ray structure in which the Fapy lesion is observed in a complex with a DNA repair enzyme. Surprisingly, our structure reveals a FapyG recognition mode of Fpg quite different from that of 8-oxoG. DNA and Protein—The preparation of a single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the cFapydG residue has been described recently (34Ober M. Linne U. Gierlich J. Carell T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After purification, the modified oligonucleotide CTCTTT(cFapydG)TTTCTCG was annealed with the complementary strand GCGAGAAACAAAGA to form a 14-mer duplex. To obtain the ΔP1-LlFpg mutant protein, the deletion of Pro1 was achieved using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the pMAL-LP1G recombinant plasmid as DNA template (39Pereira de Jesus K. Serre L. Hervouet N. Bouckson-Castaing V. Zelwer C. Castaing B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmid pMAL-LDP1 is used to produce the ΔP1-LlFpg mutant. ΔP1-LlFpg is purified as described for P1G-LlFpg (35Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Apparent dissociation constants (Kd(app)) were determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay as described previously (30Castaing B. Fourrey J.L. Hervouet N. Thomas M. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—cFapydG:dC-containing 14-mer DNA duplex was mixed with ΔP1-LlFpg in 1.3 molar excess of DNA and adjusted to a final protein/DNA complex concentration of 2-5 mg/ml. Using the sparse-matrix crystallization screening kit (Hampton Research), crystallization was performed at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Under several crystallization conditions, crystals appeared within few days. Best crystallization conditions were found for drops containing a 1/1 (v/v) ratio of the protein/DNA complex and a solution of 0.1 m Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, 1.3-1.5 m sodium citrate equilibrated to the same solution. Crystals suitable for a complete x-ray diffraction study were soaked in a cryoprotecting solution and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Quantum ADSC-Q4 charge-coupled device detector at the ID14-EH2 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The diffraction patterns were processed with MOSFLM (40Leslie A.G. Brick P. Wonacott A.J. CCP4 Newsletter. 1996; 18: 33-39Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 package (41Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The phase problem was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe (42Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of the LlFpg-1,3-propanediol complex as a search model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1NNJ). A random sample of 5% of reflections in the data set were excluded from the refinement and used for Rfree calculation. The Dundee PRODRG2 server (43van Aalten D.M.F. Bywater R. Findlay J.B.C. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) was used to generate molecular topology files of the cFapydG nucleobase. In an attempt to avoid model bias, the initial model refinement was carried out using CNS (44Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

Several cycles of simulated annealing, energy minimization, B-factor refinement, and annealed omit map calculation were interspersed with manual rebuilding using TURBO-FRODO (45Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 86. Silicon Graphics Corp., Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). Then, the structure was further refined by the maximum-likelihood method using REFMAC 5 (46Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Water molecules were picked up from the automatic protocol of ARP/wARP (47Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) on the basis of the peak heights and distance criteria. During the last refinement steps, anisotropic B factor parameters were introduced for the zinc atom. The final refined model consists of 265 protein residues (electron density was not observed for the flexible loop comprised of residues 220-224), 28 nucleotide residues, 1 glycerol molecule, 1 zinc ion, and a total of 431 water molecules. 6 residues were refined in two alternate conformations, and 11 protein side chains were not completely modeled.

Open table in a new tab Accession Numbers—The atomic coordinates of the LlFpg/FapydGDNA complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 1TDZ. Crystals of a catalytic defective LlFpg mutant (ΔP1-LlFpg in which Pro1 has been deleted) bound to a cFapydG-containing 14-mer DNA duplex have been obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”). ΔP1-LlFpg binds to cFapydG-containing DNA with high affinity similar to that of wild type LlFpg (Kd(app) of 3 and 2.6 nm, respectively). The chemical modification present in the cFapydG lesion analogue (replacement of the 2′-deoxyribose sugar backbone by the cyclopentane skeleton) conserves all the functional groups and therefore the base-pairing properties of the natural FapydG lesion (34Ober M. Linne U. Gierlich J. Carell T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structure of ΔP1-LlFpg/cFapydG-DNA was solved by molecular replacement using as a search model the P1G-LlFpg/1,3-propanediol-DNA coordinates (Protein Data Bank accession number 1NNJ) and was refined to 1.8 Å resolution. The final model consists of one polypeptide chain including residues 2 to 219 and 225 to 271 (the residues 220 to 224 of the αF-β9 loop are missing in the electron density map of the final model), one 14-mer DNA duplex, 431 solvent atoms, one zinc atom, and one glycerol molecule per complex (Table I). The global structures of the DNA and the protein in the complex are identical to those of previous LlFpg/AP-DNA structures (the root mean square deviation calculated on all C-α protein atoms is 0.282 Å). The 14-mer DNA duplex adopts a bent structure centered on the damaged nucleoside (Fig. 2A). The DNA backbone at the target site is unchanged because the (-p-O-C5′-C4′-C3′-O-p-) skeleton of the cFapydG cyclopentane ring fits perfectly the one of the 1,3-propanediol AP site analogue (data not shown). An additional and defined electron density in the active site corresponds to the cFapydG nucleoside (Fig. 2B). The FapydG-binding Pocket—The cFapydG lesion is locked by the enzyme in an extra-helical conformation inside a large protein cavity in which 8-oxodG is also observed (38Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51543-51548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cFapydG nucleoside is stabilized in this pocket with the glycosidic bond in anti-conformation. It is now accepted that the base flipping mechanism is a common strategy used by DNA glycosylases to expose the C1′ of the initially buried damaged nucleoside to the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule (for monofunctional enzymes) or an enzyme reactive amino group (for bifunctional enzymes) (31Schärer O.D. Jiricny J. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Contrary to the relatively small, preformed, and rigid pocket of the human Ogg1, the Fpg binding pocket is defined by a very large cavity closed on one side by the DNA intercalated Fpg triad Arg109, Phe111, and Met75 (35Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which results in the isolation of the damaged nucleoside from the remainder DNA backbone, thus preventing its reinsertion into the DNA grooves (Fig. 3). The lesion binding pocket is on the other side enlarged and extends to the outer side of the protein by a wide opening accessible to water molecules (Fig. 3). The inner surface of the binding pocket surrounding the damaged nucleoside is formed by residues belonging to several domains of the protein: the helix αA and the β4-β5 loop of the N-terminal domain and the structured part of αF-β9 loop located between the H2TH motif and the zinc finger in the C-terminal domain of the enzyme (29Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kuramitsu T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 35Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The precise architecture of the binding pocket is believed to be modulated by the dynamic part of the αF-β9 (residues 220-224, a brown dashed line in Fig. 2A). As it has been already observed for AP sites and 8-oxodG, the cyclopentane skeleton of cFapydG mimicking the ribofuranoside is not directly contacted by the enzyme in the binding pocket. However, its conformation is driven by numerous interactions between protein residues and the DNA phosphodiester backbone of the damaged strand (35Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). Among these interactions, the most remarkable ones are those established by Arg260 (situated in the β9-β10 loop of the Fpg zinc finger) with the two phosphate groups bordering the lesion and Tyr238 and Lys57, which contact the phosphates at the 5′- and 3′-side of the damaged nucleoside, p0 and p-1, respectively (Fig. 4A). Arg260, Tyr238, and Lys57 cooperate to constrain the bent DNA structure at the target site. One of the π-faces of the heterocycle of cFapyG is partly covered by the side chain of Ile219 whereas the other π-face is exposed to water molecules restrained in the binding pocket (Fig. 4B). A similar situation is observed for Fpg bound to 8-oxodG (38Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51543-51548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For most DNA glycosylases, the extrahelical base binding pocket is designed both to be compatible with the shape of the damaged nucleoside and to allow the formation of specific hydrogen bonds between the various donor and acceptor groups of the damaged base and the enzyme (48Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11236-11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3442-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fpg uses H-bonds and van der Waals contacts to bind the base lesion. However, some DNA glycosylases such as AlkA and AAG are devoid of any hydrogen bonding but use exclusively π-π and π-cation interactions. In these enzymes, aromatic protein residues surrounding the cationic alkylated base are the key discriminatory elements (52Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, hOgg1 utilizes Phe319 and Cys253 to stack toward both π-faces of 8-oxoG, sandwiching the damaged base in the active site (53Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). To summarize, Fpg has selected H-bond interactions to achieve the specific recognition of cFapydG and 8-oxodG rather than a π-cation interaction strategy. Features of FapyG-specific Recognition—Several LlFpg residues cooperate to constrain cFapydG in the extrahelical base-binding pocket: Glu2 and Glu5 of the helix αA at the N terminus of the enzyme, Met75 and Glu76 of the β4-β5 loop, and Ser217, Ile219, and Tyr238 of the αF-β9 loop (Fig. 4). Except for Glu76, all of these residues are strictly conserved in the primary structure of the Fpg family (Fig. 5). Fpg recognizes the Watson-Crick face of FapyG through hydrogen-bonding contacts involving four residues: Glu2, Glu5, Ser217, and Ile219 (Fig. 4). Especially, the main chain amide of Ile219 recognizes the O6-carbonyl of FapyG, whereas the main chain carbonyl of Ser217 forms simultaneously hydrogen-bonds with both N1 and N2 of FapyG. The N2 of the damaged base is also hydrogen bonded by the carboxyl side chain of Glu5. Through two hydrogen interactions with a tightly bound water molecule (wat33 with B factor 22.43), the amide NH and the carboxyl O groups of the main chain and side chain of Glu2, respectively, cooperate with Ser217 and Glu5 to recognize N2 of FapyG (Fig. 4). Glu2 is also involved in the recognition of the N3 functional group of FapyG via wat33. This structural water molecule has been already observed in the binding pocket of LlFpg bound to the AP site (Protein Data Bank accession number 1NNJ) and in the borohydride-trapped complex of BstFpg covalently bound to the AP site (37Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar). From previous studies, Glu2 was shown to play a major role in DNA glycosylases activity (54Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and to interact with the C4′-OH of the furanose ring-opened deoxyribose of the imino enzyme-DNA intermediate, the common transition state of the glycosylase and lyase processes (37Fromme J.C.

We recently demonstrated that Rab1 is involved in the export of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) to the cell surface in HEK293 cells and that transgenic mice overexpressing Rab1 in the myocardium develop cardiac hypertrophy. To expand these studies, we determined in this report whether the modification of Rab1-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport can alter the cell surface expression and function of endogenous AT1R and AT1R-mediated hypertrophic growth in primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of wild-type Rab1 (Rab1WT) significantly increased cell surface expression of endogenous AT1R in neonatal cardiomyocytes, whereas the dominant-negative mutant Rab1N124I had the opposite effect. Brefeldin A treatment blocked the Rab1WT-induced increase in AT1R cell surface expression. Fluorescence analysis of the subcellular localization of AT1R revealed that Rab1 regulated AT1R transport specifically from the ER to the Golgi in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Consistent with their effects on AT1R export, Rab1WT and Rab1N124I differentially modified the AT1R-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and its upstream kinase MEK1. More importantly, adenovirus-mediated expression of Rab1N124I markedly attenuated the Ang II-stimulated hypertrophic growth as measured by protein synthesis, cell size, and sarcomeric organization in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In contrast, Rab1WT expression augmented the Ang II-mediated hypertrophic response. These data strongly indicate that AT1R function in cardiomyocytes can be modulated through manipulating AT1R traffic from the ER to the Golgi and provide the first evidence implicating the ER-to-Golgi transport as a regulatory site for control of cardiomyocyte growth.

Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 281-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two major subtypes of Ang II receptors, the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and both receptor subtypes belong to the seven transmembrane-spanning receptor superfamily coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (2Murphy T.J.

Res. 1998; 83: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, AT1R couples to the Gq protein to stimulate phospholipase C, leading to the formation of intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, the release of calcium from intracellular stores, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (4Touyz R.M.

A number of studies have demonstrated that AT1R activation induces hypertrophic growth in both cultured cardiomyocytes and animal hearts. In cultured cardiomyocytes, Ang II stimulation induces many characteristics of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy including increased expression of fetal genes, enhanced protein synthesis, enlargement of overall cell size, and sarcomeric organization (7Sadoshima J.

In transgenic animal models, increased AT1R expression in the myocardium is sufficient to initiate hypertrophic growth (11Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6391-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, AT1R antagonist treatment prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy in experimental animal models and in hypertensive patients (13De Rosa M.L. Cardace P. Rossi M. Baiano A. de Cristofaro A. J. Hum. Hypertens. 2002; 16: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of AT1R is a critical event in regulating its function. After being synthesized, folded, and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the AT1R is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) occur (14Lanctot P.M. Leclerc P.C. Escher E. Leduc R. Guillemette G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8621-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Then, it is transported to the plasma membrane. The AT1R at the plasma membrane undergoes internalization in the continuous presence of the agonist Ang II. The internalized AT1R may then be transported to the lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane (15Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12900-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol.

Therefore, the number of AT1Rs at the plasma membrane is determined by the overall balance of AT1R export to the cell surface, internalization, recycling, and degradation. Although most studies on AT1R trafficking have focused on the events involved in the internalization, recycling, and degradation (15Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Intracellular protein trafficking between organelles is coordinated by Rab proteins, the largest branch of the Ras-like small GTPases, consisting of 11 members in yeast and 63 members in mammalian cells (20Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 21Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although most of the Rab proteins identified so far are ubiquitous and highly conserved in their structure and function, each Rab protein has a distinct intracellular localization and regulates discrete protein transport steps in secretory and endocytic pathways. Among multiple Rab GTPases involved in the regulation of vesicular protein transport between intracellular organelles, Rab1 is one of the most extensively studied and best understood Rab GTPases (22Plutner H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10982-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rab1 is localized in the ER and Golgi and regulates antegrade protein transport specifically from the ER to the Golgi and between the Golgi compartments. We recently demonstrated that AT1R exit from the ER is mediated by a motif consisting of a phenylalanine and a dileucine spaced by six residues in the membrane-proximal carboxyl terminus of the receptor (28Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that Rab1 regulates the transport of AT1R from the ER to the cell surface in HEK293T cells (29Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of Rab1 in the myocardium induces cardiac hypertrophy (30Wu G. Yussman M.G. Barrett T.J. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Hilliard G.M. Wang X Toyokawa T. Yatani A. Lynch R.A. Robbins J. Dorn II, G.W. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that an alteration in Rab1 function may play a role in the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether modifying the ER-to-Golgi transport, as a consequence of manipulating Rab1 function, could alter the cell surface expression and function of endogenous AT1R in cardiomyocytes, and if so, whether Rab1-mediated alteration in AT1R function contributes to the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Rab1WT and its dominant-negative mutant elicit opposing effects on the ER-to-Golgi transport and cell surface expression of AT1R as well as AT1R-mediated signaling and hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that AT1R function can be modulated through manipulating AT1R traffic from the ER to the Golgi in cardiomyocytes and provide the first evidence implicating the ER-to-Golgi transport as a regulatory site for control of cardiomyocyte growth.

The structure of each construct used in the present study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center DNA sequence core). Generation of Adenovirus Stocks—Wild-type or mutant Rab1 was inserted into pShuttle-CMV at the SalI/HindIII restriction sites by PCR. After linearization with PmeI, the plasmid was co-transformed into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 together with pAdEasy-1, the viral DNA plasmid. The recombinant adenoviral constructs were screened by restriction endonuclease digestion. The adenoviral constructs were digested with PacI and transfected into 911 cells to produce viral particles. Subsequent processing and purification of adenovirus were performed in the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center vector core facility by standard procedures. Isolation, Culture, and Adenoviral Infection of Neonatal Rat Ventricular Myocytes—Neonatal ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats through trypsin digestion (50 μg/ml, overnight at 4 °C) in calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) and collagenase digestion in Leibovitz's L-15 media (Worthington Biochemical Corp.). The myocytes were pre-plated on a noncoated dish to reduce contamination of fibroblast cells. Based on immunofluorescence analysis after staining with antibodies against α-actinin, greater than 95% cells isolated by this procedure are cardiomyocytes. Isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After a 24-h culture, myocytes were switched to serum-free DMEM and infected with control parent adenovirus or adenovirus expressing Rab1WT or its dominant-negative mutant Rab1N124I at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20. After infection for 6 h, the medium was changed, and the myocytes were further cultured in DMEM. The efficiency of adenoviral infection of neonatal myocytes was evaluated by immunostaining using anti-FLAG antibodies. Culture and Transfection of HL-1 Cardiomyocyte—HL-1 myocytes were plated onto fibronectin-gelatin-coated plates or coverslips and cultured in Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm norepinephrine, and 2 mml-glutamine as described (35Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of the HL-1 myocytes was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The efficiency of transfection based on the GFP fluorescence was between 60 and 80% in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. For measurement of Rab1 expression and AT1R expression at the cell surface, HL-1 myocytes were cultured in 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.8 μg of AT1R-GFP and 2.0 μg of pcDNA3.1 or FLAG-Rab1 constructs. For immunofluorescence microscopy analysis, HL-1 myocytes were cultured in 6-well dishes and transfected with 30 ng of GFP- or HA-tagged AT1R and 300 ng of Rab1 constructs. Measurement of AT1R Expression at the Cell Surface—Cell surface AT1R expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes was measured by [3H]Ang II binding to intact myocytes as described (36Bouscarel B.

Briefly, neonatal myocytes were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and infected with adenoviral constructs as described above. Infected cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing [3H]Ang II at 4 °C (to limit AT1R internalization induced by ligand Ang II during the binding) overnight with constant shaking. To exclude the contribution of AT2R to ligand binding, all solutions were supplemented with 1 μm PD123319, a specific AT2R antagonist. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of nonradioactive Ang II (10 μm). The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and the cell surface-bound [3H]Ang II was extracted by mild acid treatment (2 × 5 min with 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm glycine, pH 3, and 125 mm NaCl). The radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 6 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). We first determined the Ang II dose-dependent binding curve (2.5-20 nm) in cardiomyocytes infected with control parent adenovirus. Ang II binding to cardiomyocytes increased linearly at concentrations between 2.5 and 15 nm and reached maximal binding at the concentration of 15 nm. Therefore, the cell surface expression of AT1R in neonatal cardiomyocytes infected with Rab1WT adenovirus was measured at a saturating concentration of 20 nm. Total AT1R expression at the cell surface in HL-1 myocytes was measured by flow cytometry as described previously (29Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-1 myocytes were transfected with HA-AT1R, collected and resuspended in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated with high affinity fluorescein-conjugated anti-HA antibody 3F10 at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% fetal calf serum, the cells were resuspended, and the fluorescence was measured in a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur). Because the staining with the anti-HA antibodies was carried out in the unpermeabilized cells and only those receptors expressed at the cell surface were accessible to the anti-HA antibodies, the fluorescence measurement reflected the amount of receptor expressed at the cell surface. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cardiomyocytes were grown on coverslips, fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594- or -labeled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted, and fluorescence was detected with a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescence microscope or a Bio-Rad radiance confocal microscope (28Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol.

Cardiac myocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106/well in 6-well plates, infected with Rab1 constructs as described above, and cultured in DMEM without serum for 48 h. The cells were then preincubated with 10 μm PD123319 for 5 min and stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 600 μ l of 1× SDS gel loading buffer. After solubilizing the cells, 30 μl of total cell lysates was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and ERK1/2 and MEK1 activation was determined by immunoblotting. [3H]Leucine Incorporation—Protein synthesis rate was determined as described (40Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin.

Briefly, neonatal cardiomyocytes were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 105/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After infection with the desired construct, the myocytes were made quiescent by incubation for 48 h in DMEM without fetal bovine serum. The cardiomyocytes were then incubated with [3H]leucine (1 μCi) for 24 h with or without 100 nm Ang II and 10 μm PD123319. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium. The cardiomyocytes were washed twice with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by an extraction with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h in ice. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1 m NaOH for 6 h. The lysate was transferred to scintillation vials, neutralized with 1 ml of 1 m HCl, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution. Since Rab1 influences protein synthesis, the effect of Rab1 on Ang II-stimulated protein synthesis was calculated using the following formula: {[Ang II and Rab1] - [Rab1]}/{[Ang II and control adenovirus] - [control adenovirus]} Measurement of Cell Surface Area—To measure the cell surface area, cardiomyocytes were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (1:50 dilution) for 10 min to visualize F-actin. Cell images from at least 20 randomly chosen fields (×40 objective) of 100 cardiomyocytes were measured in three separate experiments using NIH image software. Only these myocytes that were completely in the field were measured. The effect of Rab1 on the Ang II-mediated increase in cell size was determined using the same formula as for the protein synthesis described above.

Modern research into mechanisms of immune tolerance offers the promise of reprogramming the immune system, so as to harness the body's natural tolerance mechanisms in the service of graft acceptance. This would allow the minimization of immunosuppressive treatment and offers the prospect of eventually weaning transplant recipients off their drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2163121261,"Tactile information is perceived by a heterogeneous population of specialized neurons. Neurotrophin receptors (the receptor tyrosine kinases, Trks) mark the major classes of these sensory neurons: TrkA is expressed in neurons that sense temperature and noxious stimuli, and TrkC is expressed in proprioceptive neurons that sense body position. Neurotrophin signaling through these receptors is required for cell survival. To test whether neurotrophins have an instructive role in sensory specification, we expressed rat TrkC from the TrkA (also known as Ntrk1) locus in mice. The surviving presumptive TrkA-expressing neurons adopted a proprioceptive phenotype, indicating that neurotrophin signaling can specify sensory neuron subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2070965878,"Expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, which (IGFBP-3) inhibits the proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by inducing apoptosis, is lost in about half of stage I NSCLC cases. Since promoter methylation can silence gene expression, we investigated whether hypermethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter is involved in loss of IGFBP-3 expression in NSCLC. We found the IGFBP-3 promoter to be methylated in seven of 13 NSCLC cell lines and in 16 of 23, seven of 9, eight of 11, and six of six tumor specimens from patients with stage I, II, III, and IV NSCLC, respectively. Methylation status correlated with IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein levels in a subset of NSCLC cell lines tested in our study. However, treatment with 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5′-aza-dC) restored IGFBP-3 expression in four of seven NSCLC cell lines with the methylated promoter, suggesting that multiple mechanisms regulate IGFBP-3 expression in NSCLC. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that methylation of the Sp-1/Sp-3-binding element in the IGFBP-3 promoter influenced the binding of Sp-1, methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2), and histone deacetylase (HDAC). A luciferase construct expressing IGFBP-3 promoter in which the Sp-1/Sp-3 binding element was methylated showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity. The reduction in promoter activity was further suppressed by overexpression of MeCP2, which was rescued by 5′-aza-dC. Thus interference with Sp-1 transactivation by MeCP2 may contribute to the transcriptional defect of IGFBP-3 expression in NSCLC cells with methylated promoter."

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Amino acids 51–72 of ExoS constitute a membrane localization domain (MLD) that traffics ExoS to the endoplasmic region of mammalian cells (29Pederson K.J.

Type III-delivered ExoS(ΔMLD) stimulates cell death but does not associate with the endoplasmic region yet ADP-ribosylates Ras, uncoupling the ADP-ribosylation of Ras from cytotoxicity (31Riese M.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2230-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, the ADP-ribosylation activity of ExoS has been linked to cellular adherence, the maintenance of filopodia, and enhanced lamellipodia and cellular ruffling (32Rocha C.L. Coburn J. Rucks E.A. Olson J.C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5296-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Different cell lines demonstrate different sensitivities to intoxication, with epithelial cells being the most affected by the action of ExoS (33Rucks E.A. Fraylick J.E. Brandt L.M. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ExoS ADP-ribosylates an unidentified host protein(s) that is responsible for cytoskeletal changes and/or cell death. In this report, ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERMs) are identified as early, high affinity substrates of ExoS, which links reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with ADP-ribosylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and ReagentsConstruction of pUCP-ExoS, pUCP-ExoS-R146K, pUCP-ExoS-E381D, and pUCP-ExoS-R146K/E381D have been described (21Riese M.J.

Yahr T.L. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 914-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the ORFs of the ERM proteins were purchased from the ATCC (6925743, moesin; 5265085, erzin; 7019745, radixin) and amplified by PCR using the following primer set: moesin forward, 5′-GATCGATCCTCGAGGCCATATGCCCAAAACGATCAGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATCGATCGAATTCTTAGGTCGACGCCATAGACTCAAAT-TCGTCAATG-3′; ezrin forward, 5′-GATCGATCCTCGAGGCGCATAT-GCCGAAACCAATCAATGTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATCGATCGAAT-TCTTAGGTCGACGCCAGGGCCTCGAACTCGTCGA-3′; radixin forward, 5′-GATCGATCCTCGAGGCGCATATGCCGAAACCAATCAACG-TA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATCGATCGGATCCTTAGGTCGACGCCATT-GCTTCAAACTCATCGATA-3′. For cloning into pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), the forward primer contains unique XhoI and NdeI sites (underlined), whereas the reverse primer contains unique EcoRI and SalI sites. The EcoRI in radixin was replaced with a BamHI site due to the presence of an EcoRI site in the ORF of the gene. After amplification, PCR product was digested with NdeI/EcoRI (BamHI for radixin) and ligated into the NdeI/EcoRI (BamHI) sites of pET15b to create His6-moesin (N-terminal fusion) or digested with XhoI/EcoRI and ligated into pEGFP-C1 to create GFP-moesin (N-terminal fusion). Constructs were sequenced to determine DNA fidelity. Moesin and ezrin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences and Covance (Princeton, NJ). Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted.Cell RoundingConfluent HeLa cells (85-mm dishes) were infected with P. aeruginosa expressing the appropriate ExoS construct (see above) at an m.o.i. of 8:1 (bacteria:HeLa cells). P. aeruginosa were quantified from the absorbance calculation 1 A540 = 4 × 108 bacteria. At 3 h, 3 h 20 min, 3 h 40 min, and 4 h post-infection, HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell rounding was determined using a Nikon-inverted microscope (Roper CoolSnapES camera) and quantified as % rounded by dividing the number of rounded cells by the total number of cells ×100 (5 random fields were assayed).Tetanolysin AssayProteins ADP-ribosylated by type III-delivered ExoS in cultured HeLa cells were determined by a “tetanolysin permeability assay” that has been previously described with some modifications (21Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Confluent HeLa cells (85-mm dishes) were infected with P. aeruginosa expressing the indicated form of ExoS at an m.o.i. of 8:1 (bacteria:HeLa cell). At 3 h, 3 h 20min, 3 h 40 min, or 4 h post-infection HeLa cells were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 6 ml of ice-cold HGI buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm NaATP, 4.8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EGTA, and KOH to obtain pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 4 °C with or without 4 μg of tetanolysin and then incubated in 6 ml of HGI buffer containing 20 nm [32P]NAD (10 μCi) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 40 min HeLa cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of HB2 buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and broken by passage (30 times) through a 25-gauge syringe; unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was either subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blot.In Vitro ADP-ribosylation of HeLa LysatesExoS, ExoS(ΔMLD), or ExoS(E381D) (0.04–40 nm) isolated from culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa were incubated with a HeLa post-nuclear supernatant (20 μg) and 10 μm [32P]NAD (0.2 μCi) in a 20-μl reaction for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE plus β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were silver-stained (35Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar) and subjected to autoradiography.Protein ExpressionExoS was purified as previously described (36Kulich S.M. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ExoS(ΔMLD), FAS, RasΔCAAX, (RasΔC), and ERMs were purified as His6-tagged proteins as previously described (27Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Maresso A.W. Barbieri J.T.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the appropriate construct were struck for confluency on LB agar plates containing 0.1 mg of ampicillin/ml and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Bacteria from a single plate were collected, inoculated into 400 ml of LB (total volume cultured = 1.6 liter) broth containing 0.1 mg of ampicillin/ml, and shaken at 250 rpm at 30 °C. After 2 h isopropyl-B-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.6 mm, and cells were cultured for an additional 2 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 8 min and suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole containing DNase I and RNaseA (at final concentrations of 12 μg/ml) and protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340). Cells were broken with two passes through a French press. Broken cells were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm pore-size cellulose filter. Filtrates were applied to an equilibrated 2-ml nitrilotriacetic acid/Ni2+ agarose-affinity matrix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The column was washed with 40 ml of binding buffer. His6 proteins were eluted with Binding buffer containing 0.25 m imidazole. Pooled fractions were subjected to Sephacryl-200 gel filtration (450 ml volume equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 20 mm NaCl). The column was run at 0.3 ml/min, and 3.5-ml fractions were collected. RasΔC and moesin were stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol to prevent protein precipitation. ExoS(ΔMLD) and FAS were stored at –80 °C in running buffer.MALDI-TOF AnalysisThe 70-kDa protein (∼1 μg) was excised from SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to trypsin digestion (1 μg, Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, at 37 °C for 24 h. After digestion, gel slices were sonicated twice in 200 μl of 80% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid (in H2O) for 10 min. Eluted material was combined and evaporated, and the pellet was dissolved in 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (in H2O). Peptide solutions were desalted with C18 Zip Tips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) that had been equilibrated successively in 15 μl of 100% acetonitrile, 15 μl of 50% acetonitrile (H2O), and 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Resin was washed twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Peptides were eluted in 2 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (H2O saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and applied to a sample plate to air dry. Samples were ionized by an N2 UV laser using a PE-pro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Two hundred laser shots were conducted at an accelerating voltage of 25,000 V and laser intensity of 2075 (repetition rate 3 Hz). Scans were processed using Biosystems Voyager 6004 software. Peptide fingerprinting was used to identify proteins present in the 70-kDa band, using Protein Prospector (University of California at San Francisco).TransfectionsOne microgram of DNA encoding pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-moesin was transiently transfected (LipofectAMINE Plus, Invitrogen) into 70% confluent HeLa cells (6-well plates in complete F-12 media with 5% CO2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eighteen hours posttransfection cells were infected, and a tetanolysin assay was performed as described above. Cells were visualized using a Nikon-inverted microscope using a filter set for EGFP (HQ: F712, Nikon). Images were photographed with a Roper CoolSnapES camera and cropped in Corel Photo-Paint 11.Enzyme ActivityLinear Velocity Determination—ExoS and ExoS(ΔMLD) (4.5 nm) were incubated in 20-μl reactions for 4, 8, of 16 min in the presence of FAS (250 nm), 10 μm [32P]NAD (0.2 μCi), ezrin, radixin, moesin, or RasΔC (500 nm) in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 2.0 μg of bovine serum albumin. Reactions were quenched with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and bands containing radiolabeled ERMs and RasΔC were subjected to scintillation spectrometry.Stoichiometric Determination—Moesin stoichiometric analysis proceeded as described for linear velocity determination except that reactions were run for 5 h (determined to be saturating for ADP-ribose incorporated). Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, gels were dried, and radiolabeled moesin bands were exposed to scintillation spectrometry.Michaelis-Menten KineticsExoS(ΔMLD) (4.5 nm) was incubated with 10 μm [32P]NAD (0.2 μCi) and FAS (250 nm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 2.0 μg of bovine serum albumin for 8 min with various concentrations of substrate (0.5–4 and 0.01–28 μm for moesin and RasΔC, respectively). Incorporation of radiolabel into substrates was performed as described for linear velocity determination. Data were transformed to Lineweaver-Burk, and kinetic constants were determined using Ezfitter (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). The utilization of NAD was less than 10% for velocity determinations.RESULTSExoS ADP-ribosyltransferase Activity Is Sufficient to Induce HeLa Cell Rounding—Recent studies demonstrated that the ADP-r activity of ExoS leads to a loss of cellular adherence upon infection with P. aeruginosa (33Rucks E.A. Fraylick J.E. Brandt L.M. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To quantify the effects of the ADP-r activity on cell morphology, HeLa cells were infected with P. aeruginosa expressing either the wild-type ExoS, ExoS deficient in GTPase-activating protein activity (R146K), ExoS deficient for ADP-r and GTPase-activating protein activity (R146K/E381D), or a vector (pUCP) control. Cell rounding, characterized by a change in the morphology of HeLa cells from a flat, cubiodal state to a small, button-like appearance, was observed in cells infected with Wt and R146K-expressing P. aeruginosa (Fig. 1A). Examination of the kinetics of rounding from 3 to 4 h indicated ExoS-Wt rounded up to ∼90% of the monolayer by 4 h, compared with ∼70% for ExoS-R146K. The ADP-r/GTPase-activating protein-deficient ExoS and vector control-infected cells did not undergo significant rounding during this time frame (Fig. 1B). Similar amounts of ExoS were cell-associated for ExoS-Wt, ExoS-R146K, and ExoS-R146K/E381D (inset, Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicated that the ADP-ribosylation activity of ExoS was sufficient to elicit cell rounding, which prompted an analysis into host proteins that were efficient and early targets for ADP-ribosylation.ExoS ADP-ribosylates a 70-kDa Protein Early during Infection—A tetanolysin permeability assay was used to identify cellular proteins ADP-ribosylated by type III-delivered ExoS at early time points (21Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At 3 h post-infection, several predominant radiolabeled bands were observed, notably at 70, 50, 33, and 26 kDa (Fig. 2A). Previous studies identified the 50and 26-kDa proteins to be ExoS and Ras, respectively (21Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol.

Immun. 2002; 70: 2230-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa protein was targeted for identification based upon its modification at the earliest time point assayed, suggesting that it was a high affinity target of the ExoS ADP-ribosyltransferase in cultured cells.Fig. 2ExoS ADP-ribosylates a 70-kDa proteinin vivo andvitro. A, HeLa cells were infected with P. aeruginosa expressing ExoS-Wt at an m.o.i. of 8:1 for the indicated time points and subjected to the tetanolysin assay, and radiolabeled proteins were run on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The arrow indicates an intensely labeled 70-kDa protein modified at early time points. Asterisks refer to three intensely labeled proteins also modified at early time points (upper asterisk, ExoS; lower asterisk, Ras). The autoradiograph represents one of three independent determinations. B, post-nuclear supernatants of HeLa lysates (20 μg) were incubated with either ExoS-Wt, ExoS (ΔMLD), or ExoS-E381D (0.04–40 nm) for 15 min at 25 °C (volume, 20 μl) in the presence of [32P]NAD (0.2 μCi). Reactions were quenched and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The arrow indicates the mobility of a 70-kDa radiolabeled protein. Asterisks refer to three radiolabeled proteins between 70 and 90 kDa that are consistently labeled in this analysis. The autoradiograph represents one of four independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the 70-kDa protein was a substrate in vitro, ExoS-Wt was incubated with [32P]NAD and HeLa cell lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. At 40 nm ExoS-Wt several proteins were radiolabeled, including an intense 50-kDa protein (auto-ADP-ribosylated ExoS) and three substrates ranging in molecular mass from 70 to 90 kDa (Fig. 2B, left panel). To reduce the background of radiolabeling associated with ExoS-Wt in these reactions, ExoS(ΔMLD) was used in the assay, since ExoS(ΔMLD) can be purified to homogeneity from E. coli (37Maresso A.W. Barbieri J.T. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 26: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Like ExoS-Wt, ExoS (ΔMLD) ADP-ribosylated several host proteins, including three proteins with molecular masses between 70 and 90 kDa (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The 70-kDa protein had the same relative mobility as the 70-kDa protein that ExoS-ADP-ribosylated in cultured HeLa cells. ExoS(E381D), which is deficient in ADP-r activity, did not ADP-ribosylate the 70-kDa protein (Fig. 2B, right panel). These data demonstrate that the 70-kDa protein was a substrate of ExoS in cultured cells and in vitro, and prompted an analysis into the identity of this protein.The 70-kDa Protein Is Moesin, a Member of the ERM Family of Proteins—To facilitate the identification of the 70-kDa protein, HeLa lysates were in vitro ADP-ribosylated by ExoS(ΔMLD), and proteins were separated using 11% resolving gels. Alignment of the autoradiogram with a silver-stained gel of the proteins allowed for the identification of a silver-stained protein corresponding to the 70-kDa radiolabeled protein (Fig. 3A, inset). Tryptic digestion and MALDI mass spectroscopy analysis of the 70-kDa protein identified it as moesin, a member of the ERM family of proteins (Fig. 3A, Table I).Fig. 3Identification of the 70-kDa protein as moesin, a member of the ERM family of proteins. A, inset. Radiolabeled HeLa lysates described in Fig. 2 were subjected to 11% resolving gels to achieve maximal band separation followed by silver-staining to align radiolabeled bands with stained proteins. The arrow indicates the migration of the 70-kDa protein next to a faint silver-stained band (•). The protein indicated in the inset was subjected to tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Shown is a trace of the peptide profile with moesin-specific peptides numbered 1–16 (refer to Table I). B, moesin ORF was cloned into pET15b and purified using Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration chromatography. Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration (Gel.

https://openalex.org/W2055309807,"We have examined the kinetics of nucleotide binding to actomyosin VI by monitoring the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin filaments. ATP binds single-headed myosin VI following a two-step reaction mechanism with formation of a low affinity collision complex (1/K1′ = 5.6 mm) followed by isomerization (k+2′ = 176 s–1) to a state with weak actin affinity. The rates and affinity for ADP binding were measured by kinetic competition with ATP. This approach allows a broader range of ADP concentrations to be examined than with fluorescent nucleotide analogs, permitting the identification and characterization of transiently populated intermediates in the pathway. ADP binding to actomyosin VI, as with ATP binding, occurs via a two-step mechanism. The association rate constant for ADP binding is ∼five times greater than for ATP binding because of a higher affinity in the collision complex (1/K5b′ = 2.2 mm) and faster isomerization rate constant (k+5a′ = 366 s–1). By equilibrium titration, both heads of a myosin VI dimer bind actin strongly in rigor and with bound ADP. In the presence of ATP, conditions that favor processive stepping, myosin VI does not dwell with both heads strongly bound to actin, indicating that the second head inhibits strong binding of the lead head to actin. With both heads bound strongly, ATP binding is accelerated 2.5-fold, and ADP binding is accelerated >10-fold without affecting the rate of ADP release. We conclude that the heads of myosin VI communicate allosterically and accelerate nucleotide binding, but not dissociation, when both are bound strongly to actin.

We conclude that the heads of myosin VI communicate allosterically and accelerate nucleotide binding, but not dissociation, when both are bound strongly to actin. The myosin family of molecular motors constitutes a large gene family of proteins that couple the energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to force generation along actin filaments (1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). At least 18 classes (Classes I–XVIII) make up the family (2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). All possess a highly conserved catalytic motor domain (referred to as “head”) that binds actin, hydrolyzes ATP, and performs the mechanical work. In nonmuscle cells, cytoplasmic myosins are required for various cellular processes including membrane and RNA trafficking, cell migration, and cytokinesis (3Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The nucleotide bound to myosin dictates the affinity for actin filaments (1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotide or with bound ADP, myosin binds actin filaments with high (<1 μm) affinity; these states are referred to as “strongly bound states.” With ATP or the hydrolysis products, ADP-Pi, bound, myosin binds actin with low affinity and rapidly attaches and detaches from the actin filament on a submicrosecond timescale; these nucleotide states are called “weakly bound states.” The strong binding states are force-bearing intermediates, but the weak binding states are not. The fraction of the total ATPase cycle time spent strongly bound to actin is called the duty ratio. Because under physiological nucleotide concentrations ATP binding is largely favored over ADP binding, ADP release limits the lifetime of the strongly bound actomyosin states and dictates the duty ratio. There is a long history documenting complex reactions for ADP binding to actomyosin (for review and references, see Ref. 1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Although skeletal muscle actomyosin II binds ADP weakly (Kd > 100 μm) in a rapid equilibrium (4Geeves M.A. Goody R.S.

Myosin VI spends most (>70%) of its ATPase cycle time bound strongly to actin (i.e. it is a “high duty ratio motor”) in the presence of physiological actin and ATP concentrations, primarily as a result of a slow, rate-limiting ADP release (7De La Cruz E.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); but weak and slow ATP binding also contribute to the high duty ratio (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP binding to myosin VI is much slower than other characterized myosins (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Myosin VI-HMM takes an average of six steps per diffusional encounter, a value predicted from solution kinetics (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Despite the predicted short lever arm of myosin VI, the step size is ∼35–38 nm (16Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The step size is weakly dependent on load (18Altman D. Sweeney H.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but is reduced from ∼35 to ∼ 27 nm as loads approach the stalling force (∼2 pN). An important feature of myosin VI processivity is slow, rate-limiting ADP release that allows myosin VI-HMM to dwell with at least one head strongly bound to the actin filament during processive stepping (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Most models of myosin V and VI processivity favor strong actin binding through both heads simultaneously, or predominantly the trailing head (19Mehta A. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycles of the myosin VI-HMM heads are not independent (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of coordination is unknown. It has been hypothesized that the heads communicate allosterically during processive stepping through ATP binding (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and Pi release (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Although it has been demonstrated that an applied backward load weakens ATP binding and favors ADP binding to myosin VI-HMM (18Altman D. Sweeney H.L. Spudich J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), experimental evidence supporting intramolecular head-head communication through effects on the ATPase cycle kinetics is lacking. In this study we have investigated the mechanism of ATP and ADP binding to single and double-headed actomyosin VI to (a) define the molecular basis of slow and weak ATP binding, (b) determine the mechanism of head-head communication, and (c) test the hypothesis (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that ATP binding to the trailing head of the myosin VI dimer is accelerated by the leading head. Our results support a role of myosin VI anchoring and allow us to formulate a model of processive myosin VI stepping, accounting for the effects of intramolecular load on the ATPase cycle kinetics. Reagents—All chemicals and reagents were the highest purity commercially available. ATP (99+% purity as assayed by HPLC; data not shown) was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and ADP (99+% purity as assayed by HPLC, data not shown) was purchased from Sigma. Nucleotides were purified by HPLC before use if necessary. Nucleotide concentrations were determined by absorbance at 259 nm using ϵ259 of 15,400 m–1 cm–1. A molar equivalent of MgCl2 was added to nucleotides immediately before use. Pyrenyliodoacetamide came from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Imidazole (fluorescence grade, 99+%, titration) and phalloidin were purchased from Sigma. Protein Expression and Purification—Single-headed (referred to as S1) and double-headed (referred to as HMM) myosin VI with bound calmodulin, the physiological light chain, were purified from Sf9 cells by FLAG affinity chromatography (7De La Cruz E.M.

The single-headed construct (T406A mutant) was truncated at Gly-840 (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The double-headed construct (myosin VI-HMM, T406E mutant) was truncated at Arg-992 to include 20 native heptad repeats of predicted coiled coil followed by a GCN4 leucine zipper to ensure dimerization, and a FLAG tag (7De La Cruz E.M.

By UV absorbance, purified protein preparations contained undetectable levels of bound nucleotide. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, labeled with pyrene, gel filtered over Sephacryl S-300 HR, and polymerized by dialysis against KMg50 buffer (50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). Phalloidin (1.1 molar equivalents) was used to stabilize actin filaments. Stopped-flow Measurements and Kinetic Modeling—All experiments were performed in KMg50 buffer with an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) SX.18MV-R stopped flow apparatus thermostatted at 25 °C (±0.1 °C). Concentrations stated are final after mixing. Pyrene fluorescence (λ ex = 366 nm) was monitored at 90 °C through a 400 nm long pass colored glass filter. Long time courses were corrected for minor contributions from photobleaching by subtracting the time courses of fluorescence acquired after mixing pyrene actin filaments with nucleotides. Essentially identical results were obtained when time courses of strongly bound pyrene actomyosin mixed with buffer alone were used for correction. Light scattering was measured at 90 °C with excitation at 320 nm. Most of the time courses shown in the figures are of individual, unaveraged, 1,000-point transients collected with the instrument in oversampling mode. Typically, multiple (three to eight) time courses were averaged before analysis. Time courses that display fast and slow phases (see Figs. 2, 8, and 9) were collected on a logarithmic time scale. The intrinsic time constant for data acquisition is ∼30 μs. Nonlinear least squares fitting was done using Pro-K software provided with the instrument or with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).Fig. 8ATP binding to actomyosin VI-HMM with both heads strongly bound.

Pyrene actomyosin-S1 samples were prepared by mixing myosin VI-S1 with a molar equivalent of pyrene actin and equilibrating at 25 °C for at least 5 min. Apyrase (0.1 unit ml–1 final, potato grade VII) was added to ensure rigor (no nucleotide) conditions when indicated. Samples of pyrene actomyosin VI-HMM were prepared by first mixing myosin VI-HMM with 0.1 mm MgATP in a small volume (≤5% of final volume) then adding (≥0.95 of volume) a premixed solution of pyrene-actin and apyrase (0.5 unit ml–1, potato grade VII) to hydrolyze any free ATP and ADP in solution. The final [myosin VI-HMM heads]/[Actin] was 0.1. Equilibrium Titrations—The stoichiometry of myosin VI binding to actin filaments was measured from the [myosin] dependence of pyrene actin fluorescence quenching. Myosin VI-S1 or myosin VI-HMM (±2mm MgADP, 0.5 unit ml–1 apyrase omitted when ADP present) was mixed with 90–180 nm pyrene actin and equilibrated at 25 °C(±1 °C) for 40–60 min. Steady-state fluorescence intensities were measured at 25 °C (±1 °C) using a Photon Technologies International (New Brunswick, NJ) Alphascan fluorescence spectrometer. Binding stoichiometries were obtained by fitting the fluorescence intensities at 400 nm (λ ex = 366 nm) to Equation 3, F(r)=F0+(F∞−F0)×((r+KdA0+n)−(r+KdA0+n)2−4·r·n2·n)(Eq. 3) where F(r) is the fluorescence intensity (F) as a function of the [myosin]/[actin] ratio (r), F0 is the fluorescence in the absence of myosin, F∞ is the fluorescence intensity at infinitely high r (i.e. saturating [myosin]/[actin]), Kd is the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant of actomyosin, A0 is the total actin concentration, and n is the stoichiometry of myosin heads binding to actin subunits in a filament. The stoichiometry (n), initial (F0) and final (F∞) fluorescence were allowed to float when fitting. Values of Kd were constrained to the values calculated from ratio of the experimentally determined association and dissociation rate constants. The titration curves define the stoichiometry better than they define the affinity because [A0] » Kd. Constraining F0 to 1, and F∞ to the visually determined final fluorescence value yielded similar results for n. Kinetics of Myosin VI Binding to Actin Filaments—Kinetics of myosin VI binding to pyrene actin filaments was done under pseudo first-order conditions with [actin] ≥ 10 » [myosin VI heads] (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Apyrase (0.1 unit ml–1) was included in both actin and myosin samples to achieve rigor (no nucleotide) conditions. Apyrase was omitted when ADP was present. Time courses of myosin VI and myosin VI-ADP dissociation from pyrene actin filaments were measured after mixing an equilibrated mixture of pyrene actomyosin VI-HMM (±2mm MgADP, apyrase omitted when ADP present) with 100-fold excess unlabeled actin filaments (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mechanism of MgATP Binding to Actomyosin VI-S1— Myosin VI binding to actin filaments was assayed by monitoring the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. In the absence of nucleotides or with bound ADP, myosin VI binds actin strongly and quenches the pyrene fluorescence by ∼70% (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ATP binding induces population of the weak binding states, dissociates myosin VI from actin at the low actomyosin concentrations used, and recovers 100% of the fluorescence of pyrene actin alone (7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATP binding to actomyosin VI can be monitored from the fluorescence enhancement of pyrene actin. Time courses of pyrene fluorescence enhancement after mixing ATP with actomyosin VI follow single exponentials (Fig. 1A). The observed rate constants (kobs) depend hyperbolically on the ATP concentration (Fig. 1B), consistent with a two-step mechanism for ATP binding to actomyosin VI (Reaction 1),AM+ATP⇄K1'AM(ATP)⇄K+2'A*M⋅ATP→kdA*+M⋅ATPREACTION 1where AM(ATP) is the collision complex in rapid equilibrium (K1′ = k+1′/k–1′, k–1′ » k+2′, and k+1′[ATP] + k–1′ » 1,000 s–1) with actomyosin (AM) and free nucleotide that isomerizes (k+2′) to an unquenched, weak binding state (A*M·ATP) that dissociates rapidly (kd > k+2′+ k–2′) from the filament (20De La Cruz E.M.

The observed rate constant (kobs) for the formation of the weak binding states (indicated by * in Reaction 1), when the first step is a rapid equilibrium that generates no net fluorescence change, and dissociation from actin is favored over ATP dissociation (kd » k–2′, k–2′ ∼ 0), depends hyperbolically on the [ATP] and the rate and equilibrium constants for binding according to Equation 4.kobs=(K1'k+2'[ATP]1+K1'[ATP])(Eq. 4) The equilibrium constant for initial ATP binding (1/K1′) is 5.6 (±0.7) mm, the maximum observed rate constant (kmax = k+2′) is 176.5 (±8.2) s–1, and the second-order association rate constant (K1′k+2′) is 32 (±4) mm1 s–1. Previous measurements done under a limited range of [ATP] (up to 10 mm, Ref. 7De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were linear and yielded a comparable association rate constant (Fig. 1B). At [ATP] > 3 mm, 100% of the fluorescence is recovered, demonstrating that ATP binding can be considered to be essentially irreversible. From the [ATP] dependence of the pyrene fluorescence change amplitudes, we estimate the overall apparent affinity for ATP binding to be ∼300 μm (not shown). This is not a true equilibrium constant but represents the steady-state [ATP] dependence of the shift from strongly bound (low fluorescence) to weakly bound (high fluorescence) states. Although we did not account for changes in solution ionic strength, inclusion of an additional 0.1 m KCl has only minor effects on the observed rate constants (data not shown), demonstrating that the observed hyperbolic [ATP] dependence is unlikely to result from nonspecific, common ion effects that arise at high nucleotide concentrations.

Despite the wealth of data regarding the second messenger role of cADPR, the hormonal signals responsible for ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation are less well defined. In mammals, acetylcholine and cholecystokinin have been shown to activate ADP-ribosyl cyclase in adrenal chromaffin cells (9Morita K. Kitayama S. Dohi T. J. Biol.

In higher plants, cADPR has been shown to mediate signaling of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in the drought-stress response leading to activation of gene transcription and to stomatal closure (11Wu Y.

More recently, ABA and cADPR have been demonstrated to mediate temperature signaling in sponges (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (phylogenetically the oldest metazoans), suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin of the ABA/cADPR signaling cascade in a common precursor of modern Metazoa and Metaphyta. The position of hydroids (Coelenterata, Cnidaria) in the phylogenetic tree (they follow sponges and are considered the most ancient true animal phylum, Eumetazoa), the relative complexity of their structure (as opposed to sponges, hydroids have well defined tissues with sensory, nerve, muscle and epithelial cells, a digestive cavity, and a rudimentary nervous system, (13Frank U. Leitz T. Müller W.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)), and their peculiar capacity for regeneration (a process bearing intriguing similarities with animal stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration, (13Frank U. Leitz T. Müller W.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Teragawa C.K. Bode H.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) prompted us to investigate the presence and the functional role of the ABA/ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR system in marine hydroids. Hydroids are characterized by a metagenetic life cycle with polyp and medusa forms. A sessile, feather-like colony, formed by polyps connected by a network of gastrovascular canals (stolons) covered by a chitinous exoskeleton (perisarc), gives rise to free-swimming medusae (sexual phase). Asexual reproduction is also common; cloning can be produced accidentally, due to injury to the colony, and physiologically, by budding, autotomy, and by elongation of stolons, which grow and attach to another substratum near the parent colony and then segregate to form a new colony (15Galliot B. Schmid V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). Regeneration, defined as the capacity to replace entire sections of the body in a short time, plays an important role in the maintenance of the individual structure in hydroids, compensating for spontaneous or accidental loss of tissue (15Galliot B. Schmid V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). Budding and regeneration involve the contribution of pluripotent stem cells, present in the stolonal network, which provide new tissue wherever growth processes take place (14Teragawa C.K. Bode H.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Galliot B. Schmid V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). In the cosmopolitan genus Eudendrium, medusa generation is substituted by sessile gonophores (i.e. sexual polyps) with the function of gonads. Eudendrium racemosum, the species utilized in this study, is abundant in the Ligurian Sea (West Mediterranean); it is present year-round at shallow depths (0-5 m), and it shows rapid, light-induced regeneration of cut stolons “in vitro” (16Azzini F. Cerrano C. Puce S. Bavestrello G. Biol. Mar. Medit. 2003; 10: 146-151Google Scholar). Results obtained indicate that light-induced regeneration in E. racemosum is mediated by the phytohormone ABA with cADPR as its second messenger. These observations for the first time identify the ABA/cADPR signaling pathway in primitive animals and indicate its involvement in the control of stem cell proliferation. Hydroids—E. racemosum colonies were collected in shallow water (0-5 m) inside the harbor of Santa Margherita (Genova, Italy). Hydroids were transferred to the lab in abundant seawater (SW) and were either immediately utilized or kept in an aerated aquarium in natural SW at 17 °C with 8 h/day artificial illumination for up to 4 days. For regeneration experiments, small fragments (∼10 mm) of stolons were cut from different colonies, randomized, and incubated in sterile Petri dishes in natural, filtered SW (10 fragments per dish in 30 ml of SW) at 17 °C under artificial white light (8 h/day) unless otherwise stated, in the presence of the indicated chemicals. Regeneration, i.e. budding of new tissue at the ends of each fragment, was measured by microscopic examination with a micrometric objective (final magnification ×5). Determination of ADP-ribosyl Cyclase and cADPR Hydrolase Activities—Small fragments (10 mm) were cut from several hydroid colonies, briefly sonicated (6 s) in SW containing 0.01% Triton X-100, diluted in SW to ∼0.15 mg protein/ml, and incubated at 17 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm NAD+ (for determination of cyclase activity) or 0.2 mm cADPR (for determination of hydrolase activity). At various times (30, 60, and 120 min) aliquots of 50 μl were withdrawn, trichloroacetic acid-extracted, and analyzed by HPLC (17Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cADPR Detection in Hydroid Extracts—Hydroid fragments (10-15 per determination) were sonicated in 0.3 ml of 0.6 m perchloric acid in deionized water. The intracellular cADPR concentration was determined on samples (≤0.3 mg protein) by a sensitive enzymatic cycling assay (18Graeff R.M. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 19Bruzzone S. De Flora A. Usai C. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Briefly, perchloric acid was removed by mixing the sample with 4 vol of a solution containing 1,1,2-trichlo-rotrifluoroethane and tri-n-octylamine. After 1 min of vortexing, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g, and the aqueous layer containing cADPR was recovered. Samples were then incubated overnight at 37 °C with a mixture of enzymes (nucleotide pyrophosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and NAD-glycohydrolase) to hydrolyze contaminating nucleotides. Enzymes were removed by filtration with a multi-screen vacuum manifold on Immobilon-P membrane plates (Millipore, Milan, Italy), and reactions for cADPR determination were carried out in 96-well plates. A 50-μl aliquot of reagent containing 30 mm nicotinamide, 100 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.1 μg/ml ADP-ribosyl cyclase (from Aplysia californica, Sigma) was added to 0.1 ml of sample. In parallel, the same reagent without ADP-ribosyl cyclase was added to each sample. Finally, 0.1 ml of the cycling reagent (2% (v/v) ethanol, 100 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 20 μm resazurin, 5 μg/ml diaphorase, 10 μm FMN, 10 mm nicotinamide, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) was added to each well. The increase in resazurin fluorescence (544 nm excitation, 590 nm emission) was measured every 3 min over a 12-h period using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). A cADPR standard curve was always run in parallel in each assay. ABA Detection in Hydroid Extracts—Freshly cut hydroid fragments (approx. 0.5 g wet weight) were homogenized in 6 vol of methanol/water (80:20 v/v), methanol was evaporated, and the aqueous extract was acidified (at pH 3.1) with 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and extracted with diethylether (20Le Page-Degivry M.-Th. Bidard J.-N. Rouvier E. Bulard C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After removal of diethylether under vacuum, the extract was redissolved in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and 20- and 50-μl aliquots were analyzed in duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the PGR-1 Sigma detection kit, which is specific for (+)-ABA. Occasionally, the ABA concentration was confirmed by HPLC analysis on extracts from 6 g wet weight (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosyl Cyclase Activity Is Present in Eudendrium and Increases during Regeneration—Cyclase activity was detected in lysates from freshly collected E. racemosum at 0.15 ± 0.06 nmol cADPR/min/mg protein (mean ± S.D. of 20 determinations) together with an eight times higher cADPR hydrolase activity (1.20 ± 0.18). No seasonal variations of cyclase activity were observed in E. racemosum, which is present year-round without significant variations of its biomass (16Azzini F. Cerrano C. Puce S. Bavestrello G. Biol. Mar. Medit. 2003; 10: 146-151Google Scholar). Conversely, a sharp increase in both cyclase and hydrolase activities was observed during spontaneous tissue regeneration, a light-stimulated process in E. racemosum (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which can be induced by cutting of stolon fragments. Cyclase and hydrolase activities increased in the regenerating tissue budding from the cut ends of the stolons as well as in the center of the fragments (Table I). Under light conditions, the cyclase activity of the extremities of the fragments was similar to that of the center and more than 10-fold higher compared with that at the start of incubation. In the fragments regenerating under dark conditions, cyclase activity increased to a somewhat lesser extent and was higher in the extremities compared with the central part of the fragment (Table I). Hydrolase activity was also increased during regeneration (although to a lesser extent compared with the cyclase), leading to a significant decrease in the hydrolase to cyclase ratio (Table I). These results suggested involvement of cyclase activity in the process of E. racemosum regeneration.Table ICyclase and hydrolase activities measured on E. racemosum fragments during regenerationConditionHydrolaseCyclaseRationmol/min/mgTime 01.200.158.0LightExtremities2.201.901.1Center2.732.101.3DarkExtremities3.801.472.6Center1.640.523.1 Open table in a new tab Abscisic Acid Stimulates Regeneration and ADP-ribosyl Cyclase Activity of Eudendrium Fragments—The known stimulatory effect of abscisic acid on sponge cyclase and metabolism (respiration, filtration, and protein synthesis, (21Zocchi E. Basile G. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Carpaneto A. Magrassi R. Usai C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 629-636Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) prompted us to investigate the effect of ABA on cyclase activity and on regeneration in E. racemosum fragments. Outgrowth at the ends of control fragments was detectable after 24 h (Fig. 1A, white bars) and was preceded (at 18 h) by a 10-fold increase in cyclase activity over values measured at the start of incubation (Fig. 1B, white bars). The addition of 50 μm ABA accelerated regeneration, which was already detectable after 18 h (Fig. 1A, gray bars) and induced an earlier (3 h) and higher increase in the cyclase activity (Fig. 1B, gray bars). The increase in the cyclase activity preceded tissue outgrowth in both ABA-treated and control fragments. At 5 μm, ABA stimulated cyclase activity and regeneration compared with control, however at a quantitatively lower extent than ABA 50 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). During both spontaneous and ABA-stimulated regeneration, the increase in cyclase activity was accompanied by an increase in the hydrolase, which showed a similar time course but a somewhat lesser extent of activation compared with the cyclase (Fig. 1, C and D). As a result, the hydrolase to cyclase ratio (R) decreased during regeneration from a “resting” value of 9.0 at time 0 to 1.7 and 0.7 during light- or ABA-induced regeneration (Fig. 1, C and D), respectively. In sponges, ABA was shown to activate ADP-ribosyl cyclase by means of a protein kinase (PK)-dependent phosphorylation (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect on cyclase activity and on the intracellular cADPR content ([cADPR]i) of a brief exposure of E. racemosum fragments to ABA in the absence or presence of K252a, a general cell-permeable PK inhibitor. Incubation with 50 μm ABA for 60 min induced a sharp increase in the cyclase activity in E. racemosum (Fig. 2A, gray bar), which was completely prevented by 2 μm K252a (Fig. 2A, black bar). Hydrolase was also activated by ABA but to a significantly lesser extent compared with the cyclase (1.12 ± 0.1, 1.44 ± 0.2, 1.75 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.1 nmol/min/mg for time 0, control, ABA-treated, and K252a-treated fragments, respectively), leading to a marked ABA-induced decrease in the hydrolase to cyclase ratio, which was prevented by K252a (Fig. 2, left panel). Cyclase activation was paralleled by a 4-fold increase in the [cADPR]i, which was likewise abrogated by the PK inhibitor (Fig. 2, right panel). To identify the PK involved in cyclase activation we tested the effects of two different PK-specific, cell-permeant (myristoylated) inhibitors: peptide-(14-22), specific for PKA, and peptide-(20-28), specific for PKC (both from Calbiochem). The PKA-specific inhibitor almost completely prevented the ABA-induced, early (1 h) cyclase activation as well as the belated (24 h) cyclase increase observed in unstimulated fragments during regeneration. Conversely, the PKC-specific inhibitor had no significant effect in both cases (Fig. 3). These results indicate that in E. racemosum ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation during ABA-stimulated or spontaneous regeneration occurs through a PKA-mediated phosphorylation.Fig. 3Effect of PKA- and PKC-specific inhibitors on ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation.E. racemosum fragments were incubated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 in the presence of 50 μm ABA for 1 h (striped bar) or in the absence of ABA for 24 h (white bar). The PKA-specific inhibitor (myristoylated peptide-(14-22), black bars) and the PKC-specific inhibitor (myristoylated peptide-(20-28), gray bars), both at 5 μm, were added 30 min before the start of incubation. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured on lysates prepared from 10 fragments per experimental determination. Results are expressed as activity relative to time 0 (at the start of incubation). Values shown are the mean ± S.D. from three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ABA Is Involved in Light-stimulated E. racemosum Regeneration—Regeneration of E. racemosum is decidedly light-dependent (16Azzini F. Cerrano C. Puce S. Bavestrello G. Biol. Mar. Medit. 2003; 10: 146-151Google Scholar). In control fragments, regeneration was indeed markedly light-sensitive, as outgrowth from the cut ends of the stolons was visibly higher under light conditions compared with the outgrowth in the dark (Fig. 4, A and B). Addition of ABA dramatically stimulated regeneration in the dark, inducing a similar outgrowth as observed under light conditions (Fig. 4C). The total outgrowth, as measured microscopically after 48 h of incubation of E. racemosum fragments, was 4-fold higher under light conditions compared with the outgrowth in the dark (Fig. 5). 5 μm ABA stimulated regeneration in the dark 4.5-fold compared with controls up to values similar to those observed in control fragments in the light, suggesting that this concentration may induce stimulatory effects on regeneration similar to those afforded by endogenous ABA produced under light exposure. This seems to be supported also by the similar [cADPR]i measured in fragments regenerating in the light (without additions) or in the dark but in the presence of 5 μm ABA (0.52 ± 0.08 versus 0.59 ± 0.09 pmol/g wet weight, respectively; n = 3). Finally, the similar growth of ABA-treated fragments under light and dark conditions indicated that the effects of ABA and of light on growth were not additive (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effect of ABA on E. racemosum regeneration under light and dark conditions.E. racemosum fragments were incubated in SW at 17 °C under artificial light (8 h/day) (white bars) or in the dark (gray bars), in the absence (control) or in the presence of 5 or 50 μm ABA. After 3 days, outgrowth at the cut ends of the fragments was measured microscopically. Total outgrowth was divided by the number of fragments (10 fragments per experimental point). Values shown are the mean ± S.D. from three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggested involvement of ABA in the signal transduction pathway leading to light-stimulated regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the presence of ABA in E. racemosum tissue, and we measured the hormone concentration under light and dark conditions. Indeed, ABA was detected in E. racemosum tissue extracts at a concentration of 18 ± 4 pmol/g wet tissue (n = 5). After 24 h in the dark, endogenous ABA decreased slightly, but its concentration dramatically increased shortly (15 min) after re-exposure to light (Fig. 6). After 4 h of light, hormone levels decreased to nearbasal values (Fig. 6), indicating that an effective ABA turnover occurs in E. racemosum, similar to what is observed in plants (22Cutler A.J. Krochko J.E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA synthesis from carotenoids in plants (23Kowalczyk-Schroder S. Sandmann G. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 42: 7-12Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), prevented the light-induced increase in ABA concentration (Fig. 6). The amount of ABA found in hydroids and the kinetics of increase following light exposure closely parallel those observed in sponges after heat stress (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On a fresh weight basis, the amount of ABA found in hydroids (20-100 pmol/g) is similar to that reported in the tissues of higher plants (40-400 pmol/g) (20Le Page-Degivry M.-Th. Bidard J.-N.

Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and is 2-12 times higher than that found in mammalian tissues (1-8 pmol/g) (20Le Page-Degivry M.-Th. Bidard J.-N. Rouvier E. Bulard C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate presence of the phytohormone ABA in E. racemosum and rapid stimulation of its endogenous neosynthesis by light. Carotenoids, ABA precursors in plants, were indeed detected spectrophotometrically (26Boyer R.F. Modern Experimental Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. , The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ1993: 379-389Google Scholar) in acetone extracts from freshly collected E. racemosum colonies. At 42 ± 8 μg/g wet weight, this concentration is approximately one-half of that reported in carrots (27Sulaeman A. Keeler L. Taylor S.L. Giraud D.W. Driskell J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 3253-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 summarizes the time courses of light-induced changes on cyclase activity and ABA and cADPR levels in E. racemosum fragments exposed to light after a 12-h period in the dark. ABA levels increase within minutes of light exposure and subsequently return to near-basal values after 18-24 h. Cyclase activation follows the increase in [ABA]i and reaches maximal values after 18 h, similar to the [cADPR]i. The hydrolase to cyclase ratio changes from 9.0 at time 0 to ∼3.0 after 24 h. Effect of Various Inhibitors on Light-stimulated E. racemosum Regeneration—To confirm involvement of ABA, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and intracellular calcium in the signal transduction pathway of light-induced regeneration in E. racemosum, we used a number of inhibitors to interrupt signaling at specific sites (Fig. 8). Over the concentration range used to inhibit ABA synthesis in plants (24Spollen W.G. LeNoble M.E. Samuels T.D. Bernstein N. Sharp R.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Hsu Y.T. Kao C.H. Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), Fluridone reduced regeneration in a dose-dependent way, confirming involvement of ABA in the induction of hydroid regeneration. The PK inhibitor K252a, which prevented ABA-induced ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation and the consequent [cADPR]i increase (Fig. 2), induced a 70% growth reduction after 24 h exposure (data not shown) and a somewhat lower inhibition (50%) after 48 h of exposure (Fig. 8). The PKA-specific inhibitor (myristoylated peptide-(14-22)) reduced E. racemosum regeneration by a similar extent (data not shown). Addition of the membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist 8-Br-cADPR (28Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) decreased regeneration by 70%, whereas the IP3 antagonist U73122 was less active (35% reduction). The combined effect of both antagonists together was not additive, reducing regeneration to an extent similar to that observed with 8-Br-cADPR alone (data not shown). Finally, chelation of intracellular calcium with membrane-permeant EGTA-AM resulted in the almost complete inhibition of E. racemosum regeneration. Neither of these treatments affected hydroid vitality as judged by microscopic examination of the tissue protruding from the cut ends of the fragments. Taken together, these results demonstrate that regeneration in Eudendrium is an ABA-stimulated, calcium-dependent process primarily mediated by cADPR. ABA is a phytohormone involved in plant response to abiotic stress and in the regulation of seed dormancy and germination (29Xiong L. Zhu J.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In vegetative tissue, where ABA controls stomatal closure and transcription of several genes, ABA levels increase in response to environmental conditions, such as drought, high salinity, light, and low temperature (29Xiong L. Zhu J.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium is known to be a signaling intermediate of ABA; of the principal regulators of intracellular calcium levels known to date (IP3, cADPR, and NAADP+) IP3 and cADPR have been shown to be involved in ABA signaling (see Ref. 30Himmelbach A. Yang Y. Grill E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar for a recent review). ABA increases IP3 in Arabidopsis (31Burnette R.N. Gunesekera B.M. Gillaspy G.E. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and cADPR can substitute for ABA in stimulating transcription of two ABA-regulated stress-responsive genes (8Guse A.H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in inducing stomatal closure (6Leckie C.P. McAinsh M.R. Allen G.J. Sanders D. Hetherington A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15837-15842Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In sponges (phylum Porifera), ABA is involved in temperature signaling, inducing ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation, intracellular calcium increase, and stimulation of filtration and respiration (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Zocchi E. Basile G. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Carpaneto A. Magrassi R. Usai C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 629-636Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The striking biochemical similarities between the ABA/cADPR signaling pathway in plants and in sponges suggest its ancestral role in relating cell functions to environmental conditions in a common precursor of modern Metazoa and Metaphyta. Here we demonstrate the involvement of ABA and of cADPR as its second messenger in light-induced regeneration in hydroids, the most ancient metazoan phylum possessing typical animal tissues (Eumetazoa). Thus, this is the first report of a complete signaling pathway in Eumetazoa involving a phytohormone. In E. racemosum, light exposure activates ABA synthesis, which stimulates ADP-ribosyl cyclase via a PKA-mediated phosphorylation, and the consequent increase in the intracellular cADPR concentration then leads to an increase in the [Ca2+]i, which stimulates proliferation (Fig. 9). The fact that cyclase activation by light and ABA is also accompanied by an increase in hydrolase activity (Fig. 1, C and D) may suggest that a bifunctional enzyme is responsible for both activities, similar to that observed in mammals, where the hydrolase to cyclase ratio is 10 (7Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structures, Metabolism and Functions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002Crossref Google Scholar). Both light and ABA induce a decrease in the ratio, from a “resting” value of 8.0 down to 0.5-3.0 in the “activated” condition, which together with the activation of the cyclase, cooperate to increase the [cADPR]i (Fig. 7). Cyclase activation via PKA has been observed in sponges where it is triggered by heat stress (12Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells where it is triggered by acetylcholine and is accompanied by activation of cADPR-hydrolase activity (9Morita K. Kitayama S. Dohi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It may be of interest to observe that the increase in cyclase activity induced by light is similar in the regenerating extremities and in the center of E. racemosum fragments, whereas under dark conditions the increase in cyclase activity is higher in the extremities compared with the central part of the fragments (Table I). The reason for this may lie in the fact that the hydroid exoskeleton (perisarc) is transparent to light, as witnessed by the fact that the internal tissue can be observed upon transillumination (Fig. 4). Thus, light exposure may stimulate ABA synthesis and cyclase activity throughout the tissue inside the perisarc; indeed, budding of new tissue occurs from the ramifications as well as from the extremities of cut fragments (Fig. 4, A and C). Regeneration in the dark is probably induced by the mechanical and/or chemical stress elicited by cutting of the fragments and exposure of the tissue to external SW and is accompanied by a higher cyclase activation in the tissue exposed to the environmental stress (extremities) compared with the central part of the fragment. IP3 is also involved along with cADPR in the intracellular calcium increase during Eudendrium regeneration as demonstrated by the significant decrease (35%) caused by the IP3 antagonist U73122 on ABA-induced growth (Fig. 8). However, the fact that 8-Br-cADPR and U73122 together did not exert a higher inhibitory effect compared with 8-Br-cADPR alone (70%) suggests that cADPR and IP3 act sequentially rather than synergistically. A sequential action of cADPR and IP3 has been recently observed in murine fibroblasts where a cADPR-induced calcium release is necessary to start localized IP3-mediated calcium signals in response to purinergic receptor stimulation (32Bruzzone S. Kunerth S. Zocchi E. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Failure of 8-Br-cADPR to completely prevent Eudendrium regeneration, as observed with EGTA-AM, may indicate involvement of NAADP+, a potent calcium mobilizer co-produced with cADPR by invertebrate and mammalian ADP-ribosyl cyclases (7Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structures, Metabolism and Functions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002Crossref Google Scholar), or may be caused by the higher difficulty of 8-Br-cADPR as compared with EGTA-AM to cross the perisarc, which, at the start of regeneration, completely covers the hydroid tissue except for the fragment cut ends. The capacity for extensive regeneration upon loss of tissue in hydroids is reminiscent of the process of stem cell proliferation/differentiation in higher animals, which in recent years was reported in several tissues other than those historically known to possess a stem cell reservoir (epithelial and hemopoietic tissue). Recently, stroma-produced cADPR has been shown to stimulate human hemopoietic stem cell proliferation (33Podestà M. Pitto A. Figari O. Bacigalupo A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. De Flora A. Zocchi E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the signal(s) inducing ADP-ribosyl cyclase activation in the bone marrow stroma, however, are as yet unidentified. As ABA has been detected in mammalian tissues (20Le Page-Degivry M.-Th. Bidard J.-N. Rouvier E. Bulard C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the present data may suggest a role for the phytohormone in the regulation of human stem cell proliferation/differentiation similar to that unveiled in our distant metazoan ancestors."
https://openalex.org/W2087412583,"Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane-cleaving protease identified by its cleavage of several type II membrane signal peptides after signal peptidase cleavage. Here we describe a novel, quantitative, cell-based SPP reporter assay. This assay utilizes a substrate consisting of the NH2 terminus of the ATF6 transcription factor fused to a transmembrane domain susceptible to SPP cleavage in vitro. In cells, cleavage of the substrate releases ATF6 from the membrane. This cleavage can be monitored by detection of an epitope that is unmasked in the cleaved substrate or by luciferase activity induced by the cleaved ATF6 substrate binding to and activating an ATF6 luciferase reporter construct. Using this assay we show that (i) SPP is the first aspartyl intramembrane-cleaving protease whose activity increases proportionally to its overexpression and (ii) selectivity of various SPP and γ-secretase inhibitors can be rapidly evaluated. Because this assay was designed based on data suggesting that SPP has an orientation distinct from presenilin and cleaves type II membrane proteins, we determined whether the segment of SPP located between the two presumptive catalytic aspartates was in the lumen or cytoplasm. Using site-directed mutagenesis to insert an N-linked glycosylation site we show that a portion of this region is present in the lumen. These data provide strong evidence that although the SPP and presenilin active sites have some similarities, their presumptive catalytic domains are inverted. This assay should prove useful for additional functional studies of SPP as well as evaluation of SPP and γ-secretase inhibitors.

Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). SPP-mediated cleavage of major histocompatibility complex class I signal peptides is thought to play an important role in normal immune surveillance by generating human leukocyte antigen E peptides from the signal peptide of major histocompatibility complex class I (9Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These human leukocyte antigen E peptides are presented to natural killer cells at the cell surface. Such presentation is thought to indicate that the probed cell is healthy (10Karre K. Hansson M. Kiessling R. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 343-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another substrate cleaved by SPP is the hepatitis C virus polyprotein (5Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This cleavage appears to be essential for proper maturation of hepatitis C virus, indicating that SPP is a potential target for anti-hepatitis C virus therapy. SPP is a member of a family of homologous multipass membrane proteins, which includes presenilin 1 (PS1) and 2 (PS2) (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 2Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol.

Biochemistry (Mosc). 2002; 67: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Intramembrane cleavage by members of this family is thought to be catalyzed by two aspartates present in adjacent transmembrane domains (Fig. 1a) (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 11Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/172/RE4)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins are often characterized as a family of aspartyl intramembrane-cleaving proteases (13Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PS1 and PS2, which are catalytic components of the γ-secretase complex (14Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trends Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and SPP are the only family members to date for which a proteolytic activity has been identified. Initial studies of SPP have demonstrated that it shares some properties with the PSs. The conserved transmembrane aspartates appear to be critical for protease activity in both SPP and PSs (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

PSs and SPP differ in that PSs cleave type I membrane proteins, and SPP cleaves type II membrane proteins (12Golde T.E. Eckman C.B.

This observation has led to the hypothesis that SPP and PS may have inverted active site topologies (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Moreover, PSs seem to require three additional proteins to function as γ-secretase (22Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S.

Sambamurti K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPP activity can be reconstituted in yeast by expression of SPP alone (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). SPP was originally identified as a ∼45-kDa N-linked glycoprotein using an inhibitor-labeling approach (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We have found that SPP exists primarily as a stable ∼95-kDa homodimer within cells and that this dimer can be labeled by an active site-directed γ-secretase inhibitor (3Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that γ-secretase inhibitors can inhibit SPP activity (4Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Collectively these data suggest the active sites of SPP and PS/γ-secretase are similar. This similarity raises concerns regarding the specificity of both SPP and γ-secretase inhibitors. Although in vitro assays for γ-secretase have been developed, cell-based assays of γ-secretase activity are most widely used to monitor its activity and the effects of inhibitors. To date, the vast majority of work characterizing SPP cleavage has utilized an in vitro assay (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 4Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we describe the development of a sensitive cell-based reporter assay for SPP cleavage. This assay enables rapid evaluation of protease inhibitors and their effect on SPP and, if desired, their effects on γ-secretase in the same cell. The assay utilizes a type II membrane-bound substrate containing the ATF6 transcription factor at its amino terminus. Upon cleavage, ATF6 is released from the membrane and activates a luciferase reporter construct (28Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay we show that (i) SPP activity increases proportional to its overexpression, (ii) the parent compound of the γ-secretase inhibitor we previously used to label the SPP homodimer is indeed an inhibitor of SPP activity, and (iii) a number of SPP and γ-secretase inhibitors previously evaluated with in vitro SPP assays show similar effects in this cell based assay. Finally, by evaluating N-linked glycosylation mutants of SPP, which are active in this reporter assay, we validate the proposed topological model of SPP in which the loop region between the two transmembrane aspartate domains was proposed to be in the lumen. DNA Constructs—Mutant SPP constructs used in the glycosylation studies were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis. Expression plasmids encoding SPP substrates (SPPsub) were created in two steps. A cDNA encoding the fragment of the cytomegalovirus UL40 (gpUL40) reported to be necessary for SPP cleavage (5Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol.

The resulting DNA was then digested and cloned into the pAG3 expression vector between HindIII (5′) and XhoI (3′). A cDNA encoding the amino terminus of ATF6 was then PCR-amplified from pCGNATF6 1-373 (28Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated in-frame upstream of the gpUL40 sequences. All clones were verified by sequencing. The pGL3 5X ATF6 luciferase reporter construct has been previously described (28Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Transfection of 293 Cells—The luciferase reporter assays were performed by transiently transfecting HEK 293T cells. HEK 293T cells were plated at 70% confluency and transiently transfected using 100 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM® (Invitrogen), 8 μl of FuGENE, 0.02 μg of pRL-SV40 Renilla expression plasmid (Promega), 0.25 μg of pGL3 5×ATF6 reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of pAG3 SPPsub plasmid, and the indicated amount of an SPP expression plasmid or control plasmid to total 2 μg of DNA in each well of a 12-well plate. Cells were incubated with the transfection reagent for 6-12 h, after which the serum-deficient medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's supplemented with 8% normal calf serum (Cambrex), 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). In the experiments where inhibitors were tested, the inhibitors were added after the initial removal of the transfection reagent, and the cells were harvested 6-8 h later by lysis with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-luciferase® kit (Promega) and a Veritas microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems) with Veritas 2.0.40 software package. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Results were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity control. In some experiments, where substrate was analyzed by Western blotting, transfections were modified such that 2 μg of SPPsub and 0.2 μg of SPPNTFLAG plasmids were used. Antibodies and Western Blotting—The anti-SPPNT and anti-SPPCT antibodies have been described previously and were used at a dilution of 1:1000 (3Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PS1 was detected with anti-PS1 NH2 terminus (852B3) at 1:1000. Anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies were used at 1:1000. The anti-ATF6 antibody (Imgenex) was raised to the first 273 amino acids and recognized the NH2-terminal, pre-transmembrane portion of our substrate. This antibody was used at 1:250. Anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:750. Subcellar Fractionation—HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection method (29Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). 45 μg of SPPsub1 plasmid and 5 μg of SPPNTFLAG plasmid were added to each 15-cm plate. Cells were lysed in 150 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, by nitrogen cavitation for 1 h. The nuclei were then spun down at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was spun for 1 h at 300,000 × g, and the supernatant (S2)-containing soluble proteins and the pellet (P2)-containing integral membrane proteins were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Glycosylation Experiments—HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with either plasmids encoding SPPCTV5his or glycosylation mutant and FuGENE as described above. Cells were lysed after 48 h in 300 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). 20-μl lysate samples were treated with or without peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat. For comparison of multiple experimental values relative to controls an analysis of variance was performed using a Dunnet's post hoc t test. Variance is reported as the S.E. SPP Reporter Assay Development—Potential SPP substrates were created by fusing the NH2 terminus of human ATF6 (amino acids 1-373) with a region of cytomegalovirus gpUL40 (Fig. 1, a and b). The gpUL40 sequences include the transmembrane domain and flanking residues. A contiguous V5 and six-histidine epitope tag was inserted within the cytoplasmic region of gpUL40. Three substrates that differ at their COOH termini were generated. The first, SPPsub1 contains two point mutations in the gpUL40 (T-I-T) that were shown to be necessary for cleavage by SPP in vitro (5Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The second, SPPsub2, is identical to the first except it has a 15-residue extension at its COOH terminus that includes a signal peptidase cleavage site. The third, SPPsub3, uses the wild type gpUL40 (RIR) sequence instead of the mutant T-I-T sequence. This substrate was constructed because the wild type gpUL40 was refractory to SPP cleavage in vitro (Fig. 1b) (5Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). After transient transfection each substrate can be detected just above the ∼50-kDa marker by Western blotting with an antibody to the NH2 terminus of ATF6 (Fig. 1c) or anti-V5 antibody (not shown). SPPsubActivity Increases with Increasing SPP Concentration—To determine whether SPPsub1 could be cleaved by SPP and activate the 5×ATF6 luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 1a), we examined whether increased expression of SPP would increase the luciferase expression. For these studies, we transiently transfected 293T cells with a constant amount of the SPPsub1, 5×ATF6 luciferase reporter, and Renilla expression constructs. Varying amounts of empty vector or a SPPNTFLAG expression vector were co-transfected such that the total amount of DNA in each transfection was constant. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity to control for transfection efficiency, and activity was expressed as the percent of normalized luciferase activity relative to the amount of activity seen in cells expressing endogenous levels of SPP (SPP activity % endogenous). Transfection of increasing amounts of the SPPNTFLAG expression vector resulted in a marked increase in ∼95-kDa SPP dimer up to 100-fold higher than the level of endogenous SPP (Fig. 2a). A small amount of monomer at ∼45 kDa was observed at higher levels of SPP expression. Because SPP dimer levels increased at low SPP expression levels, a corresponding linear increase in luciferase activity (expressed as percent of endogenous SPP levels) was also observed (Fig. 2b). At the highest SPP dimer expression level, there was a clear deviation from linearity. The fitted line corresponds to best fit of the data to a rectangular hyperbola, which appears linear at the points corresponding to low SPP overexpression levels, consistent with the saturation behavior of in vivo enzyme systems. Because only the relative SPP levels and activity were plotted, the fitted values do not have physical meaning and were, therefore, not included. The effects of increasing SPP dimer expression on the SPPsub1 were directly examined by Western blotting with anti-V5 and anti-ATF6 antibodies (Fig. 1c). The level of SPPsub1 detected by anti-ATF6 did not change significantly with increasing amounts of SPP expression. However, as SPP levels and luciferase activity increased, the amount of SPPsub1 detected by anti-V5 increased dramatically (Fig. 2, c and d). Based on this observation we postulated that the V5 epitope was inaccessible in the intact substrate but unmasked by SPP cleavage. As SPP cleavage would release the cytoplasmic, NH2-terminal domain of SPPsub1 from the membrane, we examined whether the anti-V5 immunoreactive material was soluble or membrane-bound. Anti-V5 immunoreactive SPPsub1 was almost exclusively present in the soluble (S2) fraction, whereas the ATF6-immunoreactive SPPsub1 was equally distributed between the soluble (S2) fraction and the integral membrane protein (P2) fraction. PS1 and SPP, which are integral membrane proteins, were almost exclusively localized in the P2 fraction. Thus, it appears that release of SPPsub1 from the membrane unmasks the V5 epitope, indicating that the unmasking of the V5 epitope is a good indicator for cleavage and solubilization of SPPsub1.Fig. 2SPP luciferase reporter assay activity increase in a SPP concentration-dependent fashion. SPPNTFLAG expression plasmid was cotransfected into HEK 293T cells at the concentrations reported with 0.25 μg of reporter, 0.25 μg of SPPsub1, and 0.02 μg of Renilla plasmids per well as described under “Materials and Methods.” a, SPP levels increase proportionally with increasing levels of SPPNTFLAG expression plasmid. The SPP dimer (∼95 kDa) and monomer (∼45 kDa) are detected with ant-FLAG, which detects the transfected SPPNTFLAG, and anti-SPPCT, which detects both endogenous SPP and SPPNTFLAG. b, SPP luciferase activity increases with increasing SPP protein expression. Normalized reporter activity expressed as % of the activity present in cells expressing endogenous levels of SPP (% Endogenous) is plotted versus SPP protein levels expressed as % of endogenous levels of SPP dimer detected by anti-SPPCT. The fitted line corresponds to best fit of the data to a rectangular hyperbola. c and d, the amount of SPPsub1 detectable with anti-V5 increases with increasing SPPNTFLAG expression. Transient transfection of cells with SPPsub1 and SPPNTFLAG expression plasmids results in a constant level of SPPsub1 detected by the anti-ATF6. However, as SPPNTFLAG expression increases, the amount of SPPsub1 detected by anti-V5 increases. In d, the amount of anti-V5 detectable SPPsub1 is plotted versus the amount of SPPNTFLAG DNA transfected, demonstrating the increase in the anti-V5 signal with increasing SPPNTFLAG levels. e, cleavage of SPPsub1 releases the amino terminus from the membrane and unmasks the V5 epitope. The majority of anti-V5 detectable SPPsub1 is in the soluble S2 supernatant. Conversely, the anti-ATF6-positive SPPsub1 bands are relatively equivalent in both the soluble supernatant fraction (S2) and the membrane pellet (P2). Membrane proteins such as SPP and PS1 are detected primarily in the P2 membrane pellet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SPPsub1Is Not Cleaved by PS1—To further demonstrate that the SPP-dependent increase in reporter activity and unmasking of the V5 epitope of SPPsub1 was a specific and sensitive indicator of SPP activity, we performed a number of additional studies. First, we tested for specificity by determining whether PS1, another aspartyl intramembrane-cleaving protease, increased luciferase activity in this assay. Neither wild type PS1 nor a FAD-linked PS1 mutant (M139V) altered luciferase activity (Fig. 3a) despite increased PS1 expression levels (Fig. 3b). In addition to the SPPNTFLAG construct, we also examined two additional SPP constructs, a wild type SPP expression construct and a V5 His COOH-terminal-tagged SPP construct (SPPCTV5his). All three constructs resulted in significant increases in luciferase activity (Fig. 3a). Whereas the level of activity relative to protein levels was similar for the wild type SPP and SPPNTFLAG, SPPCTV5his expression resulted in a high level of activity compared with SPP protein levels (Fig. 3b). The relative increase in activity seen with SPPCTV5his could be attributable to disruption of a putative ER retrieval signal (KKXX) by the addition of the epitope tag at the COOH terminus. However, to date our studies on localization of this construct have not revealed major differences in its subcellular distribution relative to the wild type construct or the NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged construct (3Nyborg A.C.

Effects of SPP and γ-Secretase Inhibitors—Having demonstrated that the SPPsub1 reporter luciferase activity is proportional to SPP expression but not altered by two other family members, we evaluated several protease inhibitors for their effect on reporter activity. Inhibition of activity was assessed in cells expressing endogenous SPP and cells transiently overexpressing SPPNTFLAG (Fig. 3, c and d). Similar results were seen for both conditions. An SPP selective inhibitor (Z-LL)2 ketone and a γ-secretase inhibitor, LY411,575, previously shown to inhibit SPP (4Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G.

III-31-C, a transition state γ-secretase inhibitor (30Kornilova A.Y. Das C. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol.

This compound is the parent compound to III-63, which we have shown binds the SPP homodimer (3Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol.

Corresponding to a high and low affinity ligand binding site, sauvagine and other peptidic CRFR1 ligands evoked high and low potency responses of G protein activation, differing by 64-fold in their EC50 values as measured by stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding. Contrary to the low potency response, the high potency response was of lower GTPγS affinity, pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive, and homologously desensitized. Distinct desensitization was also observed in the adenylate cyclase activity, when its high potency stimulation was abolished and the activity became low potently inhibited by sauvagine. From these results and immunoprecipitation of [35S]GTPγS-bound Gαs and Gαi subunits it is concluded that the high and low potency [35S]GTPγS binding stimulation reflected coupling to Gs and Gi proteins, respectively, only Gs coupling being homologously desensitized. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]GTPγS-bound Gαq/11 revealed additional coupling to Gq/11, which also was homologously desensitized. Although Gαq/11 coupling was PTX-insensitive, half of the sauvagine-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates in the cells was PTX-sensitive, suggesting involvement of Gi in addition to Gq/11in the stimulation of inositol metabolism. It is concluded that CRFR1 signals through at least two different ways, one leading to Gs- and Gq/11-mediated signaling steps and desensitization and another leading to Gi -mediated signals without being desensitized. Furthermore, the concentrations of the stimulating ligand and GTP and desensitization may be part of a regulatory mechanism determining the actual ratio of the coupling of CRFR1 to different G proteins.

The different expressions of the CRF receptor types and their ligands in tissues (for review, see Ref. 3Dautzenberg F.M. Hauger R.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) suggest that they are involved differently in the manifold physiological functions of the CRF receptor system. The CRF receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). So far, CRFR1 and CRFR2 have been shown to couple to Gs proteins, leading to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase in native tissues and cells, in various brain-derived and peripheral cell lines, and in cells transfected with the receptors (for review, see Refs. 2Dieterich K.D. Lehnert H. de-Souza E.B. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 105: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 3Dautzenberg F.M. Hauger R.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Additionally, by using the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog [α-32P]GTPγ-azidoanilide to label the G proteins when activated by the receptor, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific G protein antibodies, it was shown that the human CRFR1 is able to activate, in addition to Gs, also Gi and Gq in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the receptor (13Grammatopoulos D.K.

Levine M.A. Kanellopoulou K.A. Hillhouse E.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From these results second messengers other than cAMP or even inhibition of cAMP levels might be additionally implicated in CRF signaling. Indeed, urocortin was found to activate the Gq/phospholipase C/inositol triphosphate/protein kinase C pathway in HEK293 cells expressing the human subtype CRFR1α (14Grammatopoulos D.K. Randeva H.S. Levine M.A. Katsanou E.S. Hilhouse E.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2076-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). From the above mentioned findings it is suggested that the CRFR1 adds to the growing list of GPCRs that simultaneously couple to unrelated G proteins and show multiple signaling (16Hermans E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 99: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To come to conclusions on the regulation of the G protein coupling of CRFR1, in this investigation we studied the conditions for the coupling of the CRFR1 to different G protein classes as well as the functional consequences and relations to the receptor activation, using HEK cells stably transfected with the rat receptor as cellular model. Materials—All peptidic ligands of CRFR1 used (sauvagine, 3-I-Tyr0,Gln1-sauvagine, urocortin, urotensin I, oCRF, r/hCRF, α-helical CRF(9–41)) were synthesized in our laboratory. [35S]GTPγS (1,250 Ci/mmol), [125I]Tyr0-sauvagine (2200 Ci/mmol), and [3H]cAMP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]ATP and myo-[2-3H]inositol were from Amersham Biosciences. cDNA encoding for rCRFR1 was a gift of U. B. Kaupp (Jülich, Germany). LipofectAMINE was obtained from Invitrogen; G418 from Calbiochem; and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, PTX, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B from Sigma. Three affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-G protein antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used: Gαs/olf (C-18), raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of Gαs of rat origin; Gαi3 (C-10), raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of Gαi3 of rat origin, which reacts with Gαi3, Gαi1, and to a lesser extent with Gαi2 of mouse, rat, human, and bovine origin; and Gαq/11 (C-19), raised against a peptide mapping within a domain common to Gαq and Gα11 of mouse origin which reacts with Gαq and Gα11 of mammalian origin. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection with rCRFR1—HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For stable expression, HEK293 cells were plated in 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/dish, grown overnight, and transfected with cDNA encoding for rCRFR1 in the expression vector pcDNA3, using LipofectAMINE. G418-resistant cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Clones of G418-resistant cells were examined for [125I]Tyr0-sauvagine binding to detect cells that expressed CRFR1. Nontransfected and stably transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/dish and grown at 37 °C to about 90% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing additionally 400 μg/ml G418 for the stably transfected cells. The cells were harvested 96 h after seeding. In some cases, 100–200 ng/ml PTX was added to part of the stably transfected cells 24 h before harvesting the cells to inactivate the Gi proteins. When desensitization of the receptor was studied, the cells were incubated with 1 μm sauvagine for 24 h followed by extensive washing (eight times with cell culture medium over 2 h at 37 °C) to allow for total clearance of the ligand. HEK Cell Membrane Preparation—Cells were washed with and collected by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, the cells were suspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 27% sucrose) and homogenized by a Teflon-glass homogenizer (10 strokes, 750 rpm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar). Membranes obtained from HEK293 cells stably transfected with rCRFR1 are designated HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranes. Receptor/G Protein Coupling Estimated by Binding of [35S]GTPγS to HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes—3–10 μg of membrane protein was incubated in triplicate at 25 °C with generally 100 pm [35S]GTPγS in a total volume of 500 μl of medium consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm GDP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.15 mm bacitracin (binding medium) for usually 120 min. The reaction was terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel harvester (Gaithersburg, MD), and the filters were counted for 35S activity. Concentration-response curves for the stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by activation of the CRF receptor by the peptide ligands sauvagine, 3-I-Tyr0,Gln1-sauvagine, urocortin, urotensin I, r/hCRF, and oCRF were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program PRISM 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). From response curves of sauvagine in the absence and presence of the CRFR antagonist α-helical CRF(9–41), Schild plots were constructed to characterize the influence of the antagonist on the ligand-evoked [35S]GTPγS binding. The affinities and capacities (Bmax) of the basal binding of [35S]GTPγS (in the absence of stimulating ligand) and of the binding maximally stimulated by sauvagine were determined by displacement curves of the tracer binding by unlabeled GTPγS and fitting the curves by the program KELL 6 (BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK). In dissociation experiments the membranes were incubated with [35S]GTPγS and with and without sauvagine for 90 min at 25 °C. After chilling in ice, the membranes were centrifuged, resuspended in fresh medium containing 1 μm unlabeled GTPγS, and incubated at 25 °C to initiate the dissociation for different times at 25 °C. It was checked that in ice no dissociation at all occurred. Receptor/G Protein Coupling Estimated by Immunoprecipitation of [35S]GTPγS-bound Gαs, Gαi, and Gαq Subunits—Essentially, the protocol given in Ref. 18Akam E.C. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar was followed. About 75 μg of HEK-rCRFR1 cell membrane protein was incubated with [35S]GTPγS in the absence (basal) or presence (stimulated) of 1 μm sauvagine in 110 μl of the above binding medium containing 1 μm GDP at 25 °C for 30 min. 10 μg/ml saponin was included in the incubations, which increased the stimulation over the basal signal. The incubation was terminated by adding 900 μl of ice-cold medium, and the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 6 min. Membrane proteins were solubilized in 50 μl of precipitation buffer consisting of 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, on ice for 1 h. After adding an equal volume of precipitation buffer, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min. 10 μl of the anti-Gαs, anti-Gαi3, or anti-Gαq/11 subunit antibody was added to 100 μl of the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 100 μl of the antibody-G protein reaction mixture was incubated under shaking at 4 °C for 4 h with 3.3 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, which had been swollen and washed with precipitation buffer before. Then the beads were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 1 min, washed with precipitation buffer, mixed with scintillation mixture, and counted for 35S. CRFR1 Binding Assay in HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes—Hot [125I]Tyr0-sauvagine saturation binding curves were obtained from incubations of the tracer with 7–17 μg of membrane protein at 25 °C for 2 h in 300 μl of medium exactly the same as used in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay (see above). To cover the wide ligand concentration range from about 5 × 10–12 up to 2 × 10–7m, two tracer stock solutions were prepared in which the specific radioactivities were reduced from originally 2,200 Ci/mmol to 5–46 and 243–361 Ci/mmol with unlabeled 3-I-Tyr0,Gln1-sauvagine. In five experiments, each eight experimental points were determined in the low and high ligand concentration range using the high and low activity tracer, respectively. Nonspecific binding for all tracer concentrations was determined by adding 1 μm 3-I-Tyr0,Gln1-sauvagine. The samples were filtered through GF/C filters (Whatman) in a Brandel harvester. From the data of the two separate binding curves a common curve was calculated and fitted by the program KELL 6. Adenylate Cyclase Activity in HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes—About 20 μg of membrane protein from HEK-rCRFR1 cells was incubated in duplicate in a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm cAMP, 100 μm ATP, 10 μm GTP, 1 mm DTT, 0.75 μCi [32P]ATP, 5.1 mg/ml phosphocreatine, 1.32 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 12 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 μl for 20 min at 32 °C. Sauvagine at the indicated concentrations was added to determine concentration-response curves. The incubations were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of a solution that contained 4 mm ATP, 1.4 mm cAMP, 2% SDS, and 1 mm [3H]cAMP (about 10,000 cpm). [32P]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on columns of Dowex cation exchange resin and aluminum oxide and corrected for [3H]cAMP recovery (19Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program PRISM. Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate Accumulation in HEK-rCRFR1 Cells— The assay was performed according to Ref. 20Kirk C.J. Morris A.J. Shears S.B. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1990: 151-184Google Scholar. Briefly, HEK-rCRFR1 cells (100,000/well) were grown in 24-well plates in culture medium. After preincubation with 74 kBq/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol for 20 h in the absence and presence of 200 ng/ml PTX, the cells were stimulated with different concentrations of sauvagine for 60 min in culture medium without fetal calf serum containing additionally 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm LiCl. The cells were lysed with 150 μl/well 0.1 n NaOH, and subsequently 50 μl of 0.2 m formic acid, 1,000 μl of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, and 1,000 μl 0.5 mm EDTA were added. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to anion exchange chromatography on SepPak Vac 3-ml Waters Accel™ Plus QMA cartridges. [3H]Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was eluted with 0.1 m formic acid and 0.4 m ammonium formate and counted. Concentration-response curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program PRISM. Optimum Conditions for rCRFR1-activated [35S]GTPγS Binding to HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes—Stimulation by sauvagine of [35S]GTPγS binding to HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranes, used as a measure of total G protein activation, was systematically optimized by examining the effects of factors known to be critical in GPCR-evoked GTP binding, GDP, MgCl2, NaCl, DTT, [35S]GTPγS, temperature, and time. The optimum incubation conditions for a maximum ratio of stimulated:basal binding and, at the same time, high bound activities, were selected to be 0.1 μm GDP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 pm [35S]GTPγS tracer, without DTT, which decreased at low concentrations (0.1–1 mm) selectively the stimulation of binding by sauvagine and at higher concentration basal and stimulated binding uniformly. The influence of DTT is in line with findings showing that disulfide bonds in the extracellular amino-terminal part of the CRFR1 are important for the formation of the active receptor state (21Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Basal and stimulated binding increased time-dependently both with halflives of about 30 min at, consequently, constant relative stimulation over basal at 25 °C. Under the optimum conditions, during incubation over 2 h about 230 fmol [35S]GTPγS/mg of protein was bound in the absence of a stimulating CRF agonist, and this amount bound was increased by 80–160% by the CRF agonists. No stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by sauvagine to membranes obtained from nontransfected HEK cells was observed. rCRFR1/G Protein Coupling Estimated by CRFR1 Agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS Binding to HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes and to Gαs, Gαi, and Gαq Subunits in the Membranes— Using intact membranes, concentration-response curves of all peptidic CRFR1 agonists studied were clearly biphasic, resulting in two EC50 values corresponding to high potency and low potency responses around EC50(h) 5 × 10–11m and EC50 (l) 3 × 10–9m, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table I). On average, low and high potencies differed in their EC50 values by 64.2 ± 9.3-fold, and the part of high potency response was calculated to be 27.76 ± 1.54% of the maximum activity for the sum of both response phases at 100 pm tracer (from all peptides, n = 21). All agonists stimulated the binding to the same maximum activity (Fig. 2). When the concentration of [35S]GTPγS was increased from 100 to 1,000 pm, the EC50 values for sauvagine did not significantly change; however, the part of high potency phase increased from 27.8% to more than 50% (inset in Fig. 1), at a reduced stimulation over basal of 35.2% compared with about 105% at 100 pm tracer.Table IPotencies of CRF receptor agonists for stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranesLigandEC50(h)EC50(l)EC50(l)/EC50(h)mmUrocortin9.98 × 10-12 ± 2.87 × 10-126.10 × 10-10 ± 1.73 × 10-1061.2Urotensin I2.56 × 10-11 ± 5.21 × 10-121.44 × 10-9 ± 5.76 × 10-1056.0Sauvagine3.15 × 10-11 ± 7.50 × 10-121.40 × 10-9 ± 3.86 × 10-1044.53-I-Tyr0,Gln1-sauvigne3.24 × 10-11 ± 7.08 × 10-123.23 × 10-9 ± 4.76 × 10-1099.7r/hCRF4.89 × 10-11 ± 6.72 × 10-124.02 × 10-9 ± 1.26 × 10-982.20CRF1.50 × 10-10 ± 1.01 × 10-106.20 × 10-9 ± 1.40 × 10-941.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Maximum stimulation over basal of [35S]GTPγS binding to HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranes by CRF receptor ligands. Data were estimated from the concentration-response curves as given in Fig. 1.

The Schild plot (not shown) from these data resulted in Schild constants Ka (1Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4019) Google Scholar) of 9.21 × 10–9m (±2.98 × 10–9) and Ka (2Dieterich K.D. Lehnert H. de-Souza E.B. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 105: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) of 4.77 × 10–9m (±1.25 × 10–10) for the high and low potency responses, respectively, which showed that the compound antagonized both responses equally. As expected from the biphasic concentration-response curves obtained with the membranes, CRFR1 did not couple only to Gs protein as generally functionally observed. Anti-Gαs, anti-Gαi3, and anti-Gαq/11 antibodies precipitated solubilized [35S]-GTPγS-bound protein obtained from the membranes in significantly higher amounts after stimulation with sauvagine as well as compared with native HEK cell membranes (Fig. 4). Affinity and Dissociation of [35S]GTPγS Binding to HEK-rCRFR1 Cell Membranes—GTPγS binding isotherms for basal binding and binding stimulated by sauvagine were fitted according to a one-site and two-site binding model, respectively (Fig. 5A and Table II). The results show clearly that sauvagine stimulated binding by increasing the apparent affinity of the nucleotide binding site to GTPγS by more than 10-fold (Kd 5 × 10–10m). This increase in affinity should not only be the result of accelerated dissociation of GDP from the binding site but also because of a real increase in affinity of the site because even in the absence of GDP the affinity was increased by receptor stimulation (data not shown). Nevertheless, the nonstimulated binding sites had a rather high affinity (Kd about 1 × 10–8m), discriminating them from any nonspecific binding. It must be noted that the parameters given in Table II (including those after pretreatment of the cells with PTX, see below) are, although exact with respect to the models used, rather rough because the continuous displacement curves (Fig. 5) did not allow a clear definition of nonspecific binding for calculations. For this reason, the nonspecific binding had to be tested to give good fits. More realistically, the binding curves seem to reflect a continuum of several binding sites, which is deduced further from the dissociation experiments (Fig. 6). Dissociation of [35S]GTPγS from basal and stimulated binding sites proceeded similarly, but the basal activity dissociated more rapidly. The curves could not be fitted to simple models, and, furthermore, after a relatively rapid dissociation phase about 70% of occupied sites remained dissociating only very slowly after more than 2 h.Table IIAffinities (Kd) and capacities (Bmax) of basal and sauvagine-stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranes without (total G protein binding) and after pretreatment of the cells with PTX (Gs protein binding)PretreatmentBasal0.1 μm SauvagineHigh affinityLow affinityKdKd1Kd2mmmNone6.52 × 10-9 ± 1.20 × 10-95.00 × 10-10 ± 1.68 × 10-102.59 × 10-8 ± 1.13 × 10-8PTX1.06 × 10-8 ± 1.53 × 10-91.25 × 10-9 ± 4.71 × 10-113.74 × 10-8 ± 1.02 × 10-9BmaxBmax1Bmax2pmol/mgpmol/mgpmol/mgNone13.17 ± 0.751.90 ± 0.1518.04 ± 3.00PTX15.18 ± 2.992.07 ± 0.1924.81 ± 2.63 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Dissociation kinetics of [35S]GTPγS binding to HEK-rCRFR1 cell membranes. About 100 pm [35S]GTPγS was incubated with the membranes at 25 °C for 90 min in binding medium without (basal) and with 0.1 μm sauvagine (stimulated).

At 100 pm [35S]GTPγS, the remaining activity comprised 23.9 ± 0.94% (Fig. 2) of that obtained with untreated cells (from three experiments with sauvagine and each one with the other peptides), which closely corresponded to 27.76% activity as found for the portion of high potency response in untreated cells (see above). Furthermore, the EC50 values closely corresponded to those obtained for the high potency response with untreated cell membranes, being, on average from all peptide curves, 0.55 ± 0.07-fold (for sauvagine from three experiments EC50 1.63 × 10–11± 5.74 × 10–12m compared with 3.11 × 10–11m in untreated membranes). These results suggested that the low potency PTX-sensitive phase represented coupling to Gi proteins, and the high potency phase coupling to Gs. PTX treatment also abolished the sauvagine-evoked increase of Gαi-[35S]GTPγS immunoprecipitate, but not that of Gαs and Gαq/11 (Fig. 4). From GTPγS binding isotherms as shown in Fig. 5 it was calculated that the affinity of the stimulated binding sites after PTX pretreatment of the cells was decreased from Kd1 5 × 10–10 to 1.25 × 10–9m and that the amounts of stimulated binding sites before and after PTX treatment did not significantly differ (Bmax1 1.90 and 2.07 pmol/mg protein, respectively, Table II). The last fact may be explained by the limitations of the fits of the binding curves (Fig. 5) as discussed a"
https://openalex.org/W2047167858,"The ETS1 transcription factor is a member of the Ets family of conserved sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. ETS1 has been shown to play important roles in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, lymphoid development, motility, invasion and angiogenesis. These diverse roles of ETS1 are likely to be dependent on specific protein interactions. To identify proteins that interact with ETS1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted. Here, we describe the functional interaction between SP100 and ETS1. SP100 protein interacts with ETS1 both in vitro and in vivo. SP100 is localized to nuclear bodies and ETS1 expression alters the nuclear body morphology in living cells. SP100 negatively modulates ETS1 transcriptional activation of the MMP1 and uPA promoters in a dose-dependent manner, decreases the expression of these endogenous genes, and reduces ETS1 DNA binding. Expression of SP100 inhibits the invasion of breast cancer cells and is induced by Interferon-alpha, which has been shown to inhibit the invasion of cancer cells. These data demonstrate that SP100 modulates ETS1-dependent biological processes."

https://openalex.org/W2076743305,"The B cell adaptor molecule of 32 kDa (Bam32) is an adaptor that links the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) to ERK and JNK activation and ultimately to mitogenesis. After BCR cross-linking, Bam32 is recruited to the plasma membrane and accumulates within F-actin-rich membrane ruffles. Bam32 contains one Src homology 2 and one pleckstrin homology domain and is phosphorylated at a single site, tyrosine 139. To define the function of Bam32 in membrane-proximal signaling events, we established human B cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutant Bam32 proteins. The basal level of F-actin increased in cells expressing wild-type or myristoylated Bam32 but decreased in cells expressing either an Src homology-2 or Tyr-139 Bam32 mutant. Overexpression of wild-type Bam32 also affected BCR-induced actin remodeling, which was visualized as increases in F-actin-rich membrane ruffles. In contrast, Bam32 mutants largely blocked the BCR-induced increase in cellular F-actin. The positive and negative effects of Bam32 variants on F-actin levels were closely mirrored by their effects on the activation of the GTPase Rac1, which is known to regulate actin remodeling in lymphocytes. Bam32-deficient DT40 B cells showed decreased Rac1 activation and a failure of Rac1 to co-localize with the BCR, whereas cells overexpressing Bam32 had increased constitutive Rac1 activation. These results suggest that Bam32 regulates the cytoskeleton through Rac1. Bam32 variants also affected downstream signaling to JNK in a manner similar to that of Rac1, suggesting that the effect of Bam32 on JNK activation may be at least partially mediated through Rac1. Our results demonstrate a novel phosphorylation-dependent function of Bam32 in regulating Rac1 activation and actin remodeling."

They complement each other's active sites in a way that the ABC signature motif (LSGGQ) of one subunit interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP, bound at the Walker motifs of the opposite subunit. In the present study, the conserved glycines in the fourth position of the LSGGQ motifs of human MRP1 were substituted for aspartic acids (G771D and G1433D), the mutants were expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and the nucleotideas well as the transported substrate-protein interactions were studied. We found that these transport- and ATPase-incompetent mutants showed no nucleotide trapping under any of the conditions examined. However, when measuring the effect of nucleotide and transported substrates on the vanadate-induced cleavage reactions, we found that the effect of substrates on the cleavage reactions was significantly different in the mutant MRP1 proteins than in the wild type. Although the transported substrates (e.g. etoposide + oxidized glutathione) stimulated the formation of the posthydrolytic complex in the wild type, this reaction was inhibited in the signature mutants. Our study also revealed that a similar mutation in the ABC signature of either ABC unit resulted in the same effect. We suggest that the conserved glycine residues in both LSGGQ segments are part of the conformational network, which is responsible for the accelerated hydrolytic activity upon interaction of the protein with its transported substrates.

All of the proteins in this family consist of two kinds of major polypeptide regions: transmembrane domains, usually with six membrane-spanning helices, and conservative ABC units. The ABC units harbor two consensus polypeptide sequences, the so called Walker A and Walker B (2Walker J.E. Sarate M. RunsWick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1981; 1: 945-951Crossref Scopus (4234) Google Scholar), which are present in many ATP-binding and/or utilizing proteins. In addition, in all ABC transporters a short, highly conserved polypeptide motif, the signature region, is found between the two Walker motifs, which is diagnostic for the whole superfamily (3Hyde S.C.

This presumes an intramolecular interaction between the two regions, which mediates the allosteric effect of the drugs on the ATP hydrolysis. No high resolution three-dimensional structure is available as yet for any of the mammalian ABC transporters, but there are several bacterial structures determined. The structure of Rad50cd, a bacterial ABC-ABC ATPase, represents two functionally interacting ABC subunits, dimerizing in a head-to-tail orientation (11Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L.

In this dimer, the two ABC domains complement each other's active sites, forming composite catalytic centers. According to the structure, the Walker A sequence of one subunit and the ABC signature motif of the opposite one are involved in the formation of an ATP-binding site, and the two ATP molecules are completely buried in the dimer interface. Comparison of the structures of the ATP-free and ATP-bound Rad50cds revealed a nucleotide-mediated movement of the lobe including the LSGGQ motif toward the bound ATP molecule within the opposite subunit (11Hopfner K.P.

This movement, which might be a general feature in ABC proteins, may provide the structural requirement for the completion of the catalytic site. This conformational change may ensure the precise geometry of the active catalytic sites.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). However, in a recent review this arrangement has been challenged in the case of the MsbA transporter of V. cholera (14Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recently, in an elegant work, vanadate-induced cleavage of the bacterial MalFGK2 homodimeric ABC transporter was used to demonstrate the molecular proximity of the two ABC units and supported the “composite active center model” of the ABC ATPases (15Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In an other study, cysteines were introduced into the signature and Walker A motifs of a Cys-less version of human MDR1, and the mutants were subjected to oxidative cross-linking. On the basis of the experiments, the authors concluded that the signature sequence of one ABC unit is adjacent to the Walker A motif of the opposing ABC (16Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they studied the effect of drug binding on cross-linking in the same experimental system (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Substrates stimulating the ATPase activity increased, whereas those that inhibit the ATPase activity decreased the rate of cross-linking. These results demonstrate that drug binding to the transmembrane domains can induce conformational changes within the ABC domains. Similar to ATP hydrolysis, the rate of the posthydrolytic transition state formation (“nucleotide trapping”) in ABC transporters is accelerated by the transported drug substrates (18Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Szabó K. Welker E. Bakos É. Müller M. Roninson I. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that nucleotide trapping in MDR1 signature mutants was inhibited, instead of accelerated, in the presence of substrates, suggesting a miscommunication between the drug-binding site(s) and the catalytic domains in these mutants (20Szakács G. Özvegy Cs. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the characteristic rotation of the ABC signature motif found in the Rad50cd is an element of the drug-induced allosteric control of MDR1-ATPase activity, too. This conformational change ensures the precise geometry of the active catalytic site(s) in the wild type protein but is not proper when a critical residue of either ABC signature motif is mutated. The aim of the present study was to characterize the highly conserved ABC signature regions in the ABC units of MRP1. In the experiments reported here, we have examined the effects of substitution of a conservative amino acid in the ABC signature regions of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal half of MRP1. The conserved glycines in the fourth position of the signature motifs (LSGGQ) were substituted for aspartic acids (G771D and G1433D). We have expressed the wild type and mutant MRP1 proteins in the baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell expression system, and the nucleotide- and substrate-MRP1 interactions were studied. In our recent work we have identified three orthovanadate cleavage sites within MRP1 and found that the initial rate of cleavage reactions were influenced by the presence of nucleotides and by transported substrates (25Kern A. Szentpétery Zs. Liliom K. Bakos É. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we utilized this experimental approach to elucidate the possible role of the conserved glycine residues of the ABC signature regions of MRP1 in the catalytic cycle. Construction of the Recombinant Transfer Vectors—For cloning various cDNA constructs, the modified baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW21-L was used (20Szakács G. Özvegy Cs. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR (21Horton R.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 251-268Google Scholar) with pAcUW21-l-MRP1 as template. Sequencing was performed to confirm the mutations and to ensure that no additional mutations occurred. Generation of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Recombinant baculoviruses were generated, and Sf9 (Spodoptera frugipedra ovarian) cells were infected and cultured as described by Bakos et al. (22Bakos É. Klein I. Welker E. Szabó K. Müller M. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Individual clones expressing a high level of the MRP1 variants were obtained by end point dilution and subsequent amplification. For functional characterization the virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested, the membrane fractions were isolated, the membrane protein concentrations were determined as described earlier (22Bakos É. Klein I. Welker E. Szabó K. Müller M. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity Labeling by [α-32P]8-Azido-ATP—This method has been described in detail (19Szabó K. Welker E. Bakos É. Müller M. Roninson I. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, isolated Sf9 cell membranes were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μm final concentration of 8-azido-ATP (Sigma) containing 0.1 MBq of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (Affinity Labeling Technologies; 10.8 Ci/mmol), with or without trapping agent. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm MgATP. The membranes were washed twice in the same buffer and then irradiated for 3 min with UV (λmax about 250 nm) at a distance of 3 cm at 4 °C. The labeled samples were run on 7.5% Laemmli-type SDS-containing gels, the proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the blots were dried and subjected to quantitative autoradiography in a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The identity of the labeled bands was confirmed by immunostaining of the same blot with anti-MRP1 monoclonal antibody m6 (24Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar). Vanadate-induced Photo-oxidative Cleavage—Vanadate-induced cleavage reaction was performed as described by Kern et al. (25Kern A. Szentpétery Zs. Liliom K. Bakos É. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples containing the isolated Sf9 cell membranes (20Szakács G. Özvegy Cs. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar μg) expressing wild type MRP1 (or its signature mutants) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of 800 μm sodium orthovanadate and in the presence or absence of transported substrates in the reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Various concentrations of MgATP were subsequently added to the samples (as indicated in the figures) in the final volume of 40 μl, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 and 20 min for obtaining N- and C-terminal cleavage, respectively. After incubation the reaction mixture was immediately transferred to ice and placed under a 265-nm ultraviolet lamp at a distance of 5 cm. The samples were irradiated for 10 and 2 min for N- and C-terminal cleavage, respectively. After irradiation 10 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-PO4, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added to the reaction mixture, and the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis (23Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of human MRP1 with m6 (mouse monoclonal antibody, 10,000× diluted) anti-MRP monoclonal antibody was performed as described (24Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar). The second antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (anti-mouse, peroxidase-conjugated donkey IgG, 10,000× diluted). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantified by densitometry on ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. The data were analyzed by the KaleidaGraph software package (Synergy Software). We have recently reported the expression and the preliminary characterization of ABC signature mutants of human MRP1 (26Szentpétery Zs. Sarkadi B. Bakos É. Váradi A. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 449-455PubMed Google Scholar). In the transport- and ATPase-incompetent mutants the conserved glycines in the fourth position of the LSGGQ motifs were substituted with glutamic acids (G771D and G1433D). It was found that the specific MgATP binding was preserved, but the occluded nucleotide state (“vanadate trapping”) could not be detected. We concluded that the conserved glycine residues in the fourth position of the LSGGQ motifs are essential in MRP1-related function, but the specific role of these residues could not be determined. The motor domain of myosin was crystallized in the presence of different anions, like vanadate (27Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), fluoro-aluminate (28Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 29Xu Y.-W. Moréra S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 3579-3583Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and beryllium fluoride (28Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and it was found that the different complexes stabilized by the different anions reflect various states of ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, we performed nucleotide trapping experiments using beryllium fluoride and AlF4 as inhibitory anions to stabilize the trapped MgADP in the catalytic center after hydrolysis. In experiments documented in Fig. 1A, isolated Sf9 membrane containing the wild type MRP1 and its signature mutants were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, in the presence of AlF4 as inhibitory anion, and 5 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. Wild type MRP1 showed significant ADP-trapping ability in all cases, whereas radioactive signal was absent from control membranes prepared from cells expressing β-galactosidase. When LTC4, a substrate and stimulator of the MRP1 ATPase activity, was also included in the reaction mixture, it had a stimulatory effect on the nucleotide trapping of the wild type MRP1 (second lane). A similar stimulatory effect of etoposide (0.5 mm) + GSSG (2 mm) was observed (third lane). We have seen the same results in the presence of Vi or beryllium fluoride (not shown here). The trapping ability of the G771D and G1433D mutants was investigated under the same conditions as the wild type. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mutants, although possessing 8-azido-ATP binding (26Szentpétery Zs. Sarkadi B. Bakos É. Váradi A. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 449-455PubMed Google Scholar), did not perform any nucleotide trapping if different inhibitory anions (Vi or beryllium fluoride) and a higher 8-azido-ATP concentration (20 μm) were used (data not shown). The corresponding immunoblots ensured that equal amounts of the MRP1 variants were applied in all experiments (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1B). No signal could be observed when either LTC4 (fifth and eighth lanes) or etoposide (0.5 mm) + GSSG (2 mm) (sixth and ninth lanes) were present. Collectively, these data indicate that in the G771D and G1433D signature mutants the MRP1*MgADP*anion transition state-like complex formation cannot be detected by azido-ATP labeling. As we demonstrated recently, the vanadate-catalyzed photooxidative cleavage reaction is also suitable for studying the individual steps of the ATPase cycle and for characterizing MRP1 interactions with nucleotide and transported substrates (25Kern A. Szentpétery Zs. Liliom K. Bakos É. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that in the case of wild type MRP1, three cleavage sites can be identified, at which the initial rate of the vanadate-induced cleavage is sensitive to the nucleotide-MRP1 as well as to transported substrate-MRP1 interaction. We have mapped the approximate positions of the cleavage sites within the linear sequence of MRP1. Fig. 2 shows the membrane topology model and the domain arrangement of MRP1 (30Tusnády G.E. Bakos É. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the putative sites of the vanadate-induced photo-oxidative cleavage within the polypeptide chain. The positions of the mutations are also indicated in the figure.

Open table in a new tab The Sf9 membrane samples containing human MRP1 or its signature mutants were subjected to photo-oxidative cleavage reaction as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. In the following experiments a monoclonal antibody, m6, recognizing an extreme C-terminal epitope (Ref. 24Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar; the position of the m6 epitope is indicated in Fig. 2) was used for immunodetection. The cleavage found in the mutant variants was always compared with that of the wild type MRP1. First, we analyzed the high molecular weight products of Vi-induced photocleavage performed in the presence of orthovanadate (800 μm). The cleavage reactions were performed in the presence of various concentrations of MgATP (0–500 μm) at 37 °C, and the cleavage products were analyzed by using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, if Vi was absent no specific cleavage product appeared (Fig. 3A, lane 1, on each gel). If no nucleotide was present in the cleavage reaction of MRP1, a 95-kDa cleavage product (corresponding to cleavage at site I; see Fig. 2), well recognized by the C-terminal antibody, was apparent. However, when MgATP was included into the reaction mixture, the amount of the 95-kDa product was decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion. Upon increasing the MgATP concentration in the reaction mixture, a cleavage product with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa (corresponding to cleavage at site II; see Fig. 2) also appeared (Fig. 3A, top gel). Analysis of high molecular cleavage products of the signature mutants revealed that cleavage at site I is similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 3A, middle and bottom gels). On the basis of the determination of the f95, the concentration-dependent inhibition of cleavage at site I was quantitatively evaluated by densitometry (Fig. 3B). The apparent half-maximal effect was at 5.6 ± 1.0 μm MgATP in the case of the wild type MRP1. The half-maximal concentration of inhibition was 19.2 ± 2.1 and 30.9 ± 5.9 μm MgATP for G771D and G1433D, respectively. The differences in the apparent half-maximal effect of MgATP inhibition may be explained by lower affinity of the mutants toward MgATP. Only a low level of cleavage product of G771D and G1433D mutants, resulting in the 85-kDa product, was observed in the full concentration range (0–500 μm) examined, and the cleavage product appeared even in the absence of added nucleotide (Fig. 3A, middle and bottom gels). This suggests that the signal of 85-kDa product triggered by the Vi-induced cleavage of the mutants is nonspecific, because it is not affected by increasing ATP concentration in the reaction mixture. Next, we investigated the generation of the 25-kDa MRP1 cleavage product and the MgATP concentration dependence of cleavage at site III at 37 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting from 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the m6 monoclonal antibody was used for detection again. As demonstrated earlier (25Kern A. Szentpétery Zs. Liliom K. Bakos É. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), low concentration of MgATP (0.1 μM) results in cleavage at Site III in MRP1, and the yield of the cleavage product increases up to 1 μm MgATP (see also Fig. 4A, top gel). Thereafter the yield of cleavage decreases gradually as the concentration of MgATP is increased, and in the presence of 50 μm MgATP practically no cleavage is detected (the cleavage was dependent on the presence of vanadate (see first lane). A similar complex nucleotide concentration dependence of the cleavage at site III was observed in the case of both mutants (Fig. 4A, middle and bottom gels). The quantitative evaluation of the 25-kDa product by densitometry in the Vi-induced cleavage reaction showed a biphasic effect of the nucleotide concentration (Fig. 4B). This analysis also revealed certain differences in the bell-shaped nucleotide dependence of cleavage at site III in MRP1 as compared with its signature mutants. In wild type MRP1 the increase of yield was detected up to 1 μm, which was followed by immediate decrease at higher MgATP concentrations (1–500 μm) and complete disappearance of cleavage at 50 μm. In the mutants, however, the amount of the cleavage products was the highest at 2 μm and still present at 50 μm MgATP. Deconvolution of the obtained bell-shaped curves revealed the following half-maximal concentration values: 0.10 ± 0.01 and 4.68 ± 0.44 μm MgATP for the rising and declining parts of the curve, respectively, in case of the cleavage of the wild type MRP1; 0.37 ± 0.07 and 8.95 ± 0.81 μm MgATP for the rising and for the declining parts of the curve, respectively, in the case of G771D; 0.41 ± 0.07 and 10.15 ± 0.96 μm MgATP for the rising and for the declining parts of the curve, respectively, in the case of G1433D. In the next set of experiments we investigated the effect of transported substrates on the vanadate-induced cleavage reactions, observed at various sites as described above. Two different substrates or substrate combinations, LTC4 (0.8 μm) and etoposide (0.5 mm) + GSSG (2 mm) were used in these experiments. Figs. 5 and 6 show the effects of LTC4 (0.8 μm) and etoposide (0.5 mm) + GSSG (2 mm) on the vanadate-induced cleavage reactions at the different cleavage sites. No effect of the transported substrates on the cleavage reactions at Site I, resulting in the 95-kDa fragment, could be observed either when the wild type MRP1 or when the signature mutants were subjected to the cleavage reaction. As we described earlier, the cleavage of MRP1 at Site II, resulting in the 85-kDa fragment, was greater in the presence of the substrates (25Kern A. Szentpétery Zs. Liliom K. Bakos É. Bakos É. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 549-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No cleavage of either signature mutant at Site II was observed when the reaction mixture contained transported substrates.
