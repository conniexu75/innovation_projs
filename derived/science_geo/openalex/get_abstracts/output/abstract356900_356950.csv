https://openalex.org/W1970727168,"Preterm delivery causes substantial neonatal mortality and morbidity. Unrecognized intra-amniotic infections caused by cultivation-resistant microbes may play a role. Molecular methods can detect, characterize and quantify microbes independently of traditional culture techniques. However, molecular studies that define the diversity and abundance of microbes invading the amniotic cavity, and evaluate their clinical significance within a causal framework, are lacking.In parallel with culture, we used broad-range end-point and real-time PCR assays to amplify, identify and quantify ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of bacteria, fungi and archaea from amniotic fluid of 166 women in preterm labor with intact membranes. We sequenced up to 24 rRNA clones per positive specimen and assigned taxonomic designations to approximately the species level. Microbial prevalence, diversity and abundance were correlated with host inflammation and with gestational and neonatal outcomes. Study subjects who delivered at term served as controls. The combined use of molecular and culture methods revealed a greater prevalence (15% of subjects) and diversity (18 taxa) of microbes in amniotic fluid than did culture alone (9.6% of subjects; 11 taxa). The taxa detected only by PCR included a related group of fastidious bacteria, comprised of Sneathia sanguinegens, Leptotrichia amnionii and an unassigned, uncultivated, and previously-uncharacterized bacterium; one or more members of this group were detected in 25% of positive specimens. A positive PCR was associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 20; 95% CI, 2.4 to 172), and funisitis (adjusted OR 18; 95% CI, 3.1 to 99). The positive predictive value of PCR for preterm delivery was 100 percent. A temporal association between a positive PCR and delivery was supported by a shortened amniocentesis-to-delivery interval (adjusted hazard ratio 4.6; 95% CI, 2.2 to 9.5). A dose-response association was demonstrated between bacterial rDNA abundance and gestational age at delivery (r(2) = 0.42; P<0.002).The amniotic cavity of women in preterm labor harbors DNA from a greater diversity of microbes than previously suspected, including as-yet uncultivated, previously-uncharacterized taxa. The strength, temporality and gradient with which these microbial sequence types are associated with preterm delivery support a causal relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2114548104,"Sequencing the expressed genetic information of an ecosystem (metatranscriptome) can provide information about the response of organisms to varying environmental conditions. Until recently, metatranscriptomics has been limited to microarray technology and random cloning methodologies. The application of high-throughput sequencing technology is now enabling access to both known and previously unknown transcripts in natural communities.We present a study of a complex marine metatranscriptome obtained from random whole-community mRNA using the GS-FLX Pyrosequencing technology. Eight samples, four DNA and four mRNA, were processed from two time points in a controlled coastal ocean mesocosm study (Bergen, Norway) involving an induced phytoplankton bloom producing a total of 323,161,989 base pairs. Our study confirms the finding of the first published metatranscriptomic studies of marine and soil environments that metatranscriptomics targets highly expressed sequences which are frequently novel. Our alternative methodology increases the range of experimental options available for conducting such studies and is characterized by an exceptional enrichment of mRNA (99.92%) versus ribosomal RNA. Analysis of corresponding metagenomes confirms much higher levels of assembly in the metatranscriptomic samples and a far higher yield of large gene families with >100 members, approximately 91% of which were novel.This study provides further evidence that metatranscriptomic studies of natural microbial communities are not only feasible, but when paired with metagenomic data sets, offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore both structure and function of microbial communities--if we can overcome the challenges of elucidating the functions of so many never-seen-before gene families."
https://openalex.org/W2062073449,"Background The human gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by a very diverse symbiotic microbiota, the composition of which depends on host genetics and the environment. Several studies suggested that the host genetics may influence the composition of gut microbiota but no genes involved in host control were proposed. We investigated the effects of the wild type and mutated alleles of the gene, which encodes the protein called pyrin, one of the regulators of innate immunity, on the composition of gut commensal bacteria. Mutations in MEFV lead to the autoinflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF, MIM249100), which is characterized by recurrent self-resolving attacks of fever and polyserositis, with no clinical signs of disease in remission. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 19 FMF patients and eight healthy individuals were genotyped for mutations in the MEFV gene and gut bacterial diversity was assessed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene libraries and FISH analysis. These analyses demonstrated significant changes in bacterial community structure in FMF characterized by depletion of total numbers of bacteria, loss of diversity, and major shifts in bacterial populations within the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla in attack. In remission with no clinical signs of disease, bacterial diversity values were comparable with control but still, the bacterial composition was substantially deviant from the norm. Discriminant function analyses of gut bacterial diversity revealed highly specific, well-separated and distinct grouping, which depended on the allele carrier status of the host. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report that clearly establishes the link between the host genotype and the corresponding shifts in the gut microbiota (the latter confirmed by two independent techniques). It suggests that the host genetics is a key factor in host-microbe interaction determining a specific profile of commensal microbiota in the human gut."
https://openalex.org/W2036450767,"Dysregulated PI3K/Akt signaling occurs commonly in breast cancers and is due to HER2 amplification, PI3K mutation or PTEN inactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the role of Akt activation in breast cancer as a function of mechanism of activation and whether inhibition of Akt signaling is a feasible approach to therapy.A selective allosteric inhibitor of Akt kinase was used to interrogate a panel of breast cancer cell lines characterized for genetic lesions that activate PI3K/Akt signaling: HER2 amplification or PI3K or PTEN mutations in order to determine the biochemical and biologic consequences of inhibition of this pathway. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture and in vivo xenograft models revealed that tumors with mutational activation of Akt signaling were selectively dependent on the pathway. In sensitive cells, pathway inhibition resulted in D-cyclin loss, G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis, whereas cells without pathway activation were unaffected. Most importantly, the drug effectively inhibited Akt kinase and its downstream effectors in vivo and caused complete suppression of the growth of breast cancer xenografts with PI3K mutation or HER2 amplification, including models of the latter selected for resistance to Herceptin. Furthermore, chronic administration of the drug was well-tolerated, causing only transient hyperglycemia without gross toxicity to the host despite the pleiotropic normal functions of Akt.These data demonstrate that breast cancers with PI3K mutation or HER2 amplification are selectively dependent on Akt signaling, and that effective inhibition of Akt in tumors is feasible and effective in vivo. These findings suggest that direct inhibition of Akt may represent a therapeutic strategy for breast and other cancers that are addicted to the pathway including tumors with resistant to Herceptin."
https://openalex.org/W2143302812,"Background The aim of this study was to examine individual differences in a large sample of complete melatonin profiles not suppressed by light and search for possible associations between the amount and timing of melatonin secretion and a multitude of lifestyle variables. The melatonin profiles were derived from saliva samples collected every 30 minutes in dim light from 85 healthy women and 85 healthy men aged 18–45 years. There was a large individual variability in the amount of melatonin secreted with peak values ranging from 2 to 84 pg/ml. The onset of melatonin secretion ranged from 18:13 to 00:26 hours. The use of hormonal birth control, reduced levels of employment, a smaller number of days on a fixed sleep schedule, increased day length and lower weight were associated with an increased amplitude of melatonin secretion. The use of hormonal birth control, contact lenses, a younger age, and lower ratings of mania and paranoia were associated with a longer duration of melatonin secretion. An earlier occurrence of the onset of melatonin secretion was associated with an earlier wake time, more morningness and the absence of a bed partner. Lifestyle and behavioral variables were only able to explain about 15% of the individual variability in the amount of melatonin secretion, which is likely because of a substantial genetic influence on the levels of melatonin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2016852829,"Neuropeptides are an important class of molecules involved in diverse aspects of metazoan development and homeostasis. Insects are ideal model systems to investigate neuropeptide functions, and the major focus of insect neuropeptide research in the last decade has been on the identification of their receptors. Despite these vigorous efforts, receptors for some key neuropeptides in insect development such as prothoracicotropic hormone, eclosion hormone and allatotropin (AT), remain undefined. In this paper, we report the comprehensive cloning of neuropeptide G protein-coupled receptors from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, and systematic analyses of their expression. Based on the expression patterns of orphan receptors, we identified the long-sought receptor for AT, which is thought to stimulate juvenile hormone biosynthesis in the corpora allata (CA). Surprisingly, however, the AT receptor was not highly expressed in the CA, but instead was predominantly transcribed in the corpora cardiaca (CC), an organ adjacent to the CA. Indeed, by using a reverse-physiological approach, we purified and characterized novel allatoregulatory peptides produced in AT receptor-expressing CC cells, which may indirectly mediate AT activity on the CA. All of the above findings confirm the effectiveness of a systematic analysis of the receptor transcriptome, not only in characterizing orphan receptors, but also in identifying novel players and hidden mechanisms in important biological processes. This work illustrates how using a combinatorial approach employing bioinformatic, molecular, biochemical and physiological methods can help solve recalcitrant problems in neuropeptide research."

https://openalex.org/W2070952377,"Since 2006, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged as an important pathogen of global concern. However, individual and household factors associated with the acquisition and the magnitude of clinically silent CHIKV infections remain poorly understood. In this present study, we aimed to investigate the seroprevalence, estimate the proportion of symptomatic illness and identify the risk factors for CHIKV infection in the primo-exposed population of Mayotte. METHODS/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a household-based cross sectional serosurvey in Mayotte in November and December 2006 using complex multistage cluster sampling. To produce the results representative of the island population aged 2 years or older, sample data were adjusted with sample weights. Explanatory and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between CHIKV infection seropositivity (presence of IgM and/or IgG to CHIKV by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay) and risk factors. A total of 1154 individuals were analyzed. The overall seroprevalence of CHIKV infection was 37.2% (95% CI = 33.9-40.5), 318 (72.3%) of the seropositive participants reported symptoms consistent with a CHIKV infection during the epidemic period. Risk factors for CHIKV seropositivity among adults (aged 15 years and older) were male gender, low socioeconomic index, schooling < or = 6 years and living in makeshift housing.Our findings indicate that roughly one out of four CHIKV infections is asymptomatic. Conditions associated with poverty may be considered as critical in CHIKV acquisition. Thus, these conditions should be taken into account in the development of future prevention strategies of CHIKV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2144778725,"Synthetic mosquito oviposition attractants are sorely needed for surveillance and control programs for Culex species, which are major vectors of pathogens causing various human diseases, including filariasis, encephalitis, and West Nile encephalomyelitis. We employed novel and conventional chemical ecology approaches to identify potential attractants, which were demonstrated in field tests to be effective for monitoring populations of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus in human dwellings. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that an odorant-binding protein from this species, CquiOBP1, is expressed in trichoid sensilla on the antennae, including short, sharp-tipped trichoid sensilla type, which house an olfactory receptor neuron sensitive to a previously identified mosquito oviposition pheromone (MOP), 6-acetoxy-5-hexadecanolide. CquiOBP1 exists in monomeric and dimeric forms. Monomeric CquiOBP1 bound MOP in a pH-dependent manner, with a change in secondary structure apparently related to the loss of binding at low pH. The pheromone antipode showed higher affinity than the natural stereoisomer. By using both CquiOBP1 as a molecular target in binding assays and gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), we identified nonanal, trimethylamine (TMA), and skatole as test compounds. Extensive field evaluations in Recife, Brazil, a region with high populations of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus, showed that a combination of TMA (0.9 µg/l) and nonanal (0.15 ng/µl) is equivalent in attraction to the currently used infusion-based lure, and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated in the newly developed synthetic mixture."
https://openalex.org/W2120376007,"The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) family of receptor tyrosine kinases regulates a multitude of physiological and pathological processes. Despite the numerous possible research and therapeutic applications of agents capable of modulating Eph receptor function, no small molecule inhibitors targeting the extracellular domain of these receptors have been identified. We have performed a high throughput screen to search for small molecules that inhibit ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the EphA4 receptor. This yielded a 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acid derivative able to inhibit the interaction of EphA4 with a peptide ligand as well as the natural ephrin ligands. Evaluation of a series of analogs identified an isomer with similar inhibitory properties and other less potent compounds. The two isomeric compounds act as competitive inhibitors, suggesting that they target the high affinity ligand-binding pocket of EphA4 and inhibit ephrin-A5 binding to EphA4 with Ki values of 7 and 9 μm in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Interestingly, despite the ability of each ephrin ligand to promiscuously bind many Eph receptors, the two compounds selectively target EphA4 and the closely related EphA2 receptor. The compounds also inhibit ephrin-induced phosphorylation of EphA4 and EphA2 in cells, without affecting cell viability or the phosphorylation of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, the compounds inhibit EphA4-mediated growth cone collapse in retinal explants and EphA2-dependent retraction of the cell periphery in prostate cancer cells. These data demonstrate that the Eph receptor-ephrin interface can be targeted by inhibitory small molecules and suggest that the two compounds identified will be useful to discriminate the activities of EphA4 and EphA2 from those of other co-expressed Eph receptors that are activated by the same ephrin ligands.

In recent years the Eph receptors have also been implicated in many different physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of insulin secretion, bone homeostasis, immune function, blood clotting, pathological forms of angiogenesis, and cancer (7Pasquale E.B. Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The ability to modulate the activities of this family of receptors is therefore of critical interest to gain a better understanding of their functions in the physiology of many organs and in various pathological conditions, as well as for medical therapy. The Eph receptors exert their effects by interacting with ligands, the ephrins, which are also membrane-bound proteins. Eph receptor-ephrin interaction is mediated by two binding sites in the amino-terminal ephrin-binding domain of the receptor as follows: a high affinity site, which includes a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates a protruding loop of the ephrin (the G-H loop), and a separate low affinity site (8Himanen J.P. Saha N. Nikolov D.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A third molecular interface located in the adjacent cysteine-rich region of the receptor has also been described (9Smith F.M. Vearing C. Lackmann M. Treutlein H. Himanen J. Chen K. Saul A. Nikolov D.

Despite the presence of several binding interfaces, peptides that target the high affinity site are sufficient to inhibit Eph receptor-ephrin binding (10Koolpe M. Burgess R. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J.

Interestingly, unlike the ephrins whose binding is highly promiscuous, a number of the peptides that were identified by phage display selectively bind to only one or a few of the Eph receptors (10Koolpe M.

Other molecules that modulate Eph-ephrin interactions have also been identified, including antibodies and soluble forms of Eph receptors and ephrins extracellular domains (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev.

These inhibitors occupy the ATP binding pocket of the receptors and are usually broad specificity inhibitors that target different families of tyrosine kinases (18Caligiuri M. Molz L. Liu Q.

Epigallocatechin gallate, a green tea derivative known to inhibit several tyrosine kinases, has also been shown to inhibit EphA receptor-mediated a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVE) migration and capillary-like tube formation, but the mechanism of action of this molecule has not been elucidated (22Tang F.Y. Chiang E.P. Shih C.J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2007; 18: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the size, polarity, and geometry of the high affinity ephrin-binding pocket of the Eph receptors suggest that it might accommodate the binding of a small molecular weight chemical compound (23Fry D.C. Vassilev L.T. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), no such inhibitors have been identified so far for any of the Eph receptors. The Eph receptors are subdivided in two classes, which in the human genome include nine EphA receptors, which preferentially bind the five ephrin-A ligands, and five EphB receptors, which preferentially bind the three ephrin-B ligands. Binding between receptors and ephrins of the same class is highly promiscuous, and few examples of inter-class binding have also been reported (24Pasquale E.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In particular, EphA4 can bind both ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands and represents the most promiscuous member of the Eph family. This peculiar feature of EphA4 makes its ephrin-binding pocket particularly interesting to target. Furthermore, besides being a well know regulator of neural connectivity during development and of synaptic function in the adult brain (25Klein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Yamaguchi Y. Pasquale E.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), EphA4 has also been linked to several pathologies, which suggests that this receptor could be a promising new target for drug development. For example, EphA4 has been implicated in the inhibition of spinal cord regeneration after injury, by promoting the formation of the glial scar and inhibiting axon regrowth (27Goldshmit Y. Galea M.P. Wise G. Bartlett P.F. Turnley A.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Fabes J. Anderson P. Yanez-Munoz R.J. Thrasher A. Brennan C. Bolsover S. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2496-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, EphA4 is expressed on the surface of human platelets, where it promotes thrombus stabilization (30Prevost N. Woulfe D.S. Jiang H. Stalker T.J. Marchese P. Ruggeri Z.M. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). EphA4 has also been detected in different types of cancer cells (31Easty D.J. Mitchell P.J. Patel K. Florenes V.A. Spritz R.A. Bennett D.C. Int. J.

Hence, modulation of EphA4-ephrin binding could be useful in the treatment of different pathological conditions. In this study, we have used a high throughput screening approach to identify small molecular weight compounds that inhibit ligand binding to the EphA4 receptor. This screen identified two isomeric 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acid derivatives that selectively inhibit ephrin binding to EphA4 and EphA2 as well as the functions of these receptors in live cells. Chemical Library Screening for EphA4 Inhibitors—A 96-well format in vitro assay was used for compound screening. Polystyrene high binding capacity plates (Corning Glass) were incubated for 18 h at room temperature with 2 μg/ml streptavidin (Pierce) diluted in borate buffer (0.1 m boric acid, 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.7), washed three times with binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.01% Tween 20), blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with binding buffer, and then coated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 0.1 μm biotinylated KYL peptide (14Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in binding buffer. Peptide-coated plates were washed five times with binding buffer, and compounds were added to the wells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) together with EphA4 alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (EphA4 AP) produced from transfected cells. Cell culture medium containing the secreted EphA4 AP was diluted 1:16 in binding buffer. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature on a plate shaker before washing five times with binding buffer and adding as the substrate 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Pierce) in SEAP buffer (105 mm diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8). After 1 h at room temperature the reaction was stopped by adding 2 n NaOH, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader. Alkaline phosphatase activity from wells where AP was added instead of EphA4 AP was subtracted as background. The inhibitory activity of the compounds was calculated by dividing the absorbance observed in the presence of compound and the absorbance from wells where no compound was added. Compounds with inhibitory activity higher than 50% were considered hits. The inhibitory activity of the hits was confirmed by repeating the assay. ELISAs and Ki Determination—Protein A-coated wells (Pierce) were used to immobilize ephrin Fc fusion proteins (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Compounds at different concentrations were incubated in the wells with EphA4 AP (36Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) or EphA2 AP (13Koolpe M. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46974-46979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) for 3 h. Alternatively, Eph receptor Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on protein A-coated wells, and ephrin-A5 AP (37Menzel P. Valencia F. Godement P. Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 74-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or ephrin-B2 AP (GeneHunter, Nashville, TN) was added with the compounds. The amount of bound AP fusion protein was quantified using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate. Alkaline phosphatase activity from wells with Fc only was subtracted as background. To confirm that the binding of the compounds to EphA4 was reversible, the compounds were removed, and the wells were incubated in binding buffer for 3 h before washing and incubating with ephrin AP fusion proteins. Under these conditions, no inhibition of ephrin binding was observed, as expected for reversible inhibitors. Further control experiments verified that the compounds do not inhibit the activity of alkaline phosphatase in solution and also do not inhibit binding of EphA4 AP to an anti-EphA4 antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) immobilized to protein G-coated plates (Pierce), ruling out nonspecific inhibitory effects. To calculate the inhibition constant (Ki) values, the binding of ephrin-A5 AP to EphA4 Fc immobilized on protein A-coated wells was measured in the absence and in the presence of the compounds at different concentrations. Each data set was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation: B = Bmax [S]/(KD + [S]), where [S] is the concentration of ephrin AP fusion protein, and KD is the dissociation constant observed in the absence or in the presence of the compound, using nonlinear regression and the program Prism (Graph-Pad Software Inc.). To evaluate whether the inhibition is competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive, the KD and Bmax values were determined at different compound concentrations. The Ki was obtained from the linear regression plot of KD/Bmax as a function of the concentration of the inhibitor according to the following: KD/Bmax = (KD [S])/(Ki Bmax) + KD/Bmax. Alternatively, Ki values were obtained from the dose-response curves, using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [S]/KD) (38Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). Ephrin-A5 AP concentrations were calculated from alkaline phosphatase activity (39Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis—Compounds were purchased from ChemBridge; with the exception of compound 29 (Matrix Scientific, Columbia, SC), compounds 14 and 33 (Sigma), compound 21 (Key Organics, Cornwall, UK), compounds 8 and 39 (ChemDiv, San Diego), and compounds 3-5, 7, 19, 22, 26, 27, 37, 40-42, 47, 54, and 55, which were synthesized as described below. Furthermore, as a control compound 1 was also synthesized as well as purchased from InterBioScreen (Moscow, Russia). For the synthesis of compounds 1, 26, 27, 37, 39, 41, 42, and 54, a 15-ml glass pressure vessel was charged with the appropriate aniline (1.0 mmol), 2,5-hexanedione (1.2 mmol), p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.2 mmol), and toluene (5.0 ml). The mixture was stirred and heated under reflux for 24 h. After evaporation of the toluene, the crude product was purified first by flash chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexanes) and then by reverse phase chromatography. The final products were lyophilized to give solids in yields ranging from 47 to 82%. Final product purities of greater than 95% were confirmed by 1H NMR or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. For the synthesis of compounds 3, 4, 7, and 19, a 35-ml microwave tube was charged with the appropriate aniline (1.0 mmol), 2,5-hexanedione (1.2 mmol), p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.2 mmol), and ethanol (5.0 ml). The mixture was heated under microwave irradiation at 180 °C for 5 min. The solvent was then evaporated, and the residue was subjected to flash chromatography (0-15% ethyl acetate/hexanes or 0-10% methanol/dichloromethane) and then reverse phase chromatography if required. The final products were lyophilized to give solids in yields ranging from 30 to 80%. Final product purities of greater than 95% for compounds 4, 7, and 19, and greater than 80% for compound 3 were confirmed by 1H NMR or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

The mixture was placed in a sealed glass vial and irradiated under microwave conditions at 200 °C for 20 min. The resulting mixture was cooled, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and purified via reverse phase chromatography. After lyophilization, the product pyrroles were furnished as solids with yields ranging from 26 to 57%. Final product purities of greater than 95% were confirmed by 1H NMR or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The identity and purity of all the synthesized compounds and compound 1 purchased from InterBioScreen was verified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Measurement of Receptor Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Cells—HT22 neuronal cells, which endogenously express EphA4, are derived from immortalized mouse hippocampal neurons (40Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). COS7 cells, which endogenously express EphA2, EphB2, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, were obtained from ATCC. Both cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Inc, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin. For EphA4 immunoprecipitations, HT22 cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.5% FBS in DMEM and incubated for 15 min with the compounds or DMSO as a control. The cells were then stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml ephrin-A5 Fc, ephrin-A4 Fc, or Fc for 20 min in the continued presence of the compounds. After stimulation the cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 μm NaF, 1 μm sodium pervanadate, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were calculated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-EphA4 antibody (41Soans C. Holash J.A. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3353-3361PubMed Google Scholar). For EphA2 and EphB2 immunoprecipitations, serum-starved COS7 cells were stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml ephrin-A1 Fc or 0.5 μg/ml ephrin-B2 Fc, respectively. The cells were then lysed and incubated with 2 μg of anti-EphA2 antibody (Millipore-Upstate, Inc, Temecula, CA) or 7 μg of anti-EphB2 antibody made to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the EphB2 carboxyl-terminal tail (42Holash J.A. Pasquale E.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To assess EGF receptor phosphorylation, COS7 cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.2% FBS in DMEM. The cells were preincubated with the compounds as described above and then stimulated for 15 min with 0.1 μm EGF. PC3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc, Herndon, VA) with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. EphA2 was immunoprecipitated from PC3 cells as described above but after stimulation with 0.5 μg/ml ephrin-A1 Fc. To assess inhibition of EphA2 phosphorylation in response to endothelial cell stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), HUVE cells obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) were grown in Medium 200 supplemented with low serum growth supplements (Cascade Biologics), 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and fungizone. The cells were serum-starved overnight in 2% FBS containing medium before adding 7 nm TNFα together with the compound or DMSO for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates and lysates were probed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Millipore Inc., Temecula, CA) and reprobed with antibodies to the respective Eph receptors or anti-EGF receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (GE Healthcare). The EphA2 and EphA4 antibodies used for immunoblotting were from Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories Inc. MTT Assay—The cytotoxicity of the compounds was measured using the MTT colorimetric assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with compounds or DMSO starting 3, 2, or 1 day before they reached 100% confluency. For the assay, MTT (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml and incubated with the cells for 3 h. The resulting formazan crystals were then solubilized by addition of 100% DMSO. The absorbance in each well was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The results were expressed as the ratio of the absorbance of the cells treated with the compounds or left untreated. Growth Cone Collapse Assay—Nasal retina explants from embryonic day 6 chicken embryos were cultured on cover-slips coated with 200 μg/ml poly-l-lysine and 20 μg/ml laminin for 12-24 h in DMEM/F-12 culture medium containing 10% FBS and 0.4% methylcellulose. Three hours before adding the Fc fusion proteins, the medium was changed to DMEM/F-12 without methylcellulose. The explants were incubated for 15 min with the KYL peptide or the compounds and then stimulated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml preclustered ephrin-A5 Fc or Fc as a control. The cultures were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope, and growth cones were scored in a blinded manner as collapsed when no lamellipodia or filopodia were present at the tip of the neurite. PC3 Cell Retraction Assay—PC3 cells were plated on glass coverslips, and after 17 h they were starved for 3 h in 0.5% FBS in DMEM and then incubated for 40 min with the compounds or DMSO, before stimulation for 10 min with 0.5 μg/ml ephrin-A1 Fc or Fc as a control. The cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope, and cell area was measured in a blinded manner using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov ). Cells having rounded shape and area equal to or below 20% of the area of Fc control-treated cells were considered as retracting. Chemical Library Screening to Identify Compounds That Inhibit Ligand Binding to the EphA4 Receptor—To identify small molecule inhibitors of ligand binding to the EphA4 receptor, we designed an assay that takes advantage of a peptide ligand previously identified by phage display (14Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The peptide, designated KYL, has some sequence similarity with the ephrin-A G-H loop, which mediates high affinity binding to Eph receptors (43Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the KYL peptide was shown to competitively inhibit ephrin binding to EphA4, suggesting that it targets the high affinity ligand-binding site of the receptor (14Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We considered the peptide more suitable for high throughput screening assays than an ephrin-A Fc ligand because it is less expensive to produce and binds to EphA4 with lower affinity, which should facilitate identification of initial hits. The biotinylated KYL peptide was immobilized on streptavidin-coated ELISA wells, and binding of the extracellular domain of EphA4 fused to alkaline phosphatase (EphA4 AP) was measured in the presence of chemical compounds. We screened 10,000 compounds from the DIVERSet™ library (ChemBridge, Inc.) at 10 μg/ml in a 96-well format, and identified 43 compounds that reproducibly inhibited EphA4 AP binding by more than 50% in both the or"
https://openalex.org/W2126381692,"Sperm chemotaxis in mammals have been identified towards several female sources as follicular fluid (FF), oviduct fluid, and conditioned medium from the cumulus oophorus (CU) and the oocyte (O). Though several substances were confirmed as sperm chemoattractant, Progesterone (P) seems to be the best chemoattractant candidate, because: 1) spermatozoa express a cell surface P receptor, 2) capacitated spermatozoa are chemotactically attracted in vitro by gradients of low quantities of P; 3) the CU cells produce and secrete P after ovulation; 4) a gradient of P may be kept stable along the CU; and 5) the most probable site for sperm chemotaxis in vivo could be near and/or inside the CU. The aim of this study was to verify whether P is the sperm chemoattractant secreted by the rabbit oocyte-cumulus complex (OCC) in the rabbit, as a mammalian animal model. By means of videomicroscopy and computer image analysis we observed that only the CU are a stable source of sperm attractants. The CU produce and secrete P since the hormone was localized inside these cells by immunocytochemistry and in the conditioned medium by enzyme immunoassay. In addition, rabbit spermatozoa express a cell surface P receptor detected by western blot and localized over the acrosomal region by immunocytochemistry. To confirm that P is the sperm chemoattractant secreted by the CU, the sperm chemotactic response towards the OCC conditioned medium was inhibited by three different approaches: P from the OCC conditioned medium was removed with an anti-P antibody, the attractant gradient of the OCC conditioned medium was disrupted by a P counter gradient, and the sperm P receptor was blocked with a specific antibody. We concluded that only the CU but not the oocyte secretes P, and the latter chemoattract spermatozoa by means of a cell surface receptor. Our findings may be of interest in assisted reproduction procedures in humans, animals of economic importance and endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2103574978,"Respiratory proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin can, under oxidative conditions, form ferryl heme iron and protein-based free radicals. Ferryl myoglobin can safely be returned to the ferric oxidation state by electron donation from exogenous reductants via a mechanism that involves two distinct pathways. In addition to direct transfer between the electron donor and ferryl heme edge, there is a second pathway that involves “through-protein” electron transfer via a tyrosine residue (tyrosine 103, sperm whale myoglobin). Here we show that the heterogeneous subunits of human hemoglobin, the α and β chains, display significantly different kinetics for ferryl reduction by exogenous reductants. By using selected hemoglobin mutants, we show that the α chain possesses two electron transfer pathways, similar to myoglobin. Furthermore, tyrosine 42 is shown to be a critical component of the high affinity, through-protein electron transfer pathway. We also show that the β chain of hemoglobin, lacking the homologous tyrosine, does not possess this through-protein electron transfer pathway. However, such a pathway can be engineered into the protein by mutation of a specific phenylalanine residue to a tyrosine. High affinity through-protein electron transfer pathways, whether native or engineered, enhance the kinetics of ferryl removal by reductants, particularly at low reductant concentrations. Ferryl iron has been suggested to be a major cause of the oxidative toxicity of hemoglobin-based blood substitutes.

When such reactions involve peroxides, they lead to the formation of high oxidation states of the iron and to free radicals. The ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) derivatives of Mb and Hb are known to form whenever these heme proteins escape their normal cellular environments and the protective medium of the plasma and have been implicated in oxidative stress in a range of disease states, including rhabdomyolysis and subarachnoid hemorrhage (1Holt S.

Nevertheless, ferryl Mb has been identified in isolated ischemic rat hearts using addition of sodium sulfide that reacts with ferryl heme to give a distinctive optical band (5Arduini A. Eddy L.

Covalent modifications of Mb and Hb have been detected in vivo following Mb release from muscle cells (rhabdomyolysis) and hemolysis following subarachnoid hemorrhage (8Reeder B.J. Wilson M.T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Formation of a heme to the protein covalent bond between the heme and the globin is a specific marker for oxidative stress in vivo, diagnostic of prior involvement of ferryl heme (9Vuletich J.L.

A. 1991; 88: 7081-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and implies participation of these highly oxidative species in the pathological complications that follow. Heme to protein cross-linking requires peroxide, and its formation is enhanced under conditions of acidosis (11Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cross-links have not been found in normal blood, probably because of the antioxidant defenses present and the regulation of blood pH (11Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, chlorin-type hemes, resulting from oxidative modifications to Hb, have been detected in blood and have been shown to increase with exercise (12Vollaard N.B. Reeder B.J. Shearman J.P. Menu P.

Similarly the tyrosine radical found on Hb following the reaction of the ferric Hb with H2O2, forming the ferryl species, has been detected in normal human blood (13Svistunenko D.A. Patel R.P.

Hb redox changes in vivo appear to be a fundamental part of the normal physiological, if unwanted, process. It is not unrealistic, therefore, to suggest that these redox processes occur when cell-free Hb is infused into patients as an artificial blood substitute and could add to their general cytotoxicity. Thus the fundamental mechanisms by which the protein handles and detoxifies the high ferryl oxidation state is a subject of medical and biotechnological interest. Previously we have reported the mechanism by which ferryl Mb and Hb can be reduced to the ferric form by a wide range of organic compounds (15Cooper C.E. Green E.S. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Wrigglesworth J.M. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 20: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Reeder B.J. Wilson M.T. Chem. Res.

Through the use of engineered Mb, we have shown the presence of two distinct pathways for electron transfer between the reductant and the ferryl heme iron (18Reeder B.J. Cutruzzola F. Bigotti M.G. Hider R.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One, we suggest, involves direct electron transfer between the reductant and the heme edge (18Reeder B.J. Cutruzzola F. Bigotti M.G. Hider R.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The affinity for reductants transferring electrons by this mechanism is low, dissociation constants being typically in the range of several millimolar. The other pathway transfers electrons to the ferryl heme iron via a tyrosine residue (Tyr-103, sperm whale, human, horse Mb). This tyrosine is close to the heme but is also surface-exposed, allowing an interface between the heme iron and bulk medium. This pathway of electron transfer exhibits high apparent affinity for reductants, generally in the low micromolar concentration range. As a consequence, at low concentrations of reductant, the rates of reduction of Mb(s) that possess this pathway is enhanced severalfold compared with proteins that lack this tyrosine pathway. We have extended these studies and now report the results of experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism through which ferryl Hb is reduced by organic reductants. We have previously shown that the reduction of ferryl heme iron in Hb follows a double exponential time course. Here we demonstrate that the two kinetic phases arise from different rate constants for reduction of the α and β chains. The α chain behaves in a fashion similar to Mb, and at low reductant concentrations, reduction is much faster than the β chain. The dependence of the rate constant for reduction of the α chain on reductant concentration follows a double rectangular hyperbolic profile, as observed in Mb. The β chain does not exhibit this profile. We propose that the kinetic behavior of the chains is because of the presence of a tyrosine in the α chain (αTyr-42, C-7, analogous to Tyr-103 of sperm whale Mb) that is both close to the heme and is surface-exposed. This redox active residue is absent from the β chain, the equivalent position being occupied by a redox inactive phenylalanine (βPhe-41, C-7). To test this hypothesis we have generated a number of mutants of Hb that substitute the specific tyrosine in the α chain or introduce this residue at the homologous position in the β chain. Our results demonstrate that possession of a suitably located tyrosine provides a pathway for reduction of ferryl heme by organic reductants. We are therefore able to switch the electron transfer properties of the two chains or produce an Hb molecule in which both chains possess the pathway. This tyrosine-dependent pathway allows ferryl reduction to proceed much more rapidly at low reductant concentrations than can be achieved through direct donation to the heme edge, which occurs irrespective of the presence or absence of the specific tyrosine. The dependence of “through-protein” electron transfer on the presence of a tyrosine residue runs counter to expectations based on general outer sphere mechanisms (e.g. Marcus theory) and implies that the tyrosine residue is acting as true redox co-factor, presumably via a radical mechanism. We propose that the manipulation of such electron transfer pathways in engineered Hb-based blood substitutes could lead to a partial detoxification through attenuation of the oxidative activity of the high redox state of Hb in the presence of micromolar concentrations of reductant.

Expression of Hb was then induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.3 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid, and CO gas. Culture conditions after induction were 22 °C and 60 rpm. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, before sonication. Following centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 rpm, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.2 and filtrated using a 0.45-μm Minisart filter (Sartorius). The Hb was purified using ion exchange chromatography with CM-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). After sample application, the column was washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, until the absorbance returned to base line. The Hb was eluted with 70 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and concentrated using Viva-Spin columns (Vivascience, 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff). The concentrated sample was then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) using elution buffer on an ÄKTA purifier system. Globin-containing fractions were concentrated as above, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Prior to experimentation, the Hb was oxidized to the ferric form by the addition of a 1.5 m excess potassium ferricyanide following CO removal by shining light on the sample with gentle oxygenation using a stream of oxygen gas. Ferri-ferrocyanide was removed by filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (10 × 1 cm). Concentration of Hb was determined from reduction of an aliquot of the ferric Hb using sodium dithionite to the deoxy form (ϵ430 nm = 133 mm-1 cm-1 (21Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers in Biology. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 13-52Google Scholar)). Measurement of Rate Constant for Ferryl Decay—Optical spectra of samples were measured using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Ferric Hb (20 μm) in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was reacted with H2O2 (100 μm) at 25°C for 9 min. At this time conversion of ferric Hb to ferryl Hb was greater than 95% as measured optically. Catalase (10 nm) was added to remove excess H2O2 as this was left to react for a further 1 min. Reductant was then added in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a 1:1 volume ratio so that final concentration of Hb was 10 μm. The optical spectrum was followed until reaction was complete. The time course (425–406 nm) was fitted to a double exponential function minimizing the least squares using the Microsoft Excel Solver program. Each set of rate constants resulting from reduction of α-Hb or β-Hb was then plotted as a function of reductant concentration, and this profile was fitted (least squares method) to a double rectangular hyperbola (17Reeder B.J. Hider R.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—Hb (80 μm) was reacted with 0.8 mm H2O2 and transferred (250 μl) to Wilmad SQ EPR tubes (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ). Tubes were flash-frozen in dry ice-cooled methanol. Frozen samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen (77 K) where they were stored prior to measurements. All EPR spectra were measured using a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer (X-band) equipped with a spherical high quality resonator SP9703 and an Oxford Instruments liquid helium system. The modulation frequency was 100 kHz. Accurate g values were obtained using the built-in microwave frequency counter and a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl powder standard, the g value for which is g = 2.0037 ± 0.0002 (22Weil J.A. Bolton J.R. Wertz J.E. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance: Elementary Theory and Practical Applications. Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 510-513Google Scholar). Other instrumental settings are in the figure legends and have the following abbreviations: microwave frequency ν (GHz); microwave power P (mW); modulation amplitude Am (G); spectra sweep rate V (G/s); time constant τ (ms); number of scans per spectrum NS. The EPR spectra of the blank samples (frozen water) were subtracted from the EPR spectra of the protein samples to eliminate the base line caused by the walls of the resonator, quartz insert, or quartz EPR tube. The g = 2 component of the high spin met heme signal has been subtracted from the EPR spectra of the protein radicals. The optical changes following the addition of ascorbate (100 μm) to the ferryl derivative of authentic Hb (10 μm) are shown in Fig. 1. These are typical of the reduction of ferryl to ferric Hb, i.e. a decrease in the absorbance shoulder at 425 nm and a concurrent increase at 406 nm. Changes in the visible region are also observed, namely a decrease in the ferryl bands at 545 and 580 nm and an increase in absorbance at 630 nm, the latter indicative of the high spin ferric protein. All mutants studied showed optical spectra and changes in these that were essentially identical to those described for the wild type protein (data not shown). The time course for the reduction of wild type ferryl Hb is also shown in Fig. 1. This may best be fitted to the sum of two exponentials rather than the single exponential that is typical for Mb as illustrated by the residuals to the fits given in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1A, inset, shows an example time course for the reaction of ascorbate with ferryl Hb. The biphasic reduction kinetics of ferryl Hb does not arise from different and distinct reduction kinetics of Hb tetramers and αβ dimers that are together in solution in equilibrium because the relative amplitudes of the two phases are independent of protein concentration, the fast phase comprising 48.8% (±0.5%, n = 7). The dimer-tetramer equilibrium is concentration-dependent, with a dissociation constant (K4,2) of ∼2 μm for met-HbA (23Bull C. Hoffman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore expect that 14% of the heme would be in tetramers for 3 μm Hb as opposed to 64% for 10 μm Hb. Thus the time courses for reduction of ferryl Hb at these two concentrations would be discernibly different in their relative phase amplitudes were these phases to be due to different kinetics for the dimer and tetramer (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Normalized time courses for auto-reduction of ferryl hemoglobin. Auto-reduction of ferryl hemoglobin (3, 6, and 10 μm) was monitored optically at 406 and 425 nm. All time courses were normalized, and all can be described by a double exponential function. Time courses are offset for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that a specific tyrosine residue in Mb (Tyr-103) dramatically alters the kinetics of ferryl reduction. A homologous residue (Tyr-42) is present in the α chain of Hb but not in the β chain. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that the biphasic time courses result from differences in the behavior of the α and β chains, we have constructed mutants in which the homologous tyrosine residues in Hb are altered. (i) Tyr-42 was substituted in the α chain (αY42V; αY42W); (ii) Tyr-42 was removed from the α chain and a tyrosine residue inserted into the β chain at position 41 (αY42V,βF41Y), thus switching the chains in this regard; and (iii) the α chain remained wild type, whereas a tyrosine was introduced into the β chain (βF41Y), thus producing an Hb molecule with tyrosine residues equivalent to Mb Tyr-103 in both chains. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of ferryl Hb reduction as a function of ascorbate concentration for recombinant wild type human Hb (WTHb) and the mutant proteins. In Fig. 3A the results for reduction of ferryl WTHb by ascorbate are presented; note that the non-zero rate constant in the absence of ascorbate for both the fast and slow exponential time courses is because of auto-reduction of the ferryl protein. The faster rate constant increases considerably, from 2.23 × 10-3 to 1.10 × 10-2 s-1, as the concentration of ascorbate is increased from 0 to 100 μm. The faster rate constant displays a double rectangular hyperbolic dependence on ascorbate concentration. This profile has been extensively analyzed elsewhere and is typical of that reported previously for horse and sperm whale Mb (17Reeder B.J. Hider R.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Reeder B.J. Cutruzzola F. Bigotti M.G. Hider R.C. Wilson M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The slower rate constant, however, shows a smaller increase over the same ascorbate concentration range with no sign of the double rectangular hyperbolic concentration dependence. From our previous work on ferryl Mb reduction, we have proposed that Tyr-103 of Mb acts as an electron conduit from the reductant to the heme iron, interfacing the heme with the protein surface; this is most clearly discerned at low ascorbate concentrations. Fig. 3B shows the rate constant profile for the reduction of αY42V by ascorbate. The striking difference between the profile for the wild type protein and this mutant is the lack of the “high affinity” section of the profile for the faster rate constants for ferryl decay. As such, the rate constant for ferryl decay at 100 μm ascorbate is only one-third that observed with WTHb. The differences between the slow rate constants for ferryl reduction between the wild type and mutant are negligible. Fig. 3C shows the rate constant profile for the reduction by ascorbate of αY42W. Tryptophan, like tyrosine, has the capacity to harbor free radicals. In this case, however, the tryptophan does not appear to act as a conduit between the reductant and heme moiety, the rate constants for ferryl Hb being closely similar to those of the αY42V mutant. Comparison of Fig. 3A with Fig. 3, B and C, strongly suggests that the biphasic time course seen with the WTHb includes a component that may be assigned to the α chain that displays the double hyperbolic behavior and a component, assigned to the β chain, that has a single hyperbolic dependence on ascorbate concentration. On substitution of αTyr-42, the α chain loses one pathway and hence the double hyperbolic dependence on ascorbate concentration. One may therefore predict that by introducing a correctly positioned tyrosine residue into the β chain the wild type behavior might be restored. The kinetic profile of this double mutant (αY42V,βF41Y) is shown in Fig. 3D. The data in this figure closely resemble that collected for the wild type protein, displaying a double rectangular hyperbola rate constant profile for the faster rate of reduction and a slower rate of ferryl reduction that can be fitted to a single rectangular hyperbola. The only differences are that high affinity pathway for the double rectangular hyperbola has a lower KD value (1.0 μm) than the WT (KD = 30 μm), and the rate constant for ferryl decay for the slow phase (1.1 × 10-2 s-1) is higher than the slow phase observed for the wild type (5.6 × 10-3 s-1). In Fig. 3E the corresponding data for the βF41Y mutant are given. Despite technical difficulties resulting in high rates of precipitation following purification of this mutant, particularly when in the ferric oxidation state, the β subunit does appear to display the double rectangular hyperbola, but with lower rate constants than the α chain. The rate constant for auto-reduction (no reductant present) of the α chain in the αY42W mutant is 10-fold higher (2.53 × 10-3 s-1) (Fig. 3C) than for the αY42V mutant (2.37 × 10-4 s-1) (Fig. 3B) but comparable with that of wild type Hb (2.23 × 10-3 s-1) (Fig. 3A). This may indicate that tryptophan, like tyrosine, facilitates ferryl auto-reduction (24Lardinois O.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4601-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, the rate constants for the α chains that process a redox active residue at position 42 are higher than those that do not have the a redox active residue and hence no through-protein electron transfer pathway, i.e. β chains (ranging from 2.23 to 2.61 × 10-4s-1) that are comparable with those of the αY42V mutant. Fig. 4 shows the kinetics of ferryl Hb reduction for a different exogenous reductant (CP20). The data obtained confirm the observations made using ascorbate as reductant. The wild type protein (Fig. 4A) shows that the α chain exhibits a double rectangular hyperbolic concentration dependence, whereas the β chain does not. The double rectangular hyperbola collapses to a single hyperbola where the αTyr-42 has been mutated to Trp or Val (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively), appearing as almost straight lines (estimated KD by fitting >5 mm). The rate constants for ferryl reduction of the tryptophan mutant are again enhanced by an increased rate of auto-reduction compared with the valine mutation. The αY42V,βF41Y double mutant has a kinetic profile remarkably similar to that of wild type Hb. The βF41Y mutation results in double rectangular hyperbolic profiles when rate constants are plotted as a function of CP20 concentration (Fig. 4D). The kinetic profiles of the WTHb and four mutants at a single reductant concentration (100 μm CP20) are presented in Fig. 5. At this concentration of reductant, the differences between the kinetic profiles for each protein can easily be observed. The α subunit mutations that are designed to remove the through-protein electron transfer pathway exhibit much slower reduction kinetics compared with WTHb. Mutation of the β subunit to introduce a tyrosine at position 41 enhances the kinetics of ferryl decay at this reductant concentration, most easily seen at times greater than 5 min. The EPR spectrum of the globin radical generated by reaction of the ferric Hb with excess H2O2 is shown in Fig. 6. Reaction of wild type Hb with peroxide yields signals that are typical for human Hb, exhibiting a large singlet feature at g = 2.005. This signal has been assigned to a tyrosine radical as is seen in Mb (14Svistunenko D.A. Dunne J. Fryer M. Nicholls P. Reeder B.J. Wilson M.T. Bigotti M.G. Cutruzzola F. Cooper C.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2845-2855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unlike Mb, however, there is no evidence of a signal with gz component at g = 2.03 assigned to a tryptophan peroxyl radical. All three mutants of Hb show virtually identical signal line shapes (Fig. 6A), each showing a main singlet radical species at g = 2.005 with a peak-to-trough width of about 18 G. Significant differences can be observed in the amplitude of the singlet feature in the different mutations. Both α tyrosine mutations significantly lower the intensity of the singlet species (Fig. 6, B and C), the αY42W exhibiting 64% and αY42Val showing on"

Recently, a novel approach to Aβ clearance has been reported which involves the degradation of Aβ by a small lytic molecule, Co(III)-cyclen linked to an aromatic oligomer-recognition molecule (17Suh J. Yoo S.H. Kim M.G. Jeong K. Ahn J.Y. Kim M.S. Chae P.S. Lee T.Y. Lee J. Lee J. Jang Y.A. Ko E.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 7064-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Co(III)-cyclen complex hydrolyzes peptide bonds. We recognized that apocyclen (cyc) would be inert yet might be able to capture Cu(II) bound by Aβ, which would form an active lytic complex (18Suh J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). So we designed a small multifunctional hybrid compound utilizing KLVFF (residues 16–20 of Aβ) as the recognition moiety. The KLVFF sequence has a crucial role in the formation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils, and molecules that bind this motif, such as synthetic KLVFF or curcumin, can bind to Aβ in this domain and block self-assembly (19Tjernberg L.O.

This multifunctional approach yields a potent and selective strategy for the clearance of Aβ.FIGURE 5Comparison of cyclen-hybrid Aβ cleavage agents.A, chemical structures of the four alternatives to cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF tested.

Aβ fresh stock solution was utilized for hydrogen peroxide assay, thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS), 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.Fibrillar Aβ (fAβ) Preparation—Fresh Aβ(1–42) (10 μm) was incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 2 days and monitored by ThT assay and TEM.Oligomeric Aβ (oAβ) Preparation—Soluble Aβ(1–42) oligomers were prepared by dissolving 1.0 mg of Aβ in 400 μl of HFIP overnight at room temperature (21Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). 100 μl of the resulting seedless Aβ solution was added to 900 μl of Millipore water in an Eppendorf tube. After a 10–20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant fraction (pH 2.8–3.5) was transferred to a new tube and subjected to a gentle stream of N2 for 5–10 min to evaporate the HFIP. The samples were then stirred at 500 rpm for 24–48 h at room temperature.Tyrosine Intrinsic Fluorescence—Fluorescence spectra were collected using a Hitachi FP-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (22Syme C.D. Nadal R.C. Rigby S.E. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 23Ma Q.F. Hu J. Wu W.H. Liu H.D. Du J.T. Fu Y. Wu Y.W. Lei P. Zhao Y.F. Li Y.M. Biopolymers. 2006; 83: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An excitation frequency of 280 nm (slit width, 5 nm) was used, and data were collected over 290–400 nm (slit width, 5 nm). Samples were placed in a four-sided quartz fluorescence cuvette, and data were recorded at room temperature.Hydrogen Peroxide Assay—The colorimetric H2O2 assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate (Amresco), according to an existing protocol (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Fresh Aβ(1–42) (10 μm), Cu-Gly (2 μm:16 μm), cyc-KLVFF, or other compounds (concentrations as indicated in the figures), and a H2O2 scavenging agent, tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, 50 μm; Alfa Aesar) were coincubated in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the unreacted TCEP was detected by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (50 μm; Sigma). The amount of H2O2 was proportional to the absolute absorbance difference between a sample and catalase-only (1,000 units/ml; Sigma) control at 405 nm.ThT Assay—ThT assay was performed by combining 20 μl of incubated solution with a 700-μl solution of 10 μm ThT in 12 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Fluorescence measurements were recorded in a Hitachi FP-4500 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature using a 1-cm path length quartz cell. The excitation wavelength was set to 440 nm (slit width, 5 nm), and emission was monitored from 450 to 600 nm (slit width, 5 nm). The percent aggregation is arbitrarily defined at baseline (0%) by the fluorescence of a solution of ThT to which no Aβ(1–42) was added and at maximum (100%) by the fluorescence after a 2-day incubation of Aβ(1–42) alone. A linear relationship between ThT fluorescence and percent aggregation is used for simplicity.TEM—The TEM samples were prepared by placing 8 μl of the incubated solution monitored by ThT assay on 300-mesh formvar-coated copper grids for 2 min before removing excess solution. Then the sample was stained with 1-% fresh tungsto-phosphoric acid for another 2 min. The grid was blotted on filter paper and allowed to dry before observing the specimen in a JEOL-1200EX electron microscope (JEOL) at 100 kV.Western Blot Analysis—The samples were boiled with sample buffer for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 10–20% SDS/polyacrylamide gel using a Tris/Tricine buffer system. Then the gel was transferred onto membrane, blocked with milk (10% w/v) and probed with WO2 antibody. The membrane was incubated with a secondary polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and developed by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).MALDI-TOF/MS—Samples were first passed through a reverse phase C18 Ziptip (Eppendorf) to remove salts, according to the manufacturer's instructions, then diluted 1:1 with matrix solution (a saturated solution of 3, 5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), loaded onto a plate, and allowed to dry. The sample was then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF operated in reflection mode. Myoglobin was used as an internal standard.Neurotoxicity Assay—Two kinds of cells were studied for the ability of the hybrid compounds to be tolerated in culture and to rescue Aβ toxicity. The mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were a gift from H. Xu. The cells were plated in 24-well plates (Corning Costar Corporation) and then incubated for 28 h at 37 °C. We added 10 μm Cu(II) after 4 h from plating, and the medium was changed to fresh minimal Eagle's medium without serum before commencing treatment. Fresh Aβ (100 μm) was incubated for 8 h in minimal Eagle's medium at 37 °C before the experiment. Cyc-KLVFF (from 1 to 20 μm), and Aβ (5 μm) were added into the wells, respectively. MTT was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a humidified CO2 incubator. Stop solution was added to each well; and after 1 h, dimethyl sulfoxide was added, and the absorbance of the colored formazan product was measured at 490 nm. The rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (24Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Fresh Aβ(1–42) (40 μm) was incubated with or without cyclen-hybrid cleavage agents (40 μm) for 3 days at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.4) and then diluted 1:4 with culture medium and applied to neurons. The neurons were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and thereafter the cell viability was evaluated using a MTT assay.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Rat hippocampal neurons were treated the same as for the neurotoxicity assays. Fresh Aβ(1–42) (100 μm) was incubated for 8 h in minimal Eagle's medium at 37 °C before the experiment. The final concentration of Aβ was 1 μm, and cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF was present at 10 μm. After a 2-day incubation, cells were prepared for microscopy as described (24Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R.

Yatsimirsky A.K. Glabe C.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that Cu(II) induced a reduction in tyrosine fluorescence of Aβ(1–42) at 307 nm (Fig. 1B), indicating that there is an interaction between Cu(II) and Aβ. When coincubated with cyc-KLVFF, Aβ(1–42) in the presence of Cu(II) exhibited greater fluorescence (Fig. 1B), indicating that the cyc-KLVFF may have removed the Cu(II) from the Aβ. To confirm this capture mechanism, the Cu(II) was incubated with Aβ first, fluorescence was measured, whereupon cyc-KLVFF was added to the sample, and fluorescence was reassayed after 1 h. The addition of cyc-KLVFF completely reversed the quenching of tyrosine fluorescence by Cu(II) (Fig. 1C). We also used the generation of H2O2 by Aβ-Cu(II) complexes as an index of copper interaction with Aβ(1–42) (26Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J.D. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Cyc-KLVFF (0.5 mol eq) inhibited the amount of H2O2 generated by Cu(II)-Aβ(1–42) by ≈70% (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the data demonstrate that cyc-KLVFF can competitively capture Cu(II) from Cu(II)-Aβ.Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF Inhibits and Reverses Aβ Aggregation—The cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF molecule contains two parts, the Aβ recognition domain KLVFF and the lytic domain cyc(Cu(II)). To investigate whether the two parts of the molecule are necessary for the inhibition of Aβ aggregation, we used ThT fluorescence to measure the rate of amyloid formation over 7 days in the presence of KLVFF alone, cyc(Cu(II)) alone, cyc(Cu(II)) mixed with KLVFF peptide, cyc-KLVFF (apohybrid), or cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF (Fig. 2A). Incubation with cyc(Cu(II)), KLVFF + cyc(Cu(II)) mixture, or cyc-KLVFF did not interfere with Aβ aggregation. Compared with KLVFF (∼20% inhibition, as expected (19Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J.

These results indicate that connecting the lytic and the recognition components potentiate the inhibition of Aβ aggregation. TEM (19Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R.

The data indicate that cyc-(Cu(II))-KLVFF reduced ThT binding by 60–75% in a dose-dependent manner. The disaggregation of fAβ(1–42) was confirmed by TEM (Fig. 2D).Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF Cleaves Fresh and Oligomerized Aβ into Fragments—We used Western blotting and mass spectrometry analyses to appraise the ability of cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF to cleave Aβ species. Blots of freshly prepared Aβ (10 μm) incubated for 5 days with cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF (40 μm) showed a loss of immunoreactivity consistent with a loss of the peptide (Fig. 3A). More Aβ(1–40) was lost than Aβ(1–42) under these conditions, suggesting that Aβ(1–42) is more resistant to degradation (Fig. 3A). Evidence supports a role for Aβ oligomers in the pathology of AD (27Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF was incubated with prepared Aβ(1–42) oAβ (5 μm) for 5 days. The cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF appeared to degrade oAβ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF cleaves Aβ into fragments.A, Western blot analysis of Aβ(1–40 or 1–42) incubated with cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF for 5 days.

D, summary of the cleavage sites of Aβ(1–42) when degraded by cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MALDI-TOF/MS analysis confirmed that incubation of freshly prepared Aβ(1–42) with cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF for 5–7 days resulted in generation of Aβ fragments (Fig. 3C and supplemental Table S1). The cleavage sites were within 5 residues of the KLVFF motif (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the appearance of Aβ fragments and the disappearance of bands on Western blot are correlated and establish that cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF degrades the Aβ peptide.Cyc-KLVFF Protects Neurons from Aβ Toxicity—We reasoned that cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF may protect neurons from Aβ toxicity, if it is itself nontoxic. N2a neuronal cells were untreated or pretreated with 10 μm Cu(II) for 24 h, and then the culture medium was exchanged, whereupon the cells were incubated for 2 days with medium containing Aβ(1–42) alone (5 μm) or Aβ(1–42) with apocyc-KLVFF. After incubation, neuronal viability was assessed by MTT assay, which revealed that Aβ(1–42) was toxic, and toxicity was exaggerated by Cu(II) pretreatment (78% survival at 48 h) (Fig. 4A), in agreement with previous findings (11Opazo C.

Apocyc-KLVFF rescued Aβ(1–42)-mediated toxicity even at concentrations (1 μm) one-fifth those of the Aβ(1–42) in the culture (5 μm; Fig. 4A). Because apocyc-KLVFF cannot degrade Aβ without Cu(II), these data indicate that apocyc-KLVFF can trap Cu(II) from the cell culture to become active. Additionally, even at cyc-KLVFF concentrations 20-fold greater than the concentration needed to effect maximum rescue, there was no evidence of toxicity (data not shown), indicating that the cyc-KLVFF was tolerated by the primary neurons.FIGURE 4Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF protects neurons from Aβ toxicity.A, cyc-KLVFF protect N2a cells from Aβ1–42-Cu(II) toxicity (5 μm:10 μm). The concentrations of compounds are indicated. Data are means ± S.D., n = 6. B, viability and morphology of hippocampal neurons were determined by labeling with TUNEL (green), DAPI (blue), and antibody to β-III tubulin (red). Cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF reduces the hippocampal neurons apoptosis induced by added Aβ(1–42). Hippocampal neurons incubated with Aβ(1–42) or Aβ(1–42) with cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF were double stained with DAPI and TUNEL, and with DAPI and anti-β-tubulin antibodies. The final concentration of Aβ in the culture is 1 μm, with the concentration of cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF at 10 μm. C, apoptotic nuclei from B quantified for staining with DAPI and TUNEL dyes.

As expected, treatment with Aβ(1–42) induced cell apoptosis as well as abnormal cell morphology: neurites became dystrophic, and some neurons detached from the slides (Fig. 4B). Coincubation of Aβ(1–42) with cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4C) and prevented changes in cell morphology (Fig. 4B).Cyclen Conjugation to Other Aβ Recognition Motifs—To explore the minimum and optimum recognition motif we replaced KLVFF with LVFF in the cyclen conjugate (cyc-LVFF; Fig. 5A). Meanwhile, glycine, a small and flexible amino acid, was introduced into the recognition domain (cyc-GKLVFF; Fig. 5A) to test any requirements for flexibility between the recognition and the cleaving domains. In their apo states, both cyc-LVFF and cyc-GKLVFF inhibited the production of H2O2 by Aβ(1–42):Cu(II) similar to the effects of cyc-KLVFF (Fig. 5B). Studies of the effects of Cu(II)-bound cyc conjugates indicated that both cyc(Cu(II))-LVFF and cyc(Cu(II))-GKLVFF could inhibit Aβ(1–42) aggregation over 3 days monitored by ThT assay (Fig. 5C), but both were less potent (IC50 >160 μm) than cyc(Cu(II))-KLVFF (IC50, 10.85 μm). Coincubation with cyc-(Cu(II))-LVFF or cyc(Cu(II))-GKLVFF caused Aβ(1–42) cleavage over 5 days as observed by MALDI-TOF/MS (Fig. 6 A–C and supplemental Table S1).FIGURE 6Effects of Cu(II)-bound cyclen-hybrid agents on Aβ cleavage and neurotoxicity.A–E, the agents (80 μm) were incubated with Aβ(1–42) (10 μm) for 5 days, whereupon MALDI-TOF/MS analysis was performed.

In this study, we show induction of the energy dissipation state, monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, in the isolated major light-harvesting complex (LHCII) incorporated into a solid gel system. Removal of detergent caused strong fluorescence quenching, which was totally reversible. Singlet-singlet annihilation and gel electrophoresis experiments suggested that the quenched complexes were in the trimeric not aggregated state. Both the formation and recovery of this quenching state were inhibited by a cross-linker, implying involvement of conformational changes. Absorption and CD measurements performed on the samples in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the spectral bands assigned to the red forms of chlorophyll a, neoxanthin, and lutein 1 molecules. The majority of these alterations were similar to those observed during LHCII aggregation. This suggests that not the aggregation process as such but rather an intrinsic conformational transition in the complex is responsible for establishment of quenching. 77 K fluorescence measurements showed red-shifted chlorophyll a fluorescence in the 690-705 nm region, previously observed in aggregated LHCII. The fact that all spectral changes associated with the dissipative mode observed in the gel were different from those of the partially denatured complex strongly argues against the involvement of protein denaturation in the observed quenching.

Photosynthetic light harvesting is a controlled process, well integrated into the light phase of photosynthesis. Under conditions of intense illumination, the photosystem II antenna undergoes a transition into a photoprotective mode to dissipate harmful excess light (1Pascal A.A. Liu Z.

This mode has been quantified by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, enabling calculation of the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) 3The abbreviations used are: NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; LHCII, light-harvesting antenna complex of Photosystem II; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. component (6Quick W.P.

The precise mechanism of NPQ is currently under intense debate. Recently, the focus of this debate has centered upon which of the pigments associated with the antenna are involved. In one model of NPQ, a zeaxanthin radical cation acts as a direct quencher of chlorophyll excited states (5Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.-P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science. 2005; 307: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that a conformational change in light-harvesting proteins, resulting from establishment of ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane, brings about dissipative pigment interactions (2Horton P.

In both cases, evidence of these putative quenchers in plant leaves and chloroplasts in the NPQ state has been obtained (5Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.-P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R.

However, elucidation of the mechanisms involved undoubtedly will come from studies of isolated antenna components in which the fine details of structure and function can be determined. Experiments on the main trimeric antenna complex, LHCII, showed that a highly quenched state resembling NPQ (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

An almost identical quenching state was found in the LHCII crystals (1Pascal A.A. Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A. Nature. 2005; 436: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) used for structural determination (11Liu Z.F. Yan H.C. Wang K.B. Kuang T.Y. Zhang J.P. Gui L.L. An X.M. Chang W.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Three key questions emerged from these studies. (a) Was the control of the quenching mode at the level of interactions between neighboring proteins found in these systems? (b) Was a change in protein conformation involved? (c) Which of the pigment spectral changes observed are directly associated with the quenching state? LHCII aggregates and crystals are not suitable for many experimental approaches needed to answer these questions. Thus, it is important to develop a new methodology in which the photoprotective state can be explored. First, it is essential to test whether the aggregation of complexes is an absolute requirement of excitation energy quenching in the antenna. Second, if quenching could be induced without aggregation, it would be essential to determine whether it has the same nature as that present in aggregated LHCII. This study addresses the questions mentioned above and provides direct evidence that the mechanism of the excitation quenching in LHCII is localized at the level of monomeric LHCII, involves conformational change in the protein, and is associated with the specific alterations in configuration of pigments. LHCII trimers were prepared from dark-adapted spinach leaves by an isoelectric focusing procedure as described (12Ruban A.V. Young A. Pascal A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To prepare LHCIIb monomers, the LHCIIb trimers were treated with phospholipase A2 for 48 h at room temperature as reported previously (13Ruban A.V. Pesaresi P. Wacker U. Irrgang K.-D. J. Bassi R. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11586-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immediately after treatment, samples were further purified using a seven-step exponential sucrose gradient from 0.15 to 0.87 m sucrose (14Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Oligomeric LHCII was obtained by incubation of the trimers with 50 mg of SM-2 absorbent (Bio-Rad), allowing a 10-fold decrease in the fluorescence yield. Denaturation of LHCII complexes was achieved by incubation of samples at 70 °C for 5 min. Trimers or monomers of LHCII were introduced into a 6% polyacrylamide gel by the following procedure. Samples were diluted in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) and 0.03% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, mixed with a solution of acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37.5:1), and polymerized with 0.05% ammonium persulfate and 0.03% TEMED for ∼20 min using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN system. The gel thickness was 1 mm. To induce different quenching states, strips of gel (∼1cm wide) were incubated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), allowing time for diffusion of the detergent from the gel. The fluorescence yield was measured with a Walz PAM101 fluorometer. Fluorescence quenching strength or amplitude (kd) was defined as (Fu - Fq)/Fq, where Fu and Fq are the fluorescence levels of unquenched and quenched samples, respectively. For Fig. 3, strips of LHCII gels were placed in the stacking gel area and electrophoresed for ∼60 min at 100 V in reservoir buffer containing 0.375 m Tris, 0.15 mm glycine, and 0.005% DERIPHAT (pH 7.8). The stacking gel was composed of 0.375 m Tris (pH 7.8), 0.05% ammonium persulfate, 0.03% TEMED, and 4% polyacrylamide. The running gel had the same composition except that the polyacrylamide concentration was 6%. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 500 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) at 1-nm spectral resolution. Low temperature measurements were performed using an Optistat®DN LN2 cooled bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Samples were immersed in medium containing 70% (w/v) glycerol and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8). CD spectra were recorded from 400 to 750 nm at 1-nm resolution using a J810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Temperature was maintained by an attached PFD425S Peltier system. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements were performed using a FluoTime200 picosecond fluorometer (PicoQuant). Excitation was provided at a 10-mHz repetition rate by a 650-nm laser diode. The fluorescence was detected at 680 nm with a 2-nm slit width. The pulse energy in the annihilation-free mode was <0.1 pJ. The instrument response function was in the range of 50 ps. Time-resolved emission spectra were recorded in the 665-695 nm region with 2-nm steps. FluoFit software (PicoQuant) was used for the lifetime and global analyses. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using an optical multichannel analyzer-based instrument described in detail previously (9Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was excited with 435-nm broad-band light defined by a combination of glass filters. The spectral resolution was 1 nm. To prevent protein-protein interactions during the establishment of the photoprotective mode, trimeric LHCII complexes were incorporated into polyacrylamide gels to make LHCII gels. The proposition was that a dilute solution of protein in detergent would thereby be highly immobilized and very unlikely to form aggregates when detergent was removed. At an LHCII concentration of 10 μg/ml chlorophyll, the estimated average distance between complexes in the gel would be >100 nm. It has been previously demonstrated that the removal of detergent, acidification, and addition of dibucaine or zeaxanthin all enhance the transition of LHCII into the quenched state with varying degrees of efficiency, although in all cases the nature of the quenching state is the same (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). For study of LHCII gels, detergent removal was used as a trigger for the induction of energy dissipation (9Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). LHCII gels were incubated at room temperature under low light conditions in medium containing different amounts of detergent (n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside) to investigate whether a quenching state could be induced. After 1 h of incubation in detergent-free buffer, the fluorescence level of the sample was decreased by ∼5-fold (Fig. 1A, black trace). Most important, the decrease in fluorescence was almost completely reversed when the gel was immersed in buffer containing detergent. A similar result was obtained if LHCII monomers were used instead of trimers (data not shown, but see below). Time-correlated single-photon counting fluorescence measurements revealed the fluorescence lifetimes of LHCII in the unquenched and quenched states in the gel (Fig. 1B and Table 1). For unquenched LHCII, the major lifetime component (86%) corresponded to a typical lifetime of the LHCII trimer (15den Hollander W.T.F. Bakker J.G.C. van Grondelle R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 725: 492-507Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) of ∼4.2 ns. For quenched LHCII, two dominating and much shorter lifetime components were observed, with lifetimes of 0.15 and 0.7 ns. The average fluorescence lifetimes of the unquenched and quenched LHCII gels indicated a 7-fold reduction in the fluorescence yield. This confirms that the observed fluorescence decrease in LHCII incorporated in the gel was due to a reduction in the excited state lifetime, direct proof of the formation of a highly efficient dissipative mode, as found for NPQ in vivo (16Gilmore A.M.

First, the presence of pigment interactions between different LHCII trimers was tested by the singlet-singlet exciton annihilation approach. Annihilation occurs when two excitons meet on one pigment molecule. The probability of the process increases with increasing light intensity and is greater the larger the number of closely interacting pigments. Thus, in LHCII aggregates, the onset of annihilation starts at much lower excitation light intensity compared with unaggregated LHCII (Fig. 2) (see also Ref. 19Barzda V. Gulbinas V. Kananavicius R. Cervinskas V. van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. Valkunas L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2409-2421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This is explained by a larger pool of interacting pigments in the aggregate. In contrast, the quenched gels have almost the same light intensity dependence as the unquenched trimers (Fig. 2, lower panel), consistent with the absence of LHCII aggregates in the gel. In a second complementary approach, LHCII gels were subjected to electrophoresis. The gels were placed in an electrophoresis system in the stacking gel area and run for ∼60 min. LHCII migrated into the running gel area from both the quenched and unquenched gels. It is clear that highly quenched LHCII complexes moved out of the incubating gel into the running gel area along with the unquenched LHCII trimers. LHCII appeared as a mixture of LHCII monomers (Fig. 3, lower band) and trimers (upper band). An LHCII aggregate in the same gel did not migrate out of the stacking gel, as shown previously (8Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that quenched LHCII migrated out of the gel in the state of a trimer or monomer, not a higher oligomer, again suggested that aggregation was not involved in the establishment of the quenched mode of this complex. Rather, it points toward a conformational transition within the LHCII molecule underlying the quenching of fluorescence. The LHCII gel allowed the exploration of one of the most controversial aspects of the quenching process, the occurrence of the protein conformational change. The protein cross-linker glutaraldehyde was used in the gel system to test this key point. In the presence of glutaraldehyde, the quenching observed after incubation in the detergent-free medium was strongly reduced (Fig. 1A, red trace); even after 6 h of incubation, the quenching constant (kd) was only 1.6, compared with the control value of 10. On the other hand, incubation of a pre-quenched LHCII gel in detergent buffer containing glutaraldehyde showed very little relaxation of quenching compared with the control (blue trace). Taken together, these data indicate that the LHCII protein undergoes conformational changes during transition both into and out of the dissipative state. Having established that the quenching of LHCII in the gel was occurring by conformational change without protein aggregation, a range of spectroscopies were employed in an attempt to unambiguously determine the changes in pigment properties involved. Compared with that of either the unquenched or recovered gel (Fig. 4A, traces 1 and 3), the absorption spectrum of the quenched gel was characterized by a slight red shift in the chlorophyll QY region (trace 2). In contrast, in the spectrum of heat-treated denatured LHCII, the QY region of chlorophyll was strongly blue-shifted (trace 4). The difference spectra, quenched minus recovered (trace 5) and heat-treated minus control (trace 6), were clearly different, the former spectrum having the main peak at ∼681 nm, resembling that usually found for aggregation-induced quenching (20Ruban A.V. Calkoen K. Kwa S.L.S. van Grondelle R. Horton P. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 61-70Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, as a result of light scattering from the particulate nature of the sample, the spectrum of aggregates had a pronounced long wavelength “tail” (shown by the dotted line above trace 1), which was absent in the spectrum of the quenched LHCII gel (for detailed light scattering analysis, see supplemental Figs. 1S and 2S). The difference spectrum indicated absorption changes associated with quenching in the gel (trace 5) that were more pronounced in the chlorophyll a region at 681 nm (+), 670 nm (-), and 662 nm (+) than in the chlorophyll b region at ∼650 nm. In the blue Soret region, quenching was associated with changes arising from both chlorophyll and carotenoid (Fig. 4B). A strong negative band was found from chlorophyll a at 439 nm and in the carotenoid region at 487 nm (trace 4). The LHCII gels could be cooled to 77 K with liquid nitrogen, not only allowing the quenching process to be stopped at particular level but also allowing higher resolution spectroscopy to be performed. In this experiment, LHCII monomers were used. Absorption spectra were obtained from samples with kd values of 0.3, 2.5, and 10, and quenched-minus-recovered difference spectra were calculated (Fig. 4C). All major changes shown in Fig. 4, A and B, were again found: 438-439 nm (-), 486-487 nm (-), 650-652 nm (-), 658-662 nm (+), 670 nm (-), and 681 nm (+) bands. The spectral structure was dependent upon the amount of quenching; at the lowest level of quenching, the 681 nm feature emerged, indicative of the changes in the terminal emitter locus (trace 1). This band grew in intensity as the level of quenching increased, along with the negative 436 and 486 nm bands (trace 2); and at the highest level of quenching, the negative band at 436 nm further increased, whereas the 681 nm feature partially collapsed, and a negative band at 678 nm appeared (trace 3). The appearance of the negative red-shifted band suggested a further alteration in the terminal emitter locus of chlorophyll a during establishment of a highly quenched LHCII conformation. The sample with the highest extent of quenching also displayed a shift and broadening of the negative carotenoid band at ∼494-495 nm. Thus, these experiments have clearly established that the quenched LHCII state is associated with modification of the electronic states of pigments. The nature of the altered pigment states was further explored by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 5A shows CD spectra for unquenched, quenched, and recovered LHCII gel samples (traces 1-3, respectively). The arrows at ∼440 and ∼680 nm indicate the most affected regions in the spectrum of quenched LHCII. On the other hand, thermal denaturation of LHCII led to a strong decrease in the whole CD spectrum and elimination of its excitonic features (trace 4) (21Kwa S.L.S. Groeneveld G.F. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Lin S. Struve W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 143-146Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Ide J.P. Klug D.R. Kuhlbrandt W. Giorgi L.B. Porter G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 349-364Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum associated with quenching in the gel (Fig. 5B, trace 1) displayed a strong (-) band at 437 nm and a group of bands in the carotenoid region: 486 nm (+), 493 nm (-), and 503 nm (+). Similar changes were found in the aggregation-related difference CD spectra (trace 2) (21Kwa S.L.S. Groeneveld G.F. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Lin S. Struve W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 143-146Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both difference spectra showed similarity also in the red region, with the main positive maximum at 678 nm and a negative band at 665 nm (chlorophyll a). The quenched state of LHCII in aggregates and crystals has been previously associated with an unusual 77 K long wavelength fluorescence band at ∼700 nm (1Pascal A.A. Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A. Nature. 2005; 436: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 9Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the 77 K fluorescence spectra for LHCII gels in a range of quenching magnitudes (traces 1-4), which are completely different from those recorded with heat-induced denaturation (trace 6). There was a gradual broadening of the 681 nm band and a shift toward the 700 nm region with the increase in quenching strength, indicating that the red shift is not a result of interactions between neighboring complexes. Interestingly, there was much less emission at 700 nm in the spectrum of the quenched LHCII gel in comparison with those of highly quenched aggregates. Thus, the red shift of the main band at 680 nm and the appearance of the 700 nm band may arise from two different processes. Whereas the former was related to the extent of quenching, the latter appeared to be an attribute of interacting LHCII units in the aggregate. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to determine whether the transition from the unquenched to the quenched state occurred by switching a population of LHCII complexes into a dissipative state with a characteristic short lifetime. Fig. 7 shows a series of spectra around the maximum of LHCII fluorescence at 680 nm. The major component of 4.1 ns of trimeric LHCII in the unquenched state had a maximum at ∼680 nm. Ten times quenched LHCII in the gel displayed a multicomponent picture. It possessed 2.9-, 0.8-, 0.35-, and 0.04-ns components. It was interesting to note that the time-resolved spectra of these components revealed the tendency for red shift for the shorter lifetimes. Hence, the strongest shift in the spectrum of unquenched trimers (∼80 cm-1) was observed for the fastest component (0.04 ns). The spectrum revealed a pronounced shoulder in the 688-695 nm region (indicated in Fig. 7 by the dotted vertical line) Therefore, these data have clearly revealed the presence of not one but several quenching states/conformations in LHCII. The results obtained in this study provide important insights into the role of protein conformational changes and aggregation in the formation of excitation quenchers in LHCII. It has been previously argued that aggregation per se could give rise to artifactual quenching and that no conformational change was occurring (23Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The finding that fluorescence quenching in LHCII can be obtained without protein aggregation strongly argues against such a proposal and indicates that the cause is indeed a change in protein conformation within each monomeric LHCII unit, as originally hypothesized (4Horton P. Wentworth M. Ruban A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This conclusion also explains the early reports of the lack of tight correlation between the level of fluorescence quenching and the extent of aggregation in isolated LHCII (24Kirchhoff H. Hinz H.J. Rösgen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the same conformational change in LHCII, which is manifested as a twist in the Raman configuration of the bound neoxanthin molecule, is detected in the NPQ state in vivo in leaves and chloroplasts (10Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). We suggest therefore that aggregation of LHCII is preceded by this conformational change explored here in detail. In this sense, aggregation in vivo may be thought of as a means of simply minimizing the energy of the quenched state and pulling the equilibrium in its favor. The experimental approach used in this study allows the unambiguous interpretation of the changes in pigment configuration accompanying quenching for the first time. Two pigment domains within the complex appear to cooperatively interact in this conformational switch (Fig. 8). The neoxanthin domain contains chlorophylls a604, b606, b607, and b608, which display quenching-related changes in absorption and alterations in the CD signal structure. This domain has been previously highlighted an indicator of the conformational change not just in vitro but also in vivo (1Pascal A.A. Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A. Nature. 2005; 436: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 4Horton P. Wentworth M. Ruban A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The second domain, the putative quenching site, contains the terminal emitter group of pigments (chlorophylls a610, a611, and a612), which give rise to the red-shifted chlorophyll a at 681 nm paralleled by changes in the Soret band at ∼438 nm. The absorption change peaking at 494 nm and the CD transitions at 492 (-) and 499 (+) correspond to lutein 1, the latter implying involvement of excitonic interactions between lutein and its neighbors. It has been recently established that the quenching in aggregates of LHCII arises from the formation of an energy transfer pathway to a low-lying excited state of lutein 1 (10Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Fluorescence lifetime measurements revealed several life-time components associated with the quenched state, suggesting the existence of a number of different states of the complex with a varying energy-quenching strength. A similar conclusion was drawn from investigation of fluorescence lifetimes of LHCII incorporated into liposomes (27Crimi M. Dorra D. Bosinger C.S. Giuffra E. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum measurements revealed the appearance of a number of red-shifted components with short fluorescence lifetimes. This red shift could reflect a stepwise promotion of pigment-pigment interactions between lutein 1 and chlorophylls a610, a611, and a612 in the terminal emitter domain. Hence, the non-photochemical quenching switch in LHCII appears to have a gradual nature as opposed to an on-off switch. Detailed fluorescence lifetime measurements and time-resolved fluorescence spectra for leaves and chloroplasts with a wide range of NPQ levels are required to explore whether this switch enables all these states in vivo or if only one or two particular states are allowed, as proposed previously (18Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett V.P. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, in all cases, the presence of zeaxanthin bound at either peripheral or internal sites in any LHCII protein is insufficient to induce significant fluorescence quenching in vitro (25Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Amarie S. Standfuss J. Barros T. Kulbrandt W. Dreuw A. Wachtveitl J. J.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a need for a protein conformational change in LHCII, as demonstrated recently to fully activate NPQ in vivo (10Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature. 2007; 450: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The establishment of the existence of a conformational switch enabling highly efficient energy dissipation within the Photosystem II antenna is a clear advance in comparison with the other models of photoprotection in Photosystem II. Recently published work on the role of zeaxanthin cation in NPQ does not provide any evidence for the required conformational change and provides neither a connection to a significant energy dissipation process (28Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballotarri M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 3550-3558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) nor an explanation of the zeaxanthin-independent NPQ (29Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science. 2008; 320: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We have shown that the quenching is an internal event within one LHCII unit free from interactions with others. In conclusion, the discovery that fluorescence quenching can be induced in LHCII immobilized in a solid state gel has allowed important advances to be made in our understanding of the photoprotective antenna switch, demonstrating that it is a cooperative protein and pigment conformational change. It was shown that quenching does not require interactions between complexes, but is a process that involves structural alterations within individual LHCII subunits. Because the LHCII gel is devoid of optical artifacts, for the first time, clear information was obtained about the changes in pigment states in the quenching mode, proving the involvement of neoxanthin and lutein 1 domains. In vivo, during the formation of NPQ, through the dynamics of these domains, this switch is controlled and amplified by other factors. These are (a) protein-protein interactions between neighboring antenna complexes in the grana macrostructure (4Horton P. Wentworth M. Ruban A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4201-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 30Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Structural-dynamic properties of the homodimeric transmembrane domain of the EphA1 receptor were investigated with the aid of solution NMR in lipid bicelles and molecular dynamics in explicit lipid bilayer. EphA1 transmembrane segments associate in a right-handed parallel α-helical bundle, region (544-569)2, through the N-terminal glycine zipper motif A550X3G554X3G558. Under acidic conditions, the N terminus of the transmembrane helix is stabilized by an N-capping box formed by the uncharged carboxyl group of Glu547, whereas its deprotonation results in a rearrangement of hydrogen bonds, fractional unfolding of the helix, and a realignment of the helix-helix packing with appearance of additional minor dimer conformation utilizing seemingly the C-terminal GG4-like dimerization motif A560X3G564. This can be interpreted as the ability of the EphA1 receptor to adjust its response to ligand binding according to extracellular pH. The dependence of the pKa value of Glu547 and the dimer conformational equilibrium on the lipid head charge suggests that both local environment and membrane surface potential can modulate dimerization and activation of the receptor. This makes the EphA1 receptor unique among the Eph family, implying its possible physiological role as an “extracellular pH sensor,” and can have relevant physiological implications.

Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In adult organism, Eph-ephrin interactions can also trigger a wide array of cellular responses, including cell boundary formation, motility, adhesion, and repulsion, especially for neuronal and endothelial cells, whereas deregulated reemergence of Eph function appears to contribute to mechanism of tissue injury and of tumor invasion and metastasis. Intriguingly the Eph-ephrin interactions may have a role in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory formation, and mental disease (3Gerlai R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Eph receptors represent the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases and are divided into subclasses A and B based on the sequence homology of their extracellular parts, the structure, and the binding affinity (5Eph Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Ephrin-A ligands share a membrane-tethered glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, whereas ephrin-B ligands have a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. The Eph receptors and ephrins are not only numerous, but their relationship is also complex (6Vearing C.J. Lackmann M. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Receptor-ligand binding is highly promiscuous within each subclass, and there are several examples of interactions between members of different subclasses (7Surawska H. Ma P.C. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition to their role as conventional ligands for the related receptor tyrosine kinase counterparts (frequently referred to as “forward signaling”), the ephrins possess a receptor-like ability to transduce signals into the cell that presents these molecules on its surface (so-called “reverse signaling”) (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Like other receptor tyrosine kinases, both types of Eph receptors contain a single transmembrane (TM) helical domain with an N-terminal glycosylated extracellular region comprised of a ligand-binding domain with immunoglobulin-like motifs, a cysteine-rich region with an epidermal growth factor-like motif, and two fibronectin type III repeats. The cytoplasmic region includes a juxtamembrane segment, the kinase domain, and a sterile α-motif (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Upon cell-cell contact, the N-terminal globular domains of two Eph receptors recognize two ephrins in the opposing membrane and bind with high affinity and specificity to form a heterotetrameric ephrin-Eph receptor signaling complex. Although the activation of signal transduction cascade of most receptor tyrosine kinases is controlled by a ligand-induced receptor dimerization or by reorientation of monomers in preformed receptor dimers (8Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar, 9Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol.

A. 2002; 99: 15937-15940Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), additional formation of higher order Eph-ephrin signaling clusters is required as the signals resulting from higher order clusters seem to differ from those resulting from a single dimer (6Vearing C.J. Lackmann M. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such oligomerization is restricted within specialized plasma membrane microdomains enriched by glycosphingolipids and cholesterol, known as “lipid rafts,” which can impart additional specificity to the ephrin-Eph signaling (11Gauthier L.R. Robbins S.M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several weak ephrin-ephrin and receptor-receptor contacts could promote the association of the complex into an interconnected network. Regions that mediate low affinity intermolecular binding have been identified in the extracellular domain and in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic segment of ephrins as well as in the ephrin-binding domain, cysteine-rich region, and cytoplasmic sterile α-motif domain of Eph receptors (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 12Himanen J.P. Saha N. Nikolov D.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Association of TM helices plays an important role both in the assembly and in the function of membrane proteins. Nevertheless despite the fact that structural characterization of membrane proteins is of particular interest in contemporary structural biology, the examples of TM domains of single spanning membrane proteins whose noncovalent dimeric spatial structure has been determined experimentally are exceptional (GpA (13Mackenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), BNip3 (14Bocharov E.V. Pustovalova Y.E. Pavlov K.V. Volynsky P.E. Goncharuk M.V. Ermolyuk Y.S.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6950-6956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) compared with the hundreds of structures available for membrane proteins to date partly because of difficulties associated with expression and solubilization of transmembrane proteins. This disproportion also reflects that many biologically relevant TM helix interactions are weak, providing a mechanism for modulation of protein function through reversible association. Accumulating evidences reveal that the proper lateral dimerization of TM domains of receptor tyrosine kinase members is required for biochemical signal transduction across plasma membrane (16Li E. Hristova K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6241-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Mackenzie K.R. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1931-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The EphA1 receptor tyrosine kinase initially isolated from a hepatoma cell line (18Hirai H. Maru Y. Hagiwara K. Nishida J. Takaku F. Science. 1987; 238: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) is widely expressed in human tissues and found to be up-regulated in breast, colon, lung, kidney, gastric, and head cancers (7Surawska H. Ma P.C. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently our studies have demonstrated that fluorescently labeled TM fragments of the EphA1 receptor self-associate in liposomes, forming helical dimers crossing the lipid bilayer (19Artemenko E.O. Egorova N.S. Arseniev A.S. Feofanov A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion and with the fact that Eph-ephrin signaling requires lateral dimerization or aggregation in cell membrane (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 6Vearing C.J. Lackmann M. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Himanen J.P. Saha N.

Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we present the high resolution spatial structure of the homodimeric TM domain of the human EphA1 receptor obtained by heteronuclear NMR in lipid bicelles combined with molecular dynamics (MD) relaxation in explicit membrane. The found dimerization specificity and dependence of structural-dynamic properties of the EphA1 TM domain on ionization state of the membrane embedded glutamate carboxyl group tempted us to speculate how extracellular conditions and local cell membrane environment can modulate biological activity of the receptor, providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the Eph-ephrin signaling. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence encoding human EphA1 fragment 536-573 (EphA1tm) was synthesized from six oligonucleotides by PCR. The TrxA-EphA1tm fusion protein was constructed by fusing the coding sequence for thioredoxin of Escherichia coli with the N-terminal His tag extension to the coding sequence for EphA1tm in the pGEMEX1 vector (Promega). To facilitate purification, the His tag and enterokinase cleavage site were placed between the coding sequences for thioredoxin and EphA1tm. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and grown in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 or (15NH4)2 SO4/[U-13C]glucose (both from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for the production of uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein samples. After induction with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and an additional 40 h of growth at 13 °C, the cells were harvested and stored at -20 °C. Cell pellets (1-liter equivalents) were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 15 mm Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by ultrasonication. Centrifugally clarified lysate was applied to Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) pretreated with NiSO4, washed with 70 mm imidazole, and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. After overnight incubation with recombinant human enterokinase light chain, the cleaved EphA1tm was passed through Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. An additional purification step was applied using reverse phase chromatography to remove a trace of thioredoxin, resulting in >97% purity of the EphA1tm sample. Yields of ∼7 mg of protein/liter of the cell culture could be obtained by this procedure. Protein identity and purity were confirmed by gel electrophoreses, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy in a 1:1 methanol/chloroform mixture containing 5-10% water. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination—NMR experiments were performed on 600-MHz (1H) Varian Unity spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient unit and a triple resonance probe. NMR spectra were acquired at 40 °C using 1 mm samples of EphA1tm incorporated into 1:4 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC)/dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) lipid bicelles (with a lipid/protein molar ratio of 35) dissolved in a buffer solution (at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3) containing 10 mm deuterated sodium acetate, 0.15 μm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and either 5 or 99.9% D2O unless otherwise specified. For the NMR sample preparation the DMPC and DHPC lipids with deuterated hydrophobic tails were used. The deuterated 1,2-di-[2H27]myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (d54 -DMPC) and 1,2-di-[2 H11]myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (d22-DHPC) were synthesized from sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by acylation with anhydride of d27-myristic acid and d11-hexanoic acid, respectively, as described previously (21Chakrabarti P. Khorana G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5021-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Three EphA1tm samples were prepared: uniformly 15N/13C-labeled, 15N-labeled, and a 1:1 mixture of uniformly 15N/13C-labeled and unlabeled proteins (“heterodimer” sample). The samples were initially subjected to several freeze/thaw cycles for the achievement of uniform protein distribution among the lipid bicelles. To verify the validity of NMR experimental conditions, circular dichroism studies of EphA1tm solubilized with the DMPC/DHPC bicelles and DMPC unilamellar liposomes at pH 4.9 were performed (see supplemental experimental procedures and supplemental Fig. S1A). To assess the size of the bicelles with the protein and demonstrate their stability in the pH range used, dynamic light-scattering measurements were performed at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3 (see supplemental experimental procedures). There was no difference of the bicelle size in the entire range of pH; therefore only the results for pH 4.3 and 6.3 are presented in supplemental Fig. S1B. The backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of EphA1tm were assigned at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3 using standard triple resonance techniques (22Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 23Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Two- and three-dimensional 1H-15N (Fig. 1A) and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), 15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy (40-ms mixing time), and HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH spectra in H2O provided backbone and partial side chain assignments, whereas HCCH total correlation spectroscopy (15.6- and 23.4-ms mixing times) and 1H nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY; 60-ms mixing time) experiments in D2O facilitated side chain assignments. Resonance assignments were performed with the CARA software. Side chain pH titration of Glu547 was monitored by the chemical shift changes of neighboring amide NH groups using a set of 1H-15N HSQC spectra collected on the 15N-labeled sample of the EphA1tm dimer solubilized in 1:4 DMPC/DHPC or in 1:8:1 DMPC/DHPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids) bicelle suspension at a pH range from 4.2 to 6.7. The pH was adjusted by adding small amounts of HCl and NaOH and measured with a Radiometer glass electrode. The pKa value of titrating carboxyl group of Glu547 was obtained by nonlinear least-square fits of the pH dependence of the chemical shifts to a modified Hill equation (24Markley K.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 70-80Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar) using the Mathematica 5.1 software (Wolfram Research). The values of heteronuclear 15N{1H} steady-state NOE, 15N longitudinal (T1), and transverse (T2) relaxation times (supplemental Fig. S5) were obtained for the 15N-labeled sample at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3 as described previously (25Bocharov E.V. Korzhnev D.M. Blommers M.J.J. Arvinte T. Orekhov V.Y. Billeter M. Arseniev A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46273-46279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The local effective rotation correlation times (τR) for the individual 15N nuclei were calculated from the T1/T2 ratio using the DASHA software (26Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effective molecular mass of the EphA1tm dimer embedded into the DMPC/DHPC bicelle was estimated according to the empirical dependence (27Daragan V.A. Mayo K.H. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 63-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (220) Google Scholar) from overall rotation correlation time averaged over 15NH groups with 1H{15N} NOE >0.6 and without noticeable cross-peak broadening in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. NMR spatial structures of the EphA1tm dimer were calculated using the CYANA program (28Güntert P. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2003; 43: 105-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Intramonomeric NOE distance restraints (supplemental Fig. S2) were identified with CARA through the analysis of three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY (60- and 80-ms mixing times) spectra (23Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar) obtained for 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples in H2O and D2O (at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3), respectively. The two-dimensional 1H NOESY (80-ms mixing time) spectrum acquired for the unlabeled sample was used as an additional source of structural information concerning aromatic ring protons. Intermonomeric distance restraints (supplemental Fig. S3) were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited NOESY spectra (29Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (533) Google Scholar) acquired with a 80-ms mixing time for the 15N-labeled and heterodimer samples in H2O and D2O (at pH 4.3, 4.9, and 6.3), respectively. Stereospecific assignments and torsion angle restraints for φ, ψ, and χ1 were obtained by the analysis of local conformation in CYANA using sequential NOE data and the available 3JHNα and 3JNβ coupling constants evaluated qualitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHA and 1H-15N HNHB experiments (23Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were also estimated based on the assigned chemical shifts using the TALOS program (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Slowly hydrogen-deuterium exchanging amide groups were identified by reconstituting lyophilized 15N-labeled sample in D2O at pH 4.9 and recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra (supplemental Fig. S2). Taking into account the 15N relaxation data at different pH values (Fig. 2A), the slowly exchanging amide protons were assigned as donors of backbone hydrogen bonds with related hydrogen acceptor partners on the basis of preliminary structure calculations. In addition, based on the observed chemical shift perturbations, local NOE contact rearrangement and backbone dynamics perturbation upon pH titration, the characteristic N-capping hydrogen bonds (31Doig A.J. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 101-102: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Iqbalsyah T.M. Doig A.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Fonseca N.A. Camacho R. Magalhaes A.L. Proteins. 2008; 70: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) between residues Thr544, Gly546, and Glu547 (see “Results and Discussion”) were identified. Corresponding hydrogen bond restraints were used in subsequent calculations for d(O,N), d(O,HN), and d(C,HN) in accordance with angle and distance criteria for different types of hydrogen bonds (34Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The EphA1tm dimer was modeled as the dimer of two EphA1tm fragments linked by 20 pseudoresidues to give the monomers enough mutual arrangement. The standard CYANA simulated annealing protocol was applied to 100 random structures using the angle and distance restraints symmetrically doubled for each dimer subunit, and the resulting 12 NMR structures of the EphA1tm dimer with the lowest target function were selected for pH 4.3 and 6.3. Protein-lipid NOE contacts (supplemental Fig. S4) were identified from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited NOESY spectra acquired with an 80-ms mixing time for the 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples in H2O and D2O, respectively. Restrained energy relaxation of the representative NMR structures of the EphA1tm dimer at pH 4.3 and 6.3 was performed by molecular dynamics in hydrated explicit DMPC bilayer using the GROMACS 3.3.1 package (35Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). Construction of the protein/lipid system and MD protocol are described in the supplemental experimental procedures. Two 5-ns MD runs for the representative models of the EphA1tm dimer with protonated (uncharged) or negatively charged carboxyl side chain group of Glu547 in both dimer subunits corresponding to pH 4.3 and 6.3, respectively, were carried out with the NMR-derived intra- and intermonomeric distance restraints. To check the stability of the resulting systems, 3-ns continuations of the MD runs were performed without distance restraints. Equilibrium parts of MD trajectories (last 2 ns) were analyzed using home-made software and utilities supplied with the GROMACS package. The TM regions of Eph receptors were predicted with TMpred (36Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Hydrophobic properties of α-helices were calculated using the molecular hydrophobicity potential approach (see supplemental experimental procedures for details) (37Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The contact area between the dimer subunits was calculated using the DSSP program (38Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1985; 22: 2577-2637Crossref Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) as a difference between the accessible surface areas of EphA1tm residues in the monomer and dimer. The EphA1tm structures were visualized with MOL-MOL (39Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (40DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Validation of EphA1tm NMR Sample—The 38-residue EphA1 fragment 536-573 (named EphA1tm) with the sequence SPPVSRGLTGGEIVAVIFGLLLGAALLLGILVFRSRRA including predicted hydrophobic TM segment (underlined) flanked by polar N- and C-terminal regions was prepared as described above. Although different membrane-mimicking systems have been used for investigations of membrane-bound proteins, currently discoidal mixed bicelles composed of a small circular bilayer of long-chain lipids surrounded by a rim of short-chain lipids have proved more suitable for structural studies by high resolution NMR (for a review, see Ref. 41Prosser R.S. Evanics F. Kitevski J.L. Al-Abdul-Wahid M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8453-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Indeed our recent experience of resolving the dimeric structure of the TM domain of human proteins, including a representative of receptor tyrosine kinase, allows stating that bicelles are a fairly adequate model of lipid membrane (14Bocharov E.V. Pustovalova Y.E. Pavlov K.V. Volynsky P.E. Goncharuk M.V. Ermolyuk Y.S. Karpunin D.V. Schulga A.A. Kirpichnikov M.P. Efremov R.G. Maslennikov I.V. Arseniev A.S. J. Biol.

Therefore, the 15N and 13C isotope-labeled EphA1tm samples were solubilized in an aqueous suspension of bicelles consisting of DMPC and DHPC lipids with deuterated hydrophobic tails using DMPC/DHPC and lipid/protein molar ratios of 0.25 and 35, respectively. The prepared sample solutions were clear, and the preliminary NMR spectra (Fig. 1A) seen were suitable for further structural NMR studies with conventional 15N/13C heteronuclear NMR technique. Circular dichroism spectra, recorded to validate the NMR experimental conditions, proved virtually identical for EphA1tm incorporated into the DMPC/DHPC bicelles and the DMPC unilamellar liposomes (phospholipid bilayer), revealing an α-helical structure of the fragment in the membrane mimetics (supplemental Fig. S1). The measured 15N{1H} NOE, 15N T1 and T2 values (supplemental Fig. S5), and calculated local effective rotation correlation times (τR) (Fig. 2A) are indicative of a relatively stable TM segment 544-569 flanked by highly flexible N- and C-terminal regions. Overall rotation correlation time estimated from T1/T2 ratio on the TM region is ∼16 ns, which corresponds well to a particle mass (∼43 kDa) of the EphA1tm dimer surrounded by ∼70 lipid molecules composing a bicelle with effective hydrodynamic radius of 24 ± 2Å measured by dynamic light scattering (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, protein-lipid NOE contacts with polar lipid heads observed in the regions 542-549 and 564-571 revealed that the region spans the hydrophobic phase of the bicelle (supplemental Fig. S4), therefore mimicking the embedding of the EphA1 TM domain into a bilayer lipid membrane reasonably well. Conformational Exchange and Diversity of the EphA1tm Dimer—The NMR experiments were carried out in a pH range from 4.3 to 6.3 to overlap the pKa value (see below) of Glu547 carboxyl group and to check the influence of its ionization state on the structural and dynamic properties of EphA1tm. The preliminary analysis of NMR data showed that, being incorporated into lipid bicelles, the TM part of E"
https://openalex.org/W1996848534,"Background Historically, only partial assessments of data quality have been performed in clinical trials, for which the most common method of measuring database error rates has been to compare the case report form (CRF) to database entries and count discrepancies. Importantly, errors arising from medical record abstraction and transcription are rarely evaluated as part of such quality assessments. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) technology has had a further impact, as paper CRFs typically leveraged for quality measurement are not used in EDC processes. Methods and Principal Findings The National Institute on Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network has developed, implemented, and evaluated methodology for holistically assessing data quality on EDC trials. We characterize the average source-to-database error rate (14.3 errors per 10,000 fields) for the first year of use of the new evaluation method. This error rate was significantly lower than the average of published error rates for source-to-database audits, and was similar to CRF-to-database error rates reported in the published literature. We attribute this largely to an absence of medical record abstraction on the trials we examined, and to an outpatient setting characterized by less acute patient conditions. Conclusions Historically, medical record abstraction is the most significant source of error by an order of magnitude, and should be measured and managed during the course of clinical trials. Source-to-database error rates are highly dependent on the amount of structured data collection in the clinical setting and on the complexity of the medical record, dependencies that should be considered when developing data quality benchmarks."
https://openalex.org/W2036745733,"Background A key argument in favor of conserving biodiversity is that as yet undiscovered biodiversity will yield products of great use to humans. However, the link between undiscovered biodiversity and useful products is largely conjectural. Here we provide direct evidence from bioassays of endophytes isolated from tropical plants and bioinformatic analyses that novel biology will indeed yield novel chemistry of potential value. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated and cultured 135 endophytic fungi and bacteria from plants collected in Peru. nrDNAs were compared to samples deposited in GenBank to ascertain the genetic novelty of cultured specimens. Ten endophytes were found to be as much as 15–30% different than any sequence in GenBank. Phylogenetic trees, using the most similar sequences in GenBank, were constructed for each endophyte to measure phylogenetic distance. Assays were also conducted on each cultured endophyte to record bioactivity, of which 65 were found to be bioactive. Conclusions/Significance The novelty of our contribution is that we have combined bioinformatic analyses that document the diversity found in environmental samples with culturing and bioassays. These results highlight the hidden hyperdiversity of endophytic fungi and the urgent need to explore and conserve hidden microbial diversity. This study also showcases how undergraduate students can obtain data of great scientific significance."

Here, we have examined whether ER binding sites that are located distal from the transcription start sites of estrogen target genes are functionally relevant. Similar to ER binding sites near the proximal promoter region, ER binding sites located at distal locations are occupied by ERs after estrogen stimulation. And, like proximal bound ERs, ERs occupied at distal sites can recruit coactivators and the RNA polymerase transcription machinery and mediate specific structural changes to chromatin. Furthermore, ERs occupied at the distal sites are capable of communicating with ERs bound at the promoter region, possibly via long range chromosome looping. In functional analysis, disruption of the response elements in the distal ER binding sites abrogated ER binding and significantly reduced transcriptional response. Finally, sequence comparison of the response elements at the distal sites suggests a high level of conservation across different species. Together, our data indicate that distal ER binding sites are bona fide transcriptional enhancers that are involved in long range chromosomal interaction, transcription complex formation, and distinct structural modifications of chromatin across large genomic spans.

Estrogens also have important functions in hormone-dependent diseases, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis (1Nilsson S. Makela S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators, therapeutic agents that act as agonists or antagonists depending on the target tissue, are currently used in the treatment and prevention of these and other hormone-related disorders (1Nilsson S.

Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators exert their effects through two estrogen receptors (ERs), ER alpha (ERα/ESR1/NR3A1) and ER beta (ERβ/ESR2/NR3A2), which belong to a large superfamily of nuclear hormone receptor proteins (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). ERs share a conserved structural and functional organization with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, including domains responsible for ligand binding, dimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).As their domain structures imply, ERs behave as ligand-inducible, DNA binding transcription factors (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Their transcriptional activities require the recruitment of a variety of co-regulatory proteins by the receptors to estrogen-regulated promoters through either direct or indirect interactions (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A group of factors, including the p160/steroid receptor co-activator (SRC) family of proteins and the Mediator-like complexes (e.g. TRAP, DRIP, and ARC), have been shown to interact with and stimulate the transcriptional activities of ERs by interacting directly with the ligand binding domain in a ligand and activation function-2-dependent manner (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Other factors that contain enzymatic activities, such as the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP and the histone methyltransferase CARM-1, are recruited indirectly by ERs mainly via interactions with the SRC proteins (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A smaller subset of ER-interacting factors has been shown to bind primarily to the N-terminal A/B region of the receptors, including the RNA-binding protein p68/p72 and SRA (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Together, these co-regulatory proteins are recruited by ERs in a precise temporal and coordinated manner in response to estrogen to promote local changes in histone modifications, chromatin structure, and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of target genes.Numerous estrogen target genes have been identified through expression microarray studies (reviewed in Ref. 4Kininis M. Kraus W.L. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2008; 6: e005Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear what fraction of these genes are directly regulated by ERs. Direct regulation by estrogen is largely due to the recruitment of ERs to genomic regions containing sequence specific cis-regulatory motifs (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These sequences mostly contain a 13-bp palindromic motif (GGTCAnnnTGACC) called estrogen response elements (EREs) (2Heldring N. Pike A. Andersson S. Matthews J. Cheng G. Hartman J. Tujague M. Strom A. Treuter E. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 905-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Green K.A. Carroll J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Through classic molecular analyses, estrogen-regulated genes were typically found to be associated with a single ER binding site, containing either a full ERE, half ERE, or other binding elements, located near the TSS at the proximal promoter region (5Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Well known examples of genes directly regulated by ER whose binding site is at the proximal promoter include CATD, EBAG9, and pS2/TFF1 (5Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar).To obtain a better understanding of how ER binding directly regulates gene expression under estrogen signaling, we recently mapped the genomic landscape of ERα binding sites in breast cancer cells using a ChIP-and-clone approach called ChIP-PET (Chromatin immunoprecipitation-Paired End diTags) (6Lin C.Y. Vega V.B. Thomsen J.S. Zhang T. Kong S.L. Xie M. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Barnett D.H. Stossi F. Yeo A. George J. Kuznetsov V.A. Lee Y.K. Charn T.H. Palanisamy N. Miller L.D. Cheung E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Wei C.L. Liu E.T. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). From this study, 1234 ERα binding sites were identified in estradiol-stimulated MCF-7 cells. The majority of these ER binding sites contained full EREs (71%), whereas the rest harbored either half EREs (25%) or had no identifiable ERE motif (4%). Surprisingly, most of the ER binding sites were not concentrated at the proximal promoter region of genes as anticipated but distributed throughout the genome. A large proportion of the binding sites were found at distal regions, 5-100 kb from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the adjacent transcripts. Furthermore, these ER binding sites often occurred as groups of two or more distributed far apart from each other. Whether ERs recruited to these distal binding sites are functional and how they are able to regulate the transcription of target genes from large genomic distances is unclear. Herein, we have examined in detail the functional consequences of ERα recruitment at distal binding sites on coactivator recruitment, histone modification, and ER-dependent transcription. Our results suggest that multiple ERs function cooperatively with each other by communicating through long distance interaction to modify chromatin structure and formation of a stable and active transcription machinery to directly regulate the expression of ER target genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—17β-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene were purchased from Sigma. TPBM (NSC 95910) was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Commercially available antibodies raised against the following proteins and histone modifications were purchased from Abcam, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Upstate, or Labvision and used in chromatin immunoprecipitation: ERα (ab-10; MS-315), ERα (HC-20; sc-543), NCOA3/AIB1 (c-20; sc-7216), GCN5 (N-18; sc-6303), CBP (c-20; sc-583), CARM1 (07-080), p68 (05-850), SRA (H-190; sc-20660), SRC-1 (05-522), unphosphorylated RNA pol II (8WG16; MMS-126R), RNA pol II phospho ser 5 (ab5131), H3K4me1 (ab8895), H3K4me2 (07-030), H3K4me3 (07-473), H3K9me1 (ab9045), H3K9me2 (07-441), H3K9me3 (ab8898), acH4 (06-598), acH3 (06-599), acH3K9 (06-942), H3Arg17me2 (07-214), bulk histone H3 (ab1791), normal goat IgG (sc-2028), normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027), and normal mouse IgG (sc-2025).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Reporter Assays—Human mammary cancer MCF-7 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Two days prior to transfection, cells were transferred and maintained in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin. A day before transfection cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of ∼60%. Cells were transfected with FuGENE™ 6 as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Firefly luciferase reporter constructs were transfected together with the pRenilla luciferase-TK plasmid as the internal control at a ratio of 50:1 of firefly to Renilla luciferase. Following an overnight incubation with the transfection mixture, the cells were treated with ethanol or 10 nm E2. After 48 h cells were harvested and firefly and Renilla luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative reporter gene activity was obtained after normalization of the firefly luciferase activity with Renilla luciferase activity. Each experiment was repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility.Small Interfering RNA Studies—MCF-7 cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum 1 day prior to transfection. 100 nm siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA Pool #1 or ERα ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) was then transfected into MCF-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. 48 h following siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with either E2 or vehicle for 45 min (for Western blot analysis, 3C, and ChIP assays) or 8 h (for mRNA analysis). Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRI® reagent (Sigma) and chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and purified using Qiagen RNeasy. The RNA was then reverse transcribed in the presence of oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega), dNTP Mix, and M-MLV RT (Promega). Quantitative PCR of the cDNA was carried out using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR machine.Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Recombinant FLAG-tagged hERα-(1-595) was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (7Cheung E. Schwabish M.A. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (8Kraus W.L. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 952-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-radiolabeled probes containing sequences for either TFF1 EREs or the Xenopus vitellogenin ERE were incubated with or without 20 nm of ERα on ice for 15 min in the presence of 100 nm E2. The samples were separated on a 4.8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed on x-ray film.ChIP, 3C, and ChIP-3C/ChIP-Loop Assays—ChIP experiments were performed as essentially described (6Lin C.Y. Vega V.B. Thomsen J.S. Zhang T. Kong S.L. Xie M. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Barnett D.H. Stossi F. Yeo A. George J. Kuznetsov V.A. Lee Y.K. Charn T.H. Palanisamy N. Miller L.D. Cheung E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Wei C.L. Liu E.T. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 45 min of drug treatment cells were cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature and stopped with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Crossed-linked cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer, and sonicated for 8-10 min in a Biorupter (Diagenode) to generate DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp. Chromatin extracts were diluted 5-fold with dilution buffer, pre-cleared with Protein-A- and/or -G-Sepharose beads, and immunoprecipitated with specific antibody on Protein-A- and/or -G-Sepharose beads. After washing, elution and de-cross-linking, the ChIP DNA was detected by either traditional PCR (25-35 cycles) or by quantitative real-time PCR analyses with SYBR green master mix on the ABI Prism 7900.3C was performed as described previously (9Hagege H.

Briefly, MCF-7 cells were treated as mentioned in the ChIP protocol up to the cross-linking step with 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of 1.2× restriction enzyme buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. 7.5 μl of 20% SDS was added, the mixture was incubated for 1 h, followed by addition of 50 μl of 20% Triton X-100, and then incubation for an additional 1 h. Samples were then incubated with 400 units of selected restriction enzyme at 37 °C overnight. After digestion, 40 μl of 20% SDS was added to the digested nuclei, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. 6.125 ml of 1.15× ligation buffer and 375 μl of 20% Triton X-100 was added, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then 2000 units of T4 DNA ligase was added at 16 °C for a 4-h incubation.Samples were then de-cross-linked at 65 °C overnight followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. All primers had to be within a region of ±150 bp from the restriction enzyme digestion site. PCR products were amplified with AccuPrime Tag High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) for 40 cycles. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel. Each validation experiment was repeated at least twice.ChIP-3C/ChIP-Loop assays were performed as essentially described previously with slight modifications (10Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S.

Chromatin still bound to the antibody-Protein-A-Sepharose beads was digested with restriction enzyme, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, eluted, and de-cross-linked. After purification, the ChIP-3C material was detected for long range interaction with primers from the distal and promoter ER binding regions. Primer sequences used for ChIP, 3C, and ChIP-3C assays are available upon request.Evolutionary Conservation Analysis—The proximal promoter sequence of TFF1 (from 1 kb upstream to 200 bp downstream of the TSS) in human (hg17), chimp (panTro1), rhesus (rheMac2), mouse (mm7), rat (rn4), dog (canFam2), and cow (bosTau2) were retrieved and aligned using ClustalW. A similar procedure was used for the region upstream of TFF1 and intronic to TMPRSS3 in which the distal EREs are located. Here, a 2-kb window (chr21: 42,668,352-42,670,351) was used to include the full intron and the two flanking exons.RESULTSEstrogen Up-regulated Genes Are Often Associated with Multiple ER Binding Sites—Our previous genome-wide ERα binding site study in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that estrogen up-regulated genes in general were more significantly associated with ER binding compared with down-regulated genes (6Lin C.Y. Vega V.B. Thomsen J.S. Zhang T. Kong S.L. Xie M. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Barnett D.H. Stossi F. Yeo A. George J. Kuznetsov V.A. Lee Y.K. Charn T.H. Palanisamy N. Miller L.D. Cheung E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Wei C.L. Liu E.T. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). When we examined the location of ER binding with respect to the up-regulated genes, we observed that many genes, including previously known estrogen direct targets such as TFF1, CYP1B1, SIAH2, CTSD, and GREB1, were associated with multiple ER binding sites that are distributed across large genomic distances of up to 100 kb apart (Fig. 1). From these observations, it appears that transcriptional regulation of a large subset of estrogen up-regulated genes may require the actions of not one but multiple ERs functioning collectively through a mechanism involving long distance chromatin interaction.To understand the molecular basis of how ERs function together across large genomic distances, we examined the recruitment of ERα to the regulatory region of a well characterized E2-responsive gene, TFF1. From our ERα ChIP-PET analysis, ERα appears to be recruited at two main locations, 1) at the proximal promoter (∼-400 bp) which has been previously characterized and 2) a novel region ∼10 kb upstream of the TSS (Fig. 1). The ERα binding site at the proximal promoter has been shown to harbor a functional ERE motif in previous studies (12Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Nunez A.M. Berry M. Imler J.L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the distal ER binding site shows there are two potential ERE motifs (Fig. 2A). To determine whether ERα can bind directly to these 2 EREs, we performed gel mobility shift assays with purified recombinant FLAG-tagged ERα (Fig. 2B). As expected, ERα bound efficiently to radiolabeled double stranded probes containing sequences of the promoter ERE (ERE I) and the positive control, vitellogenin ERE. ERα also bound to probes containing sequences of the two EREs (ERE II and III) found in the distal ER binding site (Fig. 2B). Mutating the ERE sites in the gel mobility shift probes completely abrogated the binding of ERα to all 3 ERE sites (data not shown). In addition to gel shift assays, ChIP analyses were performed in MCF-7 cells to assess the in vivo binding of ERα at the corresponding ERE locations. ERα was recruited in a ligand-dependent manner to the promoter region, which encompasses ERE I, and to the distal ER binding site, which contains ERE II and III (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that ERα occupies multiple EREs at the proximal and distal regulatory regions of TFF1.FIGURE 2Multiple ERs are recruited to the TFF1 locus. A, distal ER binding sites of TFF1 identified by ChIP-PET contain potential EREs. DNA sequence and location of the previously identified ERE (ERE I) at the proximal ER binding site and two potential EREs (ERE II and III) at the distal binding sites of TFF1. B, gel mobility shift assay was performed using purified recombinant ERα protein and radiolabeled, double-stranded probes for TFF1 ERE I, ERE II, ERE III, and Xenopus vitellogenin A2 ERE as control. The samples were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with subsequent exposure to x-ray film. C, ChIP assays using anti-ERα and IgG were performed with MCF-7 cells treated with or without E2 for 45 min. Total input and ChIP material were detected by traditional PCR with primer pairs located at ERE I, II, and III of TFF1. A schematic diagram of the TFF1 locus with the three ERE sites is shown below.

To examine the repertoire of coactivators recruited to ER binding sites of TFF1, we performed ChIP assays targeting the proximal and distal binding sites with antibodies against various proteins that are known coactivators of ERα. As expected, stimulation of MCF-7 cells with E2 resulted in enhanced recruitment of activation function-2-dependent coactivators, including SRCs (SRC-1 and AIB1), CBP, GCN5, CARM1, and the AF-1-dependent coactivators, p68 and SRA, to ERE I in the ER binding site near the proximal promoter (Fig. 3). These same coactivators also bound to both ERE II and ERE III in the distal ER binding site in a similar manner. Interestingly, in addition to coactivators, RNA pol II (both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms) was also recruited to all three ERE sites, indicating that the distal EREs may have similar functional properties as the proximal ERE.FIGURE 3The distal ER binding site of TFF1 functions by recruiting coactivators and the basal transcription machinery. ChIP assays using antibodies against ERα, coactivators, and RNA pol II were performed with MCF-7 cells treated with or without E2 as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The recruitment of ER, coactivators, and the RNA polymerase machinery to the distal ER binding site of TFF1 suggests that regulatory elements located far away may play an important role in estrogen-dependent transcription. Because our binding experiments were limited to only the ERE sites, it is possible that we may have overlooked important information regarding the recruitment of ER, coactivators, and RNA polymerase to other regulatory regions of TFF1. We therefore expanded our analysis by scanning across a 19-kb region of the TFF1 locus by ChIP quantitative PCR, which included not only the proximal and distal ER binding sites, but also surrounding upstream and downstream regions such as the coding and noncoding region of the TFF1 gene. As shown in Fig. 4, estrogen induced the recruitment of ERα at three major locations along the 19-kb TFF1 locus with one sharp distinct peak at the promoter corresponding to ERE I, and another two (one small and one large) peaks at 9 and 10 kb corresponding to ERE II and ERE III, respectively. The recruitment of coactivators AIB1 and CBP also generated similar binding profiles as ERα. In contrast, estrogen induced a very different pattern for RNA pol II recruitment compared with ERα and the coactivators. Both the phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated RNA pol II bound to three main regions with very broad occupancy spanning 4-5 kb in width. Two of these regions co-localized with the proximal and distal ER binding sites, whereas a third RNA pol II peak appeared after the TFF1 gene. Collectively, our ChIP analyses suggest that the distal EREs can recruit the same set of factors as the ERE at the proximal promoter of TFF1.FIGURE 4Estrogen induces the recruitment of ERα and coactivators to specific sites while inducing RNA pol II spreading across large genomic regions.

https://openalex.org/W2015489525,"Disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark feature of immune-mediated neurological disorders as diverse as viral hemorrhagic fevers, cerebral malaria and acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. Although current models hypothesize that immune cells promote vascular permeability in human disease, the role CD8 T cells play in BBB breakdown remains poorly defined. Our laboratory has developed a novel murine model of CD8 T cell mediated central nervous system (CNS) vascular permeability using a variation of the Theiler's virus model of multiple sclerosis. In previous studies, we observed that MHC class II(-/-) (CD4 T cell deficient), IFN-gammaR(-/-), TNF-alpha(-/-), TNFR1(-/-), TNFR2(-/-), and TNFR1/TNFR2 double knockout mice as well as those with inhibition of IL-1 and LTbeta activity were susceptible to CNS vascular permeability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the extent immune effector proteins utilized by CD8 T cells, perforin and FasL, contributed to CNS vascular permeability. Using techniques such as fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), T1 gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FITC-albumin leakage assays, microvessel isolation, western blotting and immunofluorescent microscopy, we show that in vivo stimulation of CNS infiltrating antigen-specific CD8 T cells initiates astrocyte activation, alteration of BBB tight junction proteins and increased CNS vascular permeability in a non-apoptotic manner. Using the aforementioned techniques, we found that despite having similar expansion of CD8 T cells in the brain as wildtype and Fas Ligand deficient animals, perforin deficient mice were resistant to tight junction alterations and CNS vascular permeability. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that CNS infiltrating antigen-specific CD8 T cells have the capacity to initiate BBB tight junction disruption through a non-apoptotic perforin dependent mechanism and our model is one of few that are useful for studies in this field. These novel findings are highly relevant to the development of therapies designed to control immune mediated CNS vascular permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1977636458,"The yeast nucleosome assembly protein 1 (yNap1) plays a role in chromatin maintenance by facilitating histone exchange as well as nucleosome assembly and disassembly. It has been suggested that yNap1 carries out these functions by regulating the concentration of free histones. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of yNap1-histone interactions also provides information on the thermodynamics of chromatin. We have developed quantitative methods to study the affinity of yNap1 for histones. We show that yNap1 binds H2A/H2B and H3/H4 histone complexes with low nm affinity, and that each yNap1 dimer binds two histone fold dimers. The yNap1 tails contribute synergistically to histone binding while the histone tails have a slightly repressive effect on binding. The (H3/H4)(2) tetramer binds DNA with higher affinity than it binds yNap1."
https://openalex.org/W2032605950,"Vital vertebrate organs are protected from the external environment by a barrier that to a large extent consists of mucins. These proteins are characterized by poorly conserved repeated sequences that are rich in prolines and potentially glycosylated threonines and serines (PTS). We have now used the characteristics of the PTS repeat domain to identify Drosophila mucins in a simple bioinformatics approach. Searching the predicted protein database for proteins with at least 4 repeats and a high ST content, more than 30 mucin-like proteins were identified, ranging from 300–23000 amino acids in length. We find that Drosophila mucins are present at all stages of the fly life cycle, and that their transcripts localize to selective organs analogous to sites of vertebrate mucin expression. The results could allow for addressing basic questions about human mucin-related diseases in this model system. Additionally, many of the mucins are expressed in selective tissues during embryogenesis, thus revealing new potential functions for mucins as apical matrix components during organ morphogenesis."

Information on risk factors was obtained antenatally (questionnaire/interview) or at birth from birth records. Use of nicotine substitutes during pregnancy (n = 40) and infertility treatment by intrauterine insemination (n = 49) were associated with an increased risk for cryptorchidism, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) (OR (95%CI)) 3.04 (95%CI 1.00-9.27) and 3.01 (95%CI 1.27-7.15), respectively. No association was seen for mothers (n = 79) who had infertility treatment in form of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment (OR 0.71 95%CI 0.21-2.38). In total, 728 (29%) reported to have smoked during pregnancy, however, no increased risk among maternal smokers was found. Furthermore, we found statistically significant associations between cryptorchidism and low birth weight, prematurity, being small for gestational age, substantial vaginal bleeding, and breech presentation, which are in accordance with other studies.Our study revealed two novel risk factors for cryptorchidism: intrauterine insemination and the use of nicotine substitutes in pregnancy. This suggests that cryptorchidism may not only be associated to genetic factors, but also to maternal lifestyle and exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2064063323,"In recent years, an idiosyncratic new class of bacterial enzymes, named BY-kinases, has been shown to catalyze protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. These enzymes share no structural and functional similarities with their eukaryotic counterparts and, to date, only few substrates of BY-kinases have been characterized. BY-kinases have been shown to participate in various physiological processes. Nevertheless, we are at a very early stage of defining their importance in the bacterial cell. In Escherichia coli, two BY-kinases, Wzc and Etk, have been characterized biochemically. Wzc has been shown to phosphorylate the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase Ugd in vitro. Not only is Ugd involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, but also in the production of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose, a compound that renders E. coli resistant to cationic antimicrobial peptides.Here, we studied the role of Ugd phosphorylation. We first confirmed in vivo the phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc and we demonstrated that Ugd is also phosphorylated by Etk, the other BY-kinase identified in E. coli. Tyrosine 71 (Tyr71) was characterized as the Ugd site phosphorylated by both Wzc and Etk. The regulatory role of Tyr71 phosphorylation on Ugd activity was then assessed and Tyr71 mutation was found to prevent Ugd activation by phosphorylation. Further, Ugd phosphorylation by Wzc or Etk was shown to serve distinct physiological purposes. Phosphorylation of Ugd by Wzc was found to participate in the regulation of the amount of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, whereas Etk-mediated Ugd phosphorylation appeared to participate in the resistance of E. coli to the antibiotic polymyxin.Ugd phosphorylation seems to be at the junction between two distinct biosynthetic pathways, illustrating the regulatory potential of tyrosine phosphorylation in bacterial physiology."

In this study, we examined the functional properties of 11 ATP1A2 mutations associated with familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine, including missense mutations (T263M, T376M, R383H, A606T, R763H, M829R, R834Q, R937P, and X1021R), a deletion mutant (del(K935-S940)ins(I)), and a frameshift mutation (S966fs). According to the Na+/K+-ATPase crystal structure, a subset of the mutated residues (Ala606, Arg763, Met829, and Arg834) is involved in important interdomain H-bond networks, and the C terminus of the enzyme, which is elongated by the X1021R mutation, has been implicated in voltage dependence and formation of a third Na+-binding site. Upon heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, the analysis of electrogenic transport properties, Rb+ uptake, and protein expression revealed pronounced and markedly diverse functional alterations in all ATP1A2 mutants. Abnormalities included a complete loss of function (T376M), impaired plasma membrane expression (del(K935-S940)ins(I) and S966fs), and altered apparent affinities for extracellular cations or reduced enzyme turnover (R383H, A606T, R763H, R834Q, and X1021R). In addition, changes in the voltage dependence of pump currents and the increased rate constants of the voltage jump-induced redistribution between E1P and E2P states were observed. Thus, mutations that disrupt distinct interdomain H-bond patterns can cause abnormal conformational flexibility and exert long range consequences on apparent cation affinities or voltage dependence.

These findings suggested that broad experimental approaches are required to cover the diversity of functional disruptions caused by FHM2 mutations. In this study we analyzed a set of 11 ATP1A2 alleles associated with familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine. All of the mutations are located in highly conserved regions that are either core motifs of all P-type ATPases or conserved among all P2-type ATPases (31Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The mutations were selected because of their location in distinct regions within the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1B); T263M is one of three FHM2 mutations in the actuator (A) domain of the enzyme. T376M affects the core sequence SDKTGT and is two amino acids apart from Asp374, which forms a phosphorylated intermediate during the reaction cycle. R383H alters a residue within a hinge region between the nucleotide-binding (N) and the phosphorylation (P) domains. The remaining point mutations and del(K935-S940)ins(I) localize to a region, which is critical for interdomain interactions during the catalytic cycle and might also interfere with intracellular access of cations to their binding sites. The Ser966 frameshift mutation adds 32 amino acids to the C-terminal end of helix M9 and therefore most likely disrupts helix M10. The X1021R mutation results in the addition of 28 amino acids to the C terminus of the enzyme, which according to the recently published crystal structure of the Na+/K+-ATPase represents an important regulatory element to optimize Na+ binding at a putative third binding site (32Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sorensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). To assess the function of the various ATP1A2 alleles, we used the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique to analyze stationary and pre-steady state currents and measured Rb+ uptake and plasma membrane expression in Xenopus oocytes. Our findings reveal a broad spectrum of abnormalities, frequently involving changes in the voltage-dependent properties of the enzyme. Mutations that disrupt critical interdomain H-bond patterns, although at distance from the cation-binding pocket, exhibited long range consequences on cation affinities. The expansion of the C terminus of the enzyme by the X1021R mutation had a dramatic effect on the interaction with Na+, supporting the critical role of this highly conserved structural element in voltage sensing and Na+ transport properties. cDNA Constructs—Human Na+/K+-ATPase α2- and β1-subunit cDNAs were subcloned into a modified pCDNA3.1 vector, as described (28Koenderink J.B.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by recombinant PCR. All PCR-derived fragments were verified by sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). To distinguish the activity of the expressed from the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase, mutations Q116R and N127D were introduced to obtain an ouabain-resistant protein (IC50 in millimolar range) (33Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The ouabain-resistant wild type α2-subunit is referred to as WT, and the respective mutants are labeled by their amino acid substitutions, e.g. R383H.

The oocytes were obtained by partial ovarectomy from anesthetized Xenopus laevis females, followed by treatment with collagenase 1A (Sigma). Each oocyte was injected with 25 ng of α2-subunit and 2.5 ng of β1-subunit cRNAs and stored in ORI buffer (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 50 mg/liter gentamycin at 18 °C for 3-4 days. Preceding the experiments, intracellular [Na+] was elevated by 45 min of incubation in Na+ loading solution (110 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm sodium citrate, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) followed by an incubation of at least 30 min in Na buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, and 2.5 mm MOPS, 2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Electrophysiology—Currents were recorded using a Turbotec 10CX amplifier (NPI Instruments, Tamm, Germany) and pClamp 7 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature (21-23 °C). The solutions used were: Na buffer (see above), K buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MOPS, 2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Sodium-rich buffers containing distinct K+ concentrations were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of Na buffer and K buffer (resulting in (100 - x) mm [Na+] and x mm [K+], where x is a number between 0 and 10). The [K+]ext-dependent currents were calculated by subtracting currents measured in K+-free Na buffer from the currents measured in presence of a distinct K+ concentration. Current amplitudes were corrected for rundown, if necessary. All of the buffers contained 10 μm ouabain to inhibit the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase. To determine the voltage dependence of stationary currents, the cells were subjected to voltage pulses. Starting from -30-mV holding potential, the cells were clamped to test potentials between -180 and +60 mV (in +20-mV increments), followed by a step back to -30 mV. This protocol was applied first (a) in Na buffer, then (b) during perfusion with Na-based buffers containing certain [K+], and (c) after washout in Na buffer again. If currents measured during periods a and c did not differ, the stationary currents were calculated from the difference between corresponding currents measured in periods b and c. All of the currents within one experiment were normalized to the amplitude at 10 mm K+ and 0 mV. Voltage-dependent K0.5 values for the stimulation of stationary pump currents by extracellular K+ were determined using fits of the following Hill equation, I = Imax1 + (K0.5[K+])nH (Eq. 1) to the normalized currents at a given membrane potential (K0.5 is the concentration of half-maximal activity, and nH is the Hill coefficient). The Hill parameters from the fits were between 1 and 1.5. Analysis of Transient Currents—The major electrogenic event within the catalytic cycle is the extracellular release or reverse binding of Na+. At high Na+ and extracellularly K+-free conditions, dephosphorylation is slow, and the enzyme is limited to carrying out electrogenic Na+/Na+ exchange (35Nakao M. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 1986; 323: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Voltage pulses can then shift the enzyme between E1P and E2P states (Fig. 1A), resulting in transient currents, which yield kinetic information about extracellular Na+ binding/release and the voltage dependence of the distribution between E1P and E2P states. Pre-steady state currents under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions were measured as the difference between currents measured first in Na buffer and then in Na buffer containing 10 mm ouabain. The data were fitted monoexponentially disregarding the first 3-5 ms to exclude capacitive artifacts. The charge Q transported during a transient current was determined as the integral of fitted currents, extrapolated to the time of onset of voltage pulses. The resulting Q-V curves were fitted with a Boltzmann function, Q(V) = Qmin + Qmax − Qmin1 + exp(Zq⋅F(V − V0.5)RT) (Eq. 2) where Qmax and Qmin are the saturation values of Q(V), V0.5 is the half-maximal voltage, zq is the fractional charge, F is the Faraday constant, R is the molar gas constant, T is the temperature, and V is the transmembrane potential. A positively shifted V0.5 value of a mutant compared with WT is indicative of an increased apparent affinity for extracellular Na+, because less negative potentials are needed to drive Na+ movement in conjunction with the E2P-E1P conformational change. An equivalent interpretation is an apparent stabilization of the E1P (or destabilization of the E2P) conformational state. Turnover Numbers—The turnover number was calculated by dividing the stationary current (at 10 mm K+ and -30 mV) by the total moved charge Qtot = Qmax - Qmin (from fits of Q-V curves with a Boltzmann function), both measured on the same oocyte. For the ATP1A2 WT-expressing cell in Fig. 4D, the stationary current and Qtot were 286 nA and 22.6 nC, respectively, resulting in a turnover of 12.7 s-1. Rb+ Uptake Measurements—Uptake of Rb+ into oocytes was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy using an AAnalyst™ 800 spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a Rubidium hollow cathode lamp (Photron, Melbourne, Australia) and a transversely heated graphite furnace. After Na+ loading, the oocytes were incubated for 3 min at 21-22 °C in Na buffer + 1 mm RbCl containing either 10 μm or 10 mm ouabain. After three washes in Rb+-free Na buffer and one in distilled H2O, individual cells were homogenized in 1 ml of distilled H2O. From these homogenates, 20-μl samples were injected into the graphite furnace for analysis. Isolation of Membrane Fractions from Oocytes—Plasma membranes were prepared as described (36Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with some modifications; 8-12 oocytes were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C in Eppendorf cups filled with MBSS buffer (20 mm MES, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) + 1% colloidal silica (Ludox Cl, Sigma), followed by two washes with MBSS. Subsequently, the cells were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C in MBSS + 0.1% polyacrylic acid (Sigma) and then washed twice with MBS buffer (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). After careful removal of MBS, the oocytes were homogenized in 1500 μl of HbA solution (20 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing Complete® protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 30 s at 10 × g (4 °C). The top 1300 μl of these samples, which contained total cellular membranes, were removed and subjected to a total membrane preparation (see below). With the remaining 200 μl, which contained the silica beads with bound plasma membranes, the addition of 1000 μl of HbA, centrifugation, and removal of supernatant were repeated three times (at 10 × g, 20 × g, and 40 × g). After the last low speed centrifugation, plasma membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C). For the isolation of total membranes, the supernatant from the first centrifugation step (see previous paragraph) was centrifuged for 3 min at 2,000 × g and 4 °C to remove yolk platelets. Subsequently, the membranes were isolated by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C). All of the samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4 μl/oocyte). The aliquots corresponding to the content of one or two oocytes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Milipore, Bedford, MA). The α2-subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase were detected with the specific polyclonal antibody AB9094 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Structural Examinations and Figures—The analyses of possible H-bonding patterns of the Na+/K+-ATPase (Protein Data Bank structure entry 3B8E) and Ca2+-ATPase SERCA (E1(Ca2+) Protein Data Bank structure entry 1SU4 (37Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) and E2(TG) Protein Data Bank structure entry 1IWO (38Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar)) were carried out with Swiss Protein Data Bank viewer 3.7. The figures were prepared with PyMOL 1.0r1. Figure presentation and statistical analyses (Student's t test) were carried out with Origin 7.5 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes, K+-stimulated Pump Currents and Rb+ Uptake—To assess the ion transport capacity of the various ATP1A2 alleles, Na+/K+ pump currents were measured upon stimulation by different extracellular [K+]. Fig. 2A shows that the mean pump currents, measured at -30 mV, were significantly reduced compared with WT (all p > 0.005). R383H, A606T, R763H, M829R, R834Q, and X1021R exhibited mean currents between 27 and 67%. The remaining mutations (T263M, T376M, R937P, del(K935-S940)ins(I), and S966fs) showed either no or very small currents. To assess residual ion pumping activity more sensitively, we determined ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake into individual oocytes using atomic absorption spectrometry. Again, T376M and del(K935-S940)ins(I) showed no significant Rb+ uptake (p > 0.05 compared with uninjected oocytes), and values for T263M, R937P, and S966fs were below 20% of WT (Fig. 2B), confirming drastically reduced ion pumping activity. In contrast, X1021R showed Rb+ uptake of ∼75% of WT (at 1 mm Rb+), probably because of its higher K+ affinity (see below). To investigate whether the differences in transport activity were due to different expression levels or plasma membrane targeting, we carried out Western blots of simultaneously prepared plasma membrane and total membrane protein fractions. As shown in Fig. 2C total protein expression of mutant alleles was not different from WT, which also suggests intact α-β subunit interactions during protein folding and membrane insertion (39Koenderink J.B. Geibel S. Grabsch E. De Pont J.J. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51213-51222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, analysis of plasma membrane fractions revealed strongly reduced levels of mutants S966fs and del(K935-S940)ins(I) (Fig. 2C), indicating that impaired targeting to the cell surface accounts for the absence of pump currents in oocytes expressing these mutants. Dependence of Stationary Pump Currents on Membrane Potential and [K+]ext—We next determined the K0.5 values for extracellular K+ for mutants that showed sufficiently high pump currents at -30 mV (Table 1). Apparent K+ affinities were increased for R763H and X1021R but decreased for A606T (p > 0.05). Examination of the voltage dependence of pump currents revealed altered [K+]-dependent I-V curves for A606T, R763H, and R834Q compared with WT (Fig. 3), and the voltage dependence of K0.5 values for A606T and R763H was markedly changed (Fig. 3, insets). At 10 mm [K+]ext, stationary currents of WT ATP1A2 were in saturation, and the corresponding I-V curve increased steadily with voltage (Fig. 3A). At [K+]ext < 5 mm, however, bell-shaped I-V curves were obtained with a maximum at +20 mV. At subsaturating [K+]ext the electrogenic binding of extracellular K+ is responsible for the decrease of the stationary currents at positive potentials (40Rakowski R.F. Vasilets L.A. LaTona J. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For A606T the maxima of the corresponding I-V curves were shifted to +50 mV, and bell-shaped curves were only obtained at [K+]ext < 2 mm (Fig. 3B). In contrast, for R763H and R834Q bell-shaped I-V curves were even found at saturating extracellular [K+] (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating an abnormal decrease of enzyme turnover at positive potentials.TABLE 1K0.5 values from [K+]ext dependence of pump currents and parameters of Boltzmann fits to Q-V curves derived from transient currents (means ± S.E., n = number of cells)From stationary pump currents at −30 mVFrom transient currents at [Na+]ext = 100 mm and [K+]ext = 0TurnovernK0.5 (K+)nV0.5zqmmmVs−1WT0.95 ± 0.05184.3 ± 3.50.82 ± 0.0312.8 ± 3.018T263MNANANANANANAT376MNANANANANANAR383H0.98 ± 0.061430.4 ± 6.40.80 ± 0.076.1 ± 1.212A606T1.42 ± 0.123243.2 ± 8.60.85 ± 0.078.9 ± 2.515R763H0.72 ± 0.05256.2 ± 6.90.81 ± 0.024.2 ± 1.818M829R0.85 ± 0.0216−12.0 ± 6.40.77 ± 0.0411.6 ± 3.715R834Q0.87 ± 0.061025.6 ± 8.60.93 ± 0.23.6 ± 1.06R937PNANANANANANAS966fsNANANANANANAdel(K935-S940)ins(I)NANANANANANAX1021R0.37 ± 0.059−30 ± 200.29 ± 0.033.5 ± 1.211 Open table in a new tab Voltage-dependent K0.5 values of WT ATP1A2 (inset in Fig. 3A) follow a characteristic U-shaped curve with a minimum at 0 mV. The K0.5 curve for A606T was positively shifted with a minimum at +50 mV, resulting in increased K0.5 values below 0 mV compared with WT. In contrast, K0.5 values for R763H were significantly reduced at all potentials, and those of R834Q were slightly smaller than for WT between +20 and -40 mV. Other mutants did not differ from WT in this set of experiments (data not shown). Because of elevated background conductances and current drifts in oocytes expressing X1021R, sufficiently stable recordings for repetitive voltage pulse experiments were not feasible. Kinetics and Voltage Dependence of Transient Currents—To further investigate the properties of electrogenic Na+ transport, we performed voltage pulse experiments under extracellularly high [Na+], K+-free conditions. Fig. 4B shows representative ouabain-sensitive transient currents from an oocyte expressing WT ATP1A2. The apparent rate constants were ∼80 s-1 at positive potentials and exhibited a characteristic increase at negative potentials (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4D shows the voltage-dependent distribution of translocated charge (Q-V curve) for the WT ATP1A2-expressing cell from Fig. 4B. The mean values for the fractional charge zq and the midpoint potential V0.5 from Boltzmann fits of Q-V curves for the different ATP1A2 mutants are listed in Table 1. The C-terminal missense mutation X1021R led to most striking abnormalities in the behavior of transient currents under electrogenic Na+/Na+ exchange conditions. Contrasting with W"
https://openalex.org/W2116683201,"Intense motivational salience attribution is considered to have a major role in the development of different psychopathologies. Numerous brain areas are involved in “normal” motivational salience attribution processes; however, it is not clear whether common or different neural mechanisms also underlie intense motivational salience attribution. To elucidate this a brain area and a neural system had to be envisaged that were involved only in motivational salience attribution to highly salient stimuli. Using intracerebral microdialysis, we found that natural stimuli induced an increase in norepinephrine release in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice proportional to their salience, and that selective prefrontal norepinephrine depletion abolished the increase of norepinephrine release in the medial prefrontal cortex induced by exposure to appetitive (palatable food) or aversive (light) stimuli independently of salience. However, selective norepinephrine depletion in the medial prefrontal cortex impaired the place conditioning induced exclusively by highly salient stimuli, thus indicating that prefrontal noradrenergic transmission determines approach or avoidance responses to both reward- and aversion-related natural stimuli only when the salience of the unconditioned natural stimulus is high enough to induce sustained norepinephrine outflow. This affirms that prefrontal noradrenergic transmission determines motivational salience attribution selectively when intense motivational salience is processed, as in conditions that characterize psychopathological outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2124544785,"Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignant diseases. Anthracyclines are among the main drugs used for breast cancer therapy and in many other malignant conditions. Single parameter analysis or global gene expression profiles have failed to identify mechanisms causing in vivo resistance to anthracyclines. While we previously found TP53 mutations in the L2/L3 domains to be associated with drug resistance, some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 were also therapy resistant. The aim of this study was; 1) To explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m(2) every 3 week) in patients with primary, locally advanced breast cancer; 2) Identify critical mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of Chk2 and p14 proteins corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14((ARF)) genes; and 4) Explore potential CHEK2 or p14((ARF)) germline mutations with respect to family cancer incidence.Snap-frozen biopsies from 109 patients collected prior to epirubicin (as preoperative therapy were investigated for TP53, CHEK2 and p14((ARF)) mutations by sequencing the coding region and p14((ARF)) promoter methylations. TP53 mutations were associated with chemoresistance, defined as progressive disease on therapy (p = 0.0358; p = 0.0136 for mutations affecting p53 loop domains L2/L3). Germline CHEK2 mutations (n = 3) were associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.0226). Combined, mutations affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; TP53 mutations restricted to the L2/L3 domains: p = 0.0032). Two patients progressing on therapy harbored the CHEK2 mutation, Arg95Ter, completely abrogating Chk2 protein dimerization and kinase activity. One patient (Epi132) revealed family cancer occurrence resembling families harboring CHEK2 mutations in general, the other patient (epi203) was non-conclusive. No mutation or promoter hypermethylation in p14((ARF)) were detected.This study is the first reporting an association between CHEK2 mutations and therapy resistance in human cancers and to document mutations in two genes acting direct up/down-stream to each other to cause therapy failure, emphasizing the need to investigate functional cascades in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2168873940,"2,4-Dihydroxyquinoline (DHQ) is an abundant extracellular metabolite of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is secreted into growth medium in stationary phase to concentrations comparable with those of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that PqsD, a condensing enzyme in the pqs operon that is essential for Pseudomonas quinolone signal synthesis, accounts for DHQ formation in vivo. First, the anthraniloyl moiety is transferred to the active-site Cys of PqsD to form an anthraniloyl-PqsD intermediate, which then condenses with either malonyl-CoA or malonyl-acyl carrier protein to produce 3-(2-aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanoyl-CoA. This short-lived intermediate undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement to form DHQ. DHQ was produced by Escherichia coli coexpressing PqsA and PqsD, illustrating that these two proteins are the only factors necessary for DHQ synthesis. Thus, PqsD is responsible for the production of DHQ in P. aeruginosa. 2,4-Dihydroxyquinoline (DHQ) is an abundant extracellular metabolite of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is secreted into growth medium in stationary phase to concentrations comparable with those of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal.

All of the gene products in the pqsABCD gene cluster are thought to be essential for the formation of PQS and HHQ (9Gallagher L.A. McKnight S.L. Kuznetsova M.S. Pesci E.C. Manoil C. J.

The prediction that PqsA is a CoA ligase is borne out by recent in vitro experiments illustrating that PqsA is an anthraniloyl-CoA synthetase (11Coleman J.P. Hudson L.L. McKnight S.L.

The details of HHQ biosynthesis are unknown, but the anthraniloyl-CoA intermediate is predicted to react with a β-keto fatty acid via a “head-to-head” condensation in a series of steps requiring PqsB, PqsC, and PqsD to form HHQ (12Bredenbruch F. Nimtz M. Wray V. Morr M. Muller R. Haussler S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which is converted to PQS by the hydroxylation of HHQ catalyzed by PqsH (3Deziel E. Lépine F. Milot S. He J.

DHQ is a recently identified secondary metabolite of P. aeruginosa. Although only pqsA in the pqsABCD gene cluster is reported to be required for DHQ biosynthesis (13Lépine F. Dekimpe V. Lesic B.

Chem. 2007; 388: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the addition of two carbons to the anthraniloyl moiety in the DHQ structure indicates that a condensing enzyme-like reaction is probably involved. Despite that both DHQ and HHQ contain an anthraniloyl moiety and require PqsA for the synthesis, there is no evidence of DHQ being the precursor of HHQ and PQS.The condensing enzymes play a central role in bacterial fatty acid synthesis by elongating the growing acyl chains by two carbons (14White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the Claisen condensation reaction to form a carbon–carbon bond via a ping-pong kinetic mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate (15Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod.

In the first step, the acyl-enzyme is formed by the transfer of an acyl chain from either acyl-CoA or acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to the conserved active-site cysteine residue to form a thioester linkage. In the second step, malonyl-ACP is decarboxylated, forming a carbanion, which attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate to form the β-ketoacyl-ACP product (14White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 16Hirota M. Kitagaki M. Itagaki H. Aiba S. J. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 31: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to their essential functions in bacterial fatty acid synthesis, condensing enzymes are also important components for the formation of secondary metabolites such as polyketides (17Hutchinson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3336-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although PqsB, PqsC, and PqsD are designated as condensing enzymes in the sequencing data bases, only PqsD (or FabH1) possesses the Cys-His-Asn triad of active-site residues present in bone fide β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) condensing enzymes. PqsC lacks the Asn, and PqsB lacks all three of the active-site resides, although it retains some overall similarity to the N-terminal domains in the FabH condensing enzyme superfamily. In this study, we used a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses to demonstrate that the condensing enzyme activity of PqsD is responsible for the synthesis of DHQ in P. aeruginosa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Reagents—PAO1 (pqsA, pqsB, pqsC, and pqsD) strains were cultured at 37 °C in LB or tryptic soy broth (BD Biosciences) unless specified otherwise. The reagents used in this study were purchased from the following suppliers: Sigma, anthranilic acid and [ring-UL-14C]anthranilic acid (specific activity of 61.1 mCi/mmol), malonyl-CoA, ATP, and DHQ; Analtech, Silica Gel H plates; Promega, restriction enzymes; and BD Biosciences, Pseudomonas isolation agar. Malonyl-ACP was prepared using AcpS (ACP synthase) with apo-ACP and malonyl-CoA as described (18Zhang Y.-M. Hurlbert J. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17390-17399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Anthraniloyl-CoA was prepared by PqsA with anthranilic acid and CoA. Briefly, the reaction contained 82 μm [ring-UL-14C]anthranilic acid (specific activity of 61.1 mCi/mmol), 200 μm CoA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 12.5 μg/ml purified PqsA protein in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before being subjected to centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra concentration filter (10 kDa) to get rid of the PqsA protein. The complete conversion of anthranilic acid to anthraniloyl-CoA in the filtrate was confirmed by TLC.Plasmid Construction and Mutant Generation—The pqsB, pqsC, and pqsD mutants generated by transposon insertions were obtained from the P. aeruginosa mutant collection at the University of Washington Genome Center. The DNA sequence located between the loxP sites in the transposon mutant was excised by Cre-mediated recombination by conjugation of SM10λ/pCre1 donors with the transposon mutant recipients, leaving a 189-bp insertion at the location of the original transposon. The pqsA mutant was created by gene replacement technology as described previously (19Choi K.-H. Schweizer H.P. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Zhu K. Choi K.-H. Schweizer H.P. Rock C.O. Zhang Y.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA fragment containing the upstream sequence of pqsA and ∼200 bp of pqsA 5′-end, a gentamicin cassette, and a DNA fragment containing downstream sequence of pqsA were cloned into pEX18ApGW (19Choi K.-H. Schweizer H.P. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was conjugated from Escherichia coli SM10λpir into strain PAO1 with selection of gentamicin and carbenicillin on Pseudomonas isolation agar plates (BD Biosciences). Merodiploids formed via a single crossover event were resolved through 5% sucrose selection in the presence of gentamicin. The gentamicin resistance cassette was subsequently removed by Flp recombinase, resulting in a 1.3-kb deletion in pqsA. The presence of the deletion was verified by PCR and sequencing.Protein Purification—The gene fragment encoding PqsA or PqsD was subcloned into expression plasmid pET-28a (Novagen) between the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. The resultant plasmids were transformed into the Rosetta(DE3) strain (Novagen) to express the proteins with an N-terminal His tag. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth in the presence of 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A600 of 0.8, heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and lysed with a French press. His-tagged protein in the cell-free extract was purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (21Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the purified protein were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C.PqsA Activity Assay—The conversion of anthranilic acid to anthraniloyl-CoA by PqsA was measured by TLC. Briefly, each 40-μl reaction contained 82 μm [ring-UL-14C]anthranilic acid (specific activity of 61.1 mCi/mmol), 200 μm CoA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 250 ng of purified PqsA protein in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was initiated by the addition of PqsA. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on an activated Silica Gel H plate, which was developed in butanol/acetic acid/water (5:2:4, volume ratio). The dried TLC plate was exposed to a storage PhosphorImager screen, and the autoradiograph was scanned using a Typhoon 9200. The radioactivity was quantitated using ImageQuant Version 5.1 software.Activity Assay of PqsD—The activity of PqsD was analyzed by TLC using malonyl-CoA and [14C]anthraniloyl-CoA produced in situ by PqsA or prepared in advance. The PqsD reaction contained 82 μm [14C]anthraniloyl-CoA, 125 μm malonyl-CoA, and the indicated concentration of PqsD in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 20 μl of the 40-μl reaction mixture was spotted on an activated Silica Gel H plate. The TLC plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (95:5:1, volume ratio), and the product was quantitated and analyzed as described above.Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—The PqsA or PqsD reaction products with non-radioactive substrates were analyzed on a Waters Alliance HT liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system (Waters 2795 separation module linked to a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector), which was controlled by MassLynx Version 4.1 software. A 30-μl aliquot was injected onto a Waters XBridge C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm) and eluted using a methanol gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 0% methanol for 1 min, linear gradient from 0 to 60% methanol over 1.5 min, linear gradient from 60 to 95% methanol over 4.5 min, and linear gradient from 95 to 0% methanol over 2 min. The samples from the separation module were injected onto a Waters Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer and analyzed using positive ion mode electrospray mass spectrometry with a cone voltage of 60 V, a source temperature of 130 °C, and a desolvation temperature of 350 °C.Extraction of P. aeruginosa Medium Supernatant—Strains of P. aeruginosa were grown in 50 ml of tryptic soy broth to stationary phase (A600 = 4.0). The cells were removed by centrifugation and filtration. The resultant medium supernatant was extracted twice with an equal volume of acidified ethyl acetate in a separating funnel. The two extraction mixtures were combined, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of ethyl acetate for LC-MS analysis.[14C]Anthranilic Acid Metabolic Labeling—Strains were grown in LB broth supplemented with 0.005% tryptophan and 33 μm [ring-UL-14C]anthranilic acid (specific activity of 61.1 mCi/mmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. To detect DHQ levels,10 μl of supernatant was loaded onto a Silica Gel H plate (pre-activated at 90 °C for 1 h) and developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (95:5:1, volume ratio). The dried TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, which was scanned with a Typhoon 9200.Viability of MLE-12 Cells—MLE-12 cells were maintained in 2% fetal bovine serum supplemented HITES medium modified with transferrin (10 μg/ml), HEPES (10 mm), and l-glutamine (2 mm in addition to that in the base medium). Monolayers of MLE-12 cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution for 15 min and subcultured in 6-well plates at 5% density. After overnight incubation, fresh medium containing 150 μm DHQ was added to DHQ-treated wells, whereas medium with an equal volume of solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to control wells. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Total cells and viable cells excluding trypan blue stain were counted at 0, 24, and 48 h after DHQ or DMSO was added. To determine the effects of different concentrations of DHQ, the MLE-12 cells were treated with 10, 25, 75, and 150 μm DHQ or DMSO for 48 h.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFunctional Predictions in the pqs Operon of P. aeruginosa—The addition of an acetate moiety to anthranilate is required to form the basic structure of DHQ. Such two-carbon additions are typically carried out by condensing enzymes that decarboxylate malonyl-CoA (or malonyl-ACP) in the process of forming the new carbon–carbon bond. The first protein encoded by the pqs operon PqsA is an anthraniloyl-CoA synthetase (11Coleman J.P. Hudson L.L. McKnight S.L. Farrow III, J.M. Calfee M.W. Lindsey C.A. Pesci E.C. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that anthraniloyl-CoA is the primer for the condensing enzyme step. Condensation reactions that use acyl-CoA primers are carried out by the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III or FabH family of proteins (Pfam08545). Therefore, the predicted amino acid sequences of the pqs genes were compared with the E. coli initiation condensing enzyme (FabH) to identify potential gene products involved in the postulated condensation reaction in DHQ biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa. PqsB, PqsC, and PqsD all have some degree of overall sequence similarity to E. coli FabH. Multiple sequence alignment of these three proteins with E. coli FabH showed that they are most highly related in the three areas surrounding the location of the Cys-His-Asn active-site triad in E. coli FabH (Fig. 1). PqsD possesses all three predicted active-site residues and is the most highly related protein to E. coli FabH, leading to its annotation as FabH1 in the P. aeruginosa genome data base. These similarities strongly suggest that PqsD carries out a condensation reaction. PqsC is the second most related protein. The Cys and His residues are present; however, PqsC lacks the conserved Asn. All three active-site residues are missing in PqsB. Previous work suggests that all three active-site residues contribute to catalysis (22Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that PqsB and PqsC are not functional condensing enzymes, although their overall relatedness to E. coli FabH suggests that they may possess a similar overall fold. These functional predictions indicate that the most likely candidate condensing enzyme for a role in DHQ formation in the pqs operon is PqsD.FIGURE 1Sequence alignment of the FabH homologs encoded by the pqs operon in P. aeruginosa. PqsD, PqsC, and PqsB have three blocks of homologous sequence regions surrounding the active-site residues of E. coli (Ec) FabH (indicated by asterisks). Residues identical to those found in E. coli FabH are highlighted in black, and conservative substitutions are highlighted in gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DHQ Production in the pqs Operon Mutants—To identify the functions of Pqs enzymes in DHQ production in vivo, pqsA, pqsB, pqsC, and pqsD mutant strains were tested for their abilities to accumulate DHQ in the growth medium by both LC-MS analysis and [14C]anthranilic acid labeling. Each of these mutant alleles knocked out the function of the transcribed protein by the insertion or deletion of DNA sequences and did not introduce elements that could potentially create a polar effect on the downstream genes in the operon. The efficiency of DHQ extraction from the growth medium by acidified ethyl acetate was evaluated using a DHQ standard. LC-MS result showed that, at 0.15 mg/ml, >90% of DHQ was extracted into ethyl acetate. Thus, ethyl acetate was used to extract the extracellular quinolines from the spent media of the wild-type and mutant strains. The wild-type PAO1 strain secreted DHQ into the medium in addition to HHQ, PQS, and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide species with different acyl chain modifications (Fig. 2, A and B). LC-MS analyses of the growth medium extracts showed that no detectable levels of DHQ or other quinolines were observed in the pqsA mutant strain, demonstrating a requirement of PqsA for the formation of DHQ and the quinoline signals (Fig. 2A). Of the three FabH homologs, only the PqsD function was required for DHQ production because both the pqsB and pqsC mutant strains produced DHQ, whereas the pqsD mutant strain did not secrete detectable DHQ (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these results using the Pseudomonas mutant strains, expression of pqsA plus pqsD in E. coli, an organism that does not produce DHQ, led to robust DHQ formation from extracellular [14C]anthranilic acid (Fig. 2C). These data show that PqsA and PqsD are both necessary and sufficient for DHQ biosynthesis. PqsA forms the anthraniloyl-CoA primer, which is converted to DHQ by PqsD.FIGURE 2Extracellular metabolites produced by the wild-type or pqs mutant strains of P. aeruginosa.

PQS, HHQ, and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) species with different acyl chains were identified by mass spectrometry.

Analyses of the pqs mutant strains demonstrated that PqsD was involved in DHQ formation in vivo; therefore, we purified recombinant PqsD protein to test this conclusion in vitro. Anthraniloyl-CoA, which was produced in situ by PqsA, was condensed with malonyl-CoA by PqsD to form a new product as shown by TLC (Fig. 3A). The identity of the product formed in the coupled reaction was confirmed by LC-MS to be DHQ, which exhibited the same elution time (3.67 min) and mass spectrum as the DHQ standard (Fig. 3, C and D). The conversion of anthraniloyl-CoA to DHQ was nearly complete in these experiments using 1 μg of each of the enzymes. As anticipated, anthraniloyl-CoA was the product in the presence of PqsA alone (Fig. 3B). Anthraniloyl-CoA was eluted at 3.43 min; the mass spectrum of the anthraniloyl-CoA product from the PqsA reaction revealed fragment peaks characteristic of both the anthraniloyl group and CoA (Fig. 3B). Malonyl-ACP was also a substrate for DHQ formation by PqsD, whereas malonic acid did not support DHQ formation (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3PqsD catalyzes the formation of DHQ in vitro. A, TLC analysis of PqsD reaction products showed that both malonyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP were substrates, whereas malonic acid was not. The reactants are indicated above each lane. The identity of the PqsD reaction product was determined by LC-MS analyses (B–D). (Each panel shows the liquid chromatograph with the mass spectrum of the indicated peak shown in the inset.) B, anthraniloyl-CoA was the product of PqsA. Anthraniloyl-CoA was eluted at 3.43 min, and the protonated molecular ion (M + H+) at m/z 887.2 was present. The ions indicated by asterisks were derived from CoA. The ion at m/z 119 was the anthraniloyl moiety; the ion at m/z 380 was the anthraniloyl moiety plus the CoA ion at m/z 261. AU, absorbance units. C, DHQ and CoA were the products of the PqsA-plus-PqsD reaction. D, shown are the results from LC-MS of the DHQ standard. DHQ was eluted at 3.67 min; the molecular ion of DHQ was at m/z 162. The fragment ions at m/z 144 and 115 are characteristic of DHQ (13Lépine F. Dekimpe V. Lesic B. Milot S. Lesimple A. Mamer O.A.

The apparent Km values of PqsD for anthraniloyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and malonyl-ACP were 35 ± 4, 104 ± 37, and 18 ± 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C). PqsD exhibited a specific activity of 0.22 ± 0.03 pmol/min/ng for DHQ formation when assayed in the linear range. Consistent with the in vivo results, neither purified PqsB nor PqsC catalyzed DHQ synthesis in vitro.FIGURE 4Kinetic parameters of PqsD. A, the apparent Km of PqsD for anthraniloyl-CoA was 35 ± 4 μm. B, the apparent Km of PqsD for malonyl (Mal)-CoA was 104 ± 37 μm. C, the apparent Km of PqsD for malonyl-ACP was 18 ± 2 μm. These kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data with the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism Version 5 software (GraphPad Software).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation of Anthraniloyl-enzyme Intermediate—A common property of condensing enzymes is the presence of a conserved active-site Cys that forms a thioester bond with an acyl primer. Our results showed that anthraniloyl-CoA was used as a primer to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate with PqsD. Incubation of PqsD with [14C]anthraniloyl-CoA produced by PqsA in situ led to the formation of a radioactive protein intermediate, indicating that the [14C]anthraniloyl group was transferred from CoA to the PqsD protein (Fig. 5A). [14C]Anthranilic acid was not a substrate for PqsD. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the covalent modification of PqsD occurred at Cys144, which aligned with the active-site Cys of the E. coli FabH protein (Fig. 1). The increase in mass of 119 Da in peptide AQCSGLLYGLQMAR was consistent with the molecular mass of an attached anthraniloyl group (Fig. 5B). None of the other five Cys residues of PqsD was modified.FIGURE 5Formation of the anthraniloyl-PqsD intermediate. A, formation of the anthraniloyl-PqsD intermediate.

B, mass spectrum of a peptide from the anthraniloyl-PqsD sample that was eluted from an SDS gel and digested with trypsin protease. The deduced sequence of the peptide was AQCSGLLYGLQMAR; the cysteine in this peptide was predicted to be the active-site cysteine based on multiple sequence alignment (see Fig. 1). The mass difference between y11 and y12 is 222.1 Da, consistent with a cysteine residue (103.1 Da) covalently modified by an anthraniloyl moiety (119 Da).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DHQ Inhibits MLE-12 Cell Viability—The lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are colonized by P. aeruginosa biofilms, where extracellular metabolites such as DHQ are accumulated. We tested the effect of DHQ on mouse lung epithelial MLE-12 cells in the presence of 150 μm DHQ, the concentration found in the growth medium of P. aeruginosa. The addition of DHQ to the cell culture medium significantly inhibited the growth of MLE-12 cells, particularly after 48 h of treatment (Fig. 6A). In addition to the reduced total cell numbers, the fraction of viable cells treated with DHQ was reduced to 30% compared with 85% of the DMSO-treated control cells. The inhibition of MLE-12 cells by DHQ was evident at 10 μm (Fig. 6B). The growth inhibitory effect of DHQ on the mouse lung epithelial cells suggests that DHQ contributes to the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa infection. Further experiments are needed to determine how DHQ reduces cell viability and what the outcomes are from long-term exposure to DHQ.FIGURE 6DHQ inhibits MLE-12 cell viability.

Class-1 PEPC is a typical 410-kDa homotetramer composed of 107-kDa plant-type PEPC subunits (p107, encoded by RcPpc3; GenBank™ accession: EF634317), whereas the native Class-2 PEPC 910-kDa heterooligomeric complex arises from a tight interaction between Class-1 PEPC and unrelated 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPC polypeptides (p118, encoded by RcPpc4; GenBank accession: EF634318) that are also phosphorylated in vivo (4Blonde J.D.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1346-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reversible in vivo seryl phosphorylation of the p107 subunit of Class-1 PEPC in response to sucrose supply indicated that PEPC (p107) protein kinase contributes to the control of carbohydrate partitioning in developing COS at the level of the cytosolic PEP branch point (6Tripodi K.E. Turner W.L. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Murmu J. Plaxton W.C. Planta. 2007; 226: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Distinctive Class-1 versus Class-2 PEPC developmental profiles during COS filling, together with Class-2 PEPC's marked insensitivity to allosteric effectors relative to Class-1 PEPC, led to the hypotheses that: (i) Class-1 and Class-2 PEPC respectively support glycolytic carbon flux required for storage protein and storage lipid synthesis in developing COS and (ii) the p118 bacterial-type PEPC functions as a regulatory subunit within the Class-2 PEPC complex (4Blonde J.D.

Fully mature and germinating COS endosperm contain immunoreactive plant-type PEPC polypeptides that co-migrate with the p107 of developing COS PEPC. However, an additional PEPC polypeptide of ∼110-kDa (p110) appears immediately following COS imbibition and persists throughout germination at an equivalent ratio with the p107 (8Gennidakis S. Rao S.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that RcPPC3 (p107) subunits become monoubiquitinated at a conserved Lys residue during the initial stages of COS germination, resulting in formation of an unusual p110:p107 Class-1 PEPC heterotetramer. Incubation with a mammalian deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) converted the p110:p107 heterotetramer into a p107 homotetramer while exerting significant effects on the enzyme's PEP saturation kinetics and response to allosteric effectors. Monoubiquitination has recently emerged as reversible post-translational modification (PTM) involved in the control of diverse processes such as gene expression and endocytosis (11Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Science. 2007; 315: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, there have been no reports describing regulatory monoubiquitination of a metabolic enzyme in any biological system studied to date. Plant Material—Developing or germinating seeds from castor (Ricinus communis L., cv. Baker 296) plants were obtained as described previously (8Gennidakis S. Rao S. Greenham K. Uhrig R.G. O'Leary B. Snedden W.A. Lu C. Plaxton W.C. Plant J. 2007; 52: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dissected endosperm (free of cotyledon) was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until used. Enzyme and Protein Assays and Kinetic Studies—PEPC activity was assayed at 340 nm using a Molecular Devices Spectramax Plus microplate reader as described previously (9Uhrig R.G. O'Leary B. Spang H.E. MacDonald J.A. She Y.M. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1346-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of PEPC catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of oxaloacetate/min at 25 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Blue G-250 dye binding method using bovine γ-globulin as the protein standard (6Tripodi K.E. Turner W.L. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Km, Ka, and I50 values were calculated using the Brooks (13Brooks S. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) computer kinetics program. All kinetic parameters are the means of at least four separate experiments and are reproducible to within ±10% (S.E.) of the mean value. Stock solutions of metabolites were made equimolar with MgCl2 and adjusted to pH 7.5. PEPC Purification—All procedures were performed at 4 °C except DEAE-Fractogel and phenyl-Superose FPLC, which were conducted at room temperature. All buffers contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm l-malate, 20 mm NaF, and 2 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide in addition to the following. Buffer A contained 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4% (w/v) PEG 8000, 5 mm thiourea, 1% (w/v) insoluble poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone), 5 mm NaPPi, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm Na(VO3)4. Buffer B contained 1 mm EGTA and 20% (saturation) (NH4)2SO4. Buffer C was buffer B lacking (NH4)2SO4 but containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Buffer D contained 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 mm KCl. Endosperm (300 g) from 4-day germinated COS was homogenized (1:2; w/v) in buffer A using a Polytron. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth. PEG 8000 (50% (w/v) in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0) was added to the solution to a final concentration of 20% (w/v) and stirred at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, PEG pellets were resuspended in buffer B (lacking (NH4)2SO4) to a final protein concentration of about 30 mg/ml. After centrifugation, a solution of (NH4)2SO4 (100% (saturation), pH 8.0) was added to the supernatant to 20% (saturation). The solution was stirred for 10 min, centrifuged, and absorbed batchwise onto 125 ml of butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow equilibrated with buffer B and packed at 4.5 ml/min into a 3.2-cm diameter column. The column was washed at 5 ml/min with buffer B until the A280 approached base line. PEPC was eluted by 50% buffer C (50% buffer B) (10 ml/fraction). Pooled peak fractions were mixed with an equal volume of 50% (w/v) PEG 8000 and incubated overnight on ice. Following centrifugation, PEG pellets were dissolved in buffer D to a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml, recentrifuged, and loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto a column (1.1 × 13 cm) of Fractogel EMD DEAE-650 (S) connected to anÄKTA FPLC system and equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with buffer D, and PEPC activity was eluted with a 100–500 mm KCl gradient (117 ml) in buffer D (3 ml/fraction). Pooled peak fractions were concentrated to 2.5 ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (30-kDa cutoff), adjusted to 25% (saturation) (NH4)2SO4, and applied at 0.5 ml/min onto a Protein Pak phenyl-5PW column (0.8 × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. PEPC was eluted following application of a linear gradient (60 ml) of 0–100% buffer C (100-0% buffer B) (0.5 ml/fraction). Pooled peak fractions were concentrated to 0.4 ml as above, divided into 25-μl aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. PEPC activity was stable for at least 4 months when stored frozen. In some instances, the final preparation was subjected to gel filtration FPLC at 0.25 ml/min on a calibrated Superose-6 HR 10/30 column (4Blonde J.D. Plaxton W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11867-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) equilibrated with buffer D. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS and non-denaturing PAGE, subunit and native Mr estimates via SDS- and non-denaturing-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (4Blonde J.D. Plaxton W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11867-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Gennidakis S. Rao S. Greenham K. Uhrig R.G. O'Leary B. Snedden W.A. Lu C. Plaxton W.C. Plant J. 2007; 52: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gels were stained for total protein using Coomassie Blue R-250 or Sypro Red, for phosphoproteins using Pro-Q Diamond (Molecular Probes) or for PEPC activity using the Fast Violet method (4Blonde J.D. Plaxton W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11867-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sypro-Red- and Pro-Q Diamond-stained gels were scanned using a Typhoon 8600 fluorescence imager (GE Healthcare). For second dimension PAGE, PEPC activity staining bands were excised from a non-denaturing gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (14Law R.D. Plaxton W.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antigenic polypeptides were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and chromogenic detection (5Crowley V. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All gel and immunoblot results were replicated a minimum of three times, with representative results shown in the various figures. N-terminal Sequencing—This was performed by automated Edman degradation at the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre (McGill University, Montréal QC, Canada). Similarity searches were performed using the BLAST program available on the NCBI web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Mass Spectrometry—Excised gel bands were destained with 100 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1, v/v) until colorless, dehydrated in 100% ACN, and dried using a SpeedVac. Following reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol (in 100 mm NH4HCO3) at 56 °C for 1 h, proteins were alkylated with an equal volume of 55 mm iodoacetamide at 23 °C for another 45 min. Subsequent digestion was performed using 10 ng of sequencing grade trypsin (Calbiochem) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.6) at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptides were extracted by successive sonication with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% ACN, and 100% ACN followed by a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) cleanup step. The peptides were deposited on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target by mixing with an equal volume (0.5 μl) of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (100 mg/ml in 50% ACN). MALDI data were acquired using an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex QStar XL Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with an oMALDI II source and a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. Peptide sequencing of the selected ions was carried out by MALDI quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) MS/MS measurements using argon as the collision gas. All peptide fingerprinting masses and MS/MS ion searches were performed with the Mascot search engine (MatrixScience) using the NCBI non-redundant data base (NCBInr released 10/10/2007; containing 5,507,867 protein sequences). These searches take into account one missed cleavage and the modifications carbamidomethylation, asparagine and glutamine deamidation to aspartate acid and glutamic acid, as well as N-terminal pyroglutamation and methionine oxidation. The mass tolerance between calculated and observed masses used for the data base search was considered at the range of ±100 ppm for mass spectrometry (MS) peaks and ±0.1 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. Ubiquitin (UB) conjugation site identification was performed as described by Ref. 37Wang D. Cotter R.J. Anal Chem. 2005; 77: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar using MS/MS analyses of both tagged (sulfonated) and non-tagged tryptic peptides. N-terminal sulfonation was performed with 10 mg/ml sulfophenyl isothiocyanate in 20 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) (15Wang D. Kalume D. Pickart C. Pandey A. Cotter R.J. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Following C18 Ziptip cleanup, MS/MS analysis of sulfonated peptides by low energy collision induced dissociation yields a set of C-terminal y fragment ions in the positive ionization mode, which enabled a reliable and rapid sequence identification of the UB-conjugation site. Deubiquitination—All DUBs were obtained from Progenra Inc. (Malvern, PA). Purified PEPC (6 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for up to 60 min with 1 μm of each DUB in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (final volume = 50-μl). Statistics—Data were analyzed using the Student's t test and deemed significant if p < 0.05. Clarified Extract Studies—Preliminary experiments corroborated earlier reports (8Gennidakis S. Rao S. Greenham K. Uhrig R.G. O'Leary B. Snedden W.A. Lu C. Plaxton W.C. Plant J. 2007; 52: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Sangwan R.S. Singh N. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that: (i) PEPC increases following imbibition from about 0.25 units/g of fresh weight in ungerminated COS endosperm to a maximum of about 0.5 units/g of fresh weight 3–4 days later, (ii) this is paralleled by the accumulation of comparable amounts of immunoreactive 110- and 107-kDa plant-type PEPC polypeptides (p110 and p107, respectively) (supplemental Fig. S1A), and (iii) a single Class-1 PEPC activity staining or immunoreactive band is obtained following non-denaturing PAGE of clarified COS extracts (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The p110 and p107 were detected in an equal ratio when the 440-kDa PEPC activity staining band obtained following non-denaturing PAGE of a germinated COS extract was denatured and subjected to second dimension SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. S2C). However, no anti-(p107 phosphorylation-site specific)-IgG (6Tripodi K.E. Turner W.L. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) immunoreactive polypeptides were detected on immunoblots of clarified germinated COS extracts (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting that p110 and p107 were not phosphorylated at PEPC's conserved N-terminal seryl residue. This contrasts with the phosphorylated 410-kDa Class-1 PEPC p107 homotetramer from developing COS (supplemental Fig. S1B) (6Tripodi K.E. Turner W.L. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Murmu J. Plaxton W.C. Planta. 2007; 226: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as PEPCs from germinated cereal (wheat, sorghum, and barley) seeds (16Osuna L. Pierre J.N. Gonzalez M.C. Alvarez R. Cejudo F.J. Echevarria C. Vidal J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Osuna L. Gonzalez M.C. Cejudo F.J. Vidal J. Echevarria C.

Plant Sci. 2000; 151: 29-37Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PEPC Purification from Germinating Castor Oil Seeds—About 6 mg of PEPC from 4-day-old germinating COS endosperm was purified 1,920-fold and a final specific activity of 9.6 units/mg with an overall yield of 37% (Table 1). The single peak of PEPC activity that was resolved during all chromatography steps co-eluted with a 1:1 ratio of immunoreactive or protein-staining p110 and p107 (Figs. 1 and 2). Although purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2), the final preparation demonstrated no detectable phosphorylation when subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein staining or anti-(p107 phosphorylation site specific)-IgG immunoblotting (not shown). The enzyme's native Mr as estimated by FPLC on a calibrated Superose-6 column (Fig. 1) was 440 ± 10 kDa (mean ± S.E., n = 3). Thus, the native PEPC exists as a non-phosphorylated heterotetramer comprised of an equivalent ratio of p110 and p107 subunits. Similar to the Class-1 PEPC homotetramer from developing COS (4Blonde J.D. Plaxton W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11867-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the purified enzyme was relatively heat-labile, losing 100% of its activity when preincubated at 55 °C for 3 min.TABLE 1Purification of PEPC from 300 g of 4-day-old germinating COS endospermStepActivityProteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldunitsmgunits/mg-fold%Clarified extract14329,7000.0051100PEG fractionation18616,3550.0112130Butyl-Sepharose1178870.132682DEAE-Fractogel109611.836076Protein Pak Phenyl-5PW535.59.61,92037 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of various fractions obtained during the purification of germinating COS PEPC.

Lane 1 contains 2.5 μg (A) or 50 ng (B) of homogeneous, non-proteolyzed, Class-1 PEPC (p107) from stage VII (full cotyledon) developing COS endosperm (4Blonde J.D. Plaxton W.C. J. Biol.

The results demonstrate that both subunits originated from the same gene (RcPpc3) that encodes the p107 subunit of the Class-1 PEPC homotetramer from developing COS and whose transcripts are abundant in both developing and germinated COS endosperm (8Gennidakis S. Rao S. Greenham K. Uhrig R.G. O'Leary B. Snedden W.A. Lu C. Plaxton W.C. Plant J. 2007; 52: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Apart from displaying virtually identical peptide mass fingerprints (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Table S1), p110 and p107 also shared an identical N-terminal sequence (VPAKVSE) (Fig. 4). Comparison with RcPPC3's cDNA-deduced sequence indicated that both subunits were N-terminally truncated by 19 amino acid residues (Fig. 4). This was likely due to a specific in vivo post-translational processing since: (i) 2 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (included in all purification buffers) negates in vitro truncation of RcPPC3's N terminus by endogenous thiol proteases (5Crowley V. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and (ii) p110 and p107 were both observed on immunoblots of clarified extracts prepared under denaturing conditions in the presence of 10% trichloroacetic acid (supplemental Fig. S1) (10Sangwan R.S. Singh N. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As RcPPC3's N-terminal phosphorylation site is removed a result of this processing (Fig. 4), this provides a rationale for the absence of detectable p110 or p107 phosphorylation in germinated COS PEPC. By contrast, the N terminus of the p107 subunit of the phosphorylated Class-1 PEPC of developing COS is truncated by only 5 amino acids and thus retains its conserved N-terminal seryl phospho-site (Fig. 4) (5Crowley V. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Tripodi K.E. Turner W.L. Gennidakis S. Plaxton W.C.

Plant J. 2007; 52: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Differential in vivo processing of PEPC's N terminus may represent an additional, but little studied, PTM that influences the enzyme's functional and regulatory properties. Interestingly, a second N-terminal sequence (MQIFVKT) was obtained when the p110 subunit of the purified germinated COS PEPC was analyzed by Edman degradation. Analysis of this sequence demonstrated that it corresponded to the N terminus of UB (Fig. 3E). The peptide mass fingerprints also revealed several p110 peptides (Fig. 3A, highlighted in bold) that were not detected in p107 tryptic digests (Fig. 3B). QqTOF MS/MS sequencing of four of these peptides identified them as originating from UB (Fig. 3E and supplemental Table S2), which corroborated the N-terminal sequencing results while providing a rationale for the size discrepancy between p110 and p107 on SDS-PAGE. Probing immunoblots of the final PEPC preparation with anti-UB-IgG resulted in monospecific detection of p110 (Fig. 5A). No additional higher Mr immunoreactive PEPC or UB bands indicative of polyubiquitination were observed.FIGURE 4Amino acid sequence alignment of COS RcPPC3 domains subject to in vivo post-translational modification with representative plant and prokaryotic PEPCs.

https://openalex.org/W2000091638,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in many cellular processes through degradation of specific proteins. Low molecular mass polypeptide 2 (LMP-2 or beta(1i)) is one important subunit of the immunoproteasome. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) activates cell signaling pathways and generates cardioprotection but has not been linked to LMP-2 function previously. LMP-2 knockout mice (C57BL6 background) and wild-type C57BL6 mice were subjected to 30 min of ischemia (I-30) and 120 min of reperfusion (R-120) with or without preceding IPC (10 min of infusion and 5 min of reperfusion). IPC significantly increased left ventricular developed pressure and decreased infarct size in wild-type mice, but this protective effect of IPC was lost in LMP-2 knockout mice. IPC-mediated degradation of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and activation of the downstream protein kinase Akt were impaired in LMP-2 knockout hearts. The impairment of PTEN degradation was associated with defective immunoproteasomes and decreased proteolytic activities. When LMP-2 knockout mice were pretreated with the PTEN inhibitor bpV(HOpic), cardiac function was significantly improved, and myocardial infarct size was significantly reduced after I-30/R-120. In conclusion, LMP-2 is required for normal proteasomal function and IPC induction in the heart. Its action may be related to PTEN protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2071347288,"Several isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC) are regulated through interactions with Ras superfamily GTPases, including Rac proteins. Interestingly, of two closely related PLCgamma isoforms, only PLCgamma(2) has previously been shown to be activated by Rac. Here, we explore the molecular basis of this interaction as well as the structural properties of PLCgamma(2) required for activation. Based on reconstitution experiments with isolated PLCgamma variants and Rac2, we show that an unusual pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, designated as the split PH domain (spPH), is both necessary and sufficient to effect activation of PLCgamma(2) by Rac2. We also demonstrate that Rac2 directly binds to PLCgamma(2) as well as to the isolated spPH of this isoform. Furthermore, through the use of NMR spectroscopy and mutational analysis, we determine the structure of spPH, define the structural features of spPH required for Rac interaction, and identify critical amino acid residues at the interaction interface. We further discuss parallels and differences between PLCgamma(1) and PLCgamma(2) and the implications of our findings for their respective signaling roles."

We previously demonstrated that LRP130 is a binding partner of PGC-1α, required for hepatic gluconeogenesis. LRP130 is the gene mutated in Leigh syndrome French Canadian variant, a rare neurodegenerative disease. The importance of LRP130 in other, non-hepatocyte biology remains obscure. To better understand PGC-1 coactivator function in brown fat development, we explored the metabolic role of LRP130 in brown adipocyte differentiation. We show that LRP130 is preferentially enriched in brown fat compared with white, and induced in a PGC-1-dependent manner during differentiation. Despite intact PGC-1 coactivator expression, brown fat cells deficient for LRP130 exhibit attenuated expression of several genes characteristic of brown fat, including uncoupling protein 1. Oxygen consumption studies support a specific defect in proton leak due to attenuated uncoupling protein 1 expression. Notably, brown fat cell development common to both PGC-1 coactivators is governed by LRP130. Conversely, the cAMP response controlled by PGC-1α is not regulated by LRP130.

Obesity is a global health concern, predisposing to insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving neurohormonal, behavioral, genetic, and adipocyte-specific elements. Integration of these factors establishes whole body energy balance.Adipocytes constitute important regulators of systemic energy balance, and play a central role in obesity due to their inherent capacity to store or consume excess calories. The duality of the adipocyte lineage is illustrated in two different types of fat cells. White adipocytes store fat as triacylglycerol during caloric excess and release free fatty acids during fasting. In contrast, brown adipocytes oxidize triacylglycerol to generate heat (thermogenesis) (1Hansen J.B. Kristiansen K. Biochem.

Protons utilized by Ucp1 traverse the mitochondrial membrane to generate heat instead of driving the ATP synthase (16Murray R. Granner D. Rodwell V. Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry. 27 Ed.

Several transcription factors and a few coregulators have been described. Many of these factors are extensively reviewed elsewhere (1Hansen J.B. Kristiansen K. Biochem.

RIP140 is a corepressor and represses Ucp1 expression in white adipocytes. White fat cells genetically ablated for RIP140 have increased Ucp1 gene expression (22Debevec D. Christian M. Morganstein D.

Both sufficient and necessary for brown fat differentiation, PRDM16 potently drives expression of PGC-1α, Ucp1 and several other brown fat genes. The PGC-1 family of coactivators regulate Ucp1 gene expression and several brown fat selective genes during brown fat development, and following cold exposure or treatment with cAMP mimetic. PGC-1 (PPARγ coactivator-1α) is the founding member of the PGC-1 family and was isolated from a brown fat library to identify PPARγ-interacting proteins (24Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). PGC-1β is the closest homolog of PGC-1α (25Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) with PRC being more distally related (26Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C.

Complementation is shared at the level of several brown fat specific genes, including Ucp1, as well as, mitochondrial biogenesis. Either member of the family is singly sufficient to establish basal Ucp1 gene expression in cells and animals (27Uldry M. Yang W. St Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M.

A. 2007; 104: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Complementation, however, does not extend to all aspects of brown fat function. In contrast to PGC-1β, PGC-1α regulates cold inducible Ucp1 gene expression in mature brown fat (27Uldry M. Yang W. St Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 31Sonoda J. Mehl I.R. Chong L.W. Nofsinger R.R. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

How then do the PGC-1s share overlapping function during brown fat development, yet display differential function following cold exposure? The mechanism is unknown and many possibilities exist. One possibility is the existence of a specificity factor common to the PGC-1s, required for brown fat development, but not important for cold exposure. Identification of such a factor would help delineate developmental control from the environmental control, and shed insight on how the PGC-1s preferentially influence one program over another.We previously demonstrated that LRP130 (leucine-rich protein 130), also known as LRPPRC (leucine-rich protein pentatricopeptide repeat-containing motif), is a component of the PGC-1α holo-complex (32Cooper M.P. Qu L. Rohas L.M. Lin J. Yang W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2996-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LRP130 is mutated in a rare neurological disorder called Leigh Syndrome French Canadian variant (33Mootha V.K. Lepage P. Miller K. Bunkenborg J. Reich M. Hjerrild M. Delmonte T. Villeneuve A. Sladek R. Xu F. Mitchell G.A. Morin C. Mann M. Hudson T.J. Robinson B. Rioux J.D. Lander E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Patients suffer a devastating neurological disease as well as liver dysfunction (34Morin C. Mitchell G. Larochelle J. Lambert M. Ogier H. Robinson B.H. De Braekeleer M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). LRP130 localizes to the nucleus and mitochondria, and has been shown to influence gene expression in both compartments (32Cooper M.P. Qu L. Rohas L.M. Lin J. Yang W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2996-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Xu F. Morin C. Mitchell G. Ackerley C. Robinson B.H. Biochem.

Commun. 2004; 317: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that LRP130 is an important coregulator of PGC-1α-dependent gluconeogenesis. Although LRP130 was shown to interact with PGC-1β (32Cooper M.P. Qu L. Rohas L.M. Lin J. Yang W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2996-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the functional importance of interaction with this PGC-1 member was not studied. We show here that LRP130 is a novel and important regulator of brown fat development. Notably it regulates the developmental program mediated by the PGC-1 coactivators, but does not influence the cAMP response. These results suggest that LRP130 is critical for the complementary actions of the PGC-1s during brown fat development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Adipocyte Differentiation—We digested brown fat from wild-type and PGC-1α KO newborn mice (28Lin J.

Maintenance media contained 20% FBS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.55 (Invitrogen). Differentiation day 0: cells grown to 100% confluence were treated with 20 nm insulin, 1 nm T3, 500 nm dexamethasone, 125 μm indomethacin, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine in 10% FBS. Differentiation day 2: medium was changed to 20 nm insulin, 1 nm T3 in 10% FBS, and replenished every 48 h. Full differentiation happened between days 5 and 8. Treatment with 10 μm forskolin activated the thermogenic program. Stimulation for 4 h induced Ucp1 and PGC-1α, mitochondrial-encoded genes required 24 h.We induced 3T3 L1 adipocyte differentiation as previously described (40Green H. Meuth M.

Full differentiation happened between days 5 and 7.siLRP130 and LRP130 Stable Cell Lines—We stably expressed shRNA constructs in cell lines referred to as siCtrl and siLRP130. Briefly, we cloned LRP130 RNAi sequence, 5′-GAAGCTAGATGACCTGTTT-3′ (Dharmacon), into pSuperRetro GFP (42Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), and produced retrovirus in phoenix cells. Infected brown preadipocytes were selected by MoFlo cell sorting. We previously demonstrated the specificity of this LRP130 RNAi in several cell types and by comparing it to a separate LRP130 RNAi sequence, 5′-GCAGTTAGGTGTCGTATAT-3′ (32Cooper M.P. Qu L. Rohas L.M.

After digestion with BamHI/PmeI, human LRP130-FLAG was cloned into the BglII/HpaI site of pMSCV puromycin. To generate stable human LRP130-FLAG cells, we infected cells with the retrovirus and selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Empty pMSCV retrovirus of similar titer was used to create a control cell line. Culture conditions and differentiation were identical to brown fat cells. Retroviral infection occasionally reduced adipogenesis in 3T3-F442A cells; therefore, 1 μm rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich) was used in a few experiments to promote full differentiation. Results were comparable to treatments without rosiglitazone.Animal Experiments—All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Mice were maintained on standard rodent chow with 12-h light-dark cycles. For acute cold exposure studies, we housed male C57BL/6 mice, ages 3-4 weeks, at 4 °C for 4 h. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) was harvested and mRNA isolated.Immunodetection of Proteins—Whole cell protein lysates were prepared by 3 freeze/thaw cycles in FLAG lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% sarkosyl (N-lauryl sarcosine). Samples were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and quantified using Bradford reagent (44Bearden Jr., J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of LRP130 was generated by PrimmBiotech Inc. We detected PGC-1β with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody. Antibodies against, C-V-α and NDUFA9, were purchased from Mitosciences. FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and Ucp1 antibody are available from Sigma-Aldrich, and tubulin antibody from Abcam. We probed with FLAG antibody per the manufacturer's protocol. All other antibodies were used at 1:1000 in TBS/0.1% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dry milk.Electron Microscopy and Stereological Measurements—Samples were fixed, sectioned (∼60 nm), and visualized on a JEOL 1200EX (27Uldry M. Yang W. St Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We laid a grid onto randomly selected micrographs (n > 30), and counted points falling onto mitochondria or cell area. The fraction of total points attributable to mitochondria was expressed as mitochondrial density (45St Pierre J. Lin J. Krauss S. Tarr P.T. Yang R. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

We used 500 ng of the -4kbto1+ bp Ucp1 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter (46Cao W. Daniel K.W. Robidoux J. Puigserver P. Medvedev A.V. Bai X. Floering L.M. Spiegelman B.M. Collins S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and 1500 ng of RSV-β-galactosidase to normalize each transfection. To exclude nonspecific activation, we used empty reporter vector. Reporter activity was measured on days 2, 4, and 8 of differentiation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Mature brown fat cells grown in a 15-cm dish were used for 4 chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions. The reactions were processed using the EZ ChIP kit from Upstate. PPARγ (H-100 X), FLAG M2, mouse, and rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. For each reaction, we used either 6 μg of IgG, 3 μg of PPARγ, or 3 μg of FLAG antibody. ChIP experiments were performed three times; one representative experiment is shown. The primers for the promoters were: Ucp1 enhancer, forward 5′-TGAGGCTGATATCCCCAGAGA-3′, reverse 5′-TCTGTGTGTCCTCTGGGCATAA-3′; Ucp1-200 bp promoter, forward 5′-AATCAGGAACTGGTGCCAAATC-3′, reverse 5′-AGGTCTCCAAAGAGCTGCTAGTG-3′; aP2 (FABP4) DR-1 sites -4 kb promoter forward 5′-TTCCCAGCAGGAATCAGGTAG-3′, reverse 5′-CTGGGAACTCCATTTGCTCTC-3′; 18S gene, forward 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′, reverse 5′-CGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTA-3′.Oxygen Consumption—Cells in suspension were washed twice in 10% FBS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended in respiration mediuim: DPBS, 2 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, 2% bovine serum albumin. Total respiration and proton leak (“uncouple respiration”) were measured as previously described (45St Pierre J. Lin J. Krauss S. Tarr P.T. Yang R. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

We normalized respiration rates to an aliquot of total cell protein lysate.RNA Analysis—For Northern blots, total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). 10-20 μg was resolved on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with gene-specific probes. We used a 1430-2523 bp probe for LRP130, 1-810 bp for PGC-1α, and 1500-2400 bp for PGC-1β.For quantitative PCR, total RNA was isolated with Trizol, and further purified with RNAesay columns (Qiagen). We reverse-transcribed RNA with a kit (Applied Biosystems), and measured signal intensity using SyberGreen (Applied Biosystems). Samples were normalized to TBP using the ΔΔCt method, and expressed as relative gene expression. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Fig. S4.Statistical Analysis—For bar graph analyses, we used two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test. One asterisk denotes p < 0.05, two: p < 0.01, three: p < 0.001.RESULTSLRP130 Is Expressed in a Brown Fat-selective Manner—Certain regulators of brown fat development are selectively expressed in brown fat, and their expression may be further driven by differentiation or cold exposure. LRP130 mRNA is enriched in brown fat, compared with white. Its distribution across tissues is similar to PGC-1α and PGC-1β (Fig. 1A). LRP130 gene expression increases ∼5-fold during differentiation of immortalized brown fat cells, but does not change during differentiation of immortalized 3T3-L1 white fat cells (Fig. 1B). Upon cold exposure, however, LRP130 gene expression remains unchanged in brown fat (Fig. 1C). Notably Ucp1, PGC-1α and deiodinase 2 are all induced as expected (Fig. 1D). In parallel, stimulation of mature brown fat cells with forskolin does not induce LRP130 gene expression (data not shown).Effect of LRP130 Depletion on Adipogenesis and the Brown Fat Program—To assess the role of LRP130 in brown fat cell differentiation, we generated brown fat cells deficient for LRP130, using retroviral delivery of shRNA (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the shRNA against LRP130 is functional, we assessed protein level (Fig. 2B), and a target gene, Cox3 (Fig. 2A). Two genes, FABP4 (aP2) and Glut4, are induced during differentiation of brown or white fat cells. Expression of these genes were unaffected by depletion of LRP130, suggesting that adipogenesis is intact. Additionally, microscopic examination revealed no gross morphological defects (Fig. 2C), indicating LRP130 is not required for lipid accumulation.FIGURE 2Adipogenic and morphological features of brown fat cells deficient for LRP130.A, gene expression of select genes at day 7 of differentiation (n = 3).

As shown in Fig. 3A, several brown fat genes regulated by the PGC-1 coactivators are attenuated in LRP130-deficient cells, Ucp1, Cidea, Cox7a1, but not Elovl3. This is very similar to the pattern observed in PGC-1 double-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). Although moderately blunted in PGC-1 double-deficient cells, mRNA expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is unaffected in LRP130-deficient cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the gene expression of cytochrome c (cycs), a component of the electron transport chain and marker of mitochondrial biogenesis, was unaffected by LRP130 depletion. Unlike cyctochrome c, Cox7a1 is a component of the electron transport chain that is also a brown fat-specific gene (21Seale P. Kajimura S. Yang W. Chin S. Rohas L.M. Uldry M. Tavernier G. Langin D.

Its gene expression is attenuated by LRP130 depletion, highlighting the importance of LRP130 in the brown fat program. Similar genetic findings using a second RNAi against LRP130 were observed (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 3LRP130 phenocopies certain features of PGC-1 double-deficient brown fat cells.

To determine the effect of LRP130 on this program, we stimulated mature brown fat cells deficient for LRP130 with forskolin, an adenylate cyclase agonist. As shown in Fig. 4A, absolute expression of Ucp1 is reduced ∼70% in untreated and cAMP-treated LRP130-deficient cells; however, the fold change from baseline is identical to control cells, about 20-25-fold. Fold change and absolute level of PGC-1α was similar between both groups. Longer treatments with cyclic adenylate agonist induce several mitochondrial genes. As anticipated, cytochrome c (cycs), a nuclear encoded mitochondrial gene, is unaffected, but the mitochondrial-encoded genes are attenuated in LRP130-deficient cells (Fig. 4B). Although not required for Ucp1 induction following cAMP stimulation, LPR130 is required for the induction of the mitochondrial-encoded genes.FIGURE 4Depletion of LRP130 does not alter cAMP mediated induction of Ucp1.A, gene expression of Ucp1 and PGC-1α in mature brown fat cells treated with forskolin for 4 h.

https://openalex.org/W2148573497,"Dystrophin deficiency is the underlying molecular cause of progressive muscle weakness observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Loss of functional dystrophin leads to elevated levels of intracellular Ca(2+), a key step in the cellular pathology of DMD. The cysteine protease calpain is activated in dystrophin-deficient muscle, and its inhibition is regarded as a potential therapeutic approach. In addition, previous work has shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome system also contributes to muscle protein breakdown in dystrophic muscle and, therefore, also qualifies as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in DMD. The relative contribution of calpain- and proteasome-mediated proteolysis induced by increased Ca(2+) levels was characterized in cultured muscle cells and revealed initial Ca(2+) influx-dependent calpain activity and subsequent Ca(2+)-independent activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We then set out to optimize novel small-molecule inhibitors that inhibit both calpain as well as the 20S proteasome in a cellular system with impaired Ca(2+) homeostasis. On administration of such inhibitors to mdx mice, quantitative histological parameters improved significantly, in particular with compounds strongly inhibiting the 20S proteasome. To investigate the role of calpain inhibition without interfering with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we crossed mdx mice with transgenic mice, overexpressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. Although our data show that proteolysis by calpain is strongly inhibited in the transgenic mdx mouse, this calpain inhibition did not ameliorate muscle histology. Our results indicate that inhibition of the proteasome rather than calpain is required for histological improvement of dystrophin-deficient muscle. In conclusion, we have identified novel proteasome inhibitors that qualify as potential candidates for pharmacological intervention in muscular dystrophy."

Studies have demonstrated the roles of viral nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) in the induction of chromosome aneuploidy, but the molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this study, hydrodynamics-based in vivo transfection was applied to a mouse system. Mouse hepatocytes that successfully expressed NS5A protein were isolated by laser capture microdissection. Gene expression profiles of the NS5A-expressing hepatocytes were examined by an Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray system. Aspm (abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly associated), which encodes the mitotic spindle protein ASPM, was identified to be differentially expressed in the absence and the presence of NS5A. The down-regulation of Aspm mRNA and ASPM protein was confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively, both in mouse model systems and in viral subgenomic replicon and in vitro transfection culturing systems. In addition, cultured cells that constitutively expressed NS5A protein showed G2/M cell cycle block and chromosome aneuploidy. Overexpression of ASPM relieved the G2/M cell cycle block. Furthermore, NS5A protein repressed the promoter activity of Aspm gene in a dose-dependent manner. The regulatory effect was abolished when amino acid substitutions P2209L, T2214A, and T2217G known to interrupt the NS5A-PKR interaction were introduced into the NS5A protein. This indicates that the down-regulation of Aspm expression is via the PKR-p38 signaling pathway. These results suggest that NS5A protein down-regulates the expression of the mitotic spindle protein ASPM and induces aberrant mitotic cell cycle associated with chromosome instability and hepatocellular carcinoma.

In this study, we showed a down-regulation of Aspm mRNA in HCV NS5A-expressing mouse hepatocytes. The NS5A protein inhibited Aspm expression via the down-regulation of the PKR-p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, overexpression of ASPM relieved the G2/M cell cycle block imposed by NS5A.

This resulted in a removal of one of the two CMV promoters present in pAdTrack-CMV. For generation of plasmid pTTRB-T7His-NS5A, plasmid pET15b-NS5A that encodes a His-tagged full-length NS5A protein of HCV (27Cheng J.C. Chang M.F. Chang S.C. J.

Costa, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago) were digested with HindIII and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, respectively. The linearized DNAs of both plasmids were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to a further digestion with BglII restriction endonuclease. The resultant T7HisNS5A DNA fragment was then cloned into the modified PAP-TTRBsv to generate pTTRB-T7HisNS5A. pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A, pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A, and pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A-mPTT—Plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A contains a NS5A cDNA fragment under the control of the liver-specific transthyretin promoter, and in the opposite direction, it contains the cDNA of green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of CMV promoter. For generation of plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A, plasmid pTTRB-T7HisNS5A was digested with PacI and PmeI restriction endonucleases. The resultant TTRB-T7HisNS5A DNA fragment was treated with the T4 DNA polymerase and then cloned into the EcoRV site of pAdTrack(-CMV). Plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A contains the cDNA fragments of NS5A and GFP under the control of two independent CMV promoters. For generation of plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7His-NS5A, plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A was digested with BglII and NotI restriction endonucleases.

Plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7His-NS5A-mPTT contains amino acid substitutions P2209L, T2214A and T2217G in the PKR-binding region (amino acid residues 2209-2274) of the HCV genotype 1b NS5A and was derived from the wild type plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed followed the procedures as described by the manufacturer (QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). The primer set used was 5′-CTGTCTGCACTTTCTCTGAAGGCAGCATGCACTGGCCGTCATGAC-3′ (underlining corresponds to the amino acid mutations at Pro2209, Thr2214, and Thr2217) and 5′-GTCATGACGGCCAGTGCATGCTGCCTTCAGAGAAAGTGCAGACAG-3′. pCRII-Topo-mAspm-TLS(-475/-59) and pGL3-mAspm-TLS(-475/-59)—For the construction of plasmid pCRII-Topo-mAspm-TLS(-475/-59), DNA fragment mAspm-TLS(-475/-59) that contains the mouse Aspm gene from nucleotides -475 to -59 upstream of the translation start site was amplified from the genomic DNA of mouse NIH3T3 cells with the primer set TLS-59 (5′-GAAGCCAACGACCAGGACAAGG-3′) and TLS-475 (5′-CTCAGCTATTCAGGACCGCATG-3′) and cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen).

Plasmid pcDNA-hASPM-V5HisTopo that encodes the full-length human ASPM protein with V5His-tag was generated from plasmids pcDNA-hASPM(1-5141)V5HisTopo and pCRII-Topo-hASPM-(4121-10431Not) following partial digestion of the plasmids with restriction endonucleases, and ligation of the resultant 5.9-kb ScaI-NotI DNA fragment from pCRII-Topo-hASPM(4121-10431Not) with the 10-kb ScaI-NotI partial digestion product of pcDNA-hASPM(1-5141)V5HisTopo. Sequence analysis revealed a difference of two nucleotides (7064-AG-7065 for Gln2355) in the human Aspm gene of plasmid pcDNA-hASPM-V5HisTopo as compared with that previously identified (NM_018136; 7064-GA-7065 for Arg2355). Huh7 (a human hepatoma cell line), HepG2 (a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), A549 (a human lung carcinoma cell line), COS7 (an African Green Monkey kidney fibroblast cell line), 293T (a human embryonic kidney cell line), and NIH3T3 cells (a mouse fibroblast cell line) were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Unless indicated, DNA transfection was performed with the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer.

To establish stable cell lines that constitutively express NS5A, NIH3T3 cells cultured on 10-cm dishes were transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+) and 15 μg of pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were split at a 1:10 ratio and cultured in the presence of 1.2 mg of G418/ml of medium. Drug-resistant colonies that appeared 10-14 days post-transfection were clonally isolated and screened for the expression of HCV NS5A protein by Western blot analysis with NS5A monoclonal antibody (Chemicon). NIH3T3-NS5A stable cell lines that constitutively express HCV NS5A were maintained in medium containing 1.2 mg of G418/ml of medium. H7-HCVR cells were derived from Huh7 cells by inclusion of a bicistronic HCV subgenomic replicon carrying neo gene as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. H7-HCVR cells were maintained in medium containing 1 mg of G418/ml of medium. Hydrodynamics-based in vivo transfection was performed as previously described (29Kou Y.H. Chang M.F. Wang Y.M. Hung T.M. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7999-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in male BALB/c mice with plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A and the control plasmid, pAdTrack(-CMV). Two days post-injection, the mice were sacrificed. Fresh tissues including liver, heart, kidney, and lung were collected for the preparation of cryosection and examination of the expression of HCV NS5A protein and its regulatory host genes. To prepare for cryosection, the mouse tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature solution on dried ice. After cutting the frozen blocks into 14-μm-thick sections by microtome (Leica), the tissue sections were attached to slides and deep frozen immediately on dried ice. To further prepare for LCM, the cryosections were fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 min before proceeding to dehydration. The dehydration processes include a 1-min submergence in 95% ethanol, a 30-s immersion in 100% ethanol followed by another 1-min immersion in 100% ethanol. Lastly, to complete the dehydration process, the cryosections were treated by 30-s and 5-min submergence in xylene. The above were done with gentle shaking at each step. After being air-dried, cryosections of the mouse liver tissue that successfully expressed GFP and NS5A proteins were isolated by LCM with a fluorescence detector (PixCell IIe; Arcturus) setting at laser spot size of 7.5 μm, pulse power of 50 milliwatt, pulse width of 3.5 ms, and threshold voltage of 270 mV. For microarray analysis, 1,000 hepatocytes were captured by LCM with a fluorescence detector. RNA isolated from the hepatocytes using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit was subjected to two rounds of amplification with RiboAmp RNA amplification kit containing T7 RNA polymerase followed the procedures as described by the manufacturer (Arcturus) with modifications. In brief, the Agilent Lab-on-a-Chip System with the BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent) was used to examine the quality of the ribosomal RNA in the RNA preparation of hepatocytes to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility in the analysis of gene expression profiles. In addition, following the first amplification, the resultant cDNAs were added to the in vitro transcription reaction of Affymetrix microarray system to generate biotinylated cRNAs in the second round of transcript amplification. Gene expression profiles were performed with an Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarray (Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array) using the Affymetrix microarray system following the protocol as described by the manufacturer. GCOS and RMA statistics were applied for data analysis. Total RNA was isolated from culture cells by using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed with the RNA templates, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science), and oligo(dT) primer. The products were subjected to real time PCR with primer sets of specific genes and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). The primer set used for mouse Aspm was 5′-GCTTCATCACCTGCTCACCTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAGATACCGCTCCGCTTTCAG-3′, whereas the primer sets used in parallel as internal controls were 5′-CTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCACTGTGTTGGCATAGAGGTC-3′ for Actb and 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGAC-3′ and 5′-GATGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3′ for Gapdh. The results were analyzed with the iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). To generate synchronized cell population arrested at the G1/S boundary, the cells were cultured in the medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After release from the serum starvation, the cells were harvested by trypsinization at various time points. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, the cells were fixed in 75% (v/v) ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (40 mg/ml) in the presence of RNase A (50 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples of 10,000 cells were then analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed with the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against NS5A were purchased from Chemicon. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cyclin B1 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p-p38 and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Sp1 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GAPDH were purchased from Santa Cruz. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against His tag were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against p-PKR (Thr(P)446) and PKR were purchased from Abcam. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GFP were kindly provided by S. L. Doong (Institute of Microbiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine). For generation of an antiserum specific for both human and mouse ASPM, a highly conserved antigenic peptide (487PKRRPILSATVTKRK501) between human and mouse (supplemental Fig. S2) was synthesized, conjugated to Multiple Antigenic Peptides (Kelowna International Scientific Inc.), and subjected to immunization of rabbits as previously described (28Chang M.F. Sun C.Y. Chen C.J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2529-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of the promoter activity of Aspm, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the effector plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A (or pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A-mPTT), the Firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-mAspm-TLS(-475/-59), and the Renilla luciferase-expressing control plasmid phRL-TK (Promega). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were suspended with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. One half of the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the other half of the cells were subjected to the analysis of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Dual-Glo™ luciferase assay system; Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized against the Renilla luciferase activity. Gene Expression Profiles in Mouse Hepatocytes Expressing HCV NS5A Protein—To study the pathogenesis of HCV NS5A protein, plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A that contains the HCV NS5A gene under the control of liver specific transthyretin promoter and GFP gene under the control of CMV promoter was constructed. Expression of the viral NS5A protein and GFP was initially examined in cultured cells of various tissue origins. The results demonstrated that the NS5A protein co-expressed with GFP only in the hepatocyte-derived HepG2 and Huh7 cells but not in the nonhepatic A549 and COS7 cells (Fig. 1A), indicating the tissue-specific expression of the viral NS5A protein driven by the liver-specific promoter. Hydrodynamics-based in vivo transfection was then applied to a mouse system. The hydrodynamics-based method mimics the postnatal HCV infection unlike prenatal existence of the viral protein in transgenic mouse model. Two days following the rapid injection of the plasmid pAdTrack-TTRB-T7HisNS5A into mouse tail vein, GFP expression was detected specifically in the liver; no detection was observed in heart, kidney, and lung tissues (Fig. 1B). The GFP-expressing hepatocytes were isolated by LCM with a fluorescence detector. Co-expression of the viral NS5A protein in the GFP-expressing hepatocytes was further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). In addition, plasmid pAdTrack(-CMV) that expresses GFP only was used in parallel in hydrodynamic injection as a control. To learn the differential expression profiles of host genes in the presence and the absence of the viral NS5A protein, RNA was isolated from the captured hepatocytes that successfully co-expressed GFP and NS5A proteins and from the control hepatocytes that expressed GFP only. The RNA samples were amplified and biotin-labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of gene expression profiles with Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray system containing 34,000 genes revealed 63 genes that were up-regulated for more than 2-fold and 34 genes that were down-regulated for more than 2-fold in the NS5A and GFP co-expressing hepatocytes as compared with the control (data not shown). Among these differentially expressed genes, 10 genes are involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways including cell growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. The spindle gene Aspm is one of the genes whose down-regulation in the NS5A-expressing hepatocytes was further confirmed by real time PCR analysis (Fig. 1D). Growth Arrest of the Stable Cell Lines Constitutively Expressing NS5A—HCV NS5A protein has been demonstrated to induce chromosome aneuploidy (15Baek K.H. Park H.Y. Kang C.M. Kim S.J. Jeong S.J. Hong E.K. Park J.W. Sung Y.C. Suzuki T. Kim C.M. Lee C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To understand whether the down-regulation of Aspm is involved in the NS5A-induced mitotic dysregulation, stable cell lines that constitutively express the NS5A protein were established following a transfection of plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-T7HisNS5A into NIH3T3 cells and G418 selection. Among the G418-resistant clones examined, the NIH3T3-NS5A-17 stable line that showed the highest expression level of the NS5A protein (Fig. 2A) and a remarkable reduction of the growth rate (data not shown) was chosen for further analysis. RT real time PCR confirmed the down-regulation of Aspm gene in NIH3T3-NS5A-17 stable line (Fig. 2B). The effect of NS5A on the mitotic dysregulation was examined in the NIH3T3-NS5A-17 cells. The cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by serum starvation and subjected to flow analysis 24 h after release from the starvation. As shown in Fig. 2C, the NS5A-expressing NIH3T3-NS5A-17 cells had an increased cell population of G2/M phase (43%) as compared with that of the parental NIH3T3 cells (14%). The NIH3T3-NS5A-13 stable line that expressed a lower level of NS5A protein as compared with the NIH3T3-NS5A-17 cells showed a G2/M cell cycle block similar to NIH3T3-NS5A-17 cells but to a lower extent (31%). These results further correlate the expression level of NS5A with the extent of the G2/M cell cycle block.

https://openalex.org/W2001120648,"Indolopyridones are potent inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although the structure of these compounds differs from established nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs), previous studies suggest that the prototype compound INDOPY-1 may bind in close proximity to the polymerase active site. NRTI-associated mutations that are clustered around the active site confer decreased, e.g. M184V and Y115F, or increased, e.g. K65R, susceptibility to INDOPY-1. Here we have studied the underlying biochemical mechanism. RT enzymes containing the isolated mutations M184V and Y115F cause 2–3-fold increases in IC50 values, while the combination of the two mutations causes a >15-fold increase. K65R can partially counteract these effects. Binding studies revealed that the M184V change reduces the affinity to INDOPY-1, while Y115F facilitates binding of the natural nucleotide substrate and the combined effects enhance the ability of the enzyme to discriminate against the inhibitor. Studies with other strategic mutations at residues Phe-61 and Ala-62, as well as the use of chemically modified templates shed further light on the putative binding site of the inhibitor and ternary complex formation. An abasic site residue at position n, i.e. opposite the 3′-end of the primer, prevents binding of INDOPY-1, while an abasic site at the adjacent position n+1 has no effect. Collectively, our findings provide strong evidence to suggest that INDOPY-1 can compete with natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). We therefore propose to refer to members of this class of compounds as “nucleotide-competing RT inhibitors” (NcRTIs).

Once phosphorylated, NRTIs act as chain-terminators that compete with natural nucleotide substrates while NNRTIs comprise a structurally diverse family of compounds that bind to a hydrophobic pocket near the active site of RT and appear to affect the chemical step of the reaction and not nucleotide binding (reviewed in Refs. 1Basavapathruni A.

Virus Res. 2008; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indolopyridones represent a newly discovered class of inhibitors that interfere with RT function through a mechanism of action that is distinct from that described for NRTIs and NNRTIs (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The prototype compound INDOPY-1 (Fig. 1) has been shown to be active against NNRTI-resistant HIV strains (6Zhang Z. Walker M. Xu W. Shim J.H. Girardet J.L. Hamatake R.K. Hong Z. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). INDOPY-1, unlike NNRTIs, but like natural deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), can bind to and stabilize RT-DNA/DNA complexes (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Footprinting experiments and binding studies revealed that the complex with INDOPY-1 is trapped in the post-translocational state that likewise allows dNTP binding. However, in contrast to NRTI or dNTP substrates, binding of INDOPY-1 depends on the chemical nature of the ultimate base pair at the 3′-end of the primer and not on the chemical nature of the templated base that is engaged in classic base pairing. INDOPY-1 binds preferentially following pyrimidines (thymidines > cytidines). Steady-state kinetic analysis with homopolymeric substrates revealed competitive (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B.

Hong Z. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with respect to the nucleotide. The non-nucleosidic compound aphidicolin shows a similar effect on calf thymus DNA polymerase α and ϵ (7Sheaff R. Ilsley D. Kuchta R.

Together, these findings suggest that the binding site for indolopyridones and nucleotide substrates can at least partially overlap. The resistance profile of INDOPY-1 provides further independent evidence for this notion (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M.

In vitro selection experiments and phenotypic susceptibility measurements with clinical isolates and constructs generated by site-directed mutagenesis suggest that most mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to INDOPY-1 are clustered around the dNTP binding site. These mutations include the NRTI-associated change M184V that confers high level resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) (3Menendez-Arias L. Virus Res. 2008; 134: 124-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The combination of M184V and Y115F is associated with decreased susceptibility to guanosine analogue abacavir (ABC) (9Miller V. Ait-Khaled M. Stone C. Griffin P. Mesogiti D. Cutrell A. Harrigan R. Staszewski S. Katlama C. Pearce G. Tisdale M. AIDS. 2000; 14: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Of note, K65R, which is associated with decreased susceptibility to tenofovir (TFV) (10Miller M.D. AIDS Rev. 2004; 6: 22-33PubMed Google Scholar), confers increased susceptibility to INDOPY-1 (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J.

Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The inhibitor is generally sensitive against a background of thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) or NNRTI-associated mutations, respectively, with the exception of the novel mutation L234F that is located in close proximity to the NNRTI-binding pocket (11Jochmans D. Van Ginderen M. Ehteshami M. Van Schoubroeck B. Dehertogh P. Hallenberger S. Götte M. Hertogs K. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Abstract 597, Los Angeles, CA2007Google Scholar). M184V and Y115F show relatively moderate 5–8-fold increases in half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50). However, the combination of mutations M184V and Y115F appears to amplify the effects of the individual mutations, and cause >100 fold increases in the EC50 values when compared with wild-type HIV-1 (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the underlying mechanism. We show that mutant RT enzymes containing M184V can diminish binding of INDOPY-1, while binding of the natural dNTP substrate remains largely unchanged. In contrast, Y115F increases binding of the natural nucleotide substrate. Thus, the combined properties appear to amplify the ability of the enzyme to discriminate against the inhibitor. Our biochemical studies provide strong support for the notion that the binding sites for INDOPY-1 and the natural dNTP substrate can at least partially overlap, and the mechanism of inhibition is predominantly competitive in nature. Materials—Heterodimeric (p66/p51) HIV-1 RT enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (12Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to generate RT mutants of the HXB2 strain using the Stratagene QuikChange procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. “WT RT” refers to wild-type enzyme. M184V, K65R, Y115F, and F61A RT enzymes each contain a single mutation at the indicated residues and the presence of multiple mutations is indicated likewise. The RT inhibitor indolopyridone-1 (INDOPY-1) was synthesized as described (4Sluis-Cremer N. Tachedjian G. Virus Res. 2008; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and was obtained from Tibotec BVBA, Mechelen, Belgium. DNA oligonucleotides used in this study were obtained from Invitrogen. The long RNA template PBS-250 was synthesized through in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (13Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleic acid substrates were 32P-radiolabeled at their 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) (14Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. The radiolabeled material was purified on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris-borate pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea. Oligonucleotide samples were eluted overnight in a buffer containing 500 mm ammonium acetate and 0.1% SDS. Primer Extension Assay—A 2-fold molar excess of PBS-250 RNA template was hybridized to 50 nm 5′-radiolabeled PBS-28 DNA primer (5′-CTTTCAGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACTG-3′). DNA/RNA hybrids were formed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 and 50 mm NaCl. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min followed by a gradual decrease to room temperature (45 min of incubation). The hybrid was then incubated with 125 nm of RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 μm of each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. The samples were then incubated with 6 μm INDOPY-1. DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of 6 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at defined time points (0, 15, and 30 s, and 1, 2, 5, and 10 min) with formamide-loading dye containing xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. Samples were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed with a phosphor-imager (Amersham Biosciences) using Quantity One and ImageQuant software. DNA synthesis assays with the F61A RT mutant used a similar protocol with DNA template PBS-57 (5′-GTTCGAACAAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCTGAAAGCGAAAGCTAC-3′). The RT concentration was increased to 250 nm. Band Shift Experiments—50 nm of radiolabeled DNA primer (5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGA-3′) was annealed to 3-fold molar excess of the DNA template (5′-CCTTCCCATCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGT-3′) as described above. The 3′-end of the primer was blocked for 30 min with 10 μm ddTTP and 500 nm RT in a buffer containing 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mm NaCl. Increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1 or dGTP, i.e. the next complementary nucleotide, ranging from 0 to 6 μm, were added, and the complex was then challenged by adding 4 μg/μl heparin and 1 h incubation at room temperature. The samples were fractionated through 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized as described above. GraphPad Prism software was used to obtain apparent Kdvalues for INDOPY-1, and the nucleotide using the one-site binding (hyperbola) equation. Similar experiments were performed with oligonucleotides containing abasic sites, whereby the DNA primer (5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACT-3′) was annealed to each of the following DNA templates where the abasic residue is indicated by a line: control template (5′-CCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA-3′), the abasic template at position n (5′-CCCTTCC_GTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA-3′), and the abasic template at position n+1 (5′-CCCTTC_ AGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA-3′). Filter-based DNA Synthesis Inhibition Assay—61.54 nm annealed poly(rA)/(dT)20 hybrid duplex was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 7 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and 50 mm NaCl. 500 nm [3H]dTTP and INDOPY-1 (ranging from 8 nm to 16 μm) were added to the samples, and the reaction was initiated by adding 6 mm MgCl2. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was quenched with the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then filtered and scintillation analysis was used to measure the amount of remaining radioactivity. IC50 values were obtained through analysis with GraphPad Prism 4.1 software. Single Nucleotide Incorporation Assay—100 nm of a radiolabeled DNA primer (5′-TTCTGACTAAAAGGGTCTGAGGGAT-3′) was annealed to a 3-fold molar excess of DNA template (5′-GTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGAAT-3′) as described above. The hybrid was then incubated with 500 nm HIV-1 RT and increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1 (0–30 μm) in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was started by adding 6 mm MgCl2, 4 μg/μl of heparin and the next complementary nucleotide, i.e. dCTP. The two different dCTP concentrations used were 0.15 μm and 0.50 μm, respectively. Nucleotide incorporation was allowed to proceed for 1 min at 37 °C before being stopped by the addition of gel-loading buffer. The samples were fractionated through a 12% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed as described above. Normalized inhibition by INDOPY-1 was plotted using the sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) equation in GraphPad Prism 4.1 software. Effects of Mutations M184V, Y115F, and K65R on Inhibition of DNA Synthesis with INDOPY-1—Initially, we studied whether the changes in phenotypic susceptibility to INDOPY-1 translate directly in altered biochemical properties of HIV-1 RT. For this purpose, we generated RT enzymes containing mutations M184V, Y115F, and K65R, as well as the double mutant M184V/Y115F. We found that the changes in EC50 values measured in cell-based, phenotypic susceptibility assays followed consistent trends as changes in 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in a cell-free RT assay (Table 1). We measured inhibition on homopolymeric poly(rA)-(dT)20 primer/template substrates and observed that enzymes containing mutations M184V and Y115F showed ∼2-fold increases in IC50 values. These effects are markedly increased with the M184V/Y115F double mutant that shows >15-fold increases in IC50 values, which points to a synergistic effect. In contrast, K65R appears to enhance the inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1, which is consistent with the hypersusceptible phenotype in this mutational context.TABLE 1Changes in EC50 and IC50 values for INDOPY-1 against HIV-1 RT containing M184V, Y115F, and K65RMutational contextCell-based assay fold-changeaValues were obtained by comparing mutant enzymes with WT RT in EC50bEC50 values as previously reported by Jochmans et al.

We have previously reported that INDOPY-1 increases enzyme pausing following incorporation of pyrimidines (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we employed the same assay to assess the effects of mutations M184V, Y115F, and K65R on RT pausing and DNA synthesis in the presence of inhibitor (Fig. 2). The amount of enzyme was adjusted such that WT and mutant enzymes produced the same amount of full-length product in the absence of inhibitor. These data show preferential inhibition following pyrimidines with wild-type HIV-1 RT and all mutant enzymes used in this study. We therefore conclude that the mutant enzymes do not appear to affect sequence specificity of INDOPY-1. In the presence of the inhibitor, enzymes containing either M184V or Y115F mutations showed diminished enzyme pausing, which results in higher yields of the full-length product. The amount of the full-length product obtained with the M184V/Y115F double mutant in the presence of inhibitor was almost identical with that obtained by WT RT in the absence of the inhibitor. The K65R mutation, when present against a background of M184V/Y115F, is unable to counteract the resistance conferring effects of the double mutant. However, K65R appears to neutralize M184V alone. INDOPY-1 is as active against the M184V/K65R double mutant as against WT RT. Together, the biochemical findings are in good agreement with cell-based susceptibility measurements. Effects of M184V, Y115F, and K65R Mutations on Complex Formation with INDOPY-1—We next asked whether differences in the inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1 correlate with differences in inhibitor binding. To address this question, we employed band shift experiments that allow us to monitor the stability of RT-primer/template complexes in the presence of inhibitor and nucleotide substrate, respectively. Like natural dNTPs (15Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), INDOPY-1 is capable of stabilizing the RT-DNA/DNA complex (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ternary complexes composed of HIV-1 RT, a DNA/DNA primer/template, and the nucleotide substrate or INDOPY-1 are resistant to dissociation in the presence of an enzyme trap such as heparin. While binary complexes are not stable under these conditions, ternary complexes with the nucleotide or the inhibitor can be visualized by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ternary, or “Dead-end complex” formation is therefore a measure for the ability of INDOPY-1 or the nucleotide to bind to pre-formed RT-primer/template complexes. Using this assay, we measured apparent Kd values (Kd(app)) for ligand binding in the context of the various RT mutants. WT RT shows similar apparent affinities for INDOPY-1 and the natural nucleotide substrate dGTP with Kd(app) values of ∼100 and 160 nm, respectively (Table 2). Of note, nucleotide incorporation was prevented through use of a chain-terminated primer (“Experimental Procedures”). The M184V mutant shows higher values for both the inhibitor (Kd(app) = 620 nm), and the nucleotide substrate (Kd(app) = 270 nm). The Y115F mutant shows a different effect. The apparent affinity to the inhibitor is only slightly decreased, while binding of the natural nucleotide substrate is enhanced (Kd(app) = 50 nm as compared with 160 nm with WT RT). These findings suggest that both mutations together may efficiently discriminate against the inhibitor through (i) diminished binding of INDOPY-1 with M184V and (ii) increased binding of the natural nucleotide substrate with Y115F.TABLE 2The apparent Kd value for INDOPY-1 with WT and mutant RT enzymesEnzymeKd(app)aEach reported value is the average of at least three separate experimentsSelectivitybSelectivity is defined as [Kd(app)INDOPY-1]/[Kd(app)dGTP] (fold-changecFold-change of selectivity is defined as Mutant Kd ratio/WT Kd ratio)INDOPY-1dGTPnmWT97 ± 11156 ± 300.6K65R61 ± 8365 ± 390.2 (0.3)M184V618 ± 77270 ± 272.3 (3.8)Y115F156 ± 4448 ± 103.3 (5.5)M184V/Y115F1201 ± 355124 ± 159.7 (16)M184V/K65R452 ± 57355 ± 511.3 (2.2)M184V/Y115F/K65R1298 ± 432278 ± 214.7 (7.8)a Each reported value is the average of at least three separate experimentsb Selectivity is defined as [Kd(app)INDOPY-1]/[Kd(app)dGTP]c Fold-change of selectivity is defined as Mutant Kd ratio/WT Kd ratio Open table in a new tab The double mutant M184V/Y115F is severely compromised with regards to inhibitor binding, while the ability to bind the natural dGTP substrate is largely maintained (Table 2). The ratio in selectivity of mutant enzymes versus WT RT provides a measure for the ability of a given mutant to discriminate against the nucleotide substrate solely on the basis of differences in ligand binding. Our data suggest that discrimination against the inhibitor is 16-fold increased when the M184V/Y115F double mutant is compared with WT RT. This effect is much stronger than as seen with M184V (3.8-fold increase) and Y115F (5.5-fold) alone. In contrast, the K65R mutant shows enhanced binding of the inhibitor and diminished binding of dGTP as compared with WT RT (Table 2), which overall results in discrimination against the natural nucleotide. Introducing the K65R mutation against a background of M184V neutralizes their individual opposing effects. The M184V/K65R double mutant shows a small 2.2-fold increase in discrimination against the inhibitor. However, K65R cannot efficiently counteract the effects of the double M184V/Y115F mutant. The ability to discriminate against INDOPY-1 remains relatively high with a 7.8-fold increase as compared with the WT. Collectively, these binding studies are in good agreement with the inhibition data in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Effects of F61A on Both Nucleotide and INDOPY-1 Binding—The aforementioned findings suggest that differences among the various mutant enzymes in their ability to bind the natural nucleotide substrate can affect susceptibility to INDOPY-1. Enhanced binding for the incoming dNTP in the context of Y115F correlates with decreased inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1, while diminished binding for the nucleotide in the context of K65R correlates with increased inhibitory effects. However, both mutations also affect inhibitor binding, which makes it difficult to assess the contribution of the nucleotide substrate on the observed phenotype. To further address this problem, we included the F61A mutation in this analysis. The F61A mutant enzyme is severely compromised with regards to nucleotide binding while primer/template binding is largely unaffected. HIV variants containing this mutation do not replicate, and the enzyme shows marked reductions in DNA synthesis (16Fisher T.S. Darden T. Prasad V.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Fisher T.S. Prasad V.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we monitored DNA synthesis with the RT mutant in excess over primer/template substrate to generate reasonable yields of the product (Fig. 3A, left panels). However, in the presence of INDOPY-1, DNA synthesis is almost completely blocked with the F61A mutant as the inhibitor causes strong pausing during the first nucleotide incorporation events (Fig. 3A, right panels). Equivalent results were obtained in filter-based RT assays (Table 3).TABLE 3IC50 values for INDOPY-1EnzymeFilter-based IC50aEach reported value is the average of at least three separate experimentsnmWT843.0 ± 131F61A19.7 ± 12A62V1123.0 ± 192F61A/A62V45.5 ± 31a Each reported value is the average of at least three separate experiments Open table in a new tab In agreement with published data (16Fisher T.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2853-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the natural nucleotide substrate fails to form a stable ternary complex with the F61A mutant (Fig. 3B, left panel). In contrast, INDOPY-1 is capable of forming stable ternary complex (Fig. 3B, right panel). The Kd(app) value is comparable with WT RT (Kd(app) = 200 nm versus 100 nm with WT RT) (Table 2). Thus, the diminished binding of the nucleotide alone is sufficient to increase the inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1. Of note, a change at the neighboring residue, i.e. A62V, has been identified among other mutations in HIV isolates that show decreased susceptibility to INDOPY-1 (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J.

Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, increases in IC50 values for INDOPY-1 are generally subtle when comparing the A62V mutant enzyme with WT RT (Table 3). Effect of the Nucleotide Concentration on Inhibition with INDOPY-1—The combined data of our mutational analysis provide strong evidence to suggest that both differences in nucleotide binding and differences in inhibitor binding can affect the susceptibility to INDOPY-1. These findings support the notion of competitive inhibition. If correct, increasing concentration of the nucleotide substrate should diminish binding of INDOPY-1, and, in turn, its inhibitory effects. To address this issue, we studied single nucleotide incorporation events at different concentrations of the dNTP substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1. DNA synthesis was initiated in the presence of trap to ensure single turnover conditions (Fig. 4A). Thus, any effects of the nucleotide and/or the inhibitor on complex dissociation that can complicate the interpretation of the data, are excluded under these conditions. The NNRTI nevirapine is not competitive with respect to the dNTP substrate, and, as expected, the IC50 value for nevirapine was independent of the nucleotide concentration (data not shown). In contrast, the IC50 values for INDOPY-1 increased in accordance with increases in concentrations of the dNTP substrate (Fig. 4B), which is indicative of a competitive mode of inhibition. Effect of Abasic Sites in the Template Strand on Binding of INDOPY-1—The resistance profile and the combined biochemical data that point to a competitive mode of inhibition suggest that INDOPY-1 may bind in close proximity to the nucleotide binding site. In an attempt to further define the binding site for INDOPY-1, we employed chemically modified template strands with abasic sites at positions n and n+1 (Fig. 5A). Under this nomenclature, template position n lies opposite the 3′-end of the primer, and position n+1 pairs with the incoming dNTP (Fig. 5B). The planar structure of the inhibitor (Fig. 1) points to possible stacking interactions with the template strand, and the loss of the nucleobase at these strategic positions may therefore cause deficiencies in binding. We found that an abasic residue at position n fully prevents formation of a stable ternary complex with INDOPY-1, while an abasic site at position n+1 did not show any significant effect when compared with the unmodified template. The clear difference suggests that interaction with the ultimate base pair represents an important structural requirement for inhibitor binding, while the nucleobase in the template overhang appears to be dispensable in this regard. INDOPY-1 represents a family of compounds that inhibit HIV-1 RT through a novel mechanism of action. Previous biochemical studies by our group have shown that INDOPY-1 binds preferentially following incorporation of pyrimidines, stabilizes the RT-DNA/DNA complex in its post-translocated state, and blocks DNA synthesis in a reversible manner (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). While the resistance profile for this inhibitor is unique, changes in susceptibility to INDOPY-1 have been associated with a number of mutations that likewise change susceptibility to NRTIs (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Z. Walker M. Xu W. Shim J.H. Girardet J.L. Hamatake R.K. Hong Z. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we studied the biochemical phenotypes associated with these changes to provide novel insight into both mechanisms of resistance, and the binding properties of INDOPY-1. Key results are visualized against the structure of HIV-1 RT (Fig. 6). Decreased Susceptibility to INDOPY-1—M184V and Y115F have been associated with decreased susceptibility to INDOPY-1. Met-184 lies in close proximity to the 3′-end of the primer, while the aromatic side chain of Tyr-115 is in close proximity of the sugar moiety of the bound dNTP substrate ((20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), visualized in Fig. 6). The combination of the two mutations amplifies the subtle effects of the individual mutations in cell-based and cell-free assays. Thus, these mutations in HIV-1 RT can be directly linked to the resistant phenotype. However, our data suggest that the contribution of the two mutations is based on different, yet complementary mechanisms. M184V diminishes complex formation with the inhibitor, while Y115F facilitates complex formation with the natural nucleotide substrate. These interlinked mechanisms help to explain the synergistic effects of the two mutations. The data provide strong evidence to suggest that the mechanism of resistance is based on substrate discrimination. The band shift experiments used here to study complex formation provide an indirect measure for ligand binding. The differences in Kd(app) values are in good agreement with enzyme kinetic measurements that point to decreases in Kd and Km values with the Y115F mutant (21Ray A.S. Basavapathruni A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40479-40490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Martin-Hernandez A.M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Y115F mutation is seen, infrequently, in conjunction with M184V in isolates of patients treated with abacavir (9Miller V. Ait-Khaled M. Stone C. Griffin P. Mesogiti D. Cutrell A. Harrigan R. Staszewski S. Katlama C. Pearce G. Tisdale M. AIDS. 2000; 14: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Lanier E.R.

However, Y115F does not appear to further diminish the efficiency of incorporation of the NRTI (21Ray A.S. Basavapathruni A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40479-40490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Increased Susceptibility to INDOPY-1—K65R, which emerges under the selective pressure of tenofovir (10Miller M.D. AIDS Rev. 2004; 6: 22-33PubMed Google Scholar), confers hypersusceptibility to INDOPY-1. It is interesting to note that M184V can increase susceptibility to tenofovir (24Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y. Salomon H. Mulato A.S. Lamy P.D. Margot N.A. Anton K.E. Cherrington J.M. Antivir. Ther. 1999; 4: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the two compounds show inverse effects with regards to K65R and M184V and combining tenofovir and INDOPY-1 in cell culture affects the selection of resistance. Under these conditions, tenofovir selects for K70E (25Jochmans, D., Van Marck, H., Van Ginderen, M., De Baere, I., Dehertogh, P., Peeters, A., Kesteleyn, B., Pattery, T., McKenna, P., and Hertogs, K. (2006) Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections Abstract 500, Denver, COGoogle Scholar). The properties of the mutant enzyme are reminiscent of K65R; however, K70E is severely compromised in regard to viral replication capacity (26Sluis-Cremer N. Sheen C.W. Zelina S. Torres P.S. Parikh U.M. Mellors J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that K65R shows subtle increases in complex formation with INDOPY-1, and subtle decreases in complex formation with the nucleotide substrate. In essence, this is the opposite of the results described for the combination of M184V and Y115F. Thus, K65R discriminates against the dNTP substrate, which is consistent with an INDOPY-1 hypersusceptible phenotype. Complex formation with the nucleotide appears to be an important parameter that affects susceptibility to INDOPY-1. The F61A mutation provides additional evidence in support of this notion. This mutation discriminates against dNTP substrate binding while the INDOPY-1 binding remains unaffected resulting in a heavily hypersusceptible enzyme. Ternary Complexes with the Nucleotide Substrate versus INDOPY-1—The crystal structure of a ternary complex with a bound dNTP shows the polymerase domain in a closed structure (20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 27Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R.

Biol. 2004; 11: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Prior to nucleotide binding, the β3-β4 hairpin loop in the fingers subdomain is open to facilitate this step. The closure of the fingers appears to mediate interactions between Lys-65 and the γ-phosphate of the bound dNTP (29Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 77-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the aromatic side chain of Phe-61 stacks against the nucleobase at template position n+2 (Ref. 20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar and Fig. 6). The loss of these interactions, in particular the stacking between Phe-61 and template, appears to selectively destabilize the ternary complex with the nucleotide and not with INDOPY-1. Our studies with the F61A mutant suggest that the aromatic side chain of this residue is dispensable for formation of a stable ternary complex with the inhibitor. These data suggest that alternative contacts between the inhibitor and the DNA/DNA substrate provide an anchor to stabilize the complex with RT. The instability of a ternary complex with a template containing an abasic lesion opposite the primer terminus implicates important interactions between INDOPY-1 and the ultimate base pair. The specificity for pyrimidine residues at the 3′-end of the primer provides independent support for this notion; however, structural studies are required to address this issue in more detail. Despite these differences in ternary complex formation, binding of INDOPY-1 and the nucleotide substrate are competitive in nature. Previous studies under steady-state conditions have pointed to competitive or mixed-type inhibition, respectively (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Z. Walker M. Xu W. Shim J.H. Girardet J.L. Hamatake R.K. Hong Z. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In theory, mixed-type inhibition may allow binding of the inhibitor to both binary RT-primer/template complexes and ternary complexes with the incoming dNTP. However, binding parameters suggested that the affinity of the inhibitor to ternary complexes is markedly reduced. In addition, INDOPY-1 stabilizes the product complex following nucleotide incorporation, which, in turn, prevents enzyme dissociation under multiple turnover (steady-state) conditions. Enzyme kinetics measured under these conditions can translate in mixed-type or non-competitive inhibition, although simultaneous binding of substrate and inhibitor is mutually exclusive (30Marchand B. Tchesnokov E.P. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3337-3346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To avoid these complications we studied the inhibitory effects of INDOPY-1 under single turnover conditions, which indicates competitive binding, consistent with our previous observations (5Jochmans D. Deval J. Kesteleyn B. Van Marck H. Bettens E. De Baere I. Dehertogh P. Ivens T. Van Ginderen M. Van Schoubroeck B. Ehteshami M. Wigerinck P. Gotte M. Hertogs K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12283-12292Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Together, the data suggest that INDOPY-1 binds in close proximity to the nucleotide binding site of HIV-1 RT. Mechanisms associated with resistance and hypersusceptibility are both based on ligand discrimination. These findings along with complementary biochemical data show that the inhibitor competes with the natural dNTP substrates. In light of the collective data, we suggest to refer to members of this family of compounds as “nucleotide-competing RT inhibitors” (NcRTIs) (25Jochmans, D., Van Marck, H., Van Ginderen, M., De Baere, I., Dehertogh, P., Peeters, A., Kesteleyn, B., Pattery, T., McKenna, P., and Hertogs, K.

Some phylogenetic studies have demonstrated the existence of two different populations of Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains circulating in nature, but little is known about their biological characteristics. Therefore, our goal was to study the virulence pattern of seven Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains. Infected BALB/c mice were monitored for morbidity, mortality and viral replication in organs as trachea, lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, brain and spleen. Based on the virulence potential, the Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains were grouped into two groups. One group contained GP1V, VBH, SAV and BAV which caused disease and death in infected mice and the second one included ARAV, GP2V and PSTV which did not cause any clinical signals or death in infected BALB/c mice. The subdivision of Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains into two groups is in agreement with previous genetic studies. Those data reinforce the existence of different populations circulating in Brazil regarding the genetic and virulence characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2056815427,"The critical role of protein synthesis in regulating lifespan has been evidenced. This study shows that adult-onset RNAi inactivation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2Bdelta (eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2), a subunit of eIF2B, extends the mean lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. eIF2B is a GDP-GTP exchange factor for eIF2--a rate-limiting factor for protein synthesis initiation. (35)S-methionine incorporation assay showed that global protein synthesis is reduced by eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi. Inhibition of eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 during adulthood conferred thermal and oxidative stress resistance and reduced the fecundity and fat storage, suggesting the possible trade-offs of resources between reproduction and somatic maintenance. Lifespan extension by adult-onset eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi is suppressed in FOXO transcription factor daf-16 deletion mutants. Adult-onset eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi increases the expression of stress-resistant genes, including hsp-16.2, hsp-70, hsp90, and sod-3, some of which are reported to be targets of DAF-16. Adult-onset eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi in daf-16 mutants reduced fecundity, but did not extend lifespan. Furthermore, adult-onset eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi did not extend the lifespan of germline-defective glp-4 organisms. Thus, it is possible that eIF2Bdelta/F11A3.2 RNAi during adulthood prolongs lifespan via daf-16, which induces stress resistance in organisms. This might be the mechanism, at least in part, for trade-offs of resources between reproduction and somatic maintenance."

It is becoming increasingly clear that each of these two regions contains several TSGs. Until now TSGs which were isolated from AP20 and LUCA regions (e.g.G21/NPRL2, RASSF1A, RASSF1C, SEMA3B, SEMA3F, RBSP3) were shown to inhibit tumour cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of expression HYAL1 and HYAL2 was studied by colony formation inhibition, growth curve and cell proliferation tests in vitro and tumour growth assay in vivo. Very modest growth inhibition was detected in vitro in U2020 lung and KRC/Y renal carcinoma cell lines. In the in vivo experiment stably transfected KRC/Y cells expressing HYAL1 or HYAL2 were inoculated into SCID mice (10 and 12 mice respectively). Tumours grew in eight mice inoculated with HYAL1. Ectopic HYAL1 was deleted in all of them. HYAL2 was inoculated into 12 mice and only four tumours were obtained. In 3 of them the gene was deleted. In one tumour it was present but not expressed. As expected for tumour suppressor genes HYAL1 and HYAL2 were down-expressed in 15 fresh lung squamous cell carcinomas (100%) and clear cell RCC tumours (60–67%). Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that the expression of either gene has led to inhibition of tumour growth in vivo without noticeable effect on growth in vitro. HYAL1 and HYAL2 thus differ in this aspect from other tumour suppressors like P53 or RASSF1A that inhibit growth both in vitro and in vivo. Targeting the microenvironment of cancer cells is one of the most promising venues of cancer therapeutics. As major hyaluronidases in human cells, HYAL1 and HYAL2 may control intercellular interactions and microenvironment of tumour cells providing excellent targets for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2148765969,"Previously we have demonstrated that bradykinin B1 receptor deficient mice (B1KO) were protected against renal ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI). Here, we aimed to analyze the effect of B1 antagonism on renal IRI and to study whether B1R knockout or antagonism could modulate the renal expression of pro and anti-inflammatory molecules. To this end, mice were subjected to 45 minutes ischemia and reperfused at 4, 24, 48 and 120 hours. Wild-type mice were treated intra-peritoneally with antagonists of either B1 (R-954, 200 microg/kg) or B2 receptor (HOE140, 200 microg/kg) 30 minutes prior to ischemia. Blood samples were collected to ascertain serum creatinine level, and kidneys were harvested for gene transcript analyses by real-time PCR. Herein, B1R antagonism (R-954) was able to decrease serum creatinine levels, whereas B2R antagonism had no effect. The protection seen under B1R deletion or antagonism was associated with an increased expression of GATA-3, IL-4 and IL-10 and a decreased T-bet and IL-1beta transcription. Moreover, treatment with R-954 resulted in lower MCP-1, and higher HO-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that bradykinin B1R antagonism is beneficial in renal IRI."
https://openalex.org/W2057201067,"In an event-related fMRI study, we scanned eighteen normal human subjects while they viewed three categories of pictures (events, objects and persons) which they classified according to desirability (desirable, indifferent or undesirable). Each category produced activity in a distinct part of the visual brain, thus reflecting its functional specialization. We used conjunction analysis to learn whether there is a brain area which is always active when a desirable picture is viewed, regardless of the category to which it belongs. The conjunction analysis of the contrast desirable > undesirable revealed activity in the superior orbito-frontal cortex. This activity bore a positive linear relationship to the declared level of desirability. The conjunction analysis of desirable > indifferent revealed activity in the mid-cingulate cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex. In the former, activity was greater for desirable and undesirable stimuli than for stimuli classed as indifferent. Other conjunction analyses produced no significant effects. These results show that categorizing any stimulus according to its desirability activates three different brain areas: the superior orbito-frontal, the mid-cingulate, and the anterior cingulate cortices."
https://openalex.org/W1986056008,"Phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2) is an important signaling effector of multiple receptors in the immune system. Here we show that PLCgamma2-deficient mice displayed impaired lymph node organogenesis but normal splenic structure and Peyer's patches. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is a tumor necrosis factor family cytokine and is essential for lymph node organogenesis. Importantly, PLCgamma2 deficiency severely impaired RANKL signaling, resulting in marked reduction of RANKL-induced activation of MAPKs, p38 and JNK, but not ERK. The lack of PLCgamma2 markedly diminished RANKL-induced activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and NFATc1. Moreover, PLCgamma2 deficiency impaired RANKL-mediated biological function, leading to failure of the PLCgamma2-deficient bone marrow macrophage precursors to differentiate into osteoclasts after RANKL stimulation. Re-introduction of PLCgamma2 but not PLCgamma1 restores RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation of PLCgamma2-deficient bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage. Taken together, PLCgamma2 is essential for RANK signaling, and its deficiency leads to defective lymph node organogenesis and osteoclast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1989709341,"Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster (Y122-HC) is an interaction network formed by the top part of the second transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic actuator and phosphorylation domains of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. We have previously found that Y122-HC plays critical roles in the processing of ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (E2P) after its formation by the isomerization from ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1PCa2) (Wang, G., Yamasaki, K., Daiho, T., and Suzuki, H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 26508–26516). Here, we further explored kinetic properties of the alanine-substitution mutants of Y122-HC to examine roles of Y122-HC for Ca2+ release process in E2P. In the steady state, the amount of E2P decreased so that of E1PCa2 increased with increasing lumenal Ca2+ concentration in the mutants with K0.5 110–320 μm at pH 7.3. These lumenal Ca2+ affinities in E2P agreed with those estimated from the forward and lumenal Ca2+-induced reverse kinetics of the E1PCa2-E2P isomerization. K0.5 of the wild type in the kinetics was estimated to be 1.5 mm. Thus, E2P of the mutants possesses significantly higher affinities for lumenal Ca2+ than that of the wild type. The kinetics further indicated that the rates of lumenal Ca2+ access and binding to the transport sites of E2P were substantially slowed by the mutations. Therefore, the proper formation of Y122-HC and resulting compactly organized structure are critical for both decreasing Ca2+ affinity and opening the lumenal gate, thus for Ca2+ release from E2PCa2. Interestingly, when K+ was omitted from the medium of the wild type, the properties of the wild type became similar to those of Y122-HC mutants. K+ binding likely functions via producing the compactly organized structure, in this sense, similarly to Y122-HC.

In the initial steps (steps 1 and 2 in Scheme 1), the enzyme is activated by binding of two cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions at the transport sites with a submicromolar high affinity (E2 to E1Ca2). The activated enzyme is then auto-phosphorylated at Asp351 by ATP and forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate (EP) (step 3), thereby the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites. This EP is rapidly dephosphorylated by ADP in the reverse reaction reproducing ATP, therefore “ADP-sensitive EP” (E1P). In the next step (step 4), E1PCa2 is isomerized to the ADP-insensitive form, E2PCa2. Upon this change at the catalytic site, the Ca2+ sites are deoccluded and opened to the lumenal side, and the Ca2+ affinity is largely reduced, releasing the bound Ca2+ ions into the lumen (step 5). The Ca2+ release process is thought to be very rapid with the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, and the accumulation of E2PCa2 intermediate had actually never been found until we recently identified and trapped successfully this intermediate by a mutation study (9Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34429-34447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the final step, the Asp351-acylphosphate of E2P is hydrolyzed to reproduce the dephosphorylated and inactive E2 form (step 6). The transport cycle is totally reversible, e.g. E2P can be formed from E2 by Pi in the absence of Ca2+, and the subsequent lumenal Ca2+ binding to E2P produces E1PCa2.

Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase has three cytoplasmic domains, P (phosphorylation), N (nucleotide binding), and A (actuator or anchor), and ten transmembrane helices (M1–M10). The two Ca2+ binding sites consist of residues on M4, M5, M6, and M8 (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The P domain possesses the phosphorylation site (Asp351) and is directly linked to the long helices M4 and M5. The ATP binding site is on the N domain connected to the P domain. The A domain is linked to M1, M2, and M3 via the A/M1-, A/M2-, and A/M3-linkers. The cytoplasmic three domains largely move and change their organization states during the Ca2+-transport cycle (19Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and these changes are linked with the rearrangements in the transmembrane helices for the Ca2+ transport. As a most remarkable change, in the EP isomerization (loss of ADP sensitivity) and Ca2+ release, the A domain largely rotates and the P domain largely inclines toward the A domain, and these domains produce their tight association (see Fig. 1 for the change E1Ca2⋅AlF4−⋅ADP→E2⋅MgF42− as the model for the overall process E1∼PCa2·ADP → E2·Pi, including the EP isomerization and Ca2+ release). These structural changes therefore involve distinct events in distinct regions, yet they are coordinated; namely 1) the loss of ADP sensitivity at the cytoplasmic region, 2) the decrease in the Ca2+ affinity at the transmembrane region, and 3) the opening of the Ca2+-releasing pathway (lumenal gating). Recently, we found that mutations in a specific hydrophobic interaction network, “Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster” (Y122-HC), at the A-P domain interface disrupt markedly the processing of ADP-insensitive EP formed from ATP with Ca2+ and also the hydrolysis of E2P formed from Pi without Ca2+, thus causing nearly complete inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In these Y122-HC mutants, the high affinity binding of cytoplasmic Ca2+, the resulting E1PCa2 formation, and the loss of the ADP sensitivity were all found to occur normally as in the wild type (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Y122-HC is formed by gathering of the seven residues of the three regions upon their motions; i.e. the largely rotated A domain (Ile179, Leu180, and Ile232), the inclined P domain (Val705 and Val726), and the top part of the largely inclined M2 (or the A/M2-linker) (Leu119 and Tyr122). Thus Y122-HC produces the compactly organized structure of E2P. Our previous analyses indicate that, in the Y122-HC mutants, there is a kinetic limit after the loss of ADP sensitivity and before the hydrolysis of the Ca2+-free E2P, therefore the Ca2+ release from E2PCa2 is likely retarded (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Almost the same kinetic results were found with the mutations in another A-P domain interaction network at the Val200 loop of the A domain (24Kato S. Kamidochi M. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9624-9629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Notably, E2PCa2, the ADP-insensitive EP with two Ca2+ ions occluded at the transport sites was recently identified and trapped successfully by the elongation of the A/M1-linker with two or more amino acid insertions (9Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34429-34447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the elongation mutants, Y122-HC is not formed properly yet in E2PCa2 trapped, but it is properly formed in the Ca2+-released form of E2P produced by Pi without Ca2+. Thus the observation is consistent with the involvement of Y122-HC in the Ca2+ release process from E2PCa2. In the present study, to further clarify roles of Y122-HC in the Ca2+ deocclusion/release processes and thus in the long range communication between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions, we explored kinetic features of the alanine-substitution mutants of Y122-HC. The results revealed that the mutations cause a marked increase in the apparent affinity of E2P for lumenal Ca2+ and also a substantial retardation of the lumenal Ca2+ access to E2P. Therefore, the formation of Y122-HC is critical for decreasing the affinity for Ca2+, for lumenal gating (opening of the release pathway), and thus for Ca2+ release into lumen. Importantly, the assembling manner of the seven residues in Y122-HC in the very recently revealed crystal structure E2⋅BeF3− (17Toyoshima C. Norimatsu Y. Iwasawa S. Tsuda T. Ogawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19831-19836Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.-M. L. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) somewhat differs from that in E2⋅AlF4− and E2⋅MgF42− . Therefore, we discussed the significance of this difference in terms of the possible sequential gathering of the seven residues into Y122-HC on the basis of the observed difference in the extents of their mutational effects. In addition, we found with the wild type that its kinetic behavior became similar to that of Y122-HC mutants when K+ was omitted from the medium of the wild type. Results revealed for the first time the critical role of K+ binding in the wild type for Ca2+ deocclusion/release from E2PCa2. Mutagenesis and Expression—Mutations were created by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and plasmid pGEM7-Zf(+) or pGEM3-Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) containing ApaI-KpnI or KpnI-SalI fragments of rabbit SERCA1a cDNA as a template. The ApaI-KpnI or KpnI-SalI fragments were then excised from the products and used to replace the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (25Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (26Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in a mixture containing 20 μg/ml microsomal protein, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 3 μm A23187, 0.1 m KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, various concentrations of CaCl2 up to 3 mm, 0.01 mm EGTA, and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.3). Formation and Hydrolysis of EP—Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi and dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled SERCA1a were performed under conditions described in the figure legends. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Rapid kinetics measurements of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were performed with a handmade rapid mixing apparatus (27Kanazawa T. Saito M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 693-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), otherwise the method was as above. The precipitated proteins were separated at pH 6.0 by 5% SDS-PAGE, according to Weber and Osborn (28Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described previously (29Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was <1% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA1a. Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the Calcon program. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by using the program VMD (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35757) Google Scholar). Ca2+-induced Change in Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP in the Presence of 0.1 m K+ at Steady State—We first determined the steady state Ca2+-ATPase activity in the presence of increasing Ca2+ and ionophore A23187 with the alanine-substitution mutants of the seven residues of Y122-HC and the wild type. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was nearly completely inhibited in all the mutants in agreement with our previous observation (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the complete inhibition was found at all the Ca2+ concentrations examined (see supplemental Fig. S1 for the representative mutant Y122A). Thus the possible lumenal Ca2+ effect was not revealed by this type of measurements. Therefore in Fig. 2, to assess the affinity of the lumenally oriented Ca2+ transport site of E2P (known as the low affinity sites with the mm over ∼10 mm Kd value), the amounts of ADP-insensitive EP were determined with the representative mutant Y122A at steady state at various Ca2+ concentrations and pH values in the presence of A23187 and KCl. The total amounts of EP (ADP-sensitive EP plus ADP-insensitive EP) were nearly the same under all the sets of conditions. In the mutant Y122A, the fraction of the ADP-insensitive EP was very high at the low Ca2+ concentrations at all pHs (Fig. 2). This agrees with the property of this mutant (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the hydrolysis of E2P is nearly completely inhibited thus causing its accumulation. The fraction of ADP-insensitive EP in the mutant markedly decreased, and it was converted to the ADP-sensitive EP with increasing Ca2+ concentration at several tens of micromolar to the sub-millimolar range. The apparent Ca2+ affinity in this Ca2+-induced change increased with increasing pH, and the Hill coefficients were found to be 2 in all pH values (see the legend to Fig. 2). In the wild type, the fraction of ADP-insensitive EP was low at pH 7.3 and 7.8 being ∼10% or less, and was a significant level, 35% at pH 6.8 (supplemental Fig. S2). These levels were not changed at 1 μm to 3 mm Ca2+. Consistently, the lumenal Ca2+ affinity of E2P of the wild type is known to be in the millimolar to 10 mm range (see Ref. 32Coan C. Verjovski-Almeida S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2968-2974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Prager R. Punzengruber C. Kolassa N. Winkler F. Suko J. Eur. J.

The results suggested that the lumenal Ca2+ affinity of transport sites of E2P in the mutant may be significantly higher than that in the wild type. Time Courses of Forward and Ca2+-induced Reverse Conversions between E1PCa2 and E2P—In Fig. 3 with Y122A, the ADP-insensitive EP, and the ADP-sensitive EP was first accumulated at steady state at 10 μm Ca2+ and 1 mm Ca2+, respectively, at pH 7.3. Then the Ca2+ concentration jump was made from 10 μm to 1 mm or from 1 mm to 80 nm, and the change in the fraction of the ADP-insensitive EP was followed. Because the hydrolysis of E2P was nearly completely blocked in Y122A (with the rate << 0.01 s-1) (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol.

When Ca2+ was increased from 10 μm to 1 mm, the fraction of ADP-insensitive EP rapidly decreased from 80% to 10% (i.e. it was converted to the ADP-sensitive EP) with a rate 0.4 s-1. On the other hand, when the Ca2+ concentration was decreased from 1 mm to 80 nm, i.e. virtually Ca2+ was removed, the ADP-sensitive EP was converted to the ADP-insensitive EP with a rate 0.022 s-1. Effect of Ca2+ Ionophore A23187 in Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP—To ascertain that the Ca2+-dependent changes in the fraction of ADP-insensitive EP (Figs. 2 and 3) are caused by lumenal Ca2+, we examined also in the absence of A23187 the Ca2+ dependence of the steady-state fraction of ADP-insensitive EP (Fig. 4). The Ca2+-dependent change was rather small in the absence of A23187, in contrast to the very large change in its presence. Therefore, the observed Ca2+-induced conversion from the ADP-insensitive EP to ADP-sensitive one in Y122A is due to the Ca2+ binding to the lumenally oriented transport sites. Ca2+-induced Change in Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP of Seven Y122-HC Mutants in the Presence of 0.1 m K+—In Fig. 5, each of the other six residues involved in the Y122-HC (Leu119/Ile179/Leu180/Ile232/Val705/Val726) was substituted with alanine, and its effect on the ADP-insensitive EP level was examined as in Fig. 2 in the presence of A23187 and K+. All the Y122-HC mutants exhibited the marked Ca2+-dependent change in the ADP-insensitive EP fraction. 3The maximal level of the ADP-insensitive EP of L180A at low Ca2+ concentrations (44% of total amount of EP) was significantly lower than those of the other mutants. It may be due to the significantly faster E2P hydrolysis rate in L180A as compared with the rates in the others, as shown in supplemental Fig. S4. The apparent affinities for lumenal Ca2+ in the Y122-HC mutants were found to be between 110 and 320 μm with a Hill coefficient of ∼2 (Table 1). The results showed that all these Y122-HC mutants possess the lumenally oriented transport sites with the affinities as high as that of Y122A.TABLE 1Parameters obtained for Ca2+ dependence of accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP in Y122-HC mutants As shown in Fig. 5, the lumenal Ca2+-induced change in the steady-state accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP of the seven Y122-HC mutants in the presence of 0.1 m K+ were fitted to the Hill equation. The parameters thus obtained by the least squares fit are listed here. K0.5 is the Ca2+ concentration giving the half-maximum change in the fraction of ADP-insensitive EP among the total amount of EP, therefore the apparent affinity for lumenal Ca2+. The highest fraction of the ADP-insensitive EP at the low Ca2+ concentration range (0–10 μm) and its lowest fraction at the high Ca2+ concentration range (over ∼mm) are also listed as the obtained parameters in the fitting (see Fig. 5). The value nH is the Hill coefficient.MutantFraction of ADP-insensitive EP at highest and lowest Ca2+ concentration rangesK0.5nHHigh Ca2+Low Ca2+% of total amount of EPmmL119A11780.122.1Y122A6860.161.9I179A12920.252.3L180A9440.111.6I232A10890.322.0V705A39800.271.6V726A23650.282.0 Open table in a new tab Ca2+-induced Change in Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP of Mutants and Wild Type in the Absence of K+—In Fig. 6, the same sets of steady-state analysis as in Fig. 2 were done with the wild type and Y122A but here in the absence of K+. It is well known (35Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, in the absence of K+, the E2P hydrolysis of the wild type is markedly slowed, and therefore the ADP-insensitive EP significantly accumulates. The fraction of ADP-insensitive EP in the wild type in the absence of K+ decreased with increasing Ca2+ concentration as in Y122A with the Hill coefficient ∼2. The apparent affinity for lumenal Ca2+ increased with increasing pH in the wild type as in Y122A. The pH-dependent changes are consistent with the fact that the residues for Ca2+ ligation at the transport sites are also involved in the proton binding (and its counter transport); the observed Ca2+-induced changes reflect the Ca2+ binding to the lumenally oriented transport sites of E2P. At each pH, the affinity of the wild type was similar to or slightly lower than that of Y122A. Thus in the absence of 0.1 m K+, the property of the wild type became similar to that of Y122A. In Y122A, elimination of K+ exhibited no significant effect on the apparent affinity for lumenal Ca2+ (cf. Fig. 2). The observed effect of K+ on the wild type is probably due to its binding in the cytoplasmic region. In crystallographic as well as mutational studies (12Sørensen T.L.-M. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 37Sørensen T.L.-M. Clausen J.D. Jensen A.-M. L. Vilsen V. Møller J.V. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46355-46358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the K+ binding site of the Ca2+-ATPase was identified to be in the cytoplasmic region but not in the lumenal or transmembrane regions (see Fig. 11). Actually, we found experimentally that, when K+ at 0.1 m was added without any K+-ionophore to the Ca2+-ATPase in SR vesicles phosphorylated in the absence of K+, the Ca2+-dependence of the ADP-insensitive EP fraction observed as in Fig. 6A became immediately (within 10 s after the K+ addition) that in the presence of 0.1 m K+ as in supplemental Fig. S2 (data not shown). Kinetics of Lumenal Ca2+-induced E2P to E1PCa2 Reverse Transition Followed by Its ADP-induced Rapid Decay to E1Ca2 in the Presence of 0.1 m K+—Then with the representative mutant Y122A, we explored kinetically the lumenal Ca2+ accessibility to the lumenally oriented transport sites of E2P formed from Pi without Ca2+ and the resulting lumenal Ca2+-induced E2P to E1PCa2 reverse transition. In Fig. 7, we included ADP and thereby followed the Ca2+- and ADP-induced decay of E2P to E1Ca2 via E1PCa2 in the reverse reaction. The E2P hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+ was extremely slow (as previously demonstrated with the Y122-HC mutants (22Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), and the E2P decay was dramatically accelerated by the addition of Ca2+ and ADP (Fig. 7A). For example, the rate in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ was 200-times faster than that of the forward E2P hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+. ADP alone without Ca2+ or Ca2+ alone without ADP did not accelerate the EP decay (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the increase of Ca2+ to 1 mm converted the ADP-insensitive EP (E2P) to the ADP-sensitive one (E1PCa2), and E1PCa2 thus formed was not decomposed in the absence of ADP. Therefore the Ca2+- and ADP-induced decay of E2P in Fig. 7A obviously occurred in the reverse reaction by the lumenal Ca2+ binding; E2P + 2Ca2+ → E1PCa2, then E1PCa2 + ADP → E1Ca2 + ATP (Scheme 1). This view agrees with the previous demonstration with SR Ca2+-ATPase (34de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of the EP decay in the presence of Ca2+ and ADP increased almost linearly with increasing Ca2+ concentrations and was not saturated even at 3 mm (Fig. 7B). 4Its slope was approximately 0.2 s-1mm-1 at 0–2 mm Ca2+. In Fig. 3, the rate of the forward E1PCa2 to E2P conversion was estimated to be 0.02 s-1. Therefore the calculation with these values, 0.02 s-1 divided by 0.2 s-1 mm-1, gave the apparent affinity for lumenal Ca2+ in E2P of Y122A as 100 μm. This value agreed very well with that (160 μm) obtained in Fig. 2 under the same conditions (pH 7.3) at the steady state. Here, note that the steady-state level of ADP-sensitive EP (E1PCa2) in the conversion from the ADP-insensitive EP (E2P) upon the lumenal Ca2+ binding in Y122A was almost fully saturated at 1 mm Ca2+ (see Fig. 2 at pH 7.3). The results indicate that the lumenal Ca2+ binding to E2P and formation of E2PCa2 (E2P + 2Ca2+ → E2PCa2) is likely the rate-limiting for the overall Ca2+- and ADP-induced reverse decay via the E2P to E1PCa2 conversion with subsequent extremely rapid ADP-induced E1PCa2 decay to E1Ca2. This means that the slope in Fig. 7B of the Ca2+ dependence probably reflects the rate constant for"
https://openalex.org/W2013864496,"Neurons require precise cytoskeletal regulation within neurites, containing microtubule tracks for cargo transport in axons and dendrites or within synapses containing organized actin. Due to the unique architecture and specialized function of neurons, neurons are particularly susceptible to perturbation of the cytoskeleton. Numerous actin-binding proteins help maintain proper cytoskeletal regulation.From a Drosophila forward genetic screen, we identified a mutation in capulet--encoding a conserved actin-binding protein--that causes abnormal aggregates of actin within dendrites. Through interaction studies, we demonstrate that simultaneous genetic inactivation of capulet and kinesin heavy chain, a microtubule motor protein, produces elongate cofilin-actin rods within dendrites but not axons. These rods resemble actin-rich structures induced in both mammalian neurodegenerative and Drosophila Alzheimer's models, but have not previously been identified by loss of function mutations in vivo. We further demonstrate that mitochondria, which are transported by Kinesin, have impaired distribution along dendrites in a capulet mutant. While Capulet and Cofilin may biochemically cooperate in certain circumstances, in neuronal dendrites they genetically antagonize each other.The present study is the first molecularly defined loss of function demonstration of actin-cofilin rods in vivo. This study suggests that simultaneous, seemingly minor perturbations in neuronal dendrites can synergize producing severe abnormalities affecting actin, microtubules and mitochondria/energy availability in dendrites. Additionally, as >90% of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's cases are sporadic this study suggests mechanisms by which multiple mutations together may contribute to neurodegeneration instead of reliance on single mutations to produce disease."

This family of receptors is defined by a modular structure and characterized by a cytokine binding domain (CBD) (31Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 32Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CBD is composed of two “specialized” fibronectin III domains linked by a proline-rich sequence (Fig. 1). The N-terminal fibronectin III domain of the CBD (the D2 domain in Fig. 1) is characterized by two conserved disulfide bridges. The C-terminal fibronectin III domain of the CBD (the D3 domain in figure 1) contains a conserved WSXWS motif. The crystal structure of several type I cytokine receptors and cytokine-receptor complexes has revealed that CBD forms an elbow-shaped module bent at an angle of ∼90°. The receptor CBD interacts with cytokines through loops located at the boundary of the two fibronectin III domains (33Boulanger M.J. Garcia K.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 107-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The IL-6 family of cytokines belongs to the “long chain” four-α helix bundle class, with an up-up down-down topology (7Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The different secondary structures are named A-D from the N terminus to C terminus (Fig. 1). Crystallographic structures and site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that these cytokines interact with their receptor through three different binding sites, numbered 1-3 by analogy with growth hormone (Fig. 1) (34Boulanger M.J.

Cytokines requiring an α chain, like CNTF, CLC, NP, IL-6, and IL-11, bind first to the receptor through a site 1 composed of residues from the C-terminal parts of the AB loop and the αD helix (Fig. 1). Site 2 is located on solvent-exposed faces of the αA and αC helices and is important for binding to gp130. Site 3 is specific to the IL-6 family and corresponds to an additional signaling receptor binding site for LIFR in the case of CNTF, CLC, and NP. The LIFR binding site is characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of the αD helix (36Plun-Favreau H. Perret D. Diveu C. Froger J. Chevalier S. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Chabbert M. J.

These studies have shown that a conserved tryptophan residue and an RXXXD motif, which are located in the C-terminal parts of the AB loop and the αD helix, respectively, are required for CNTF and CLC interaction with CNTFRα. However, the counterpart of this contact site on CNTFRα is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the location of the binding site of CNTF, CLC, and NP on CNTFRα. For this purpose, NP was modeled, and its predicted binding site 1 was compared with the binding sites of CNTF and CLC. This analysis led us to identify a conserved binding site 1 among all of the CNTFRα ligands. Subsequently, the CNTFRα CBD was modeled, and its binding surface was analyzed to identify an area displaying physicochemical properties complementary to those of the CNTF, CLC, and NP binding site 1. Sequence Alignments—CNTF, NP, CLC, LIF, cardiotrophin-1, oncostatin M, CNTFRα, IL-6Rα and IL-12p40 sequences were retrieved from the Uniprot and GenBank™ data bases. Multiple sequence alignments were obtained using the T-Coffee (available on the World Wide Web) and GeneDoc (available on the World Wide Web) programs. CNTFRα and NP secondary structures were predicted using Network Prediction Server @nalysis at the Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais (Lyon, France) (39Deleage G. Blanchet C. Geourjon C.

Cells and Reagents—The COS-7, T98G glioblastoma, and SK-N-GP neuroblastoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The culture medium of Ba/F3 cells, modified to express the functional tripartite receptor for CNTF (BAF GLC), was supplemented with 5 ng/ml human CNTF (2Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S.

Anti-CNTFRα (AN-B2, AN-C2, and AN-E4) monoclonal antibodies and the polyclonal anti-CNTF antibody were generated in the laboratory. The anti-protein C (HPC4) antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody and the mAb-specific for phospho-705-STAT3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. CNTF, LIF, and IL-2 were bought from R&D Systems (Oxon, UK). CLC and mouse NP were produced as previously described (1Derouet D.

Site-directed Mutagenesis and Cell Transfection—The cDNAs encoding NP and the membrane or soluble forms of CNTFRα were subcloned in the pcDNA3.1 vector and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding mutant and wild type CNTFRα were transfected by electroporation in T98G glioblastoma cells using the Amaxa Nucleofactor™ technology (Amaxa, Köln, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs encoding mutant and wild type (WT) NP were transfected in COS-7 cells, as previously described (1Derouet D.

A. 2004; 101: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After a 48-h culture period, cells or supernatants were harvested and assayed. Mutant and WT NP were purified from the supernatant, as previously described (1Derouet D. Rousseau F. Alfonsi F. Froger J. Hermann J. Barbier F. Perret D. Diveu C. Guillet C. Preisser L. Dumont A.

Tyrosine Phosphorylation Analysis and Western Blotting—Parental or transfected T98G cells and SK-N-GP neuroblastoma cells were activated for 10 min with the indicated cytokines before being lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with a mAb specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT3. Membranes were stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 15 h and neutralized in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, before reblotting with an antibody recognizing all STAT3 isoforms. Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cell supernatants containing the wild type or mutated forms of soluble CNTFRα were harvested 48 h after transfection. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the receptors were incubated at a concentration of 1 nm with 1 nm CNTF. Then proteins were incubated over-night with the AN-C2 anti-CNTFRα mAb at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Complexes were isolated using beads coupled to protein A, followed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were performed with an anti-protein C biotinylated mAb or an anti-CNTF biotinylated polyclonal antibody, and revealed by polystreptavidin peroxidase. The reaction was visualized using an image Master camera from Amersham Biosciences. Membranes were stripped as described above, before reblotting with the biotinylated anti-CNTFRα AN-E4 mAb. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Parental and transfected T98G glioblastoma cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-CNTFRα monoclonal antibodies (AN-B2 and AN-C2) (10 μg/ml) or an isotype control antibody before using a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. CLC was biotin-tagged using the Bir A biotin ligase AviTag peptide substrate as previously described (50Cognet I. Guilhot F. Gabriac M. Chevalier S. Chouikh Y. Herman-Bert A. Guay-Giroux A. Corneau S. Magistrelli G. Elson G.C. Gascan H. Gauchat J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 301: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). CNTF and IL-2 were biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). Binding of biotinylated CLC, CNTF, NP, or IL-2 as a control cytokine was revealed using phycoerythrin-labeled polystreptavidin for an additional 30-min incubation step. Fluorescence was subsequently analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Biological Assays—BAF GLC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Serial dilutions of the cytokines tested were performed in triplicate. After a 72-h incubation period, 0.5 μCi of [3H]Tdr was added to each well for the last 4 h of the culture, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting, as previously described (51Chevalier S.

Analysis of the CNTF, CLC, and NP Binding Site 1 and NP Modeling—First, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of orthologs and paralogs of the IL-6 family members recruiting LIFR in their receptor complex (Fig. 2A). A conserved tryptophan residue (Trp64 and Trp94 in CNTF and CLC, respectively), located in the AB loop of these cytokines was previously reported to contribute to their binding site 1 (37Panayotatos N. Radziejewska E. Acheson A. Somogyi R. Thadani A. Hendrickson W.A. McDonald N.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14007-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Perret D.

The alignment shows that Trp85 in NP was highly conserved with CNTF Trp64 and CLC Trp94 and suggests that this residue is also involved in the NP site 1. Additional residues in the αD helix of these cytokines also contribute to CNTF and CLC binding site 1 (37Panayotatos N. Radziejewska E. Acheson A. Somogyi R. Thadani A. Hendrickson W.A. McDonald N.Q.

Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43961-43970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An RXXXD motif (Arg171 and Asp175 in CNTF and Arg197 and Asp201 in CLC) is conserved in the C-terminal part of this α helix. Interestingly, this RXXXD motif was also present in the C-terminal part of the NP αD helix (Arg190 and Asp194). These observations suggested that, like CNTF and CLC, NP possesses a conserved binding site 1 for CNTFRα (Fig. 2A). We built a NP molecular model using CNTF and LIF structures as templates. Next, we compared the NP model obtained with the CNTF structure or the CLC model previously reported (38Perret D. Guillet C. Elson G. Froger J. Plun-Favreau H. Rousseau F. Chabbert M. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43961-43970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and analyzed their binding site 1 (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, the NP binding surface involved a tryptophan residue located in the AB loop surrounded by positively charged residues, as already observed for CNTF and CLC. This clearly showed that the physicochemical properties of CNTF, CLC, and NP binding site 1 were conserved. Site-directed Mutagenesis of NP—To confirm the modeling study, we generated the W85A NP mutant. As a control, an irrelevant F82A mutation, located in the vicinity of the area studied, was introduced into the NP sequence. WT and mutant forms of NP were expressed in the COS-7 cell line and purified onaNi2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, as previously described (1Derouet D. Rousseau F. Alfonsi F. Froger J. Hermann J. Barbier F. Perret D. Diveu C. Guillet C. Preisser L. Dumont A. Barbado M. Morel A. deLapeyriere O. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The functionality of WT NP and mutant NP was tested in a proliferation assay using the BAF GLC cell line expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor complex. The results showed a lack of proliferation when cells were grown in the presence of the W85A NP mutant compared with the proliferation observed in the presence of the WT or F82A forms of NP (Fig. 3A). In addition, the NP mutants were studied for their ability to induce the recruitment of the STAT3 signaling pathway in SK-N-GP, a neuroblastoma cell line expressing the three CNTF receptor chains (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2089773825,"We present an analysis of the selective forces acting on two hepatitis C virus genome regions previously postulated to be involved in the viral response to combined antiviral therapy. One includes the three hypervariable regions in the envelope E2 glycoprotein, and the other encompasses the PKR binding domain and the V3 domain in the NS5A region. We used a cohort of 22 non-responder patients to combined therapy (interferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin) for which samples were obtained before initiation of therapy and after 6 or/and 12 months of treatment. A range of 25–100 clones per patient, genome region and time sample were sequenced. These were used to detect general patterns of adaptation, to identify particular adaptation mechanisms and to analyze the patterns of evolutionary change in both genome regions. These analyses failed to detect a common adaptive mechanism for the lack of response to antiviral treatment in these patients. On the contrary, a wide range of situations were observed, from patients showing no positively selected sites to others with many, and with completely different topologies in the reconstructed phylogenetic trees. Altogether, these results suggest that viral strategies to evade selection pressure from the immune system and antiviral therapies do not result from a single mechanism and they are likely based on a range of different alternatives, in which several different changes, or their combination, along the HCV genome confer viruses the ability to overcome strong selective pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2066573910,"Background Understanding the mechanisms that govern protein stability under poly-extreme conditions continues to be a major challenge. Xylanase (BSX) from Bacillus sp. NG-27, which has a TIM-barrel structure, shows optimum activity at high temperature and alkaline pH, and is resistant to denaturation by SDS and degradation by proteinase K. A comparative circular dichroism analysis was performed on native BSX and a recombinant BSX (R-BSX) with just one additional methionine resulting from the start codon. The results of this analysis revealed the role of the partially exposed N-terminus in the unfolding of BSX in response to an increase in temperature. Methodology We investigated the poly-extremophilicity of BSX to deduce the structural features responsible for its stability under one set of conditions, in order to gain information about its stability in other extreme conditions. To systematically address the role of the partially exposed N-terminus in BSX stability, a series of mutants was generated in which the first hydrophobic residue, valine (Val1), was either deleted or substituted with various amino acids. Each mutant was subsequently analyzed for its thermal, SDS and proteinase K stability in comparison to native BSX. Conclusions A single conversion of Val1 to glycine (Gly) changed R-BSX from being thermo- and alkali- stable and proteinase K and SDS resistant, to being thermolabile and proteinase K-, alkali- and SDS- sensitive. This result provided insight into the structure-function relationships of BSX under poly-extreme conditions. Molecular, biochemical and structural data revealed that the poly-extremophilicity of BSX is governed by a partially exposed N-terminus through hydrophobic interactions. Such hitherto unidentified N-terminal hydrophobic interactions may play a similar role in other proteins, especially those with TIM-barrel structures. The results of the present study are therefore of major significance for protein folding and protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2065090108,"Background Transgenic mice with mosaic, Golgi-staining-like expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have been very useful in studying the dynamics of neuronal structure and function. In order to further investigate the molecular events regulating structural plasticity, it would be useful to express multiple proteins in the same sparse neurons, allowing co-expression of functional proteins or co-labeling of subcellular compartments with other fluorescent proteins. However, it has been difficult to obtain reproducible expression in the same subset of neurons for direct comparison of neurons expressing different functional proteins. Principal Findings Here we describe a Cre-transgenic line that allows reproducible expression of transgenic proteins of choice in a small number of neurons of the adult cortex, hippocampus, striatum, olfactory bulb, subiculum, hypothalamus, superior colliculus and amygdala. We show that using these Cre-transgenic mice, multiple Cre-dependent transgenes can be expressed together in the same isolated neurons. We also describe a Cre-dependent transgenic line expressing a membrane associated EGFP (EGFP-F). Crossed with the Cre-transgenic line, EGFP-F expression starts in the adolescent forebrain, is present in dendrites, dendritic protrusions, axons and boutons and is strong enough for acute or chronic in vivo imaging. Significance This triple transgenic approach will aid the morphological and functional characterization of neurons in various Cre-dependent transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2103345587,"The reasons for using natural stimuli to study sensory function are quickly mounting, as recent studies have revealed important differences in neural responses to natural and artificial stimuli. However, natural stimuli typically contain strong correlations and are spherically asymmetric (i.e. stimulus intensities are not symmetrically distributed around the mean), and these statistical complexities can bias receptive field (RF) estimates when standard techniques such as spike-triggered averaging or reverse correlation are used. While a number of approaches have been developed to explicitly correct the bias due to stimulus correlations, there is no complementary technique to correct the bias due to stimulus asymmetries. Here, we develop a method for RF estimation that corrects reverse correlation RF estimates for the spherical asymmetries present in natural stimuli. Using simulated neural responses, we demonstrate how stimulus asymmetries can bias reverse-correlation RF estimates (even for uncorrelated stimuli) and illustrate how this bias can be removed by explicit correction. We demonstrate the utility of the asymmetry correction method under experimental conditions by estimating RFs from the responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural stimuli and using these RFs to predict responses to novel stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2025969870,"Background Pubertal timing in mammals is triggered by reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Strain-dependent differences in vaginal opening among inbred mouse strains suggest that genetic background contribute significantly to the puberty timing, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a genome-wide scanning for linkage in reciprocal crosses between two strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6/J (B6), which differed significantly in the pubertal timing. Vaginal opening (VO) was used to characterize pubertal timing in female mice, and the age at VO of all female mice (two parental strains, F1 and F2 progeny) was recorded. A genome-wide search was performed in 260 phenotypically extreme F2 mice out of 464 female progeny of the F1 intercrosses to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling this trait. A QTL significantly associated was mapped to the DXMit166 marker (15.5 cM, LOD = 3.86, p<0.01) in the reciprocal cross population (C3HB6F2). This QTL contributed 2.1 days to the timing of VO, which accounted for 32.31% of the difference between the original strains. Further study showed that the QTL was B6-dominant and explained 10.5% of variation to this trait with a power of 99.4% at an alpha level of 0.05.The location of the significant ChrX QTL found by genome scanning was then fine-mapped to a region of ∼2.5 cM between marker DXMit68 and rs29053133 by generating and phenotyping a panel of 10 modified interval-specific congenic strains (mISCSs). Conclusions/Significance Such findings in our study lay a foundation for positional cloning of genes regulating the timing of puberty, and also reveal the fact that chromosome X (the sex chromosome) does carry gene(s) which take part in the regulative pathway of the pubertal timing in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2093923346,"Introduction The molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial BAK activation during apoptosis remains highly controversial. Two seemingly conflicting models have been proposed. In one, BAK requires so-called activating BH3 only proteins (aBH3) to initiate its conformation change. In the other, displacement from inhibitory pro-survival BCL-2 proteins (PBPs) and monomerization of BAK by PBP selective dissociator BH3-only proteins (dBH3) is sufficient. Methodology/Principal Findings To better understand the kinetic implications of these conflicting but highly evidence-based models, we have conducted a deterministic, dynamical systems analysis to explore the kinetics underlying the first step of BAK activation, as a non-linear reaction system. We show that dBH3 induced BAK activation is efficient, even in the absence of aBH3s, provided constitutive interaction of PBPs with open conformation BAK occurs in an adenoviral E1B 19K-like manner. The pattern of PBP expression robustly predicts the efficacy of dBH3s. Conclusion Our findings accommodate the prevailing BAK activation models as potentially coexisting mechanisms capable of initiating BAK activation, and supports a model based approach for predicting resistance to therapeutically relevant small molecule BH3 mimetics."
https://openalex.org/W1996388900,"Background Whole genome duplication, which results in polyploidy, is a common feature of plant populations and a recurring event in the evolution of flowering plants. Polyploidy can result in changes to gene expression and epigenetic instability. Several epigenetic phenomena, occurring at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, have been documented in allopolyploids (polyploids derived from species hybrids) of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet findings in autopolyploids (polyploids derived from the duplication of the genome of a single species) are limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in ploidy enhances transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing using autopolyploids of A. thaliana. Methodology/Principal Findings Diploid and tetraploid individuals of four independent homozygous transgenic lines of A. thaliana transformed with chalcone synthase (CHS) inverted repeat (hairpin) constructs were generated. For each line diploids and tetraploids were compared for efficiency in post-transcriptional silencing of the endogenous CHS gene. The four lines differed substantially in their silencing efficiency. Yet, diploid and tetraploid plants derived from these plants and containing therefore identical transgene insertions showed no difference in the efficiency silencing CHS as assayed by visual scoring, anthocyanin assays and quantification of CHS mRNA. Conclusions/Significance Our results in A. thaliana indicated that there is no effect of ploidy level on transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our findings that post-transcriptional mechanisms were equally effective in diploids and tetraploids supports the use of transgene-driven post-transcriptional gene silencing as a useful mechanism to modify gene expression in polyploid species."
