https://openalex.org/W1994528729,"Exogenous DNA sequences were introduced into the Drosophila germ line. A rosy transposon (ry1), constructed by inserting a chromosomal DNA fragment containing the wild-type rosy gene into a P transposable element, transformed germ line cells in 20 to 50 percent of the injected rosy mutant embryos. Transformants contained one or two copies of chromosomally integrated, intact ry1 that were stably inherited in subsequent generations. These transformed flies had wild-type eye color indicating that the visible genetic defect in the host strain could be fully and permanently corrected by the transferred gene. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, a DNA segment that does not confer a recognizable phenotype on recipients was also transferred into germ line chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2103080800,"Recombinant DNA carrying the 3-kilobase P transposable element was injected into Drosophila embryos of a strain that lacked such elements. Under optimum conditions, half of the surviving embryos showed evidence of P element-induced mutations in a fraction of their progeny. Direct analysis of the DNA of strains derived from such flies showed them to contain from one to five intact 3-kilobase P elements located at a wide variety of chromosomal sites. DNA sequences located outside the P element on the injected DNA were not transferred. Thus P elements can efficiently and selectively transpose from extrachromosomal DNA to the DNA of germ line chromosomes in Drosophila embryos. These observations provide the basis for efficient DNA-mediated gene transfer in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1999643558,"Until recently, it has been impossible to approach learning with the techniques of cell biology. During the past several years, elementary forms of learning have been analyzed in higher invertebrates. Their nervous systems allow the experimental study of behavioral, neurophysiological, morphological, biochemical, and genetic components of the functional (plastic) changes underlying learning. In this review, we focus primarily on short-term sensitization of the gill and siphon reflex in the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica. Analyses of this form of learning provide direct evidence that protein phosphorylation dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate can modulate synaptic action. These studies also suggest how the molecular mechanisms for this short-term form of synaptic plasticity can be extended to explain both long-term memory and classical conditioning."

https://openalex.org/W1991711092,"We have employed repeat units of herpes simplex virus (HSV) defective genomes to derive a cloning-amplifying vector (amplicon) that can replicate in eucaryotic cells in the presence of standard HSV helper virus. The design of the HSV amplicon system is based on the previous observation that cotransfection of cells with helper virus DNA and seed monomeric repeat units of HSV defective genomes results in the regeneration of concatemeric defective genomes composed of multiple reiterations of the seed repeats. Cotransfection of cells with helper virus DNA and chimeric repeat units containing bacterial plasmid pKC7 DNA resulted in the generation of defective genomes composed of reiterations of the seed HSV-pKC7 repeats. These chimeric defective genomes were packaged into virus particles and could be propagated in virus stocks, with the most enriched passages containing more than 90% chimeric defective genomes. Furthermore, monomeric chimeric repeat units could be transferred back and forth between bacteria and eucaryotic cells. A derivative vector constructed so as to contain several unique restriction enzyme sites could be potentially employed in the introduction of additional viral or eucaryotic DNA sequences into eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976491544,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the doubt-stranded circular DNA of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) was determined. Analysis of this sequence in conjunction with known transcriptional data for the virus provides a basis of determining the organization of the papillomavirus genome. All the major open reading frames are located on the same DNA strand. The region transcribed in BPV-transformed cells contains open frames in all three translational frames whereas the region transcribed in productively infected bovine fibropapillomas is characterized by two large open reading frames partitioned by a single translational stop codon. The localization of sequences diagnostic of promoters and polyadenylation sites suggests that splicing is involved in the biosynthesis of the viral mRNAs. A sequence comparison indicates the genome organization of the bovine papillomavirus and that of the members of the simian virus 40-polyomavirus subgroup to be distinct, suggesting that these two groups of viruses are evolutionarily unrelated."
https://openalex.org/W1975514230,"The protein coding region of the herpes simplex virus type-1 glycoprotein D (gD) gene was mapped, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The predicted amino acid sequence of the gD polypeptide was found to contain a number of features in common with other virus glycoproteins. Insertion of this protein coding region into a bacterial expressor plasmid enabled synthesis in Escherichia coli of an immunoreactive gD-related polypeptide. The potential of this system for preparation of a type-common herpes simplex virus vaccine is discussed."

Furthermore, antiserum to CRF significantly lowered ACTH levels in adrenalectomized animals. These results suggest that endogenous CRF plays a physiological role in regulating ACTH secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1509876975,"Bacteriophage T4 gene 41 protein is one of the two phage proteins previously shown to be required for the synthesis of the pentaribonucleotide primers which initiate the synthesis of new chains in the T4 DNA replication system. We now show that a DNA helicase activity which can unwind short fragments annealed to complementary single-stranded DNA copurifies with the gene 41 priming protein. T4 gene 41 is essential for both the priming and helicase activities, since both are absent after infection by T4 phage with an amber mutation in gene 41. A complete gene 41 product is also required for two other activities previously found in purified preparations of the priming activity: a single-stranded DNA-dependent GTPase (ATPase) and an activity which stimulates strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by T4 DNA polymerase, the T4 gene 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins, and the T4 gene 32 helix-destabilizing protein (five-protein reaction). The 41 protein helicase requires a single-stranded DNA region adjoining the duplex region and begins unwinding at the 3' terminus of the fragment. There is a sigmoidal dependence on both nucleotide (rGTP, rATP) and protein concentration for this reaction. 41 Protein helicase activity is stimulated by our purest preparation of the T4 gene 61 priming protein, and by the T4 gene 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins. The direction of unwinding is consistent with the idea that 41 protein facilitates DNA synthesis on duplex templates by destabilizing the helix as it moves 5' to 3' on the displaced strand."
https://openalex.org/W2056107617,"We tested whether DNAase I-hypersensitive sites, once induced, can be propagated to daughter cells in the absence of the original inducer. Chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive Rous sarcoma virus at 41 °C and then shifted to 36°C become transformed and begin to transcribe globin RNA. DNAase I-hypersensitive sites appear in the α- and β-globin chromatin domains. Neither transcription nor hypersensitive sites are detected in cells infected and maintained at 41°C. Activation of the globin hypersensitive sites occurs within 30 min of a temperature shift to 36°C and does not require new protein synthesis. To test for the self-propagation of these hypersensitive structures, we inactivated the v-src gene product by a shift back up to 41°C, and allowed the cells to divide 20 times at 41°C. Although transcription of the globin genes was minimal after this treatment, the DNAase I-hypersensitive sites remained. The same sites can be induced by NaCI shock of cells. After the cells are returned to normal medium and allowed to grow for 20 doublings, the hypersensitive sites remain. This suggests that once formed, DNAase I-hypersensitive sites have the capacity to template their own structure independent of the initial “inductive” event. The single-stranded character of these DNAase I-hypersensitive sites could explain these results."
https://openalex.org/W2048404769,"We have compared the function of the human α-, β- and δ-globin genes using various plasmid expression vectors derived from pBR322. Amplification of recombinants occurred after their introduction, by calcium-phosphate-mediated DNA transfer, into monkey kidney cells that constitutively produce T antigen (COS cells). The human α-globin gene promoter functioned independently, but the β-globin gene promoter was nearly totally dependent on the enhancing activity of the 72 bp direct repeats from the SV40 genome. Furthermore, when the human α- and β-globin genes were linked in the same vector, the a promoter was active but the β promoter was not. Function of the δ-globin gene promoter also depended on the enhancer element. In vectors containing the 72 bp repeats and the β- or δ-globin gene, the activity of the β-globin gene was approximately 50 times greater than that of the β-globin gene, approximating the ratio of β and δ mRNA observed in normal human bone marrow cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062882442,"The tnpR gene product, resolvase, of the transposable element gamma delta mediates site-specific recombination between two copies of gamma delta directly repeated on the same replicon, and it negatively regulates transcription of the tnpA (transposase) gene and its own gene. The recombinational site, res, and the regulatory region both are located in the tnpA-tnpR intercistronic region. In studying the interaction of purified resolvase with DNA fragments derived from gamma delta and the related transposon, Tn3, that span this region, we have demonstrated that three sites specifically bind resolvase. Site I overlaps the recombinational crossover point and both transcriptional promoters. Sites II and III cover most of the DNA between the crossover point and the translational start of the tnpR gene. These are the only binding sites we have detected in a region of about 400 base pairs centered on the crossover point. Studies of cointegrates that contain only part of the region that binds resolvase indicate that site I is not sufficient for efficient site-specific recombination and suggest that all three sites are probably required."

https://openalex.org/W2055421163,"Receptors for maleylated or acetylated proteins as well as for α-2-macroglobulin-protease complexes on macrophages serve as scavengers by mediating the uptake of macromolecules from the extracellular compartment. Described in this report is a novel function of these receptors on macrophages: regulation of neutral protease secretion. The binding of maleylated bovine serum albumin to macrophages triggered secretion of three neutral proteases: neutral caseinases, plasminogen activator, and cytolytic proteinase. Release of acid phosphatase, however, was not induced. An important biological consequence of protease secretion by macrophages, tumor cytolysis, was also triggered by engagement of the receptor for maleylated bovine serum albumin. By contrast, the binding of α-2-macroglobulin-protease complexes to the macrophages suppressed secretion of all three proteases. Thus two receptors heretofore believed to serve principally as scavengers also regulate secretory functions of macrophages."

Characterization of the purified protein indicates that it is spectroscopically identical with cytochrome c oxidase isolated from beef heart. Preparations of isotopically substituted yeast cytochrome c oxidase are obtained incorporating [1,3-15N2]histidine or [beta,beta-2H2]cysteine. Electron paramagnetic resonance and electron nuclear double resonance spectra of the isotopically substituted proteins identify unambiguously at least 1 cysteine and 1 histidine as ligands to CuA and suggest that substantial spin density is delocalized onto a cysteine sulfur in the oxidized protein to render the site Cu(I)--S."
https://openalex.org/W1509019649,"Abstract The beta 1-adrenergic receptor of turkey erythrocytes has been purified by a combination of affinity and high performance steric exclusion chromatography. These procedures provide preparations with specific activities of greater than 15,000 pmol/mg of protein with an overall recovery of approximately 30% of the receptor activity solubilized from membrane preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radioiodinated purified receptor reveals two bands of labeled protein with apparent Mr = 40,000 +/- 2,000 and 45,000 +/- 3,000 in a 3-4:1 ratio. These same two peptides can also be labeled specifically and in approximately the same ration in both membranes and purified preparations using the photoaffinity probe 125I-labeled p-azidobenzylcarazolol. When the two purified polypeptides are completely separated by high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to detailed ligand binding studies, identical beta 1-adrenergic specificities are found for the two receptor forms. Preliminary characterization of these two proteins by partial protease digestion suggests a large degree of similarity between them, albeit with some significant differences. These results demonstrate that both purification and photoaffinity labeling identify two polypeptides in turkey erythrocyte membranes as containing a beta 1-adrenergic receptor binding site. The functional and structural relationships of these two forms of the receptor remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2037409464,A protein macromolecule in the cytosol of the unicellular eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae selectively binds the vertebrate estrogen hormone 17β-estradiol with high affinity. Lipid extracts of the yeast cells or the conditioned growth medium yield a substance that can bind competitively to the tritiated estradiol-binding sites in the yeast and to mammalian estrogen receptors. These findings suggest that the binding protein may be a primitive hormone receptor and that the lipid-extractable substance represents the endogenous ligand.
https://openalex.org/W2058342635,"The distribution of opiate receptors in the cerebral cortex of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was determined by autoradiographic visualization of [3H]naloxone binding to tissue sections. Naloxone was bound in relatively large amounts to the cortical laminae containing the cell bodies of output neurons, to a varying set of additional laminae in different cortical fields, to fields closer to more primitive types of cortex, and to polysensory cortical fields. From these laminar and areal variations in distribution, it appears that opiate receptors play a role in specific aspects of cortical function."
https://openalex.org/W1506436196,"Incorporation of the saxitoxin receptor of the sodium channel solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified 250-fold from rat brain into phosphatidylcholine vesicles is described. Fifty to 80% of the saxitoxin receptor sites are recovered in the reconstituted vesicles (KD = 3 nM). Unlike the detergent-solubilized saxitoxin receptor, the reconstituted saxitoxin binding activity is stable to incubation at 36 degrees C. Approximately 75% of the reconstituted saxitoxin receptor sites are externally oriented and 25% are inside-out. The initial rate of 22Na+ uptake into reconstituted vesicles is increased up to 3- to 4-fold by veratridine with a K0.5 of 11 microM. Seventy per cent of this increase is blocked by external tetrodotoxin (TTX) with a Ki of 10 nM. All of the veratridine-stimulated 22Na+ uptake is blocked when TTX is present on both sides of the vesicle membrane, or when tetracaine is added to the external medium. The apparent binding constants for veratridine, saxitoxin, and TTX are essentially identical to those in intact rat brain synaptosomes. The results demonstrate reconstitution of sodium transport, as well as neurotoxin binding and action, from substantially purified sodium channel preparations."

https://openalex.org/W2058789118,"The white-ivory (wi) mutation, an unstable allele of the white locus in Drosophila, reverts to wild-type at frequencies of 5 X 10(-5) in homozygous females, and 5 X 10(-6) in males and deletion heterozygous females. We show by molecular cloning and Southern blot analysis of DNA from wi flies that a 2.9 kilobase tandem duplication within the white locus is responsible for the mutation. Phenotypic reversion appears, in most cases, to be due to an exact excision of the extra copy of the sequence. Two derivative alleles of wi, one phenotypically wild-type, the other a partial revertant, carry insertions of moderately repetitive DNA from outside the locus, in addition to suffering deletions of some white locus DNA. Earlier genetic data preclude unequal crossing-over between homologs as an explanation for the precise reversions. Rather, an intrachromosomal meiotic event seems to be responsible. Our results suggest that intrachromosomal recombination may be responsible in other systems for a larger number of rearrangements than has been suspected, and that interallelic recombination frequencies in Drosophila do not always correlate in a simple way with DNA length or extent of homology."

https://openalex.org/W1983255104,"Opiate-mediated analgesia at the spinal level is thought to involve opiates binding to opiate receptors on primary afferent terminals1–3 resulting in a selective depression of neurotransmitter release4–9. Multiple opiate receptor types have been distinguished11–22 and µ - and δ -opiate receptors, originally described by Kosterlitz et al.17,18,22, have been demonstrated on primary afferent terminals1 but the correspondence of these opiate receptors to opiate-mediated depression of transmitter release is unclear. However, opiates binding to receptors present on individual somata of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones in dissociated cell culture have been reported to reduce the duration and amplitude of calcium-dependent action potentials8,10. Therefore these opiate receptors might have a function similar to those on primary afferent terminals where a decrease in calcium entry would be correlated with a decrease in transmitter release23,24. We have now studied the response of DRG neurones to opiate agonists with different affinity for μ- or δ-receptors and our results suggest that both receptor types can mediate decrease in somatic calcium-dependent action potentials but that there is a variable proportion of µ- and δ-receptors on DRG neurones."

https://openalex.org/W1850149476,"When intact mouse neuroblastoma NB cells were incubated with choleragen at 4 degrees C, washed, and incubated at 37 degrees C, activation of adenylate cyclase occurred rapidly after a delay of 15 min. The cells were incubated under the same conditions with 125I-labeled toxin, lysed, and solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate under mild conditions. Soluble proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of dithiol reductants to separate labeled toxin products. Initially, only 0.1 to 0.2% of the cell-associated radioactivity migrated on the gels as the A1 peptide of choleragen. After a 15-min delay, the amount of A1 peptide increased rapidly with time and paralleled the activation of adenylate cyclase. Similar results were observed with human skin fibroblasts, Friend erythroleukemic cells, and II3-alpha-N-acetylneuraminosyl-gangliotetraosylceramide-treated rat glioma C6 cells. When toxin-treated NB cells were incubated at increasing temperatures, generation of A1 peptide and activation of adenylate cyclase increased in parallel. Both processes were prevented by incubation of cells at 4 or at 37 degrees C in the presence of anticholeragen antibodies. These results indicate that there is delay both in the formation of A1 peptide and in the activation of adenylase cyclase in intact cells. As A1 is believed to be the catalytically active component of choleragen, it is suggested that the lag period may be related in part to the time required to generate A1 peptide from choleragen."
https://openalex.org/W1517807315,"Specific receptors for fibrinogen can be induced on platelets by a variety of stimuli. In this study, two independent approaches have implicated the D domain of fibrinogen in its interaction with the platelet. Immunochemically purified Fab fragments of anti-fibrinogen and anti-D inhibited 125I-fibrinogen binding to platelets in a dose-dependent fashion and platelet aggregation. In contrast, Fab fragments of anti-E produced only a slight inhibition of fibrinogen binding and nonimmune Fab fragments had no effect. Fibrinogen was digested with plasmin in the presence of 5 mM calcium and fragment D and E of Mr 100,000 and 50,000, respectively, were isolated. This D fragment inhibited 125I-fibrinogen binding to platelets in a concentration-dependent fashion, whereas the E fragment was ineffective. With 125I-fibrinogen at 0.17 microM, nonlabeled fibrinogen inhibited binding by 50% at 0.7 microM, whereas 170 microM fragment D was required to produce 50% inhibition. D fragment of Mr 80,000, generated in the absence of calcium, was noninhibitory. These observations provide strong evidence for the participation of the D domain in the binding of fibrinogen by its platelet receptor and suggest that the recognition site is lost in the conversion of the Mr 100,000 to 80,000 D species."

https://openalex.org/W1889982770,"Poliovirus replicase can be isolated in a form which depends on either oligo(U) or on a host cell protein for the initiation of copying of poliovirion (plus strand) RNA. The product of replicase reactions--initiated either with host factor or with oligo(U)--includes full length (35 S) RNA molecules, largely in double-stranded form, which contain the ribonuclease T1-resistant oligonucleotides of the poliovirus minus strand. For the oligo(U)-stimulated reaction, it is shown that the oligo(U) primer is covalently associated with full length product at its 5'-end. For either the host factor- or oligo(U)-dependent reactions, full length molecules appear only after 15 min of synthesis. The fraction of 35 S product is increased by raising the concentration of the limiting nucleoside triphosphate. The reaction is inhibited by as little as 100 mM salt, although it is stimulated by low (20 mM) salt concentrations. Zinc stimulates overall synthesis, but not the rate of appearance of full length molecules; the reaction is inhibited by agents which chelate zinc. Although synthesis of full length products occurs much more slowly than in the infected cell, this soluble system appears to mimic quite faithfully the initial steps of poliovirus replication."

A single protein of apparent Mr = approximately 67,000 daltons and pI 6.3 is associated with this host activity. Poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography of the template-dependent replicase isolated from poliovirus-infected cells results in the complete loss of replicase activity if a salt gradient is used to develop the column. Host factor elutes early in the salt gradient and restores replicase activity to protein fractions eluted later in the gradient.

In contrast, treatment of cultured fetal testes with gonadotropins and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate enhanced steroidogenic responsiveness and did not cause the luteinizing hormone-receptor loss and desensitization that is characteristic of the adult gonad. The analysis of gonadotropin receptors and action in cultured fetal testis cells facilitates developmental studies of gonadal function, and has revealed significant differences in the responses of fetal and adult Leydig cells to gonadotropic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2159037798,"We describe a novel type of transposon in the tetracycline resistance plasmid pYM103, a derivative of pSC101 carrying a single copy of an insertion element IS102. The new transposons we found were identified as DNA segments, approximately 6 kb (Tn1021) and 10 kb (Tn1022) in length, able to mediate the cointegration of pYM103 with plasmid Col E1. The resulting cointegrate contains either of these pYM103 segments duplicated in a direct orientation at the junctions of the parent plasmids. A direct duplication of a 9 bp sequence at the target site in Col E1 is found at the junctions for cointegration. Both transposons have IS102 at one end and also contain different lengths of the pYM103 DNA adjacent to IS102, including the tetracycline resistance gene. Each transposon contains terminal inverted repeats of a short nucleotide sequence. These results and the fact that IS102 can itself mediate plasmid cointegration, giving rise to a duplication of a 9 bp target sequence, indicate that IS102 is responsible for generation of Tn1021 and Tn1022. They are quite different from the common IS-associated transposons, which are always flanked by two copies of an IS element, and may be similar to transposons such as those of the Tn3 family and phage Mu."

This process yields normal circular viral minichromosomes containing the four core histones and traces of the capsid proteins at pH values higher than 8.5. However, when carried out at pH 7.5, this procedure yields nucleoprotein complexes that contain both histones and the viral structural proteins. These pH 7.5 complexes appear as circular structures with a mean of 93 +/- 17 beads with a diameter of 7 nm and no visible nucleosomes when observed by electron microscopy. In contrast to the compaction of the viral DNA in minichromosomes, the length of these beaded structures is roughly the same as free DNA. We suggest that VP1, the major capsid protein, can act as a nucleosome unfolding agent in neutral pH and low ionic strength."

This cellular response to cAMP was developmentally regulated. It was first detected in 3 1/2-h starved cells and appeared to persist throughout the aggregation phase of the cells' life cycle. pP47 phosphorylation was specifically induced by cAMP in that amoebae did not respond to stimulation with 5'-AMP, folic acid, Ca2+, and/or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. cGMP could elicit pP47 phosphorylation but only at high concentrations. Phosphorylation of pP47 in response to cAMP occurred rapidly (within 5 s). The length of time for which it remained phosphorylated depended upon the concentration of the stimulus. With 10(-6) M cAMP, pP47 was phosphorylated for less than 4 min. If amoebae were stimulated with 10(-4) M cAMP, over 30 min were necessary before pP47 was dephosphorylated. Once dephosphorylated, pP47 could again be phosphorylated upon reapplication of the cAMP stimulus."

It binds to an hydrophobic region of the catalytic site with a KD = 6 microM. Time emission anisotropy measurements yielded a rotational correlation time of 38 ns for the bound inhibitor. N-Dansyl-2-oxopyrrolidine is immobilized by strong interactions with the nucleotide binding site. Protein fluorescence quenching was used to determine the dissociation constants of the diastereomers of ATP beta S. Both diastereomers bind with a dissociation constant KD = 25 microM. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for the pyridoxal kinase reaction were determined for ATP and the diastereomers of ATP beta S in the presence of Mg(II), Co(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II). With Mg(II), pyridoxal kinase exhibits stereoselectivity for the A diastereomer of ATP beta S, Vmax ratio, A/B = 30. In the presence of Cd(II), the stereoselectivity is reversed and the B diastereomer of ATP beta S is the preferred substrate. As the divalent cations were varied in the series Mg(II), Co(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II), the A/B ratio was progressively lowered to the value of 0.2 found for Cd(II). These data indicate that the divalent cations coordinate to the beta-phosphate group of the nucleoside triphosphate substrates. The results obtained with the diastereomers of ATP alpha S suggest that pyridoxal kinase uses the divalent cation, delta,beta,gamma-bidentate nucleotide chelate as substrate."

This anomalous behavior occurs even under conditions of high ionic strength (1 M salt), indicating that the absence of binding is not due to generalized repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate groups of 2'-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5'-AMP and the negatively charged boronate sites of the resin. Despite the lack of boronate binding the presence of a chemically functional cis-diol group in 2'-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5'-AMP was verified by quantitative periodate oxidation. Subsequent dephosphorylation rendered the cis-diol in ribosyladenosine accessible to binding to the boronate sites; therefore, one or both of the phosphate groups sterically interfere with complexation of the cis-diol with boronate. Computer model-building studies based on NMR data implicate the 5'-phosphate group of the molecule, is located sterically near the cis-diol group, inhibiting the complex formation with boronate."
