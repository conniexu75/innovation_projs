https://openalex.org/W2047762243,"The tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of the soil microorganism Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the agent of crown gall disease in dicotyledonous plants. The Ti plasmid contains two regions that are essential for the production of transformed cells. One of these regions, termed transfer DNA, induces tumor formation and is found in all established plant tumor lines; the other, termed the virulence region, is essential for the formation but not the maintenance of tumors. Transfer DNA, which transfers to the plant genomes in a somewhat predictable manner, can be increased in size by the insertion of foreign DNA without its transferring ability being affected. The tumor-causing genes can be removed so that they no longer interfere with normal plant growth and differentiation. This modified Ti plasmid can thus be used as a vector for the transfer of foreign genes into plants."

The new observations confirm the existence of a sharply defined transition zone, probably worldwide in extent, at a depth of approximately 650 kilometers. These data are shown to be a useful tool for the study of upper mantle structure on a global basis."

Total nitrogen and total carbon contents of individual chondrites do not show a positive correlation."
https://openalex.org/W2041235863,Silicate melts were equilibrated with aqueous chloride solutions at temperatures between 770 degrees and 880 degrees C and a total pressure of 1.4 to 2.4 kilobars. The ratio of potassium to sodium in the aqueous phase was (0.74 +/- 0.06) times the corresponding ratio in the coexisting melt over the entire range of temperature and pressure for all chloride concentrations between 0.2 and 4.2 moles per kilogram.

We have searched for the 111.54-megahertz transition [F (total angular momentum quantum number) = 2 → 2] and for the 111.22-megahertz transition (F = 1 → 1) in the galactic radio source W49, one of the brightest hydroxyl emission sources. No sulfur hydride emission lines with half-power widths of 130 hertz or greater were detected with the 1000-foot Arecibo antenna. The upper limits established with 100-hertz filters were 50 and 60 flux units (1 flux unit= 1026 watt meter-2 hertz-1), respectively, for the two lines."

The latter alternative must be the one chosen, not only on account of the vastness of the material, but chiefly that personal experience may give some value to the presentation. In the present address, therefore, certain limitations become necessary, and in this case they are very natural. In the first place, it would be presumptuous in me to inelude zoology in any review of progress, for botanists, as a rule, are strietly limited by their material, and have never confounded botanywith biology. It is true that such subjects as morphology and physiology are not to be limited by any barrier that may be set up between plants and animals, but it is also true that the material and literature with which one is familiar do not often cross this barrier. At the saine time, I think it must be recognized that botany and zoology have been mutually stimulating, every real advance in the one having given an impetus to the other, and that, as a consequence, their progress has been largely along parallel lines. Hence a review of any phase of the progress of the one may serve as an indieation of the progress of the other."
