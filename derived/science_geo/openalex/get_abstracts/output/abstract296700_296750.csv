https://openalex.org/W1977060926,Photochemically generated benzyl radicals react with C(60) producing radical and nonradical adducts Rn C(60) (R = C(6)H(5)CH(2)) with n = 1 to at least 15. The radical adducts with n = 3 and 5 are stable above 50 degrees C and have been identified by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy as the allylic R(3)C(60)(.) (3) and cyclopentadienyl R(5)C(60)(.) (5) radicals. The unpaired electrons are highly localized on the C(60) surface. The extraordinary stability of these radicals can be attributed to the steric protection of the surface radical sites by the surrounding benzyl substituents. Photochemically generated methyl radicals also add readily to C(60). Mass spectrometric analyses show the formation of (CH(3))nC(60) with n = 1 to at least 34.

Nevertheless, little is known about the quantitative improvements that result from cooperation. A number of experimental results are presented on constraint satisfaction that both test the predictions of a theory of cooperative problem solving and assess the value of cooperation for this class of problems. These experiments suggest an alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial intelligence."

These changes have been computed parametrically for mixing fractions of water vapor between 3 x 10(-6) and 6.5 x 10(-6). With added water from the exhausts of projected fleets of stratospheric aircraft, the ozone column may diminish by 3.8 percent, the transmitted solar power increase by 0.07 percent, and the surface temperature rise by 0.04 degrees K in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to a cancellation of terms, temperatures in the lower stratosphere remain essentially unchanged. These results are sensitive to the form of the water profile and emphasize the potential role of convective transients near 30 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2060389604,Sexual dimorphism in the second antennae of the amphipod Gammarus duebeni Lilljeborg is connected with the reception in the male of a female sex pheromone transported through the water. Investigations on tritium-labeled specimens were carried out with scintillator and autoradiographic techniques.
https://openalex.org/W1994362003,The past cool decade over the eastern United States is attributed to increased deployment of polar air masses set in motion by responses of the upper-air wind circulation of the Northern Hemisphere to large-scale air-sea coupling over the North Pacific.

The vector (pole) is located at 52.5 degrees N, 34 degrees W and has a magnitude (opening rate) of 5.7 x 10(-7) degree per year. Major changes in either the pole location or the opening rate are not evident for the last 40 million years."
