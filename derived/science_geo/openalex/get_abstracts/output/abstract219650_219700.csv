Although the biological mechanisms of these adverse effects are unknown, emerging data suggest a key role for oxidative stress. Ambient PM and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) contain redox cycling organic chemicals that induce pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects in the lung. These responses are suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which directly complexes to electrophilic DEP chemicals and exert additional antioxidant effects at the cellular level. A proteomics approach was used to study DEP-induced responses in the macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. We demonstrate that in the dose range 10–100 μg/ml, organic DEP extracts induce a progressive decline in the cellular GSH/GSSG ratio, in parallel with a linear increase in newly expressed proteins on the two-dimensional gel. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, 32 newly induced/NAC-suppressed proteins were identified. These include antioxidant enzymes (e.g. heme oxygenase-1 and catalase), pro-inflammatory components (e.g. p38MAPK and Rel A), and products of intermediary metabolism that are regulated by oxidative stress. Heme oxygenase-1 was induced at low extract dose and with minimal decline in the GSH/GSSG ratio, whereas MAP kinase activation required a higher chemical dose and incremental levels of oxidative stress. Moreover, at extract doses >50 μg/ml, there is a steep decline in cellular viability. These data suggest that DEP induce a hierarchical oxidative stress response in which some of these proteins may serve as markers for oxidative stress during PM exposures.

Even though the relative risks are small, there is considerable public health concern because of the large number of exposed people and the existence of high risk groups. People suffering from asthma constitute a susceptible group, as exemplified by acute symptomatic flares after a sudden surge in ambient PM levels (3.Pope C.A. Dockery D.W. Holgate S. Koren H.S.

In addition to these short term effects, animal and human studies conducted with diesel exhaust particles (DEP) as a model air pollutant showed that these particles can enhance allergen-specific IgE production and airway allergic inflammation in parallel with increased Th2 cytokine production (5.Nel A.E.

Although the biological hypotheses for the mechanisms of PM action are just beginning to develop (15.National Research Council Committee on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter: I. Immediate Priorities and a Long-range Research Portfolio. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1998Google Scholar), most of the limited mechanistic data generated to date suggest that oxidative stress is a key biological event in causing the adverse health effects of ambient PM (5.Nel A.E.

Med. 1997; 22: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). How does ambient PM induce oxidative stress? When exposed to intact DEP or organic extracts made from these particles, macrophages and epithelial cells respond by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (16.Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P. Li N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is known that DEP and ambient PM contain transition metals (21.Carter J.D. Samet J.M. Devlin R.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 146: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 22.Ghio A.J. Dailey L.A. Carter J.D. Inhal. Toxicol. 1999; 11: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as well as redox cycling organic components that elicit ROS production in various cellular locations (19.Li N. Kim S. Wang M. Froines J. Sioutas C. Nel A. Inhal. Toxicol. 2002; 14: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23.Schuetzle D. Lee F.S. Prater T.J. Int. J. Environ. Anal.

Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). For instance, organic DEP extracts induce superoxide production in lung microsomes through the action of NADPH-dependent P450 reductase (20.Kumagai Y. Arimoto T. Shinyashiki M. Shimojo N. Nakai Y. Yoshikawa T. Sagai M. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), as well as through damage to the mitochondrial inner membrane (16.Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P. Li N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J.

Perspect. 2003; 111: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). DEP contain a large number of organic chemical compounds among which the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitro-derivatives of PAH, oxygenated PAH derivatives (ketones, quinones, diones), heterocyclic organic compounds, aldehydes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons are the most abundant (23.Schuetzle D. Lee F.S. Prater T.J. Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem. 1981; 9: 93-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 24.Cohen A.J. Nikula K. Holgate, S.T. Koren H.S. Samet J.M. Maynard R.L.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have shown that there is a good correlation between the induction of oxidative stress and PAH content of ambient PM (19.Li N. Kim S. Wang M. Froines J. Sioutas C. Nel A. Inhal. Toxicol. 2002; 14: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25.Li N. Sioutas C. Cho A. Schmitz D. Misra C. Sempf J. Wang M. Oberley T. Froines J. Nel A. Environ. Health. Perspect. 2003; 111: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Another chemical group that needs to be considered is quinones (27.Monks T.J. Hanzlik R.P. Cohen G.M. Ross D. Graham D.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 112: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 28.Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Hung C.F. McCoull K.D. Palackal N.T. Tsuruda L.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Chemical derivatization of quinones diminished the effect of organic DEP extracts on superoxide production in lung microsomal preparations (20.Kumagai Y. Arimoto T. Shinyashiki M. Shimojo N. Nakai Y. Yoshikawa T. Sagai M. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that polar chemical groups, fractionated from DEP and enriched in quinones, act as potent inducers of oxidative stress in macrophages and epithelial cells (26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29.Li N. Wang M. Oberley T.D. Sempf J.M. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4531-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition to being produced by the fuel combustion process, quinones are also generated during enzymatic conversion of PAH in the lung, including their conversion by cytochrome P450 1A1 (28.Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Hung C.F. McCoull K.D. Palackal N.T. Tsuruda L.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 30.Takano H. Yanagisawa R. Ichinose T. Sadakane K. Inoue K. Yoshida S. Takeda K. Yoshino S. Yoshikawa T. Morita M. Arch. Toxicol. 2002; 76: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although much remains to be learned about the role of oxidative stress in PM-induced adverse health effects, we have demonstrated that organic DEP extracts induce a wide range of biological effects in epithelial cells and macrophages (16.Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P. Li N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 146: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This includes the induction of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects, which can be suppressed by the thiol agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (16.Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P. Li N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Whitekus M.J. Li N. Zhang M. Wang M. Horwitz M.A. Nelson S.K. Horwitz L.D. Brechun N. Diaz-Sanchez D. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2560-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These pro-inflammatory effects include the production of cytokines and chemokines (13.Diaz-Sanchez D. Tsien A. Fleming J. Saxon A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2406-2413PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Diaz-Sanchez D. Jyrala M. Ng D. Nel A. Saxon A. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas the cytotoxicity depends on the perturbation of mitochondrial function (16.Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P. Li N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 4531-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This includes disruption of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase 9 activation (17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition to these harmful effects, organic DEP components have also been shown to induce cytoprotective responses, including the expression of an antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Based on these diverse effects, we have postulated that DEP may induce a hierarchy of oxidative stress effects, which range from cytoprotective to injurious (19.Li N. Kim S. Wang M. Froines J. Sioutas C. Nel A. Inhal. Toxicol. 2002; 14: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J.

Proteomics. 2001; 1: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We used this approach to test the premise of an incremental oxidative stress response in RAW 264.7 cells during exposure to organic DEP extracts. Our data show that methanol DEP extracts induce a linear increase in newly expressed proteins, >50% of which are suppressed by NAC. We have subjected 32 of these proteins to mass spectrometry, and used select candidates to show that there is a difference in the dose-response kinetics of antioxidant versus pro-inflammatory proteins. These results support the existence of a hierarchical oxidative stress model. Reagents—Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. DEP, collected from a low duty engine, was generously provided by Dr. Masaru Sagai (National Institute of Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan) (20.Kumagai Y. Arimoto T. Shinyashiki M. Shimojo N.

Eighty μg of total lysate protein was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To determine HO-1 (26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A.

DEP was collected on high capacity glass fiber filters, from which the scraped particles were stored as a powder in a glass container under nitrogen gas. The particles consist of aggregates in which individual particles are <1 μm in diameter. The chemical composition of these particles, including PAH and quinone analysis, has been described previously (26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Methanol extraction of DEP was performed as described previously (17.Hiura T.S. Li N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of DEP were suspended in 25 ml of methanol and sonicated for 2 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 425 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant transferred to a preweighed Eppendorf tube to determine the amount of extractable material. After drying under nitrogen gas, the dried material was completely dissolved in Me2SO and aliquots saved at -80 °C in the dark until use. Cellular Stimulation with DEP Extracts—RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in complete medium, which consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. For cellular stimulation, 2 × 106 cells in 3 ml of culture medium were treated with the indicated amounts of the DEP extract in 6-well culture plates for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Control cultures received 0.1% of the Me2SO carrier. Some cultures received 20 mm NAC from a 1 m stock made in HEPES buffer immediately before use. NAC was added independently prior to, concomitant with or following the addition of the DEP extract as indicated. To determine whether NAC interacts directly with electrophilic chemicals in the extract, we premixed 10 mg of NAC with 1 mg of the DEP extract in a small volume (50 μl). This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h before addition to the cell culture at a final extract concentration of 10–50 μg/ml, while limiting the NAC concentration in the medium to 61.5 μm. The controls consisted of cells receiving DEP chemicals only, or 20 mm NAC added to the culture medium for 2 h prior to the addition of the DEP extract at the indicated concentrations. The cells were harvested 6 h later and used for HO-1 immunoblotting as described previously (26.Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Determination of Cellular GSH/GSSG Ratios—Total glutathione (GSH plus GSSG) and GSSG were measured in a recycling assay that uses 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and glutathione reductase (39.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed and deproteinized in 3% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Whole cell lysates were cleared at 4 °C by centrifugation at 20,800 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant was used to measure total and oxidized glutathione. Total glutathione was read from a GSH standard curve, prepared in 5-sulfosalicylic acid. For the GSSG assay, 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with 2 μl of 2-vinylpyridine and 6 μl of triethanolamine for 60 min on ice. GSSG standards were treated in the same way, and the GSSG content of the samples was calculated from a GSSG standard curve. Reduced GSH was calculated by subtracting GSSG from total glutathione. Determining Cell Viability by Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—Cells (3 × 106) were plated into 3.5-cm plates in 3 ml of medium and rested for 4 h. Some cultures were preincubated with 20 mm NAC for 2 h. Varying concentrations of DEP were added to these cultures for 18 h. Cells were collected, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 500 μlof PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml PI for 5 min. Cells were analyzed in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) equipped with a single 488-nm argon laser. Dead cell fragments were gated out by forward and side scatter, and PI analysis was performed at excitation and emission settings of 488 and 575 nm, respectively. Protein Extraction and Sample Preparation—Aliquots of 2 × 107 RAW 264.7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors and sonicated in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture set III (100 mm AEBSF, 80 μm aprotinin, 5 mm bestatin, 1.5 mm E-64, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (200 mm imidazole, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 115 mm sodium molybdate, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 400 mm sodium tartrate dihydrate) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 10 s. Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. To remove the salt from the lysates, the supernatant proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v), 20 mm DTT for 30 min on ice. The precipitate was collected at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 20 mm DTT. Trichloroacetic acid in the precipitate was removed through the extraction with diethyl ether or acetone plus 10 mm DTT. After drying, the pellet was resuspended by sonication in a buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% w/v CHAPS, 100 mm DTT, 0.2% v/v Bio-Lyte pH 3/10:4/6:5/8 (1:0.5:0.5), 5% glycerol, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (mixture sets II and III). After standing for 1 h at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged at 23,800 × g for 10 min at 15 °C, and the supernatants stored at -80 °C until use for two-dimensional PAGE. Protein concentration in these samples was estimated by using a commercial Bradford kit (DC reagent kit, Bio-Rad), and bovine serum albumin as standard. Two-dimensional P"
https://openalex.org/W1968677875,"It is unknown why sustained elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone resorption, whereas intermittent administration stimulates bone formation. We show in mice that daily injections of PTH attenuate osteoblast apoptosis, thereby increasing osteoblast number, bone formation rate, and bone mass, but do not affect osteoclast number. In contrast, sustained elevation of PTH, achieved either by infusion or by raising endogenous hormone secretion with a calcium-deficient diet, does not affect osteoblast apoptosis but increases osteoclast number. Attenuation of apoptosis by PTH in cultured osteoblastic cells requires protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad as well as transcription of survival genes, like Bcl-2, mediated by CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and Runx2. But, PTH also increases proteasomal proteolysis of Runx2. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of PTH is prolonged by inhibition of proteasomal activity, by overexpressing a dominant negative form of the E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) that targets Runx2 for degradation (Smurf1), or by overexpressing Runx2 itself. The duration of the anti-apoptotic effect of PTH, thus, depends on the level of Runx2, which in turn is decreased by PTH via Smurf1-mediated proteasomal proteolysis. The self-limiting nature of PTH-induced survival signaling might explain why intermittent administration of the hormone is required for bone anabolism.

The self-limiting nature of PTH-induced survival signaling might explain why intermittent administration of the hormone is required for bone anabolism. Cyclic activation of cell surface receptors often leads to a different biologic response than sustained activation. A classic example is the stimulation of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone production by pituitary gonadotroph cells in response to pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) versus the inhibition of hormone production by continuous GnRH treatment (1.Belchetz P.E. Plant T.M. Nakai Y. Keogh E.J. Knobil E. Science. 1978; 202: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar).

Indeed, chronic elevation of the hormone as in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism stimulates bone resorption leading to bone loss (2.Guo C.Y. Thomas W.E.G. al-Dehaimi A.W. Assiri A.M.A. Eastell R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3.Slatopolsky E. Brown A. Dusso A. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1999; 73: 14-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In contrast, intermittent administration of PTH stimulates new bone formation by increasing osteoblast number (4.Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Heretofore, a mechanistic explanation for the dependence of this effect on repeated transient increases in PTH has remained unknown. Albeit, intermittent PTH administration by daily injections was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as the first form of osteoporosis therapy that increases bone mass de novo, reverses the bone deficit, and dramatically reduces the incidence of fractures (5.Neer R.M. Arnaud C.D. Zanchetta J.R. Prince R. Gaich G.A. Reginster J.Y. Hodsman A.B. Eriksen E.F. Ish-Shalom S. Genant H.K. Wang O. Mitlak B.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3816) Google Scholar).We had previously shown that daily injections of PTH to mice for 28 days reduces the prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis and increases the number of osteoblasts (6.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), providing an explanation for the increase in bone formation rate and bone mineral density (BMD) seen with intermittent PTH administration. In the studies reported herein we show that in contrast to daily injections, sustained elevation of PTH in mice does not reduce the prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis but, as expected, stimulates osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we show that the anti-apoptotic effect of PTH requires runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2)-mediated transcription of survival genes like Bcl-2 and is short-lived because PTH itself also stimulates the proteasomal degradation of Runx2 (also known as Cbfa1, Osf2, Aml3, and PEBP2αA). The self-limiting nature of PTH-induced survival signaling suggests a mechanistic explanation for the necessity of intermittent administration to elicit the bone anabolic properties of this hormone.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Studies—Female Swiss-Webster mice (4–6 months old, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were maintained and used in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Arkansas School for Medical Sciences and the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System approved the animal protocols. Mice were fed standard rodent diet (Agway RMH 3000; Arlington Heights, IL) containing 22% protein, 0.97% calcium, and 0.85% phosphorus. The age of the animals used in each experiment varied by 2 weeks or less, and mice with a body weight 10% higher or lower than the mean of the group were excluded.Mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of human PTH-(1–34), human PTH-(1–84) (Bachem California, Inc., Torrance, CA) or vehicle (0.9% saline, 0.01 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% acetic acid) as described (6.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mice were infused with PTH-(1–84) using 3- or 7-day micro-osmotic pumps delivering hormone at 1 or 0.5 μl/h, respectively (Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA). Pumps were implanted into an inter-scapular subcutaneous pocket under Metaphane anesthesia as previously described (7.Grey A. Mitnick M.A. Masiukiewicz U. Sun B.H. Rudikoff S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Insogna K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There was no effect of PTH administration whether by injection or infusion on body weight (not shown). In the experiments shown in Fig. 1c, untreated mice were used as controls in view of evidence that injected vehicle had no effect on the skeleton (Fig. 1b), and our previous studies showing that infused vehicle had no effect on the level of serum pyridinoline cross-links (7.Grey A.

To elevate endogenous PTH, 5-month-old C57Bl/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were fed a diet containing 0.01% calcium and 0.45% phosphorous (#960177, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Preliminary studies showed that the circulating level of PTH-(1–84) was elevated from a base-line value of 12 ± 7 to 44 ± 20 pg/ml (n = 6, p < 0.01 by paired t test) 1 day after placing the mice on the calcium-deficient diet. Tetracycline HCl (30 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) was given 6 and 2 days before sacrifice in some experiments to permit measurement of bone formation rate.BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorption using a QDR 2000 Plus densitometer (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA) adapted for measurement of murine skeletal subregions with the aid of customized software developed by Hologic for use with mice. Resolution was enhanced by increasing the line spacing and using a smaller collimator. Sensitivity was increased by reducing the scan speed (8.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Takahashi K. Parfitt A.M.

Serum was obtained by retroorbital bleeding for measurement of osteocalcin by radioimmunoassay (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), total calcium by colorimetric determination (Sigma), pyridinoline cross-links by enzyme immunoassay (Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA), or murine PTH-(1–84) or human PTH-(1–84) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immunotopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA). Lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4) and femurs were embedded in methyl methacrylate. Histomorphometric analysis of undecalcified bone sections and detection of apoptotic osteoblasts by in situ nick-end labeling was performed as previously described (9.Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L.

Calvaria cells from Bcl-2-deficient mice and wild-type siblings were prepared from neonatal mice from our breeding colony of B6;129S2-Bcl2tm1Sjk heterozygotes (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). The genotype of each mouse was established by the presence of neo and Bcl2 sequences by PCR of tail genomic DNA and confirmed by Western blotting of calvaria cell lysates. OB-6 cells harboring the rTA(TET-OFF) protein were infected with a tetracycline-regulated retroviral construct to conditionally express dominant negative (dn) Runx2 (16.Fu Q. Jilka R.L.

The latter was used in experiments involving expression constructs wherein cells were co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein containing a nuclear localization sequence (nGFP) to permit assessment of nuclear morphology in fluorescent cells. Apoptotic cells were defined as those exhibiting nuclear fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation, a sine qua non feature of programmed cell death. Because apoptosis is only determined in the transfected cells, this approach has the advantage of being independent of differences in the efficiency of transfection among experiments and eliminates the contribution of untransfected cells that would otherwise mask the effect of the construct being studied. At least 225 transfected cells were evaluated, and the identity of the samples was unknown to the person scoring the live and dead cells. Experiments were repeated at least once and assessed by a different blinded reader. Critical findings were confirmed by in situ nick-end labeling, measurement of caspase-3 activity, or immunodetection of active caspase-3 as described in Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Fig. 1. H89, dibutyryl-cAMP (DBA), and RpcAMP were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and neutralizing antibodies to interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), α-cyano-(3-methoxy,4-hydroxy,5-iodo)cinnamoyl-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl) ketone tyrphostin (AG538), lactacystin, and Z-E(Ot-Bu)AL-pNA from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, actinomycin and etoposide from Sigma, and PD98059 from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). IGF binding protein 4 was a gift from S. Mohan (Loma Linda Veterans Affairs Medical Center).Data are presented as % dead cells or as % of stimulus-induced apoptosis in the absence of PTH or DBA. The latter was calculated using the formula (% DCA+P – % DCP)/(% DCA – % DCV) × 100, where DC = dead cells, A = death-inducing agent, P = PTH or DBA, and V = vehicle. The value of %DCA – % DCV was designated as 100%. The S.D. of the % of stimulus-induced apoptosis value was calculated by combining the S.D. values of the components of the equation as previously described (18.Kendall M. Kendalls' Advanced Theory of Statistics. Oxford University Press, New York1987: 324-325Google Scholar). None of the pharmacologic agents or expression constructs affected basal cell viability, except as noted in the legend of Fig. 7.Fig. 7The duration of the anti-apoptotic effect of PTH is limited by PTH-induced proteasomal degradation of Runx2.a, OB-6 cells were treated with vehicle, lactacystin (10 μm), or the proteasome activator Z-E(Ot-Bu)AL-pNA (100 μm) for 30 min followed by the addition of 50 nm PTH. After 1 h, etoposide was added, and apoptosis was evaluated by trypan blue staining 6 or 24 h later. b and d–g, OB-6 cells transfected with the indicated constructs (along with nGFP) were treated with PTH followed by the addition of etoposide. Nuclear morphology of fluorescent cells was determined 6 or 24 h later. Basal apoptosis was increased to ∼20% in cells transfected with dn Bad and treated with lactacystin and in cells cotransfected with dn Bad and dn Smurf1, as compared with 5% in cells transfected with vector or the other constructs. An additional 15% of the cells were killed by etoposide in all conditions.

Bcl-2 mRNA was quantified by TaqMan by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Murine Bcl-2 mRNA was amplified with 5′-GCGACTTCGCCGAGATGT-3′ and 5′-CACCACCGTGGCAAAGC-3′ and detected with labeled 5′-ACCTGACGCCCTTCA-3′. Murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified with 5′-ATGTCGTGGAGTCTACTGGTGTCTT-3′ and 5′-TTGGCTCCACCCTTCAAGTG-3′ and detected with labeled 5′-CACCACCATGGAGAAG-3′. The expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA was calculated relative to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the value 2 to the power of the negative value of the difference between the threshold cycles for Bcl-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification.

Cells were transiently co-transfected with the gene of interest and nGFP using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) (12.Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K.

The efficiency of transfection was 40–60% as determined by the number of cells labeled with nGFP.Western Blot Analysis—Rabbit anti-phospho-155Ser-Bad antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and rabbit anti-Runx2 antibody from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). All other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell lysates were obtained as described previously (17.Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) and separated in an 8–10% SDS gel followed by immunoblotting with the relevant antibody and development by enhanced chemiluminescence. The intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms was quantified by densitometry. To detect ubiquitinated Runx2, cells were lysed in standard buffer (17.Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M.

After pre-clearing with rabbit IgG, anti-Runx2 antibody was added, and the precipitated protein was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.Statistics—Values are reported as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 2.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Data were analyzed by t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) after establishing normal distribution of data and homogeneity of variances. Significance values were adjusted with Bonferroni's correction. Pearson Product moment analysis was used to detect relationships between osteoblast apoptosis and indices of bone formation. For longitudinal analysis of the effect of PTH on BMD, a mixed-effects longitudinal ANOVA model was used with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to allow specification of the covariance structure.RESULTSThe Prevalence of Osteoblast Apoptosis Is Inversely Related to Bone Formation in Mice Receiving Intermittent PTH—To firmly link suppression of osteoblast apoptosis and the stimulation of bone formation during intermittent PTH administration, we sought evidence for the correlation of the two phenomena in dose-response- and time-course studies in mice. In these studies we used 3–300 ng PTH-(1–34)/g to determine the minimum effective dose requirement for the anabolic effect of PTH in mice and also to eliminate the possibility that the anti-apoptotic effect of PTH was a phenomenon only associated with the 400 ng/g dose we had used in our earlier work (6.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Roberson P. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Daily injection of as little as 30 ng of PTH-(1–34)/g for 28 days increased hindlimb and spine BMD. These changes were associated with a reduction in osteoblast apoptosis at both sites as well as an increase in the level of serum osteocalcin, a biochemical index of osteoblast number (Fig. 1a). At the same dose that PTH inhibited osteoblast apoptosis, it also increased osteoblast number, bone formation rate, and the amount of cancellous bone in the distal femur, but the number of osteoclasts was not affected at any dose examined (not shown). The prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis exhibited a strong inverse correlation with three independent measures of bone formation, serum osteocalcin, bone formation rate, and osteoblast number (Fig. 1a). Temporal correlation between osteoblast apoptosis and bone formation was demonstrated in a separate experiment in which mice were given daily injections of 200 ng of PTH-(1–34)/g for 7, 14, or 28 days (Fig. 1b). Spine and hindlimb (not shown) BMD increased time-dependently in the PTH-treated mice, and this increase became statistically significant at days 14 and 28. A decrease in osteoblast apoptosis and an increase in osteoblast number in vertebral bone along with an increase in serum osteocalcin were evident as early as 7 days in mice receiving PTH, as compared with the vehicle controls. These changes persisted throughout the course of the experiment.Sustained PTH Elevation Does Not Affect Osteoblast Apoptosis—We next compared the effects of sustained versus intermittent PTH elevation on the prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis and on the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts at 2, 4, and 6 days (Fig. 1c). In this experiment we used human PTH-(1–84), the full-length PTH molecule that has identical biological effects as the 1–34 peptide but, unlike 1–34, can be quantified using a commercially available immunoassay. Infusion of 140 ng of PTH-(1–84)/h raised the serum level of the hormone from 13 ± 7 pg/ml to 160 ± 54, 164 ± 56, and 201 ± 66 pg/ml as determined at 2, 4, or 6 days after initiation of the infusion. Sustained elevation of PTH caused an increase in the number of osteoclasts at day 2 and was followed by an increase in osteoblast number at day 4, consistent with the expected increase in bone remodeling by continuous PTH elevation (Fig. 1c and Supplemental Fig. 2). The level of serum pyridinoline cross-links, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, was also elevated by day 6 (Fig. 1c). Consistent with previous findings in the rat (31.Dobnig H. Turner R.T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4607-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), 6 days of PTH infusion at this dose did not affect vertebral cancellous bone area (not shown). Strikingly, sustained elevation of PTH had no effect on the prevalence of osteoblast apoptosis at any time during the experiment (Fig. 1c), whereas daily injections of 230 ng PTH-(1–84)/g reduced osteoblast apoptosis and increased osteoblast number beginning on day 2. Osteoclast number and pyridinoline cross-links were unchanged by intermittent PTH. Importantly, the increase in osteoblast number seen with daily injections was significantly greater and occurred earlier than that caused by sustained infusion of PTH. Consistent with these differences and the association of increased osteoblast number with reduced apoptosis only in the case of the daily injections, 6 days of intermittent PTH i"

To better understand the pathological effect of Aurora-A activation, it is first necessary to elucidate the physiological functions of Aurora-A. Here, we have investigated the roles of Aurora-A in mitotic progression with the small interfering RNA, antibody microinjection, and time lapse microscopy using human cells. We demonstrated that suppression of Aurora-A by small interfering RNA caused multiple events to fail in mitosis, such as incorrect separation of centriole pairs, misalignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate, and incomplete cytokinesis. Antibody microinjection of Aurora-A into late G2 cells induced dose-dependent failure in separation of centriole pairs at prophase, indicating that Aurora-A is essential for proper separation of centriole pairs. When we injected anti-Aurora-A antibodies into prometaphase cells that had separated their centriole pairs, chromosomes were severely misaligned on the metaphase plate, indicating that Aurora-A is required for proper movement of chromosomes on the metaphase plate. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora-A at metaphase by microinjected antibodies prevented cells from completing cytokinesis, suggesting that Aurora-A also has important functions in late mitosis. These results strongly suggest that Aurora-A is essential for many crucial events during mitosis and that the phosphorylation of a series of substrates by Aurora-A at different stages of mitosis may promote diverse critical events in mitosis to maintain chromosome integrity in human cells.

These results strongly suggest that Aurora-A is essential for many crucial events during mitosis and that the phosphorylation of a series of substrates by Aurora-A at different stages of mitosis may promote diverse critical events in mitosis to maintain chromosome integrity in human cells. To accurately divide genetic material between two daughter cells during mitosis, cells undergo various crucial events such as chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, centrosome separation, bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Studies of diverse lower organisms have found that these events are controlled by reversible phosphorylation conducted by several serine/threonine kinases, known as mitotic kinases (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Mitotic kinases include cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (p34cdc2), Polo-like, NimA-related, Warts, and Aurora/Ipl1-related kinases; their structures have been well conserved through evolution (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J.

Prominent among the mitotic kinases implicated in the regulation of mitotic progression is Aurora-A, one of the Aurora/Ipl1-related kinases. Studies in several species agree that Aurora-A localizes to centrosomes and the spindle and that the expression and activity peak at the G2/M transition (3Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D.

In Drosophila, dysfunction of Aurora-A causes centrosome disorganization and a reduction in the length of astral microtubules (6Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These phenotypes may relate to the ability of Aurora-A to interact with and phosphorylate Drosophila-transforming acidic coiled-coil, a centrosome-associated protein implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics (7Giet R. McLean D. Descamps S. Lee M.J. Raff J.W. Prigent C. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the elimination of Aurora-A by RNA-mediated interference leads to failures in spindle assembly and centrosome maturation (8Schumacher J.M. Ashcroft N. Donovan P.J.

In Xenopus egg extracts, inhibition of Eg2, a Xenopus Aurora-A kinase, provokes a failure in the mitotic spindle assembly (10Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These investigations indicate that Aurora-A has similar but slightly different roles between these organisms. On the other hand, less is known about human Aurora-A. Aurora-A might regulate TPX2, a prominent component of the spindle apparatus in human cells (11Kufer T.A. Sillje H.H. Korner R. Gruss O.J. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human Aurora-A was found to interfere with mitotic exit, causing tetraploidization and concomitant amplification of centrosomes (12Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human aurora-A gene is mapped to chromosome 20q13, a region frequently amplified in various human malignant tumors (13Bigner S.H. Mark J. Friedman H.S. Biegel J.A. Bigner D.D.

These findings suggest that dysregulation of Aurora-A activation may lead to genomic instability, which results in development and progression of malignant tumors. Thus, to better understand the pathological effect of Aurora-A activation, it is first necessary to elucidate the physiological functions of Aurora-A in human cells. In this study, we interfered with the function of Aurora-A by antibody microinjection in addition to silencing Aurora-A by RNA interference (small interfering RNA; siRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNAsmall interfering RNAMG132carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinalMTOCmicrotubule-organizing centerTPX2targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2GSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDICdifferential interference contrast.1The abbreviations used are: siRNAsmall interfering RNAMG132carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinalMTOCmicrotubule-organizing centerTPX2targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2GSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDICdifferential interference contrast. in HeLa cells to precisely examine the effect of Aurora-A inhibition on each mitotic event. Our data demonstrate that human Aurora-A is required for multiple crucial events during mitosis, such as mitotic entry, separation of centriole pairs, and accurate bipolar spindle assembly. Aurora-A plays a crucial role in events that occur at middle and late mitosis, including alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate and completion of cytokinesis. Thus, Aurora-A is a critical component for orchestrating mitotic progression in human cells. small interfering RNA carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal microtubule-organizing center targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid green fluorescent protein differential interference contrast. small interfering RNA carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal microtubule-organizing center targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid green fluorescent protein differential interference contrast.

Proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132; Sigma) was used in culture medium at 10 μm to block the cell cycle at metaphase (31Topper L.M. Bastians H. Ruderman J.V.

For transient transfection, COS7 cells in 6-well plates were transfected using a FuGene6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Plasmids and Constructs—The open reading frames of Aurora-A, centrin3, and Mad2 were amplified by PCR from the HeLa cDNA library, and PCR products were sequenced and subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The fragment of Aurora-A was then cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Full-length cDNA fragments of Aurora-B and Aurora-C, kindly provided by Dr. Masashi Kimura (Gifu University), were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), respectively. To generate GST and histidine-tagged Aurora-A proteins, the sequence corresponding to residues 1-387 of Aurora-A was amplified by PCR using the pGEM-T Easy-Aurora-A plasmid as a template and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pRSET (Invitrogen) vectors. To generate GST-centrin3 protein or GST-Mad2 protein, full-length centrin3 or full-length Mad2 was subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. Antibody Preparation and Microinjection—Anti-centrin3 antibody was generated in rats by injecting GST-centrin3 (Supplemental Fig. S2). Anti-Mad2 antibody was generated in rabbits by injecting GST-Mad2 (Fig. 1G). Anti-Aurora-A antibody was generated in rabbits by injecting them with the GST-N-terminal domain of Aurora-A (amino acids 1-129) (Fig. S1) (5Marumoto T. Hirota T. Morisaki T. Kunitoku N. Zhang D. Ichikawa Y. Sasayama T. Kuninaka S. Mimori T. Tamaki N. Kimura M. Okano Y. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The bleeds were affinity-purified using an Affi-Gel 10 gel coupled with the histidine-tagged N-terminal-domain of Aurora-A or GST-Mad2 following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). For antibody microinjection, rabbit IgG from preimmune serum was affinity-purified using ImmunoPure (A) (Pierce). Anti-Aurora-A antibodies and control IgG were concentrated in 0.5× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) in Vivaspin Mr 5,000 cut-off microconcentrators (Vivascience). Equal concentrations of anti-Aurora-A antibodies or control IgG, with or without a rhodamine-labeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton), were injected into the cytoplasm of synchronized HeLa cells at the specific phase (G2 phase, prometaphase, or metaphase) of the cell cycle using an Eppendorf semiautomatic microinjector (Eppendorf) attached to an Olympus IX 70 microscope (Olympus). We identified the cell cycle stages of the cells by careful observation using DIC and/or fluorescence images. G2 phase was defined as the time 8 h after release from a double thymidine block, when chromosomes have not yet been condensed. Prometaphase cells were selected based on the findings that nuclear envelope breakdown were completed but chromosomes had not been aligned on the metaphase plate. Metaphase cells were selected by the finding that chromosomes were completely aligned on the equator of the cell. Time Lapse Imaging and Analysis—HeLa cells were plated and synchronized in ΔT 0.15-mm dishes (Biopteches). Before microinjection and observation, the culture medium was replaced with dye-free L-15 medium, pH 7.2 (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and overlaid with mineral oil. Dishes were maintained at 37 °C using the ΔT Culture Dish System (Biopteches) and imaged on an Olympus IX 70 microscope equipped with a sensitive SenSys-1401E CCD camera (Roper Scientific). After antibody microinjection, images were obtained using a ×10 or ×40 UPlan Apo objective (Olympus). The camera, shutters, and the filter wheel were controlled by MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging), and the images were collected at every 3 min with exposure times of 50 ms. Through-focus z-series stacks consisting of three frames were acquired at each time point. For quantitation of mitotic intervals, the duration of early mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase) was defined as the time elapsed from the first sign of chromosome condensation (12:27 ± 2:53 (min:s) before completion of nuclear envelope breakdown in control HeLa cells, n = 10) to partial separation of chromosomes into more than two masses. The duration of late mitosis (anaphase and telophase) was defined as the time from chromosome separation to spreading of divided daughter cells. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, equal amounts of cell lysates were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE Laemmli gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with the primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: anti-α-tubulin antibody (B-5-1-2; Sigma), anti-FLAG antibody (M5; Sigma), anti-Aurora-A antibody (5Marumoto T. Hirota T. Morisaki T. Kunitoku N. Zhang D. Ichikawa Y. Sasayama T. Kuninaka S. Mimori T. Tamaki N. Kimura M. Okano Y. Saya H.

The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. siRNA—We used the following target sequences for Aurora-A siRNA: 725AUG CCC UGU CUU ACU GUC A743 and 155AUU CUU CCC AGC GCG UUC C173. We obtained the similar results using above two sequences of oligonucleotides. The results obtained using the former sequence are represented here. Oligonucleotides were transfected into HeLa cells using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). As a control, we used the GL-2 duplex to target the luciferase gene (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—For immunostaining, HeLa cells were rinsed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (25 mm HEPES, 60 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C and then fixed with -20 °C methanol for Aurora-A or centrin3 staining. For Mad2 staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PHEM. After washing with PHEM buffer containing 0.05% Triton-X, cells were incubated with blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in PHEM). Sequential incubation of primary and secondary antibodies was done in PHEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The stained cells were mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane/glycerol and observed with confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Fluoview; Olympus). Images were obtained separately by independent excitation at 488/568/633 nm to minimize overlapping signals. Antibodies used were anti-Aurora-A antibody (Fig. S1) (5Marumoto T. Hirota T. Morisaki T. Kunitoku N. Zhang D. Ichikawa Y. Sasayama T. Kuninaka S. Mimori T. Tamaki N. Kimura M. Okano Y. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), anti-centrin3 antibody (Fig. S2), anti-Mad2 antibody (Fig. 1G), anti-α-tubulin antibody (B-5-1-2; Sigma), anti-γ-tubulin antibody (GTU-88; Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (BIOSOURCE), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG (BIOSOURCE), and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) or TOTO-3 dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Reduction of Aurora-A Expression by siRNA Leads to Failure of Various Mitotic Events—As a first approach to understand the function of Aurora-A in human cells, we used siRNA duplexes in HeLa cells (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). A 48-h treatment with siRNA targeted to a region located 725 bp downstream of the start codon in Aurora-A mRNA resulted in a considerable, but incomplete, reduction of the protein expression (Fig. 1, A, E, and H). We first examined the effect of Aurora-A reduction on cell cycle progression. Asynchronized HeLa cells were transfected with Aurora-A siRNA. At 48 h after the transfection, we fixed the attached cells, stained them with anti-α-tubulin antibodies (microtubules) and TOTO-3 dye (DNA), and scored the number of cells in different cell cycle stages. We found that 91.9 ± 0.1% (mean ± S.D.) of the cells transfected with Aurora-A siRNA and 96.2 ± 0.2% of the control cells were in interphase (Fig. 1B). The proportion of the Aurora-A-depleted cells in earlier stages of mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase) was more than double that of the control cells (4.9 ± 0.4% in the Aurora-A siRNA transfected cells versus 2.3 ± 0.1% in the controls) (Fig. 1B). However, cells at later stages of mitosis (anaphase and telophase) were less detected when Aurora-A siRNA was transfected (0.9 ± 0.5%), whereas a normal number of late mitotic figures was observed in control cells (1.6 ± 0.2%). These results indicated that reduction of Aurora-A expression causes early mitotic delay in HeLa cells. Moreover, although only 0.1 ± 0.1% of control cells showed an apoptosis-like appearance, 2.2 ± 1.0% of Aurora-A siRNA-transfected cells did. These phenotypes were observed consistently in all experiments using Aurora-A siRNA in HeLa cells. As we have recently reported, complete depletion of Aurora-A expression blocked mitotic entry in mammalian cells (35Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, a fraction of cells showing significantly reduced but still detectable levels of Aurora-A were observed to enter mitosis after Aurora-A RNAi. These cells with attenuated Aurora-A expression revealed mitotic phenotypes described above. We employed immunocytochemistry to examine further the phenotype of cells arrested in early mitosis by Aurora-A siRNA. In most of these Aurora-A-reduced mitotic cells (89.6 ± 2.0%, Fig. 1C), although chromosomes were condensed and bipolar spindles were formed, several chromosomes were not aligned on the metaphase plate and positioned in the vicinity of two spindle poles (Fig. 1E, lower panel). In contrast, fewer than 10% of control mitotic cells showed misaligned chromosomes (9.9 ± 1.6%) (Fig. 1, C and E, upper panel). The kinetochores of the misaligned chromosomes found in Aurora-A-reduced mitotic cells were positive for Mad2, which localizes selectively to the kinetochores that are not bound to the spindle microtubules (Fig. 1G) (36Chen R.H. Waters J.C. Salmon E.D. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 274: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that misalignment of chromosome in Aurora-A-reduced cells is caused by loose connections between microtubules and kinetochores during early mitosis. The centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles and the surrounding pericentriolar materials, both of which play a central role in organizing mitotic spindles (37Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Doxsey S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In lower organisms, Aurora-A is thought to function in the centrosome separation and the recruitment of γ-tubulin to centrosomes (centrosome maturation) during mitosis (6Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Hannak E. Kirkham M. Hyman A.A. Oegema K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 17: 1109-1116Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 38Berdnik D. Knoblich J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 640-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined mitotic centrosomes in Aurora-A-reduced cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody against γ-tubulin, a component of pericentriolar material. We found that γ-tubulin staining was normal at each spindle pole in both control and Aurora-A-down-regulated cells during mitosis (Fig. 1H). We have recently shown that centrosomes remain immature in cells arrested at late G2 phase by complete depletion of Aurora-A (35Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we speculate that low levels of activated Aurora-A, which allow the cells to enter mitosis, are sufficient for recruitment of γ-tubulin to centrosomes during mitosis in HeLa cells. To analyze the centrosome separation in Aurora-A down-regulated cells, we have generated highly specific antibody against centrin3 (Fig. S2), a component of centriole (39Paoletti A. Moudjou M. Paintrand M. Salisbury J.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3089-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct dots of centrin3-positive staining that represent a pair of centrioles were clearly visible on each spindle pole in control cells (100%, 39 of 39; Fig. 1F, upper panel), but in Aurora-A-reduced cells, relatively low centrin3 staining was seen only on one spindle pole, and no staining was recognized on the other (Fig. 1F, lower panel). This abnormality was observed in 74% (28 of 38) of Aurora-A-reduced mitotic cells. These results suggest that Aurora-A is involved in the separation of centriole pairs during early mitosis. We also found that a significant population (24.4 ± 5.0%) of the multinucleated cells was generated when Aurora-A was reduced, whereas control siRNA induced only 3.3 ± 1.0% of the multinucleated cells (Fig. 1, D and I). These data suggest that Aurora-A is directly or indirectly required for cytokinesis. The findings described above suggest the possibility that Aurora-A is involved in various critical events related to the centrosome, such as separation of centriole pairs, chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate, and cytokinesis. However, given that the centrosome plays lead roles in the progression of various mitotic events, there is a possibility that dysfunction of the centrosome might be responsible for several mitotic failures found in Aurora-A-depleted cells. Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that reduction of Aurora-A levels by siRNA interference affects interphase events and that mitotic failures are caused as a secondary consequence. Anti-Aurora-A Antibody Injection Interferes with the Progression of Early Mitosis—We were very keen to find whether Aurora-A is directly involved in the mitotic events described above. For this purpose, at specific phases of cell cycle, we microinjected affinity-purified anti-Aurora-A antibodies into HeLa cells at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (∼3.0 × 10-3 pmol of the anti-Aurora-A antibodies per cell). This antibody was highly specific for Aurora-A kinase and did not recognize Aurora-B and Aurora-C (Fig. S1). We microinjected anti-Aurora-A antibodies into the cytoplasm at the late G2 phase when the replication of centrosomes was completed (∼8 h after release from a double thymidine block) and observed the cells by time lapse DIC microscopy. In each experiment, control cells microinjected with protein A-purified IgG from preimmune serum were simultaneously visualized in the same field as the experimental cells. As we have previously shown, injection of anti-Aurora-A antibodies into late G2 cells results in significant delay of entry into mitosis, suggesting that Aurora-A is involved in the mechanisms of entry into mitosis in HeLa cells (5Marumoto T.

We next quantitatively analyzed time lapse images to determine the duration of each mitotic event in the anti-Aurora-A antibody-injected cells.

The newly discovered human DNA glycosylases, NEIL1 and NEIL2, are distinct in structural features and reaction mechanism from the previously characterized NTH1 and OGG1 but act on many of the same substrates. However, NEIL2 shows a unique preference for excising lesions from a DNA bubble, whereas NTH1 and OGG1 are only active with duplex DNA. NEIL1 also excises efficiently 5-hydroxyuracil, an oxidation product of cytosine, from the bubble and single-stranded DNA but does not have strong activity toward 8-oxoguanine in the bubble. The dichotomy in the activity of NEILs versus NTH1/OGG1 for bubble versus duplex DNA substrates is consistent with higher affinity of the NEILs for the bubble structures of both damaged and undamaged DNA relative to duplex structure. These observations suggest that the NEILs are functionally distinct from OGG1/NTH1 in vivo. OGG1/NTH1-independent repair of oxidized bases in the transcribed sequences supports the possibility that NEILs are preferentially involved in repair of lesions in DNA bubbles generated during transcription and/or replication.

OGG1/NTH1-independent repair of oxidized bases in the transcribed sequences supports the possibility that NEILs are preferentially involved in repair of lesions in DNA bubbles generated during transcription and/or replication. Reactive oxygen species are continuously generated as byproducts of respiration and are also induced during the inflammatory response and other pathological processes (1.Gotz M.E. Kunig G.

These compounds and radicals are genotoxic and in addition to DNA strand breaks induce a plethora of base lesions, many of which are mutagenic and/or toxic (3.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Although OGG1 and NTH1 comprise the bulk of DNA glycosylase activity in mammalian cells for repairing oxidized bases, the fact that Ogg1–/– and Nth1–/– mice have no phenotype suggested the presence of back-up systems for repairing reactive oxygen species-induced lesions in mammalian cells (9.Minowa O.

Preferential repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from the transcribed strand of a plasmid DNA in Ogg1-null mouse fibroblasts also supports the existence of additional DNA glycosylases (11.LePage F.

At the same time, accumulation of 8-oxoG residues in the bulk genome suggests the presence of two distinct processes for repair of 8-oxoG in the transcribed versus nontranscribed sequences (9.Minowa O.

Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) in the transcribed sequences in genomic DNA, also indicates distinct repair systems for transcribed versus bulk DNA sequences. These results are reminiscent of the preferential repair of bulky base adducts in transcribed sequences in DNA via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which led to the paradigm of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) as a distinct subpathway of NER (14.Bohr V.A.

It is expected that repair of the transcribed strand is critical for preventing synthesis of mutant RNA or sustaining gene expression in order to maintain normal cellular phenotype.

NEIL1 prefers formamidopyrimidine-A, formamidopyrimidine-G, thymine glycol, and 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) as substrates, whereas NEIL2 excises 5-OHU and other oxidized derivatives of cytosine (17.Hazra T.K.

Surprisingly, except for few conserved motifs, NEIL1 and NEIL2 show no significant sequence homology. Here we report an unusual activity of NEIL1 and NEIL2 in excising lesions from DNA bubble structures. In contrast, neither OGG1 nor NTH1 shows any base excision activity for lesions present in a bubble or single-stranded (ss) DNA. This novel structural preference of the NEILs raises the possibility that these enzymes are involved in a distinct function in vivo for the repair of oxidized bases.

Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Incision Assay of DNA Glycosylases—DNA strand cleavage, due to intrinsic AP lyase activity of DNA glycosylases after lesion excision, was assayed by using duplex oligo containing 5-OHU or 8-oxoG in the 32P-labeled strand, after incubation with the DNA glycosylases at 37 °C for the indicated times in 10-μl reactions containing 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were stopped with 70% formamide, 30 mm NaOH, and the cleaved oligo products were then separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), and 2 mm EDTA. For analysis of enzyme kinetics, we incubated 5-OHU·G and 5-OHU·B11 oligo substrates (7.8–125 nm) with either NEIL1 (at 17.5 nm for 3.5 min) or NEIL2 (at 20 nm for 5 min) at 37 °C. The rate of product formation was linear for both enzymes under these conditions. The radioactivity in the DNA bands was quantitated by analysis in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using Image-Quant software. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The 51-mer 5-OHU-containing oligo and a control oligo of identical sequence except for substitution of 5-OHU with C in position 26 (Table I) were labeled with 32P at the 5′ terminus by T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed with appropriate complementary strands to generate either perfect duplexes or 11-nt bubble structures (B11) flanked by duplex regions. The DNAs (1.5 nm) were incubated with WT and mutant NEIL1 (5–20 nm) for 10 min or WT and mutant NEIL2 (15–60 nm) for 15 min at 22 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), before electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (10%) in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.4). The protein-bound DNA was quantitated in the linear range by PhosphorImager analysis as before. The dissociation constants of binding were calculated according to Taylor et al. (28.Taylor J.D. Badcoe I.G. Clarke A.R. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Characterization of DNA Bubble Structures—We annealed equimolar amounts of lesion-containing and complementary oligos to generate either completely base-paired duplexes or bubble structures of various unpaired regions flanked by duplex sequences as indicated in Table I. The melting temperatures (Tm) of the annealed oligo duplexes, calculated according to Oligo Analyzer 3.0 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), ranged from 50 to 74 °C, depending on the bubble size. Thus the duplexes and bubble structures should be stable in our studies. We then carried out detailed analysis of the structure of the duplex and B11 oligos prepared by annealing a lesion-containing or a normal strand with various complementary strands. Both strands in annealed DNAs were labeled with 32P. In all cases, we observed a single band of the expected mobility after electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels for both 5-OHU- and normal base-containing oligos (Fig. 1). The mobility of the duplex was in between that of ssDNA and the bubble structure. These results indicated that the duplex and bubble structures were stable and homogeneous without contamination by single-stranded oligos (Fig. 1A). We confirmed the presence of a single-stranded region in the control B11 oligo containing C in position 26 by examining its susceptibility to the single strand-specific mung bean endonuclease (Fig. 1B). Duplex sequences, 20-mer in length on either side of the bubble in B11 oligo, should be resistant to the ssDNA-specific endonuclease, whereas the single-stranded sequences in these oligos would be degraded by the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1B, with a limited amount of the nuclease, the duplex oligo remained unchanged (lanes 6 and 7), whereas a significant fraction of the B11, DNA in which both strands were radiolabeled (lanes 2 and 4), was converted into 20–22-mer fragments from either strand (lanes 3 and 5) after denaturing gel electrophoresis. As expected, the ssDNA was extensively degraded by nuclease treatment (lane 9). Thus, the bubble oligo contained stable 20-mer duplex sequences flanking an ssDNA region. It should also be noted that no significant hairpin duplex region in the oligos was predicted from the sequence analysis under our assay condition (Oligo Analyzer 3.0, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). These results also predict that B5 and B19 bubble oligos have similar base unpaired regions flanked by duplex segments. Preparation of Inactive NEIL1 and NEIL2 Mutants—To investigate the affinity of NEIL1 and NEIL2 for DNA bubbles containing substrate lesions by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), as described later, inactive mutants of NEIL1 and NEIL2 were generated. Previous studies (29Saparbaev, M., Sidorkina, O. M., Jurado, J., Privezentzev, C. V., Greenberg, M. M., and Laval, J. (2002) 39, 10–17Google Scholar, 30.Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Gilboa R. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Rieger R.A. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have shown that E. coli Nei and Fpg contain a conserved Lys residue essential for base excision but not for the AP lyase activity. We therefore mutated the corresponding conserved Lys residues (Lys-53 in NEIL1 and Lys-49 in NEIL2) and purified both K53L NEIL1 and K49R NEIL2 mutant proteins to homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Analysis of activity of the WT and mutant enzymes for excision of 5-OHU and strand cleavage of 32P-labeled 5-OHU-containing duplex oligos confirmed our prediction that the NEIL1 and NEIL2 mutants lack DNA glycosylase activity (Fig. 2B). Preferential Excision of 5-OHU from a DNA Bubble Structure—We compared the DNA glycosylase activity of NEIL1, NEIL2, and NTH1 in excising 5-OHU from duplex, single-stranded, and bubble oligos B5, B11, and B19 with 5, 11, and 19 unpaired bases, respectively. The lesion base was positioned in the middle of the bubble in all cases. We have confirmed the observation by Takao et al. (20.Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T.J. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3, that NEIL1 is active with ssDNA (Fig. 3A, lane 6), and we further showed that NEIL2 (Fig. 3A, lane 11) but not NTH1 (Fig. 3B, lane 5) was similarly active with ssDNA. More remarkably, both NEIL1 and NEIL2 were highly active in excising 5-OHU when it was placed inside a bubble in B5, B11, and B19, in an otherwise duplex DNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–5 and 8–10). In contrast, NTH1 was completely inactive with the same substrate (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). This was expected, because NTH1 was also inactive with the ssDNA substrate (Fig. 3B, lane 5), as was shown before. NEIL1 is generally more active in base excision from duplex DNA than NEIL2 (17.Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, although both NEIL1 and NEIL2 had comparable activity with the bubble substrates, NEIL2 showed almost 4-fold higher excision activity when 5-OHU was present in an 11- or 19-nt bubble than in a duplex. We determined the kinetic parameters of NEIL1 and NEIL2 with oligos containing 5-OHU either paired with G or present in the B11 bubble. The G·5-OHU pair should be generated in the genome in situ after oxidative deamination of C (31.Dizdaroglu M. Holwitt E. Hagan M.P. Blakely W.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both NEIL1 and NEIL2 have higher catalytic specificity in excising 5-OHU from an 11-nt bubble than from a G·5-OHU pair in the duplex (Table II). Although both NEIL1 and NEIL2 prefer 5-OHU located in the bubble, NEIL1 has higher turnover and catalytic specificity than NEIL2. On the other hand, the preference of NEIL2 for the 11-nt bubble substrate relative to duplex DNA is higher (about 7-fold) than that of NEIL1 (about 3-fold).Table IIKinetic parameters of NEIL1 and NEIL2 with duplex (5-OHU·G) and bubble (5-OHU·B11) substratesKm (nm)kcat (×103/min)kcat/Km (min-1 nm-1)5-OHU·G5-OHU·B115-OHU·G5-OHU·B115-OHU·G5-OHU·B11NEIL112.8 ± 1.19.0 ± 1.665.8 ± 0.1124.5 ± 11.95.2 ± 0.6214.0 ± 1.7NEIL221.9 ± 2.515.6 ± 3.58.2 ± 2.137.8 ± 1.90.37 ± 0.082.5 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Preferential Excision of 8-OxoG in a Bubble Structure—We showed earlier that with the duplex DNA NEIL1 but not NEIL2 was active in excising 8-oxoG from an 8-oxoG·C pair (17.Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 18.Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W.

However, we have now observed that NEIL2 could excise 8-oxoG when it was present inside a bubble (Fig. 4, lane 6). Like NTH1, OGG1, the major 8-oxoG-excising enzyme in eukaryotic cells, was completely inactive in excising 8-oxoG from both a bubble structure or ssDNA (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, NEIL1 had higher 8-oxoG excision activity when the lesion was present in the 8-oxoG·C duplex (lane 2) than in the bubble (lane 3). Affinity of NEIL1 and NEIL2 for Bubble Conformation—The lower Km values of both NEIL1 and NEIL2 for the 5-OHU substrate in bubble relative to duplex DNA suggested that these enzymes have intrinsic affinity for the bubble structure. We therefore analyzed their relative affinity for duplex versus bubble DNA by EMSA. Because the activity of NEIL1 and NEIL2 does not require a cofactor, we could not carry out EMSA with WT NEILs and substrate oligos. We therefore used inactive mutants of the enzymes with 5-OHU-containing oligos. We also examined the affinity of WT NEIL1 and NEIL2 with control oligos that are identical to the 5-OHU-containing oligos except for substitution of 5-OHU with C. Fig. 5 shows a representative analysis of WT NEIL1 and NEIL2 complexes with duplex and bubble-containing DNA with normal bases. The slower moving complex with bubble DNA appears to be due to the binding of two enzyme molecules which became more pronounced with increasing protein concentration (Fig. 6A). It should be noted that NEIL1 and NEIL2 have no excision activity with normal bases, as expected (data not shown).Fig. 6Concentration-dependent binding of NEIL1 to undamaged duplex and bubble oligos.A, EMSA of NEIL1 with bubble (B11) oligo (lanes 1–5) and duplex oligo (lanes 6–10); NEIL1 was used at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 nm in lanes 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, and 5 and 10, respectively.

Ka1 and Ka2 are the equilibrium constants for primary and secondary binding. Assuming the free duplex as the reference state, the partition function, Q, for the binding reaction is given by Reaction 2 (28.Taylor J.D. Badcoe I.G. Clarke A.R. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32.Vallone P.M. Benight A.S.

Ka1, i.e. 1/Kd, could then be calculated from the binding isotherms by data fitting using the Sigma plot (representative plots are given in Fig. 6, B and C). We calculated the apparent Kd values of interaction of WT NEIL1 and NEIL2 with normal duplex and B11 bubble oligos (Table III, top). We could not calculate the Kd values of these enzymes for single-stranded oligos because the complexes were not stable during EMSA. Interestingly, our initial EMSA results using the Tris borate buffer system were not reproducible. On the other hand, the results obtained from gels containing Tris-glycine buffer were reliable and used in calculating the above constants. We carried out similar binding studies of K53L NEIL1 and K49R NEIL2 mutants with 5-OHU-containing oligos. Table III, bottom, summarizes these results. It is evident from these EMSA results that both WT and mutant NEILs have an inherent affinity for the bubble structures. Similar EMSA studies with NTH1 and OGG1 did not indicate the formation of stable complexes of these enzymes with single-stranded and 11-nt bubble oligos containing normal bases (data not shown).Table IIIAffinity of WT and mutant NEILs for DNAKd app (nm)DuplexBubble (B11)NEIL1aWT enzymes and nondamaged oligo duplex and bubbles were used.714 ± 7632.2 ± 2.7NEIL2aWT enzymes and nondamaged oligo duplex and bubbles were used.833 ± 34119 ± 6NEIL1(K53L)bMutant enzymes and 5-OHU-containing oligos were used.1428 ± 14287 ± 16NEIL2(K49R)bMutant enzymes and 5-OHU-containing oligos were used.5000 ± 100286 ± 24a WT enzymes and nondamaged oligo duplex and bubbles were used.b Mutant enzymes and 5-OHU-containing oligos were used. Open table in a new tab Mammalian NEIL1 and NEIL2 share many oxidized DNA base lesions as substrates with OGG1 and NTH1, the other two previously characterized DNA glycosylases involved in repair of these lesions. However, unlike the latter, which belong to the Nth family, NEIL1 and NEIL2 belong to the distinct Fpg/Nei family of enzymes based on reaction chemistry. It is interesting that there is no significant homology between NEIL1 and NEIL2 (17.Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 18.Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we show here that NEIL1 and NEIL2 share a common preference for an unusual DNA structure. Most DNA glycosylases of both bacterial and eukaryotic origin are active only with duplex DNA substrates. This is expected because the complementary strand serves as a template for the repair of gaps generated in the lesion-containing strand after damage removal. Thus, neither NTH1 nor OGG1 showed detectable activity for excising 5-OHU or 8-oxoG from ssDNA. In contrast, NEIL1 and NEIL2 have significantly higher activity and catalytic specificity for 5-OHU located in a single-stranded sequence in a bubble than for those in duplex DNA. Furthermore, the activity of NEIL2 was much higher with the bubble substrate than with ssDNA. We used 5-OHU and 8-oxoG in oligos of the same sequence as common substrates for the DNA glycosylases in order to avoid any potential impact of the sequence context. We confirmed an earlier observation that NEIL1 is active with ssDNA (20.Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T.J. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and we showed for the first time that NEIL2 has similar activity. Our results indicate that NEIL1 had comparable activity with ssDNA and duplex DNA and with DNA containing 5–19-nt bubbles. In contrast, NEIL2 had much higher activity with the bubble DNA than with duplex or ssDNA. The preference of NEIL2 for the bubble substrate extends to repair of 8-oxoG (Fig. 3). Compared with a robust activity with the 8-oxoG·C pair in duplex DNA, OGG1 showed no activity when 8-oxoG was present in ssDNA or in an 11-nt bubble. The complex substrate preferences of NEIL1 and NEIL2 raise the question about their affinity for various DNA structures. Our EMSA results with undamaged DNA showed that both NEIL1 and NEIL2 have higher affinity for bubble structures than for duplex DNA. Furthermore, the binding of NEILs to ssDNA was less specific than to the B11 bubble. These data strongly suggest that whereas NEIL1 and NEIL2 stably bind to single-stranded sequences even in the absence of substrate lesions, their initial interaction with DNA requires a duplex structure. The similar trend in binding of NEIL1 and NEIL2 with lesion-containing and nondamaged DNA in single-stranded, duplex, and bubble conformation supports our conclusion that these enzymes have intrinsic affinity for the bubble structure. We then assessed the contribution of the base lesion to the binding by using inactive mutants of NEIL1 and NEIL2 with 5-OHU-containing oligos in various DNA structures. We observed a lower affinity of the mutants for the substrate oligo compared with that of the WT enzymes for the undamaged oligo (Table III). It thus appears likely that significant changes in the tertiary structures of these enzymes were induced by the mutations. Nevertheless, the affinity of both NEIL1 and NEIL2 for the bubble DNA was consistently higher than for the duplex DNA. This is in strong contrast to the situation with NTH1 and OGG1 which did not produce stable complexes with either ssDNA or B11 bubble. Tainer and co-workers (33.Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have proposed a push-pinch-pull model for lesion detection by DNA glycosylases while scanning by NEILs along the DNA backbone. It is unclear how such a model could apply to initial scanning when the duplex DNA changes abruptly to ssDNA before reaching the lesion. This issue may be resolved once the structures of DNA-bound NEILs are elucidated. Given the absence of requirement for ATP whether NEIL1 and NEIL2 move unidirectionally on the DNA strand is not known. Furthermore, it is highly likely that these enzymes, like other DNA glycosylases, flip out the damaged nucleotide before catalysis (34.Hosfield D.J. Daniels D.S. Mol C.D. Putnam C.D. Parikh S.S. Tainer J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 315-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). It should thus be easier for them to insert the base lesion into the catalytic pocket from ssDNA or a loop than from a duplex DNA. The inability of OGG1 and NTH1 to similarly utilize ssDNA or bubble DNA substrates may be due to distinct mechanisms involved in stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex for the NEILs versus other DNA glycosylases. Finally, the physiological implications of the unusual substrate structure preference of NEILs deserve to be discussed. The bubble DNA containing noncomplementary bases used in these studies was designed to represent unwound duplex regions in the genome. Similar bubbles are transiently formed in vivo during both transcription and DNA replication. Although preferential repair of DNA template strands during DNA replication has not been established, we had earlier hypothesized about replication-associated repair of mutagenic bases in mammalian cells (36.Mitra S. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Bhakat K.K. Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). During DNA replication, several distinct DNA helicases function in unwinding the DNA duplex ahead of the replication fork to generate a bubble structure (37.Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). S-phase-specific activation of NEIL1 raises the possibility that it is involved in repair of the damage present in the replication bubble. In contrast, NEIL2, independent of cell cycle expression, could be involved in TCR. TCR of bulky base adducts (e.g. UV photoproducts), which prevent RNA chain elongation, was identified as a distinct subpathway of NER. The blockage of RNA polymerase II at the damage site triggers repair of the transcribed strand, which is required for survival and maintenance of genomic integrity (14.Bohr V.A. Smith C.A.

Preferential repair of oxidative damage in transcribed sequences via base excision repair was also observed (11.LePage F. Flungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Prog. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12.LePage F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K.

Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because oxidatively damaged bases, unlike bulky adducts, do not block transcription, at least in vitro, how TCR is activated during in vivo repair of these bases is not clear (41.Tornaletti S. Maeda L.S. Lloyd D.R. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45367-45371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We propose the following model of how NEIL2 initiates repair of oxidized bases in a transcription bubble. After base excision by NEIL2 in the transient bubble, generated ahead of the growing RNA chain, the DNA strand is cleaved due to the AP lyase activity of the enzyme. In contrast, OGG1 and NTH1 are unable to carry out base excision in the bubble. This could explain their dispensability in repairing damage from the transcribed sequences. The single-strand break generated by NEIL2 prevents forward movement of the transcription complex and induces either its retrograde movement or dissociation from the template (38.Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The bubble then collapses to reform the duplex structure, allowing completion of the strand break repair and resumption of transcription. Whether NEILs interact with transcription and replication complexes in order to carry out targeted repair of DNA templates in a coordinated fashion remains to be investigated. We thank Dr. D. Konkel for carefully editing the manuscript, Wanda Smith for expert secretarial help, and Dr. R. Roy for the gift of NTH1."

These findings postulate new uses for SWNTs in biological applications and provide unexpected insights into the current view of mechanisms governing the interaction of ion channels with blocking molecules. Because of the physiological role they play, ion channels exhibit unique structures, including the pore that provides the physical pathway for ion movements across the plasma membrane and several charged domains that attract and/or repel ions (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). These characteristics make ion channels easy targets for external agents such as natural toxins and synthetic drugs that react with them by establishing electrochemical interactions. Thus, blocking agents have been used not only as the basic components for commercial pesticides and potential therapeutic drugs but also to infer functional information (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed.

Here we show that SWNTs of certain diameters can efficiently block K+ channels.MATERIALS AND METHODSNanotubes and Fullerene Synthesis—SWNTs, with a diameter distribution peaked in the 0.8–0.9 nm range, were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a horizontal tube reactor using a three-stage process. In the first stage, the catalyst/support system was obtained via wet mixing followed by combustive calcination. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate, and citric acid (the latter to induce combustion) were mixed with enough distilled water to give a clear solution, which was heated to 550 °C for 5–10 min in air. The resulting powder of general composition MgO(1-x-y)CoxMoy (where nanoscale Co-Mo is the catalyst in a typical molybdenum/cobalt atomic ratio of 1:4, and MgO is the catalyst support) was taken out, ground to a fine consistency, and placed in a quartz boat in the CVD reactor. The deposition reaction zone was pumped down to 10–3 torr, back-filled with pure hydrogen to 1 atm, and the temperature was raised to 500 °C for 30 min. The temperature was then raised to 700 °C, and pure CO was introduced at 1 atm with a flow rate of 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute. The SWNT growth was carried out for 20 min. For purification, the as-prepared SWNTs, together with the catalyst and support, were immersed in 6 m hydrochloric acid, shaken for a few minutes, centrifuged, and decanted. The roughly purified SWNTs were dispersed again in 6 m hydrochloric acid, sonicated for 5–10 min, centrifuged, and decanted. This process was repeated twice. The purified SWNTs were then washed 2–3 times with de-ionized water, filtered, and dried. X-ray diffraction and x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy of the SWNT powder showed the absence of MgO and catalyst particles. The purified SWNTs (consisting only of SWNTs as determined by micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction) were used after dispersion to a uniform and stable suspension by ultrasonic agitation for 15 min in a basic aqueous solution (pH near 10) containing 1 volume percentage of Triton X-100 surfactant. The purification of the [email protected] SWNTs was carried out with 45 h of reflux in 2–3 m nitric acid to remove amorphous carbon and graphitic onions. Following reflux, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid was decanted. The SWNT sediment was washed, resuspended, centrifuged, and again decanted. This process was repeated 3–4 times. The purified SWNTs were dispersed in a pH 10 aqueous solution containing 0.5 volume percentage Triton X-100 by ultrasonic agitation for ∼1 h. Stock solutions were prepared by rinsing the nanomaterials in water several times (until they formed clusters indicating removal of Triton) and resuspended in CHAPS. To confirm that this treatment was sufficient to remove Triton, nanotubes in which Triton was removed via annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h were tested on HERG channels. The absence of the Triton subsequent to annealing was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Annealed nanotubes retained their blocking efficiency (data not shown), indicating that blocking can be attributed to nanotubes alone and not to the Triton.Electrophysiology—CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNA ligated into pCI-neo using Superfect kit (Qiagen) and studied after 24–36 h. Data were recorded with an Axopatch 200B (Axon), a PC (Dell), and Clampex software (Axon), filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 2.5 kHz. Bath solution was 4 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH = 7.5 with NaOH), 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. Pipette solution was 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH = 7.5 with KOH), 1 mm MgCl2,1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm EGTA (pH = 7.5 with KOH). Prior to electrophysiological measurements, test solutions were prepared by diluting stocks in bath solution, and control solutions were supplemented with equal levels of CHAPS. Holding voltage was –80 mV for all experiments with an interpulse interval of 1 s if not otherwise stated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCarbon atoms can be arranged into diverse geometries forming a number of stable nanostructures. For example, a graphene sheet can be seamlessly folded to form a long, single-wall, carbon nanotube with a diameter of ∼1 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). Bare carbon atoms can also be organized into spherical structures such as fullerenes. The most stable and readily available fullerene (Fig. 1C) is the C60 molecule, having an average diameter of 0.72 nm. In addition to these single layer structures, large nanotube and fullerenes can also be synthesized by superimposing concentric spherical or tubular layers to form onion-like clusters (Fig. 1D) or multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) (Fig. 1E). The range of diameters of the onions and MWNTs used in this study were 3–5 and 10–15 nm, respectively. To assay whether nanotubes, C60 fullerene, and fullerene-like onions can interact with ion-channels, we conducted electrophysiological experiments on different pore-forming channel subunits heterologously expressed in mammalian (CHO) cells. Surprisingly, as-fabricated and purified SWNTs had a significant effect on channels formed by Caenorhabditis elegans EXP-2, KVS-1, human KCNQ1 and Kv4.2 (not shown) as well as HERG potassium channels but not on endogenous CHO cell ClC-3 channels (Fig. 2, A–E) (5.Davis J.

Qualitatively, these molecules acted to inhibit each current to a different extent, with KCNQ1 and HERG being the more susceptible proteins. Here, we use HERG as a representative example. Effects on EXP-2, Kv4.2, KVS-1, and KCNQ1 were significant but not conceptually different from those on HERG and are not covered in detail. Fig. 2E shows whole-cell HERG currents recorded in the absence and the presence of the SWNTs in the test solutions. SWNT inhibition was reversible, suggesting that the interaction takes place within extra-cellular domains of the channel. Calculated dose-response relationships for SWNTs with an average diameter of 1.3 nm fitted well to the Hill equation with Ki = 0.023 ± 0.003 mg/ml and a Hill coefficient n = 1.0 ± 0.1, suggesting that the blockade is not cooperative (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2SWNTs and fullerenes interact with a variety of potassium channels in CHO cells. In these experiments, SWNTs with diameters peaked at ∼1.3 nm, and fullerenes with an average diameter of 0.72 nm were used at a 0.1 mg/ml concentration. A, KCNQ1 channels blocked by SWNTs. Currents were evoked by 1-s voltage steps from –80 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. B, C. elegans KVS-1 channels are inhibited by SWNTs. Currents were elicited by 0.1 voltage steps from –80 to +120 mV in 20 mV increments. C, fullerenes block C. elegans EXP-2 currents. Channels were studied in a high K+ (100 mm) solution to magnify tail currents that were evoked by a prepulse to 20 mV followed by test pulses from –120 to 0 mV in 20 mV increments. D, chloride currents endogenously expressed in CHO cells are not blocked by SWNTs. Currents were elicited essentially as described for panel B by using voltage steps from –80 to +80 mV. E, HERG tail currents in the absence or presence of SWNTs. Currents were elicited by 0.5-s preconditioning pulses from –80 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments followed by 1-s test pulse to –40 mV. F, current-dose relationships in the presence of the indicated amounts of SWNTs in the bath. Tail currents were measured at the end of the repolarizing pulse, and data were fit to the Hill functionKin/(Kin+[SWNT]n) with Ki = 0.021 ± 0.005 mg/ml and n = 1.2 ± 0.2. Data are from five cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HERG channels open when depolarized to positive voltages; they are described as inwardly rectifying, however, because net ion movement through these channels is inward with symmetrical K+. This conduction mechanism is the consequence of two singular gating characteristics, rapid inactivation and slow deactivation (12.Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. 1987; 387: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13.Smith P. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), as shown by the sequence shown in Equation 1,C⇌O⇌I(Eq. 1) where C, O and I represent the closed, open, and inactivated state respectively. Rapid inactivation means that, when the channel is opened by depolarization, it enters a non-conducting (inactivated) state passing very little current. In contrast, when the membrane potential is returned to its resting value (repolarization), the channel probably retraces its conformational steps and passes through the open state on the way back to the closed configuration. The return to the closed state, or deactivation, is slow and, therefore, the channel spends a significant time in the conducting open state. SWNTs exerted several effects on HERG gating (Fig. 3, A–F). They lowered the half-maximal threshold for activation (Fig. 3A) and speeded deactivation at any voltage (∼2-fold; Fig. 3, B and C). These gating modifications, however, can account only marginally for the instantaneous decrease of the tail current (Fig. 2E) that appears to be the principal cause of blocking. We noticed that depolarization increased current inhibition (Fig. 3D), which was also dependent on the duration of the depolarizing pulse (Fig. 3E). Although sustained depolarization produced larger tail currents (by moving an increasingly large number of channels into the inactivated state), in the presence of SWNTs this effect was significantly suppressed (Fig. 3E). These observations can be interpreted by assuming that either the SWNTs impair the forward transition from the open to the inactivated state (O → I) or that, alternatively, they impair the reverse transition (I → O) by stabilizing the inactive state. In the presence of SWNTs, the number of inactivated channels was significantly increased compared with control conditions (Fig. 3F), and, thus, we conclude that the blockade results from the combined effect of stabilizing the channel in the inactivated state and accelerating deactivation kinetics. Other mechanisms seem less likely; for example, a process in which the SWNTs prevent the channel to open (C → O) could be possible in principle but would challenge the observation that depolarization facilitates block (Fig. 3D). The fact that as-fabricated and purified SWNTs are chemically inert suggests that the geometry and not the chemical nature of the molecule must be the primary factor governing blockade. Fig. 3G shows the dependence of the inhibition constant Ki, assumed to be an indicator of blocking efficiency, as a function of nanotube/nanoparticle diameter for HERG, KCNQ1, and KVS-1. The extent of the block varies among channel types, but in all cases blocking is stronger with small diameters and is suppressed with large diameter nanostructures (MWNTs did not exert any block; in Fig. 3 the Ki is fixed to the astronomical 1 kg/ml value for fitting purposes). Thus, SWNTs having an average diameter of 0.9 nm blocked better than those with a diameter of 1.3 nm with Ki(0.9)/Ki(1.3) ratios of 1.9, 1.5, and 1.4 for HERG, KCNQ1, and KVS-1, respectively. Block was affected not only by the dimensions but also by the shape of the molecule. In Fig. 3H we compare the effects of fullerenes and nanotubes at a fixed concentration (0.1 mg/ml) in the test solution. Both small diameter nanotubes (i.e. SWNTs) and the C60 fullerene blocked HERG channels and, significantly, the former were roughly 3- to 2-fold more efficient. We conclude that geometrical factors play a key role in determining a blockade whose relative intensity is probably affected by structural differences among the various channel types.Fig. 3The geometrical basis of nanotube blockade. In these experiments, filled symbols indicate the absence and open symbols the presence of 0.1 mg/ml SWNTs in the test solutions. A, steady-state activation is altered by SWNTs. Voltage protocol is in the inset. Lines according to the Boltzmann equation {1 + EXP((V½ – V)/Vs)}–1, where V½ is half-maximal voltage and Vs the slope factor. V½ was 6.9 ± 0.5 mV and –8.3 ± 2.2 mV and Vs was 9.4 ± 0.4 mV and 15.4 ± 2.0 mV in the absence and presence of SWNTs, respectively. Data are from four cells. B and C, voltage dependence of deactivation kinetics. Deactivating tail currents were evoked by the voltage protocol shown in the inset (0.5-s depolarizing steps to +20 mV; 1-s test pulses from –120 to 40 mV in 20-mV increments) and fitted to a double exponential function Io + If e–t/τf + Is + Is e –t/τs. Data are from groups of five cells. D and E, dependence of block on the magnitude and duration of depolarization. In panel D, steady-state fractional tail current at –40 mV was evaluated as a function of the indicated depolarizing pulses. Depolarization increases inhibition, suggesting that opening of the channel is a prerequisite for block. Under the same conditions as in panel D, tail currents were evaluated in panel E as a function of the duration of the depolarizing step (in the inset in panel D the bar indicates a 20-mV variable prepulse in 16-ms increments followed by a 1-s repolarizing step to –40 mV). Data were normalized to the amplitude of the control current at time = 0. Data are from four cells. F, steady-state inactivation was evaluated by using a voltage protocol in which channel inactivation comes to equilibrium at various voltages during a prepulse so brief that little deactivation can occur; then, the fraction of channels in the inactive state is assessed by stepping the voltage to a test potential (inset depicts a 1-s depolarizing step to +20 mV, 30-ms repolarizing steps from –120 to 0 mV in 10-mV increments followed by a 1-s depolarizing step to + 20 mV). For comparison, data were normalized. Data are from groups of four cells. G, SWNTs block various K+ selective pores differently. Inhibition constants were obtained by fitting dose-response curves to the Hill function (see Fig. 2F) and fitted to the function a + bxc, with c varying from 7 to 3 in the cases considered. Nanotubes having the smallest diameter (0.9 nm) exerted maximum block on all of the three different channel types. Data are from groups of 3–5 cells. H, dependence of block on the shape and diameter of nanostructures. HERG channels were exposed to test solutions containing nanotubes (N) or fullerenes having the indicated average diameters. With both basic shapes, large diameter nanoparticles did not block the channels. In all cases, p < 0.05. Data are from groups of 3–5 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Docking simulations with the crystal structure of KcsA (Fig. 4A) provide insights into the geometrical basis of these interactions (14.Doyle D. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R. Kuo A. Gulbis J. Cohen S. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar). In KcsA, a fullerene with a diameter of 0.72 nm can fit into the mouth of the selectivity filter and, like a cork in a bottle, obstruct the flow of ions (Figs. 4, B–C). Similarly, larger onions or MWNTs (that have diameters ≥3 nm) would be too big to fit into this or other channel crevices. The case of SWNTs is more intriguing, considering that these structures block more efficiently than fullerenes (Fig. 3G). SWNT synthesis and purification can result in two physically distinct and co-existing species, namely SWNTs having spherically shaped closed ends (Fig. 4D) and those in which one or both ends are open (Figs. 4, E–F). Thus, the same considerations used for fullerenes can be evoked to explain the interaction of closed end SWNTs with the selectivity filter (Fig. 4D). However, open-ended SWNTs might be the most efficient type because the rim can be chemically reactive. Fig. 4, E–F shows open-ended SWNTs with different diameters sitting and stably anchoring on the top of the selectivity filter after having established weak electrical and/or chemical bonds. It is a common view that the three-dimensional structure of the pore and the selectivity filter is conserved among K+ channels because of their universal TVGYG signature (15.Heginbotham L. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1992; 258: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), a notion corroborated by the recent crystallization of a bacterial, voltage-gated K+ channel (16.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that phylogenetically distant K+ channels all appear susceptible to nanotubes, whereas chloride channels are not. Local structural differences must also exist, however, to account for the diverse extent of blocks exhibited by different channel types.Fig. 4Nanotubes block K+ channels through a pore occlusion mechanism.A, the crystal structure of the KscA K+ channel. This and other images were constructed by RasMol and the file 1BL8 from the Protein Data Bank. B and C, docking simulation of a fullerene.

D, docking simulation of a capped SWNT showing that, because of its spherical end, it can fit into the selectivity filter like a fullerene. The figure shows a SWNT with an average diameter of 0.9 nm, similar to those used in this report. E and F, docking simulation of an open-ended SWNT. An open-ended nanotube can sit on top of the selectivity filter establishing weak bonds. Simulations of SWNTs with average diameters of 0.9 and 1.3 nm are shown in panels E and F, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SWNTs constitute a new class of universal K+ channel inhibitors exploiting rather elementary principles of blocking. The mechanism appears to be governed by geometrical factors and lacks any other physical/chemical component that is usually required by conventional agents. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) ions, for instance, are driven into and clog K+ pores by their free positive charge. Short chain scorpion toxins accomplish docking by establishing electrochemical bonds with specific residues of the target protein (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In contrast, SWNTs do not resort to any of those mechanisms but instead hamper channel function probably by fitting into the pore and thus either hindering ion movement or alternatively preventing further conformational steps. In virtue of their electrochemical neutrality, nanotubes can provide precise information about ion channel structures. For instance, our data suggest that the pore vestibules of different K+ channel subunits such as HERG, KCNQ1, and KVS have variable dimensions, with HERG being the larger and KVS the narrower. SWNTs are singular materials with unique characteristics. Here we unveil another previously unknown novel property of these materials that represents a further step forward in the effort to utilize them for biological purposes. Because of the physiological role they play, ion channels exhibit unique structures, including the pore that provides the physical pathway for ion movements across the plasma membrane and several charged domains that attract and/or repel ions (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). These characteristics make ion channels easy targets for external agents such as natural toxins and synthetic drugs that react with them by establishing electrochemical interactions. Thus, blocking agents have been used not only as the basic components for commercial pesticides and potential therapeutic drugs but also to infer functional information (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2013044317,"Recent data have implicated the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) in a diverse array of physiological pathways, raising the question of how biological specificity is maintained. Partial clarification derived from the observation that mice deficient in either of the two isoforms, Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ, demonstrate distinct abnormalities, i.e. reduced organismal size or insulin resistance, respectively. However, the question still persists as to whether these divergent phenotypes are due exclusively to tissue-specific differences in isoform expression or distinct capacities for signaling intrinsic to the two proteins. Here we show that Akt2/PKBβ-/- adipocytes derived from immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts display significantly reduced insulin-stimulated hexose uptake, clearly establishing that the partial defect in glucose disposal in these mice derives from lack of a cell autonomous function of Akt2/PKBβ. Moreover, in adipocytes differentiated from primary fibroblasts or immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts, and brown preadipocytes the absence of Akt2/PKBβ resulted in reduction of insulin-induced hexose uptake and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation, whereas Akt1/PKBα was dispensable for this effect. Most importantly, hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation were completely restored after re-expression of Akt2/PKBβ in Akt2/PKBβ-/- adipocytes, but overexpression of Akt1/PKBα at comparable levels was ineffective at rescuing insulin action to normal. These results show that the Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ isoforms are uniquely adapted to preferentially transmit distinct biological signals, and this property is likely to contribute significantly to the ability of Akt/PKB to play a role in diverse processes.

A critical problem in signal transduction research is understanding how a limited number of protein kinases or other signaling molecules can couple to a vast array of physiological actions and yet retain specificity. For example, the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB 1The abbreviations used are: PKBprotein kinase BGLUT4glucose transporter 4MEFmouse embryo fibroblastC/EBPαCAAT enhancer-binding protein αGFPgreen fluorescence proteinIRSinsulin receptor substrateHAhemagglutininWTwild type. has been implicated in processes as diverse as carbohydrate metabolism, cell growth, anti-apoptosis, and angiogenesis, yet agonists that activate Akt/PKB are capable of regulating single responses in a time- and cell-specific manner (1.Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Although tissue-specific expression of protein kinases might contribute to specificity, the virtually ubiquitous distribution of many critical signaling molecules including Akt/PKB makes this an unlikely general mechanism. The existence of gene families has been often invoked as a strategy to confer specificity in signaling, but in fact there are few examples of well defined differences in the signaling capabilities of homologous isoforms. The Akt/PKB subfamily consists of three closely related species, Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ (2.Murthy S.S. Tosolini A. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All three gene products are similar in structure and size and are regulated by similar mechanisms involving the 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent stimulation (1.Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). However, no differences in substrate specificity have been established, and there are few convincing examples in which unique downstream pathways are modulated by the three enzymes (3.Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). protein kinase B glucose transporter 4 mouse embryo fibroblast CAAT enhancer-binding protein α green fluorescence protein insulin receptor substrate hemagglutinin wild type. Akt/PKB has been strongly implicated in the insulin-promoted storage of nutrients in muscle and adipose tissue. An impairment in insulin ability to maintain normal glucose homeostasis, a condition termed insulin resistance, predisposes to the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (4.Hunter S.J. Garvey W.T. Am. J. Med. 1998; 105: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Some of the strongest data suggest differences in the roles of Akt/PKB isoforms in these processes. For example, the levels of Akt2/PKBβ increase during the differentiation of cells into insulin-responsive adipocytes, whereas the expression of Akt1/PKBα declines, consistent with a role for Akt2/PKBβ in adipose cell function (5.Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Summers S.A. Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Akt1/PKBα exists primarily in the cytosolic fraction, whereas significant amounts of Akt2/PKBβ reside in a membrane fraction that also contains the intracellular compartment housing the insulin-responsive GLUT4 glucose transporter (7.Calera M.R. Martinez C. Liu H. Jack A.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akt2/PKBβ can phosphorylate component proteins in this GLUT4-positive compartment (8.Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these biochemical data is confounded by the relatively higher level of expression of Akt2/PKBβ in adipocytes compared with Akt1/PKBα. Nonetheless, based on these data, it was proposed that the Akt2/PKBβ isoform might be more important in mediating the insulin effect on such metabolic functions as glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. Confirmation of the importance and distinct role of Akt2/PKBβ in the physiological response to insulin derived from animal studies, in which it was shown that mice lacking Akt2/PKBβ displayed insulin resistance and a diabetes-like syndrome (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mice lacking Akt1/PKBα demonstrated normal glucose homeostasis but were small throughout life (10.Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 11.Cho H. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Feng F. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38349-38352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt1/PKBα seems to be involved predominantly in control of growth/proliferation, whereas Akt2/PKBβ regulates cellular metabolism. Nonetheless, there are several ambiguities in such in vivo studies that preclude a mechanistic interpretation. First, because all the cells were lacking in Akt/PKB, it is unclear whether the insulin resistance in liver and muscle represents a cell autonomous defect. This problem is of particularly concern when studying integrative metabolism, since distant effects produced by non-endocrine organs have been well established (12.Burcelin R. Dolci W. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13.Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Second, and more importantly, the in vivo experiments leave unresolved whether isoform-specific phenotypes relate to differences in the level and distribution of the Akt/PKB forms or to distinct capacities for signaling intrinsic to each of the proteins. To clarify these issues, we have established hormone-responsive cell lines lacking either Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ. We show here that insulin-induced glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation are preferentially mediated by Akt2/PKBβ. Cell Lines—Primary mouse fibroblasts were established from E13.5 embryos. Embryos were dissected from pregnant Akt1/PKBα+/-;Akt2/PKBβ+/- females that had been bred to Akt1/PKBα+/-;Akt2/PKBβ+/- males. The yolk sacs, heads, and internal organs were isolated and used for genotyping by reverse transcription-PCR. Carcasses were utilized for the preparation of immortalized fibroblasts by continuous culturing for 30 passages as described previously (14.Todaro G.J. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Brown adipose cell lines were generated by a modification of a previously described protocol (15.Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, interscapular brown adipose tissue was isolated from 6-week-old mice, minced, and subjected to collagenase digestion (1 mg/ml in isolation buffer containing 0.123 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 100 mm Hepes-OH pH 7.3, and 4% bovine serum albumin). Digested tissue was overlaid onto a fetal bovine serum cushion for 10 min. The upper phase consisting of precursor cells was washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 7.5% CO2. After reaching 80% confluence, cells were infected with the retroviral vector pBABE containing an insert encoding SV40 large T antigen (kindly provided by Dr. C. Ronald Kahn at Joslin Institute, Boston) for 48 h. After infection, the brown adipose precursor cells were maintained in culture medium for 72 h and then subjected to selection with puromycin (10 μg/ml) for at least 2 weeks. Retroviral Infection and Adipocyte Differentiation—Generation of retrovirus was as described previously with slight modifications (16.Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5276-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, ecotropic BOSC cells (a gift from Warren S. Pear, University of Pennsylvania) were transiently transfected with pVSV G and pCgp pantropic retroviral packaging constructs and retroviral vector (pMIGR1-Akt/PKB, pMSCV-C/EBPα, or pBABE-SV40T) (17.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Cell-free viral supernatants were harvested at 24 h and used to infect immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells. pMIGR-Akt/PKB contains kinase as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) separated by an internal ribosome entry site, and thus, relative expression was assessed by GFP expression. To obtain enhanced differentiation, immortalized MEF cells or Akt/PKB-expressing cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding C/EBPα, a gift from Dr. Mitchell A. Lazar at University of Pennsylvania. Cells were incubated with viral supernatant for 2 days followed by selection in 10 μg/ml puromycin. Pre-brown adipocytes were immortalized by infection with puromycin-resistant pBABE vector encoding SV40 large T antigen as described above. Clones of resistant cells were pooled and used for all experiments. Adipose differentiation was induced by treatment with 2 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 0.1 mg/ml Troglitazone (BI-OMOL) as described (16.Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5276-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Brown adipocytes were differentiated as described previously (15.Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 8-10 days after initiation of differentiation. Immunocytochemistry—Differentiated cells were serum-starved for 12 h before exposure to 100 nm insulin for 20 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Science), permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 1 h followed by rhodamine Red-X- or Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were mounted with anti-fading reagent (2% N-propyl gallate in 80% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline solution) and images obtained using an Ultraview spinning disc confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 60× magnification. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake and GLUT4 Translocation Assays—2-Deoxy-d-glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by plasma sheet assay were as described previously (18.Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digital image acquisition, processing, and automated quantitation of plasma membrane fluorescence intensity were performed using MetaMorph imaging system software (Universal Imaging Corp., Westchester, PA). To create a mask for identification of areas of interest, we used caveolin immunostaining. Eight randomly selected fields of view were analyzed per experiment. All experiments were performed at least three times and presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.) of triplicates. Western Blotting and General Reagents—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA/EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol. Cell lysates (40 μg) were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7-18% gradient polyacrylamide gel under reduced conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were subjected to immunoblotting using the indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-C/EBPα and anti-hemagglutinin were from Santa Cruz, anti-pan caveolin antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratory, and anti-insulin receptor, anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS2, and anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies. Anti-UCP-1 was obtained from Oncogene Science. Anti-aP2 antibody was a generous gift of Dr. David A. Bernlohr (University of Minnesota). All other high quality reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated elsewhere. Defects in GLUT4 Translocation in Akt2/PKBβ-deficient Fat Cells—Previously, we have shown that mice lacking Akt2/PKBβ display a diabetes-like syndrome (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the phenotype derives from a systemic failure in the knockout animals or a cell autonomous inability of insulin to signal to glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in target cells. As an initial approach to this problem we measured glucose uptake into adipocytes isolated from Akt2/PKBβ-/- mice. As shown in Fig. 1, Akt2/PKBβ-/- adipose cells took up less glucose than wild type cells at all insulin concentrations tested. This indicates that a loss in Akt2/PKBβ-/- impairs glucose uptake in freshly isolated adipocytes, as it does in skeletal muscle (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). To further resolve whether this was a cell-autonomous defect, we established MEF cells from each combination of genotypes, i.e. wild type (WT), Akt1/PKBα-/- (1KO), Akt2/PKBβ-/- (2KO), and Akt1/PKBα-/-;Akt2/PKBβ-/- (DKO). Expression of both Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ are undetectable in the expected knockout cell lines, as shown in Fig. 2A. Primary MEF cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes solely by treatment with differentiation mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures,” about 10∼20% of WT and 2KO cells differentiated into fat cells, whereas the differentiation of 1KO cells was less than 1% (data not shown). DKO primary fibroblasts appeared completely incapable of differentiation. Nonetheless, even in 1KO cells, adipocytes were unambiguously identified by the appearance of fat droplets and, more definitively, significant amounts of caveolin, whose expression dramatically increased during adipogenesis, and then assessed for insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation by confocal microscopy (19.Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Stimulation with insulin of either WT or 1KO cells, but not 2KO adipocytes, resulted in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). These results, although non-quantitative, suggest that Akt1/PKBα preferentially regulates adipogenesis, whereas Akt2/PKBβ is more critical to GLUT4 translocation. Defects in Deoxyglucose Uptake in Adipocytes Derived from Immortalized MEF Cells—To achieve a higher efficiency of differentiation, we first generated spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts by continuous passage of MEFs. As expected, insulin stimulated a modest, 2-fold increase in deoxyglucose in these cells (Fig. 3). Although there was a trend for decreased insulin-stimulated transport in all of the mutant cells lines, none of these achieved statistical significance (p > 0.05). To assess the consequences of Akt/PKB loss on deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes, we expressed C/EBPα, a known adipogenic transcription factor, in immortalized fibroblast cells (20.Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). As assessed either by accumulation of fat droplets or the induction of adipose-specific markers, expression of C/EBPα induced differentiation only in WT and 2KO cells about 90∼95% but not in 1KO and DKO cells, consistent with the data presented above using primary cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Defects in differentiation of 1KO and DKO cells were not due to differences in C/EBPα expression, since the levels of C/EBPα among the cell lines were quite similar (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, insulin-induced hexose uptake into 2KO adipocytes was only about 60% of that in WT cells. Rescue of Hexose Uptake and GLUT4 Translocation in 2KO Cells by Re-expression of Akt2/PKBβ but Not by Akt1/PKBα —The demonstration that only 2KO fat cells displayed reduced hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation after exposure to insulin still left unresolved whether this isoform specificity was caused by properties intrinsic to the kinase or simply to cell context. To resolve this issue we assessed both hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 2KO cells expressing retrovirally transduced Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ at equivalent levels (Fig. 5A). Expression was monitored by GFP fluorescence, as both Akt/PKB and GFP are translated from a single mRNA containing an intervening internal ribosome entry site. As shown in Fig. 5B, both Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ were expressed appropriately in GFP-positive cells. Expression of HA-Akt2/PKBβ was about 2∼3-fold higher than that of endogenous Akt2/PKBβ, and HA-Akt1/PKBα levels exceeded those of HA-Akt2/PKBβ by about 2-fold (Fig. 5C). Infection with a retrovirus encoding HA-Akt1/PKBα elevated amounts of this isoform 8-10-fold (Fig. 5C). Expression of Akt2/PKBβ but not Akt1/PKBα restored hormone-dependent hexose uptake completely (Fig. 6A). In a further effort to more quantitatively measure GLUT4 translocation, we utilized the plasma membrane sheet assay (18.Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 was about 6∼7-fold in WT cells, which is similar to that reported previously in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6, B and C) (16.Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5276-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in 2KO cells insulin stimulated only a 4-fold increase in GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. Re-expression of Akt2/PKBβ in 2KO cells completely restored insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation, whereas expression of Akt1/PKBα to ∼2-fold more than Akt2/PKBβ was without effect. It is striking that the diminution in insulin-stimulated hexose uptake precisely paralleled that of GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 6). These results indicate that Akt2/PKBβ is more effective than Akt1/PKBα in conveying the signal for accelerated glucose uptake in adipose cells, and this is likely to be mediated exclusively by translocation of GLUT4.Fig. 6Rescue of insulin-stimulated hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by re-expression of Akt2/PKBβ but not Akt1/PKB in Akt2/PKBβ-/- cells. Immortalized fibroblasts were induced to differentiate into adipose cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 9 days, cells were utilized for experiments. A, 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the absence or presence of insulin. Data are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. B, adipocyte cells were treated with either vehicle or insulin (100 nm) for 20 min. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared and stained for GLUT4 (red) and caveolin (green). C, quantitation of GLUT4 translocation was performed using MetaMorph software as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22.Klein J. Fasshauer M. Klein H.H. Benito M. Kahn C.R. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The levels of expression of either Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ were verified by Western blotting with specific antibodies against each isoform, providing further confirmation of the genotype (Fig. 7A). In contrast to differentiation induced by forced expression of C/EBPα, spontaneous differentiation of brown preadipocytes proceeded equally well for WT, Akt1/PKBα-/-, and Akt2/PKBβ-/- exposed to differentiation mixture (Fig. 7B). As above, adipose conversion was assessed by accumulation of lipid droplets as well as Western blot of several adipose marker proteins and the brown fat cell specific marker protein, UCP-1. In addition, expression of insulin receptor, IRS-1 and IRS-2, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase were unchanged in the KO lines (Fig. 7C). Most importantly, we measured insulin-induced hexose uptake in these brown adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 7D, complete loss of Akt2/PKBβ caused a significant reduction in insulin-induced hexose uptake, whereas a deficiency of Akt1/PKBα produced only a marginal reduction. GLUT4 translocation precisely paralleled hexose uptake, with a significant reduction only in Akt2/PKBβ-/- cells (Fig. 7E). Effect of Akt/PKB on GLUT1 Translocation—In cultured adipocytes, although GLUT4 displays the greatest “fold” stimulation in response to insulin, the GLUT1 glucose transporter also translocates to the cell surface (23.Mueckler M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 6-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been suggested that different signaling pathways regulate the two carriers (24.Foran P.G. Fletcher L.M. Oatey P.B. Mohammed N. Dolly J.O. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28087-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of Akt/PKB loss on GLUT1 translocation in brown adipocytes. As expected, GLUT1 was readily visualized at the plasma membrane and translocated 1.5-2-fold in response to insulin in WT cells. Interestingly, disruption of either the Akt1/PKBα-/- or Akt2/PKBβ-/- gene did not affect the basal, surface level of GLUT1, but loss of Akt2/PKBβ appeared to block the insulin-induced translocation of the transporter (Fig. 8). Previously, we reported that Akt2/PKBβ-deficient mice display moderate glucose intolerance due at least in part to insulin resistance (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). However, those studies left unresolved two important issues, first, whether the insulin resistance was because of a lack of Akt/PKB signaling in the target cell, i.e. if the defect was cell autonomous, and second, the mechanism underlying the apparent isoform specificity. In regard to the latter, it was possible that the marked differences in phenotype for the Akt2/PKBβ-/- mice compared with the Akt1/PKBα-/- animals might well have been caused by tissue-specific patterns of expression as opposed signaling capabilities intrinsic to each of the isoforms (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 10.Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38349-38352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). In the current study we answer each of these questions. By examining insulin-dependent physiological responses in cells immortalized from Akt/PKB knockout mice, we show conclusively that Akt2/PKBβ is required in a cell autonomous manner for maximal hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. Importantly, this is not due simply to the level of the kinase expression or the nature of the immortalized cell, as indicated by two critical observations. First, reintroduction Akt2/PKBβ, but not Akt1/PKBα in the same cell lines completely restores hormone-responsive hexose flux and transporter translocation. Second, in precisely the same immortalized cell lines, adipogenesis is abrogated in Akt1/PKBα null cells but not Akt2/PKBβ. The ability of each kinase isoform to preferentially signal to distinct biological responses in identical cell lines provides a convincing demonstration of the capacity of individual Akt members to link to specific downstream pathways. Several previous studies have implicated differential signaling capabilities for pathways upstream of Akt/PKB. Cells from IRS1-null mice are defective in differentiation into brown fat cells (25.Fasshauer M. Klein J. Kriauciunas K.M. Ueki K. Benito M. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the lack of IRS1 selectively reduced Akt1/PKBα activation. However, IRS2 appeared to be more capable than IRS1 of conveying the insulin-dependent signal to GLUT4 translocation in immortalized murine brown adipocytes, reminiscent of our results, in which Akt2/PKBβ is crucial for the same response (26.Fasshauer M. Klein J. Ueki K. Kriauciunas K.M. Benito M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whether the different IRS isoforms are capable of selectively activating distinct Akt/PKB proteins is an intriguing idea worthy of additional study. Recent studies using small interfering RNA strategy have also demonstrated that Akt2/PKBβ was more important in mediating insulin-induced glucose uptake (27.Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 28.Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Akt1/PKBα did not significantly affect insulin-induced glucose uptake, whereas knockdown of Akt2/PKBβ reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake. Like the studies in this report involving complete loss of an Akt isoform, these previous experiments with small interfering RNA strategy showed that knockdown of Akt1/PKBα slightly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas reduction of Akt2/PKBβ caused about a 60% of decrease in glucose uptake. However, the studies presented herein provide two additional insights. First, they show that the incomplete ablation of insulin-dependent hexose uptake using small interfering RNA strategy for either Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ is not due to failure to eliminate all expression of the relevant isoform. Second, and more importantly, they provide strong support for the idea that isoform specificity is not due solely to levels of expression but is derived from properties intrinsic to each of the Akt isoforms. Although Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ seem to have preferential specificity for different physiological responses, it is notable that the absence of Akt2/PKBβ in cultured adipocytes did not result in complete loss of the ability of insulin to stimulate hexose uptake, but only a partial abrogation. This correlates well with the in vivo metabolic studies of the Akt2/PKBβ knockout mice, in which there was only a partial defect in peripheral insulin action (9.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). One possibility is that functional complementation is provided by other Akt/PKB isoforms still present in the adipocyte. In 3T3-L1 cells, there is significant amount of Akt1/PKBα after differentiation. Moreover, it has been reported that 3T3-L1 cells also contain significant Akt3/PKBγ, although this has been difficult to study due to the lack of high quality antisera (29.Barthel A. Nakatani K. Dandekar A.A. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). That Akt1/PKBα can provide part of the function of Akt2/PKBβ in the absence of the latter is suggested by the observation that mice null for Akt2/PKBβ and lacking one allele of Akt1/PKBα are more glucose-intolerant than those homozygous null for Akt2/PKBβ alone. 2H. Cho, M. Mizrahi, and M. J. Birnbaum, unpublished observations. If this interpretation is correct, it is striking that even when overexpressed, Akt1/PKBα is incapable of restoring insulin action to wild type levels (Fig. 6). This result suggests that Akt2/PKBβ is unique in its ability to confer some aspect of signaling to GLUT4 translocation. An alternative interpretation of these data is that a signaling pathway that functions completely independent of Akt/PKB confer the residual insulin-responsive hexose transport present in Akt2/PKBβ null adipocytes. The molecular mechanism by which Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ could dictate specificity is unknown. In rodents and humans, Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ are encoded by distinct genes and share high sequence homology (2.Murthy S.S. Tosolini A. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the primary function of each of the Akt/PKB isozymes appears to be different. A plausible model to explain how each these closely related proteins maintain individual signaling capabilities is provided by the differential capacity of Akt1/PKBα to suppress c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation and neuronal apoptosis (31.Kim A.H. Yano H. Cho H. Meyer D. Monks B. Margolis B. Birnbaum M.J. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2002; 35: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this case specificity in conferred by the ability of Akt1/PKBα, but not Akt2/PKBβ, to bind via a non-catalytic domain to the scaffolding protein, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-interacting protein. We think it likely that such localization motifs will be important for conferring specificity to signaling through Akt/PKB. It is also notable that Akt2/PKBβ can modulate insulin-induced GLUT1 translocation but not basal recycling in brown adipocytes (Fig. 8). Because it has been shown that GLUT4 exists in at least two intracellular compartments, i.e. insulin-responsive compartment and recycling compartment (32.Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33.Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), these data suggest that Akt2/PKBβ contributes to the recruitment of insulin-responsive population of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Therefore, different subcellular localizations of Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ may explain a different physiological response of Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ. It is not clear at this time why our conclusions are different from Foran et al. (24.Foran P.G. Fletcher L.M. Oatey P.B. Mohammed N. Dolly J.O. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28087-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), who find that overexpression of Akt/PKB led to the translocation of GLUT4 but not GLUT1. It is possible that the strategies of overexpression versus loss of function may contribute to these differences or, on the other hand, are due simply to the difficulty inherent in measuring the rather modest change of GLUT1 on the cell surface. In summary, despite a high degree of sequence similarity, Akt1/PKBα and Akt2/PKBβ serve distinct cellular functions in regard to growth/differentiation and metabolism. Akt2/PKBβ is much more important for the control of glucose uptake through GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane than Akt1/PKBα. Identification of specific target proteins for either Akt1/PKBα or Akt2/PKBβ will be key to understanding how both isoforms confer different physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1975287242,"Glutaredoxin (GRX) is a small dithiol protein involved in various cellular functions, including the redox regulation of certain enzyme activities. GRX functions via a disulfide exchange reaction by utilizing the active site Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys. Here we demonstrated that overexpression of GRX protected cells from hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced apoptosis by regulating the redox state of Akt. Akt was transiently phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, and then degraded in cardiac H9c2 cells undergoing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis. Under stress, Akt underwent disulfide bond formation between Cys-297 and Cys-311 and dephosphorylation in accordance with an increased association with protein phosphatase 2A. Overexpression of GRX protected Akt from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation and suppressed recruitment of protein phosphatase 2A to Akt, resulting in a sustained phosphorylation of Akt and inhibition of apoptosis. This effect was reversed by cadmium, an inhibitor of GRX. Furthermore an <i>in vitro</i> assay revealed that GRX reduced oxidized Akt in concert with glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione-disulfide reductase. Thus, GRX plays an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis by regulating the redox state of Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2046982257,"The recent discovery of direct interactions between two important regulators of cell fate, the tumor suppressor p53 and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), led us to examine the mechanism and outcomes of this interaction. Two regions of p53 were identified that regulate its binding to GSK3β. Deletion of the p53 activation domain-1 (AD1), but not mutations that prevent MDM2 binding through the AD1 domain, enhanced GSK3β binding to p53, indicating that the AD1 domain interferes with p53 binding to GSK3β. Deletion of the p53 basic domain (BD) abrogated GSK3β binding, and a ten amino acid region within the C-terminal BD domain was identified as necessary for binding to GSK3β. GSK3β activity was not required for p53 binding, but inhibition of GSK3β stabilized the association, suggesting a transient interaction during which active GSK3β promotes actions of p53. This regulatory role of GSK3β was demonstrated by large reductions of p53-induced increases in the levels of MDM2, p21, and Bax when GSK3β was inhibited. Besides promoting p53-mediated transcription, GSK3β also contributed to mitochondrial p53 apoptotic signaling. After DNA damage, mitochondrial GSK3β co-immunoprecipitated with p53 and was activated, and inhibition of GSK3β blocked cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Thus, GSK3β interacts with p53 in both the nucleus and mitochondria and promotes its actions at both sites.

Thus, GSK3β interacts with p53 in both the nucleus and mitochondria and promotes its actions at both sites. The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a transcription factor that is activated by a wide variety of cellular stresses, notably including conditions that cause DNA damage (1.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W.

Post-translation modifications, such as phosphorylation or acetylation, and interactions with other proteins are important regulators of the level and activity of the normally short-lived p53 (3.Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 4.Haupt Y. Robles A.I. Prives C. Rotter V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8223-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, p53 binding by MDM2 enhances its degradation, while inhibition of MDM2 can result in stabilization and accumulation of p53. Activated p53 induces the expression of a variety of gene targets, including p21waf1/cip1, MDM2, Bax, and others, leading to two well-defined cellular responses, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Another enzyme that can contribute to apoptotic signaling is glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βAD1activation domain-1AD2activation domain 2BDbasic domainPRDproline-rich domainPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasetipoxadiazole2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)-[1,3,4]-oxadiazoleHAhemagglutinin. (5.Li X. Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Bipolar Disorders. 2002; 4: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). GSK3β is a serine/threonine kinase that plays crucial roles in development, such as in the Wnt developmentally regulated signaling pathway (6.Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Devel. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GSK3β is also a critical component in several receptor-coupled signaling pathways (7.Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), such as those emanating from growth factor-stimulated receptors that activate the intermediary protein kinase Akt, which phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3β (8.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Additionally, activated GSK3β has been shown to promote apoptotic signaling in a number of conditions (9.Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Especially noteworthy was the finding that apoptosis induced by the overexpression of GSK3β was p53-dependent (10.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several apoptotic stimuli recently were found to cause the accumulation of GSK3β in the nucleus, co-localizing it with p53 (15.Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Most recently, nuclear GSK3β was found to directly associate with p53 after DNA damage, and evidence that GSK3β contributes to p53-induced signaling was reported (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This evidence included the findings that p53-mediated increases in p21 protein levels and caspase-3 activation were blocked by lithium, a selective inhibitor of GSK3β (17.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc.

The present study was designed to further clarify the interactions between GSK3β and p53. The results identify two regions of p53 that regulate binding to GSK3β, demonstrate that inhibition of the activity of GSK3β stabilizes its association with p53, documents mitochondrial as well as nuclear association of GSK3β and p53, and show that GSK3β contributes to the transcriptional and apoptotic actions of p53. Cell Culture—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and p53-null human lung carcinoma H1299 cells that express inducible wild-type or mutated forms of p53 were grown as described previously (12.Bijur G.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (15.Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Drugs used include lithium (Sigma), rottlerin (Tocris), and 2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)-[1,3,4]-oxadiazole (tip-oxadiazole; marketed as GSK-3 Inhibitor II; Calbiochem). Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblotting, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 nm okadaic acid, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were collected in centrifuge tubes, sonicated, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, followed by incubation with protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were washed three times. Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were probed with antibodies to p53 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), GSK3β, p21, proteolyzed poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 85-kDa fragment (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-active casapse-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), p53 (Ab-2), MDM2 (Oncogene, San Diego, CA), or HA tag (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein bands were quantitated with a densitometer and each experiment was carried out two or more times. GSK3β Activity—The activity of GSK3β was measured essentially as described previously (12.Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated and activity was measured by incubation in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi [γ-32P]ATP; Amersham Biosciences), with 0.1 μg/μl recombinant tau protein (Panvera, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 30 °C. Laemmli sample buffer (25 μl) was added to stop the reaction. Samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, proteins were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to a phosphoscreen overnight, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The efficiency of GSK3β immunoprecipitation was determined by immunoblotting for GSK3β. Northern Analysis—Northern blot measurements were carried out as described previously (19.Song L. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29689-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. p21 or MDM2 cDNA (18.Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized with labeled probes at 42 °C for 18 h and then washed in two changes of 2× saline-sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS at 20 °C for 20 min and once in 1× saline-sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 10 min. Results were obtained using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and bands were quantitated using ImageQuant. All experiments were repeated two or more times. p53 Domains Regulating Its Interaction with GSK3β—In order to identify the domains of p53 that regulate its interaction with GSK3β, we used p53-null H1299 cells that inducibly express HA-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants of p53, which have been described previously (18.Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The domains of p53 that were investigated are diagrammed in Fig. 1A. In addition to wild-type p53, we studied p53 with deletions of the activation domain 2 (ΔAD2) comprising residues 43–63, of the activation domain 1 (ΔAD1) comprising residues 1–42, of the proline-rich domain (ΔPRD) comprising residues 64–92, and of the C-terminal basic domain (ΔBD) comprising residues 364–393. For each of these, cells expressing wild-type and mutant p53 were examined in parallel. After 24 h of induced expression of p53, cells were harvested, nuclear fractions were prepared, the levels of nuclear p53 were measured by immunoblot analysis, and GSK3β was immunoprecipitated. This was followed by measurements of the levels of immunoprecipitated GSK3β and of co-immunoprecipitated p53 to identify which domains of p53 affected its association with GSK3β. Results obtained with ΔAD2-p53 and ΔAD1-p53 are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. The expression level of ΔAD2-p53 in the nucleus was nearly identical (89 ± 8%; mean ± S.E.; n = 4) to that of wild-type p53, with ΔAD2-p53 demonstrating slightly faster mobility than wild-type p53 due to the deletion of the AD2 domain (Fig. 1B). Additionally, equal amounts of nuclear GSK3β were immunoprecipitated from each cell line, and a similar amount of ΔAD2-p53 (76 ± 19%; n = 3) as wild-type p53 co-immunoprecipitated with the GSK3β (Fig. 1B). Thus, the AD2 domain of p53 does not participate in regulating binding to GSK3β. Different results were obtained with ΔAD1-p53 (Fig. 1C). The levels of nuclear ΔAD1-p53 were higher than wild-type p53 (208 ± 53% of wild-type p53; p < 0.05; n = 4) because p53 stability is increased by deletion of the MDM2 binding site in the AD1 domain of p53. Most notably, although equivalent amounts of nuclear GSK3β were immunoprecipitated, greater amounts of ΔAD1-p53 compared with wild-type p53 co-immunoprecipitated with GSK3β (1381 ± 543% of wild-type p53; p < 0.05; n = 4). Thus, the amount of p53 associated with GSK3β normalized to the nuclear level of p53 was 6-fold greater for ΔAD1-p53 than wild-type p53 (6.1 ± 1.1 compared with the ratio with wild-type p53; p < 0.05; n = 4). These data show that deletion of the AD1 domain facilitates the association of GSK3β and p53, indicating that the AD1 region of p53 can interfere with the binding of GSK3β to p53. This inhibition could be due to interference of the AD1 domain of p53 with the binding of GSK3β, or due to impaired access of GSK3β to p53 by MDM2 bound to the AD1 domain of wild-type p53. To examine this question further, we studied the association of GSK3β with a p53 construct, AD1(–), containing an intact AD1 domain but with two point mutations (L22Q, W23S) which inhibit MDM2 binding to p53 (20.Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). After induction the level of AD1(–)-p53 was extremely high, therefore expression was controlled by titration of the doxycycline concentration to obtain a level of AD1(–)-p53 similar to that of fully induced wild-type p53. Similarly, the expression of ΔAD1-p53 also was limited to match the level of wild-type p53. Using these methods, the expression levels of all p53 constructs were similar, as were the immunoprecipitated amounts of GSK3β (Fig. 1D). Upon examination of the co-immunoprecipitation of AD1(–)-p53 and wild-type p53 with GSK3β, these were found to be equivalent, whereas more ΔAD1-p53 (5-fold) co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1D). This result shows that eliminating the binding site for MDM2 was not sufficient to enhance the binding of p53 to GSK3β. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a functional AD1 domain of p53 has an inhibitory regulatory role in the association of p53 with GSK3β independently of the binding of MDM2. Comparisons of the association of GSK3β with p53 also were made using ΔPRD-p53 and ΔBD-p53. The levels of nuclear p53, immunoprecipitated GSK3β, and co-immunoprecipitated p53, were equivalent in cells expressing ΔPRD-p53 and wild-type p53 (Fig. 1E). In contrast, experiments with the p53 construct with deletion of the basic domain demonstrated that this region was critical for the association of p53 with GSK3β. Unlike all of the other p53 constructs, no ΔBD-p53 was detected in immunoprecipitates of GSK3β although the levels of nuclear p53 and of immunoprecipitated GSK3β were similar using cells expressing ΔBD-p53 and wild-type p53 (Fig. 1E). This result indicated that the BD domain was necessary for the binding of GSK3β to p53. To examine this further, we used cells expressing p53 containing a partial deletion (residues 374–393) of the BD domain (residues 364–393). These measurements revealed that Δ(374–393)-p53 co-immunoprecipitated with GSK3β equivalently with wild-type p53 (Fig. 1F). Taken together these results indicate that residues 364–373 of p53, consisting of the amino acid sequence AHSSHLKSKK, are critical for the association of p53 with GSK3β (Fig. 1G). Recent structural studies of GSK3β have demonstrated that a phosphorylated serine on a GSK3β substrate binds the “primed substrate binding pocket” of GSK3β to facilitate phosphorylation by GSK3β of a serine four amino acids removed from the phosphorylated serine (21.Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 22.Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Within this binding pocket of GSK3β is arginine-96, which is critical for binding to primed substrates, and mutated R96A-GSK3β is unable to bind primed substrates (22.Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The sequence of the GSK3β-binding region of p53 contains a potential “primed” phosphorylation site for GSK3β binding, SXXXS(p), if serine 371 of p53 is phosphorylated. Although this is unlikely since little post-translational modifications occur when p53 is overexpressed in unstressed cells, to test if p53 binds GSK3β in this manner, wild-type p53 and either wild-type-GSK3β or R96A-GSK3β (each with a HA tag to distinguish them from endogenous GSK3β) were expressed in H1299 cells. Subsequently, p53 was immunoprecipitated, and the co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3β with p53 was examined. The levels of expressed p53 and of the variants of GSK3β were essentially equivalent in the cells expressing wild-type GSK3β and R96A-GSK3β (Fig. 2A). Following immunoprecipitation of p53, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated GSK3β was the same for wild-type GSK3β and R96A-GSK3β (103 ± 12%; n = 3) (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with hypothesis that the association of p53 with GSK3β is not mediated by the binding of pre-phosphorylated p53 to the phosphobinding pocket of GSK3β. The binding of p53 to GSK3β previously was reported to increase the activity of GSK3β (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but those experiments did not examine if this was a transient interaction temporally limited by the activity of GSK3β. To address this issue, cells were incubated with lithium, a selective inhibitor of GSK3β (17.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar), to test if GSK3β activity influenced its association with p53. Following induction of wild-type p53 expression in H1299 cells, the association of p53 with endogenous GSK3β was examined by co-immunoprecipitation from nuclear fractions. Inhibition of GSK3β with 20 mm lithium did not inhibit the co-immunoprecipitation of p53 with GSK3β, but to the contrary increased the association (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that GSK3β activity is not required for association with p53 and that inhibition of GSK3β stabilizes its association with p53. Functional Regulation of p53 by GSK3β—Induction of p53 leads to increased expression of a large group of p53-regulated proteins (23.Kannan K. Kaminski N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3449-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), including regulators of p53 (e.g. MDM2), of the cell cycle (e.g. p21), and of cell death (e.g. Bax). To test if these outcomes of p53 activation show differential sensitivities to the influence of GSK3β, we examined the effects of the inhibitor of GSK3β, lithium, on a representative from each of these groups. In the absence of induced expression of p53, p53-null H1299 cells expressed nearly undetectable levels of MDM2 and p21, whereas a low basal expression of Bax was detected (Fig. 4A). Following induced expression of p53, large increases in each protein were evident. Inhibition of GSK3β by treatment with lithium greatly diminished the p53-induced increased levels of all three proteins, without altering the level of p53 (Fig. 4, A and B). The expression of MDM2 appeared to be slightly less sensitive to inhibition of GSK3β than the other two, as the p53-induced increase in MDM2 was inhibited by lithium by 52 ± 8%, whereas the p53-induced increases in p21 and Bax were inhibited by 84 ± 9% and 80 ± 4%, respectively. The large inhibition by lithium of increased p21 following the induced expression of p53 matches well our previous report that increases in p21 following camptothecin treatment were nearly completely blocked by inhibiting GSK3β with lithium, dominant-negative GSK3β, or expressed GBP, an inhibitory GSK3β-binding protein (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting GSK3β, lithium also has moderate inhibitory effects on casein kinase 2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (24.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). To further verify that the effect of lithium was due to inhibition of GSK3β, we directly compared the effects of lithium to those of two other small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These include rottlerin, which is a potent inhibitor of GSK3β but also inhibits equally well mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2, p38-regulated/activated kinase, and protein kinase A and is a weaker inhibitor of other kinases (24.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), and tip-oxadiazole, a potent inhibitor of GSK3β but currently lacking an extensive study of specificity (25.Naerum L. Norskov-Lauritsen L. Olesen P.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1525-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the new results following lithium treatment match well with the initial results, as in the two groups of experiments lithium treatment reduced MDM2 levels by 52% (Fig. 4B) and 49% (Fig. 4D), p21 levels by 84 and 97%, and Bax levels by 80 and 70%, respectively. Inhibition of GSK3β by treatment with 5 μm tip-oxadiazole or 5 μm rottlerin reduced the p53-induced increased levels of MDM2 more than lithium, by 99 and 94%, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). p21 levels were reduced by 99% by tip-oxadiazole, whereas rottlerin had a more variable and weaker effect, reducing p21 by 65%. Bax levels were reduced by 75% by rottlerin, similar to the effect of lithium, whereas tip-oxadiazole had less effect, causing a reduction of 48%. Thus, in each case all three inhibitors of GSK3β attenuated these responses by 48 to 99%, although there was some variation among the three inhibitors in the extent of inhibition which may be attributable their different specificities and magnitudes of inhibition of GSK3β. Altogether, these results are consistent with the proposal that GSK3β activity contributes to p53-induced expression of MDM2, p21, and Bax. To further examine if GSK3β participates in regulating the expression of these proteins, northern blotting was carried out to test if inhibition of GSK3β by lithium blocked the increases in mRNA levels of p21 and MDM2 induced by p53. Induction of wild-type p53 in H1299 cells increased the p21 mRNA level, and inhibition of GSK3β with lithium reduced this response by 56 ± 7% (n = 3) (Fig. 5A). Lithium treatment also reduced the p53-induced increased level of MDM2 mRNA in H1299 cells by 47 ± 10% (n = 3) (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the measurements of protein and mRNA levels demonstrate that GSK3β activity is necessary for full transcriptional activity of p53. Transcriptional-independent, as well as -dependent, processes contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis. Evidence is accumulating that mitochondrial p53 is an important intermediate in transcriptional-independent apoptosis (26.Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 27.Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Our further studies examining mitochondrial events following DNA damage demonstrated that regulatory interactions of GSK3β with p53 are not limited to the nucleus. Previously we showed that inhibition of GSK3β by pharmacological and molecular methods attenuated camptothecin-induced, p53-mediated, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As noted above, in addition to the nucleus, p53 also has been identified in mitochondria, where GSK3β also is known to reside (30.Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if the mitochondrial p53 level increased, and compared this with nuclear p53, following camptothecin treatment of SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment with 1 μm camptothecin caused a time-dependent increase in nuclear p53, soon followed by increased mitochondrial p53 (Fig. 6A). This was verified not to be due to contamination with cytosolic or nuclear proteins by immunoblotting for markers of all three fractions, including tubulin for cytosol, the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) for the nucleus, and cytochrome oxidase for mitochondria (Fig. 6B). Because previously we found that nuclear p53 associates with, and activates, nuclear GSK3β (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we tested if these actions also occurred in mitochondria. This was found to be the case, as after camptothecin treatment mitochondrial p53 co-immunoprecipitated with GSK3β (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the activity of mitochondrial GSK3β was increased, whereas the total level of mitochondrial GSK3β remained unaltered (Fig. 6D). Thus, similar signaling events occurred in both the nucleus and the mitochondria, including accumulation of p53, the association of p53 with GSK3β, and the activation of GSK3β. To test if GSK3β contributed to the mitochondrial targeted apoptotic signaling, the effects of three inhibitors of GSK3β were examined on the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol, which leads to activation of caspases (31.Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32.Schuler M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldstein J.C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16547-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and the activation of caspase-3. Treatment with camptothecin stimulated the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (Fig. 6E). Inhibition of GSK3β by pretreatment with 20 mm lithium, 5 μm rottlerin, or 5 μm tip-oxadiazole blocked the camptothecin-induced release of cytochrome c. Furthermore, all three inhibitors of GSK3β attenuated the camptothecin-induced activation of caspase-3, as measured by the appearance of cleaved active caspase-3 bands and the proteolysis of the caspase-3 substrate PARP (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that GSK3β plays a role in p53-induced apoptotic signaling, and the blockade of signals leading to cytochrome c release upon inhibition of GSK3β likely accounts for the block of caspase-3 activation shown here and previously reported using several other methods to inhibit GSK3β (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of both p53 (1.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 2.Vogelstein B. Lane D.

Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) in cell fate determination, the recent finding that these two proteins interact synergistically (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) led us to address two aspects of this interaction in this investigation: what are some of the factors that control the association, and what are some of the consequences of this interaction. Regarding the first goal, we identified two domains of p53 that modulate its interaction with GSK3β. Secondly, both nuclear and mitochondrial interactions of GSK3β and p53 were identified. This information indicates that when the level of p53 is elevated it plays a role in directing the actions of GSK3β, and that GSK3β, in turn, contributes an important facilitating role in promoting the actions of p53, suggesting that these two proteins co-operate as partners in controlling cellular responses to DNA damage. Two domains of p53, the BD and AD1 regions, had regulatory influences on its association with GSK3β. The BD in the C-terminal region of p53 was identified as necessary for the binding of GSK3β to p53. Specifically, amino acids 364–373 of p53 were found to be obligatory for its association with GSK3β. Previous studies have documented that this basic domain of p53 is a region that regulates the function of p53, although the precise regulatory actions of the BD remain controversial (1.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 34.McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35.Gohler T. Reimann M. Cherny D. Walter K. Warnecke G. Kim E. Deppert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41192-41203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One function of the BD appears to be to facilitate the binding to GSK3β, which subsequently facilitates the transcriptional and apoptotic actions of p53, as indicated by the inhibitory effects of blocking GSK3β activity. It is of interest that other proteins that bind to the basic domain, such as the Werner syndrome protein (36.Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F. Yu C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29463-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the Y-box binding protein YB-1 (37.Okamoto T. Izumi H. Imamura T. Takano H. Ise T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6194-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and TFIIH subunits (38.Leveillard T. Andera L. Bissonnette N. Schaeffer L. Bracco L. Egly J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), also have been reported to facilitate actions of p53. Apparently the regulation of proteins associating with the BD region of p53 significantly modifies the actions of p53, likely causing protein-selective differences in the repertoire of signals derived from p53. Additionally, a possibly unique aspect of the association of p53 and GSK3β is that not only is p53 function enhanced, but the activity of GSK3β also is increased by the association of the two proteins (16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the activity of GSK3β contributed to regulating the stability of the complex, as inhibition of GSK3β activity increased the association of p53 with GSK3β. Such an effect could be ascribed to a direct phosphorylating action of GSK3β on p53, or to an indirect action mediated by the GSK3β-induced phosphorylation of another protein interacting with p53 or GSK3β. In either case, it may indicate that the association of p53 and GSK3β is transient, with the activity of GSK3β influencing the duration of binding to p53. Finally, considering the many links between GSK3β and apoptosis (7.Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), it is intriguing to note the correlation between the capacity of p53 constructs to bind GSK3β and their ability to induce cell death, as ΔBD-p53 is unable to bind GSK3β or to induce apoptosis (39.Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The AD1 region is the other domain of p53 that had a regulatory influence on its association with GSK3β. The AD1 domain is the binding site for MDM2, which targets p53 for degradation. Thus, deletion or functional mutations of the AD1 domain, by eliminating MDM2 binding, lead to accumulation of p53. Deletion of the AD1 domain allowed significantly more association of GSK3β with p53 than occurred with wild-type p53. That this was unlikely due to elimination of MDM2 binding was evident from the results with the AD1(–)-p53 construct in which elimination of MDM2 binding, but retention of the AD1 region, did not alter the association of GSK3β with p53. Thus, the AD1 region, or another protein bound to this region, regulates the capacity of p53 to associate with GSK3β. The mechanisms by which either p53 or GSK3β individually promotes apoptosis remain uncertain, thus the mechanisms accounting for apoptosis following the concerted action of these two molecules remain to be determined. Apoptosis caused by p53 can be directed by transcriptional-dependent and transcriptional-independent mechanisms. The former is clearly an action of nuclear p53, and there is accumulating evidence that the latter is a mitochondrial action of p53. For example, some apoptotic conditions cause translocation of p53 to the mitochondria and constructs of p53 with decreased ability to translocate to the mitochondria are weaker activators of apoptosis (26.Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 27.Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). More recently this association was further solidified by the finding that the Arg-72 polymorphic variant of p53 translocates to the mitochondria much better than the Pro-72 variant and is at least five times better at inducing apoptosis (28.Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that both nuclear and mitochondrial interactions between p53 and GSK3β may be relevant in this capacity. This was indicated by the findings that inhibition of GSK3β was capable of interfering with p53-mediated apoptotic signaling at two levels, including a rapid mitochondrial action and a slower nuclear transcriptional action. Inhibition of GSK3β blocked cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation, suggesting that mitochondrial GSK3β may contribute to the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. One possibility is that GSK3β acts in concert with mitochondrial p53, which bound mitochondrial GSK3β, to facilitate mechanisms causing cytochrome c release. Previous studies have reported that mitochondrial p53 contributed to apoptotic signaling upstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release (26.Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 27.Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). The association of p53 with GSK3β in the mitochondria, and the concomitant activation of GSK3β, represents the first enzymatic regulatory action of mitochondrial p53 that has been identified, although mitochondrial p53 has been shown to bind other proteins in mitochondria (26.Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 28.Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of p53 with GSK3β in mitochondria and the activation of mitochondrial GSK3β may contribute to the mitochondrial apoptotic action of p53, although the intermediate steps whereby GSK3β activity promotes cytochrome c release remain to be determined. We also note that although only the association of GSK3β with p53 was examined, the inhibitors used also block the activity of GSK3α so it is quite possible that both isoforms of GSK3 may contribute to the signaling activities reported here. In the nucleus, GSK3β was found to co-localize with p53 following apoptotic stimuli-induced nuclear accumulation of GSK3β (15.Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16.Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Clearly the nucleus represents an important localization for the interactions of p53 and GSK3β since the two proteins associate in the nucleus, p53 activates nuclear GSK3β, and inhibition of GSK3β reduces the expression of p53-regulated proteins. For example, the involvement of Bax mediated by transcriptional activation of p53 often contributes to apoptosis and was evident in H1299 cells upon induced expression of p53. Inhibition of GSK3β with lithium greatly abrogated this p53-induced Bax expression, likely by inhibiting the facilitation of GSK3β on the transcriptional activity of p53. Thus protection from apoptosis may be provided by inhibiting the facilitating effects of GSK3β both on the rapid mitochondrial and slower nuclear apoptotic responses to DNA damage. We thank Dr. G. V. W. Johnson for R96A-GSK3β and Dr. J. Woodgett for the GSK3β constructs."

In yeast, at least five Sir2-like proteins have been identified. The founding member, yeast Sir2 (ySir2), is required for all major silenced loci (reviewed in Ref. 4Moazed D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A Sir2 homologue from Salmonella enterica was shown to up-regulate acetyl-CoA synthetase, through deacetylation of a critical lysine residue (8Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D.

Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Of these seven, human SIRT2 (hSIRT2) has been identified as a cytosolic protein (10Afshar G. Murnane J.P.

The nuclear Sir2 homologue, SIRT1, has been reported to regulate the p53 tumor suppressor by deacetylation, resulting in inhibition of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (14Vaziri H. Dessain S.K.

Class 1 and 2 histone deacetylases catalyze the deacetylation of histones/proteins to generate free acetate and the deacetylated protein. Based on sequence homology to a metalloprotease-like enzyme from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, the mechanism involves activation of a water molecule by a zinc atom and two aspartate/histidine ion pairs in the active site (16Finnin M.S.

Although the physiological function of OAADPr is unclear, microinjection of OAADPr results in a delay/block in oocyte maturation and in a delay/block of embryo cell division (25Borra M.T.

Genetics. 2002; 160: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have implicated a nuclear NAD+ salvage pathway as a regulatory control point for ySir2. This salvage pathway conserves the pyridine ring of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide to regenerate β-NAD+. Enzymes involved in this pathway influence ySir2-dependent gene silencing. Mutation of the NAD+ salvage pathway gene NPT1 (nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase) results in silencing defects (29Sandmeier J.J. Celic I. Boeke J.D. Smith J.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a single extra copy of the PNC1 gene (nicotinamidase) is sufficient to increase ySir2-dependent silencing (28Bitterman K.J.

How these pathway intermediates (nicotinamide metabolites) may affect directly Sir2-dependent deacetylation is not clear. However, nicotinamide has been suggested as an in vivo regulator of Sir2 function (6Denu J.M. Trends Biochem.

Although nicotinamide has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of several Sir2 homologues (28Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 30Landry J. Slama J.T. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the mechanism of inhibition has not been established. This paper focuses on three critical topics as follows: the mechanism of nicotinamide inhibition through the measurement of the efficiency by which nicotinamide/pyridine analogues can serve as substrates for transglycosidation; the nature of the transition state for transglycosidation; and the function of the 2′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose in the catalytic mechanism utilizing NAD+ analogues and a catalytic mutant (His-to-Ala). Reagents—All chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available, were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Fisher, and were used without further purification. Synthetic 11-mer H3 peptide and acetylated H3 peptide (corresponding to the 10 amino acid residues surrounding lysine 14 of histone H3; H2N-KSTGGK(Ac)APRKQCONH2) were purchased from SynPep Corporation (Dublin, CA), 3H-Labeled acetyl H3-peptide was prepared as reported previously (22Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). [adenylate-32P]NAD+ was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). HST2 mutant H135A was a generous gift from Rolf Sternglanz (State University of New York, Stony Brook). 2′-Ribo-FNAD+ and 2′-deoxy-ribo-NAD+ were synthesized as described previously (31Sleath P.R. Handlon A.L. Oppenheimer N.J. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 3608-3618Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of His-tagged HST2, HST2 Mutant H135A, hSIRT2, and ySir2—The procedure used in the expression and purification of histidine-tagged full-length HST2 has been reported previously (22Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) with only minor changes and was applied to the purification of the Sir2 enzymes. Fractions containing protein greater than 90% purity, based upon densitometry, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5, 37 °C) or PBS (pH 7.3), 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. For yeast Sir2 (ySir2), 800 mm NaCl was also included in the final dialysis to prevent precipitation of protein. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), and the stock solutions were stored at -25 °C until needed. Charcoal Binding Assays—General enzymatic reactions contained 3H-acetylated H3 peptide substrate, NAD+, and a NAD+-dependent Sir2-like class III protein/histone deacetylase to form the product 3H-labeled OAADPr. To 70-μl reaction volumes was added 50 μl of charcoal slurry (1 volume of activated charcoal to 2 volumes of 2.0 m glycine buffer, pH 9.5) to terminate the reaction at the desired time points. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 min at 7000 × g. A total of 90 μl of the supernatant was removed and added to 50 μl of fresh charcoal slurry, centrifuged again for 1 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant removed and added to a clean tube. This was centrifuged for 5 min, and 75 μl removed and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. This assay effectively measures the amount of 3H-labeled OAADPr in the form of free acetate. Both OAADPr and acetylated H3 peptide bind to the activated charcoal. However, under these conditions the 3H-labeled acetate from OAADPr is hydrolyzed and remains in the supernatant. Activated charcoal immediately stops the enzymatic reaction at all pH and temperature values tested. Heating and high pH is necessary only to hydrolyze acetate from OAADPr (data not shown). Amides, represented by unreacted peptide, are not hydrolyzed under these conditions (data not shown). Nicotinamide Exchange Reactions—General exchange reactions for HST2, HST2 mutant H135A, hSIRT2, and ySir2 were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 500 μm NAD+, 300 μm acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, and buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, 37 °C, or 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 37 °C, as noted), 0.2 μm enzyme, and nicotinamide concentrations ranging from 3 μm to 1 mm containing [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide (Sigma N-2142, 52.8 mCi/mmol). Reactions were initiated via addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C for 5-8 min, and quenched with neat trifluoroacetic acid (to a final concentration of 1%). Linearity of rates was confirmed by measuring exchange over time courses up to 30 min. After quenching, 5 μl of each reaction was spotted to Whatman aluminum-backed Silica Gel TLC plates (Fisher) and placed in a development tank pre-equilibrated with 80:20 ethanol, 2.5 m ammonium acetate for 1 h (20Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5807-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Plates were air-dried and exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen (Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging Screen-CS) for 24 h and then read with Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imaging System and Molecular Analyst software (version 2.1.2). The percentage of nicotinamide exchanged was determined by measuring the densities of the [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide (Rf 0.80) and enzymatically created 14C-labeled NAD+ (Rf 0.27). Enzymatic exchange rates were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Reported values are the average of at least three independent experiments.νo=(kcat·[S])/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) Nicotinamide Inhibition Curves—Nicotinamide inhibition reactions for both HST2 and hSIRT2 were performed in 80-μl volumes with 500 μm NAD+, 300 μm3H-acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5, 37 °C), 0.5 μm enzyme, and nicotinamide concentrations ranging from 3 μm to 1 mm. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C for 5-8 min, and quenched with activated charcoal. Inhibition was determined by measuring the forward rate using the charcoal-binding assay (described above). Forward rates were fitted to Equation 2 using Kaleidagraph software. Reported values are the average of at least three independent experiments.νapp=νmax(1-([I]/(Ki(app)+[I])))(Eq. 2) Exchange Rates of Pyridine Derivatives for Use in Brönsted Analyses—Exchange reactions were performed in 70-μl volumes containing 500 μm NAD+, 300 μm acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5, 37 °C), 0.2-1.0 μm HST2, and pyridine analogue concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 100 mm. The pH values of inhibitor stock solutions were checked for consistency. Reactions were initiated via addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C, and quenched with neat trifluoroacetic acid (to a final concentration of 1%). Quenched reactions were analyzed by HPLC. Two analytical C-18 columns (Vydac, 4.6 × 250 mm, 10 μm) were connected in tandem and run at 1 ml/min in 100% buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water) for 1 min and then ramped to 20% buffer B (0.02% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) for over 20 min. NAD+ eluted from the column at 13 min, and the corresponding NAD+ analogue made in the exchange reaction eluted 1-3 min later. Rates were determined by integrating the peaks and determining the amount of NAD+ converted to its analogue. Reactions were quenched at 1, 2, and 3 min, and rates were determined by using linear least squares regression with Kaleidagraph software. Corresponding rates were then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1). The log of the rate for pyridine analogue exchange (Vmax) was plotted against pKa of the ring nitrogen of the pyridine analogue in the Brönsted plot and fitted using linear least squares regression (Kaleidagraph software). TLC Conditions for the Analysis of Thionicotinamide and 3-Hydroxypyridine Inhibition Reactions—Inhibition reactions were performed in 60-μl volumes with 50 μm32P-labeled NAD+ (ICN 37025, adenylate-32P), 225 μm acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm inhibitor, 4.2 μm HST2, in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 37 °C). Nicotinamide was used as a control. Thionicotinamide reactions were run in 6.8% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Reactions were run for 10 min at 37 °C and quenched with neat trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. A total of 2 μl of each reaction was spotted onto Whatman aluminum-backed silica gel TLC plates and placed in a development tank pre-equilibrated with 70:30 ethanol, 2.5 m ammonium acetate for 4 h. The plate was air-dried, exposed to a β-imaging screen (Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging Screen-BI) for 3 h, and read as described above. Under these conditions NAD+ has an Rf of 0.41, ADPr an Rf of 0.68, and OAADPr an Rf of 0.75. Charcoal Binding Method Used for the Analysis of Pyridine Analogue Inhibition Reactions—Inhibition reactions were performed in 80-μl volumes with 50 μm NAD+, 225 μm3H-acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 μm HST2, inhibitor concentrations spanning 1-30 mm, and in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 37 °C). Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C for 5-8 min, and quenched with activated charcoal. Inhibition was determined by measuring the forward rate using the charcoal-binding assay (described above). Reactions using thionicotinamide contained 6.8% Me2SO and were compared with uninhibited reactions also in 6.8% Me2SO as a control. Reported values are the average of at least three independent experiments. Use of 2′-Deoxy-2′-fluororibo-NAD+and in Nicotinamide Exchange Reactions Catalyzed by HST2, HST2 Mutant H135A, and hSirT2—At fixed [nicotinamide], exchange reactions using 2′-ribo-FNAD+ consisted of either 80-100 μm wt HST2 or HST2 mutant H135A or 50 μm hSIRT2, 800 μm 2′-ribo-FNAD+, 300 μm AcH3 peptide, 50 μm nicotinamide (containing 14C-labeled nicotinamide), 1 mm DTT, in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated via the addition of enzyme and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched via the addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and 6-μl aliquots were analyzed by TLC as mentioned previously. To obtain the apparent Vmax value for nicotinamide exchange with 2′-ribo-FNAD+, reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 7.5 min and contained the following components: 7.8 μm hSIRT2 or 79 μm HST2, 1 mm DTT, 300 μm AcH3 peptide, 1.91 mm dFNAD in PBS (pH 7.3, 37 °C), and nicotinamide concentrations ranging from 50 to 2000 μm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of enzyme. Reactions were terminated via the addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% and were analyzed by HPLC and liquid scintillation counting as described before. Control reactions containing the varied range of [nicotinamide] but lacking enzyme were treated in the same manner to determine the extent of nonenzymatic incorporation of exogenous nicotinamide. The initial rate of nicotinamide exchange was determined by subtracting the amount of nicotinamide incorporation from the controls from the enzymatic reactions. The complete data set was then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the apparent Vmax for base exchange. The 2′-deoxy-ribo-NAD+ analogue was analyzed similarly to that of 2′-deoxy-2′-fluororibo-NAD+ except where noted in the legend of Fig. 5B. Utilization of 2′-Deoxy-2′-fluororibo-NAD+ as a Substrate in Forward Reactions Catalyzed by Wild-type HST2—Reactions were performed in triplicate and consisted of 100 μm HST2, 1 mm DTT, 500 μm [3H]AcH3 peptide, 800 μm 2′-ribo-FNAD+ in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3, 37 °C). The reactions and controls were incubated at 37 °C from 0.25 to 30 min and quenched via the addition of charcoal slurry, either at pH 7 or pH 9.5. The transfer of [3H]acetate from substrate to the ADP-ribose moiety of 2′-ribo-FNAD+, in the form of free acetate, was determined using the charcoal-binding assay mentioned previously. Control reactions contained either no enzyme or 1% SDS and enzyme. Free acetate does not bind to charcoal at either pH 7 or pH 9.5, whereas [3H]AcH3 peptide binds under both conditions and does not liberate free acetate, even under the pH 9.5 conditions. As with the normal product 2′-OAADPr generated by using NAD+, the observed acetylated intermediate with 2′-ribo-FNAD+ was measured as free acetate production under hydrolytic quenching. Under nonhydrolytic quenching (pH 7), this product bound to activated charcoal. Enzymatic Synthesis of [carbonyl-14C]2′-ribo-FNAD+—A single reaction (1 ml) containing 100 μm HST2, 1 mm DTT, 500 μm acetylated H3 peptide, 800 μm 2′-ribo-FNAD+, and 100 μm [carbamoyl-14C]nicotinamide in PBS (pH 7.3, 37 °C) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and the [carbonyl-14C]2′-FNAD+ was purified by HPLC as described previously (22Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The peak corresponding to 2′-FNAD+ was collected, lyophilized, and suspended in a small volume (100 μl) of water. The concentration of [carbonyl-14C]2′-FNAD+ was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of 18.1 mm-1 cm-1 at 260 nm. Determination of the Rate of Nicotinamide Release Using 2′-ribo-FNAD+and Wild-type HST2—Reactions were performed in duplicate and consisted of 80 μm HST2, 1 mm DTT, 500 μm AcH3 peptide, 800 μm 2′-ribo-FNAD+ (labeled with [14C]nicotinamide) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3, 37 °C). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals and quenched via the addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Reactions were then analyzed by HPLC as described previously. The extent of nicotinamide liberation was determined by liquid scintillation counting and correlated to nicotinamide concentrations in the reactions. Linear data points were plotted using linear least squares, and the rate of nicotinamide release was calculated from the slope of the graph. The following experiments have focused on the following three topics: the origin of nicotinamide noncompetitive inhibition; the nature of the transition state for formation of the nicotinamide-ribosyl bond; and the utilization of NAD+ analogues to probe the mechanism of deacetylation catalyzed by Sir2-like enzymes.

Protein-protein interactions between Bax and other Bcl-2 family members are strongly implicated in Bax activation, but a compelling case has recently been made for the involvement of lipids in this process as well. Here we report that purified Bax undergoes a reversible conformational change upon incubation with lipid vesicles in the absence of other proteins. This Bax-liposome interaction does not depend on a specific lipid composition. Changes in Bax conformation were observed by immunoprecipitation with the conformation-specific antibody 6A7, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Although liposomes induced Bax to become 6A7-reactive (a feature normally associated with the onset of apoptosis), the protein did not insert into membranes, become oligomeric, or form pores, clearly indicating that other triggers are required for Bax to achieve its final pro-apoptotic state. Indeed, the lipid-induced Bax conformational change is shown to be required for tBid-induced Bax oligomerization and pore formation, putting it upstream of tBid activity in this molecular pathway to Bax activation. These data demonstrate that Bax is sensitized to activation by transient interaction with lipid membrane surfaces and provide evidence that Bax activation proceeds in a stepwise fashion, with multiple triggers and potential levels of regulation.

Programmed cell death in multicellular organisms is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (1.Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar). Some proteins within this family promote apoptosis, whereas others promote survival, but the exact molecular mechanisms by which these proteins function are still largely unknown. Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators (2.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5853) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, Bax resides in the cytoplasm (3.Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), but upon induction of apoptosis by diverse stimuli, Bax undergoes a conformational change involving both its N and C termini (4.Goping I.S.

Bax at the ER is implicated in the regulation of calcium ion fluxes (10.Nutt L.K. Chandra J. Pataer A. Fang B. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. O'Neil R.G. McConkey D.J. J. Biol.

Regulation of Bax activity is thus a critical determinant of cell fate. Protein-protein interactions between Bax and other Bcl-2 family members are key to this regulation. For example, Bid is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is processed by proteolytic cleavage to an activated form (tBid) in response to death receptor signaling (12.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar), and tBid subsequently functions as a potent Bax activator to induce apoptosis (13.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 14.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Conversely, Bcl-XL is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that has been reported to heterodimerize with Bax and nullify its activity (15.Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). Regulation of Bax activity may also depend on interactions with non-Bcl-2 family members; Ku70 (part of the regulatory subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase) and humanin (a 24-amino acid anti-apoptotic peptide encoded in mammalian genomes) have both been shown to interact with Bax in the cytoplasm and prevent its translocation to membranes (16.Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 17.Sawada M. Sun W. Hayes P. Leskov K. Boothman D.A. Matsuyama S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A compelling case has also been made that lipids play a role in Bax pore formation. For example, in the absence of other proteins, the permeabilization of liposomes induced by detergent-activated Bax has been shown to depend on both intrinsic monolayer curvature (18.Basanez G. Sharpe J.C. Galanis J. Brandt T.B. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49360-49365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and on the mitochondria-specific lipid cardiolipin (19.Epand R.F. Martinou J.C. Montessuit S. Epand R.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). In addition, visualization of apoptotic cells by confocal microscopy shows that Bax oligomerization occurs primarily at discrete foci on mitochondria, which subsequently become sites of mitochondrial fission (21.Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Based on these and other data, it has been hypothesized that Bax may function to disrupt membranes via formation of nonspecific lipidic pores, such as those observed during membrane fission and fusion events (reviewed in Refs. 22.Esposti M.D. Dive C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and 23.Hardwick J.M. Polster B.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 963-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such lipid-lined pores would be large enough to allow the release of not only cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space but also the release of other much larger apoptotic inducers such as Smac/Diablo (27 kDa), EndoG (33 kDa), and AIF (67 kDa). Indeed, tBid-activated Bax is reported to be capable of permeabilizing liposomes to dextrans of up to 2000 kDa (20.Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). But, apart from their complicity in actual pore formation, do lipids play an additional role in Bax activation? To answer this question and further characterize the molecular mechanism of Bax activation, we examined whether purified recombinant Bax could interact with liposomes of mitochondrial membrane-like composition by testing for all the in vitro hallmarks of Bax activation: conformational changes, membrane binding and insertion, oligomerization, and pore formation. Our data demonstrate that Bax undergoes a transient conformational change upon interaction with a lipid membrane surface, indicating a previously unrecognized role for lipids in the regulation of Bax activity. Furthermore, this Bax-lipid interaction is shown to be a prerequisite for tBid-induced Bax oligomerization and pore formation, highlighting the biological significance of this conformational change to Bax activation. Materials—Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were purified from egg. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) was from bovine liver. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and cardiolipin were purchased as synthetic lipids in dioleoyl (DO) or tetraoleoyl form, respectively. 8-Aminonaphthalene 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). CHAPS and HEPES were from BioShop Canada Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. ER membranes were purified from canine pancreas (24.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and mitochondria were isolated from rat liver (25.Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Bax monoclonal antibodies 6A7 and 2D2 were generous gifts from Richard Youle. Protein Purification—Recombinant full-length human Bax with no additional amino acid residues was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as an intein/chitin-binding domain (CBD) fusion as described previously (26.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Lysis of E. coli was achieved by mechanical disruption with a French press, and at no point was the protein exposed to detergents that alter the native Bax conformation. After affinity chromatography with a chitin column, intein self-cleavage and release of Bax from its fusion partner was initiated by incubation with buffer containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 36 h. The eluted protein was applied to a column of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and collected in the flowthrough, with residual impurities remaining bound to the column. Eluted Bax was dialyzed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 30% glycerol, then flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Detergent-activated Bax was obtained by incubating the purified recombinant protein in buffer containing 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside for 1 h at 4 °C, as previously reported (27.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length human Bcl-XL with no additional amino acid residues was purified as an intein/CBD fusion, as above. CHAPS was added to the lysis as well as wash buffers to prevent protein aggregation (at 1% and 0.2%, respectively). The protein eluted from the chitin column was further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a column of Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Bcl-XL was eluted from the Phenyl-Sepharose column in 20 mm Tris, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.2% CHAPS, then flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Recombinant full-length rat Bid with an N-terminal His6 tag was purified and cleaved with caspase 8 as described previously (28.Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment of cleaved Bid (tBid) was purified away from the N-terminal Bid fragment and residual caspase 8 using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described previously (28.Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Proteins were judged to be greater than 95% pure based on Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels (see Fig. 6C below). Liposome Preparation—Lipids were mixed in the appropriate ratio from stocks dissolved in chloroform. To mimic the composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane, liposomes were made up of PC, PE, PI, DOPS, and tetraoleoylcardiolipin (48:28:10:10:4 molar ratio). The organic solvent was removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen gas, followed by incubation for 2 h in a vacuum to ensure complete solvent removal. Lipid films were resuspended in targeting buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA), subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, and large unilamellar vesicles were formed by extrusion through 100-nm Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes. To prepare ANTS/DPX-charged liposomes, 12.5 mm ANTS and 45 mm DPX were included in the targeting buffer, and non-entrapped fluorophore and quencher were removed by gel filtration using a column of CL2B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations with the conformation-specific antibody 6A7 were performed in 0.5-ml reactions in targeting buffer (see above) at 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Bax and liposomes were added at concentrations of 30 nm and 30 μm, respectively (∼300 ng of protein and 12 μg of total lipid). Immunoprecipitation was allowed to occur overnight on a rotator. In the absence of liposomes, Triton X-100 or CHAPS were added at 0.2% (w/v) as positive and negative controls, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h, followed by centrifugation for 1 min. The pellets were washed two times with wash buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS), three times with wash buffer B (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS), then an additional three times with wash buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl). Immunoprecipitates were released from the beads in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with the Bax 2D2 antibody. To determine the reversibility of Bax 6A7 epitope exposure, protein and liposomes were co-incubated for a period of 2 h (in a 0.4-ml volume), and then protein was separated from liposomes over a gel filtration column of CL2B Sepharose with a 4-ml bed volume. The resulting separation time was 30 min (at an approximate flow rate of 0.2 ml/min). The included Bax-containing fractions were pooled and divided into aliquots, and then 6A7 antibody was added at 0, 30, and 60 min post-separation, followed by immunoprecipitation as described above. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV Model 215 CD spectrometer from Protein Solutions (Lakeview, NJ). Samples were prepared by diluting a concentrated Bax stock solution into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of the Bax stock solution was determined by amino acid analysis. Where applicable, lipids (DOPC:DOPE:DOPS:PI:cardiolipin; 43:27:9:9:12 molar ratio) were introduced as a vacuum-dried film that was hydrated in buffer and sonicated to near-clarity before addition of protein. The final concentration of Bax in all CD spectroscopy samples was 2.7 μm. CD spectra were corrected for the buffer baseline and expressed in terms of mean molar residue ellipticity. Scans were measured twice and averaged. Secondary structure was analyzed with the Selcon3 program (29.Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation curves were obtained by recording the temperature dependence of Bax ellipticity at 222 nm. Temperature scans were performed at a heating or cooling rate of 1 °C/min. Ellipticity was measured from 25 °C to 95 °C, and then back to 25 °C to assess the reversibility of denaturation. To compare the rates of thermal denaturation, the molar ellipticity at 25 °C was defined as –1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC runs were performed using an N-DSCII microcalorimeter from Calorimetry Sciences Corp. (American Fork, UT). Data analysis was carried out with the program Origin. For sample preparation, concentrated Bax stock solutions were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, and the final dialysate was used in the buffer reference cell. Sample and buffer were degassed prior to loading. Where applicable, lipids (DOPC: DOPE:DOPS:PI:cardiolipin; 43:27:9:9:12 molar ratio) were introduced as a vacuum-dried film on the walls of a tube (lipid to protein ratio of 1000); the protein solution was added to the film and mixed by vortexing extensively under argon before degassing and loading. Three independent sets of runs were performed using three independently prepared batches of dialyzed Bax. Scans were performed at a rate of 2 °C/min, and Bax was used at a concentration of 13 μm. Control scans with lipid vesicles alone showed no transitions. Membrane Binding Assay—Liposomes and Bax were co-incubated at a lipid to protein ratio of 500 for 3 h at 37 °C in targeting buffer. A fraction of this sample (120 μl) was adjusted to a final sucrose concentration of 1.4 m (final volume of 300 μl), overlaid with 400 μl of 0.8 m sucrose in buffer, and finally 300 μl of 0.25 m sucrose in buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 3 h, and then four 250-μl fractions were drawn from the air-fluid interface. The top two fractions collected from the gradient correspond to the lipid-containing fractions and contain any membrane-associated Bax, whereas the bottom two fractions contain the remainder of the non-targeted protein. The polycarbonate centrifuge tubes were washed with 250 μl of hot 1% (w/v) SDS to give an indication of protein that had aggregated or adhered to the sides of the tube. Gel Filtration Analysis of Bax Oligomerization—Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column from Amersham Biosciences equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% (w/v) CHAPS. The sample was applied to the column in a total volume of 0.4 ml at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected (starting at the column void volume) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Bax antibody 2D2. ANTS Release Assay for Bax Pore Formation—ANTS release from ANTS/DPX-charged liposomes was monitored by recording the dequenching of the ANTS fluorescence in a spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International, Inc. (Lawrenceville, NJ) using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and monitoring the emission from 500 to 540 nm (slit widths set at 4 nm). Numerical values were obtained by integrating the area under the emission curve between 510 and 525 nm. The extent of ANTS release is reported as a percentage of the total determined by complete lysis of the liposomes with 0.2% Triton X-100. The emission maximum for ANTS-charged liposomes alone did not change over the duration of the assay, indicating that there was no spontaneous ANTS leakage. Likewise, the emission maximum for the detergent-lysed liposomes did not change over the duration of the assay, indicating that bleaching was not a factor. Cuvettes were incubated at 37 °C, and cooled briefly to room temperature to take measurements. Bax and lipid were used at concentrations of 100 nm and 50 μm, respectively. The tBid and Bcl-XL proteins were used at concentrations of 20 and 200 nm, respectively. Final readings were taken after a 2-h incubation, at which point the fluorescence intensity had reached a plateau. Liposomes Alone Elicit a Conformational Change in Bax That Can Be Detected by Antibody 6A7—Monoclonal antibody 6A7 recognizes an epitope at the N terminus of Bax that is occluded in its inactive state but that becomes exposed upon Bax activation (30.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Bax does not react with 6A7 (Fig. 1A, lane 2), but can be artificially induced to adopt the activated, 6A7-positive conformation by incubation in buffer containing the detergent Triton X-100 (Fig. 1A, lane 1), as previously reported (30.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, incubation of recombinant Bax with liposomes of mitochondrial outer membrane composition was also enough to trigger 6A7 epitope exposure (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This finding was somewhat unexpected—why then is the 6A7 epitope not constitutively accessible in whole cells where mitochondrial membranes abound? To address this question, immunoprecipitations were performed on samples of Bax incubated for 2 h with purified mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) or ER membranes (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Membranes were lysed by the addition of either CHAPS or Triton X-100 (as a positive control) prior to 6A7 addition. Interestingly, neither mitochondria nor ER membranes caused the conformational change that was observed with liposomes alone. This conundrum is discussed in greater detail below. As the pore-forming ability of Bax has recently been shown to depend upon the presence of the mitochondria-specific lipid cardiolipin (19.Epand R.F. Martinou J.C. Montessuit S. Epand R.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether individual lipids were also critical to inducing 6A7 epitope exposure. To this end, immunoprecipitations were performed on samples of Bax incubated with PG:PC (50:50 molar ratio) and PC only liposomes. Both types of liposome induced 6A7 epitope exposure (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that the change in Bax is not cardiolipin (or other lipid)-specific. When lipid vesicles of the compositions tested above were lysed with CHAPS (a detergent that does not affect Bax conformation) prior to mixing with the protein, they had no effect on Bax conformation (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8). Therefore the induction of Bax 6A7 epitope exposure depends on an intact lipid vesicle, which cannot be substituted by the presence of lipids in mixed micelles with detergent. Because both PG:PC (net negative charge) and PC only (net neutral charge) liposomes triggered the conformational change in Bax, the Bax-lipid interaction is likely not mediated by electrostatic forces alone. To confirm this, immunoprecipitations were performed on samples of Bax and liposomes co-incubated in targeting buffer supplemented with high salt (0.5 m NaCl) to diminish electrostatic interactions. The higher salt conditions had no discernable effect (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that the lipid-induced change in Bax is not solely due to electrostatic interactions. Other documented properties of Bax activation include 1) a dependence on the presence of Mg2+ (31.Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) or Ca2+ (19.Epand R.F. Martinou J.C. Montessuit S. Epand R.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in some systems, and 2) inhibition of pore formation by the membrane-active drug propanolol (32.Polster B.M. Basanez G. Young M. Suzuki M. Fiskum G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed to test whether any of these variables affected the lipid vesicle-induced Bax conformational change, but no divalent cation dependence or inhibition by propanolol was observed (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the Bax conformational change induced by lipid exposure was a permanent or reversible event, protein and liposomes were co-incubated for a period of 2 h, and then protein was separated from liposomes by gel filtration using a column of CL2B-Sepharose. Control experiments demonstrated negligible binding of Bax to liposomes in these experiments (data not shown, see also Fig. 4 below). The included fractions containing Bax protein were pooled and divided into aliquots, and then 6A7 antibody was added at 0, 30, and 60 min post-separation, followed by immunoprecipitation. Bax that had not been exposed to liposomes was also run over a CL2B column; pooled protein-containing fractions were divided into two aliquots and treated with either CHAPS or Triton X-100 as negative and positive controls, respectively. The results are summarized in Fig. 1C and show that the lipid-induced conformational change in Bax is rapidly reversible. Bax could not be immunoprecipitated with the 6A7 antibody once separated from liposomes, even when antibody was added immediately after separation (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Identical results were obtained when immunoprecipitations were repeated using samples in which protein and liposomes were separated by flotation (as per the “Membrane Binding Assay” under “Experimental Procedures,” data not shown). In summary, the liposome-induced exposure of the Bax 6A7 epitope 1) is reversible, 2) is not cardiolipin (or other lipid)-specific, 3) is not mediated solely by electrostatic interactions, and 4) requires the presence of an intact lipid vesicle surface. Characterization of the Lipid-induced Bax Conformational Change by CD Spectroscopy—All Bax-containing samples gave CD spectra with a predominantly α-helical pattern (Fig. 2A). Deconvolution of the CD curves gave the following estimate of Bax secondary structure content: 66% α-helix, 6% β-structure, 12% β-turns, and 16% random. These values agree well with those previously reported by NMR (26.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar).

Oxidized phospholipids, which are generated during inflammation and apoptosis, modulate the inflammatory response by inducing the expression of several genes including HO-1. Here we investigated the signaling pathways and transcriptional events involved in the induction of HO-1 gene expression by oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. OxPAPC up-regulated HO-1 mRNA and protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, whereas pro-inflammatory agents like TNF-α and lipopolysaccharide did not significantly induce HO-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Signaling pathways involved in the OxPAPC-mediated HO-1 induction included protein kinases A and C, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK. The cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) was phosphorylated via these pathways in response to OxPAPC treatment and expression of a dominant-negative mutant of CREB inhibited OxPAPC-induced activity of a human heme oxygenase-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct. We identified a cAMP-responsive element and a Maf recognition element to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the HO-1 promoter by OxPAPC. In gel shift assays we observed binding of CREB to the cAMP-responsive element after OxPAPC treatment.

Nevertheless the mechanism of the OxPAPC-mediated induction of HO-1 gene expression remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated in detail the mechanism of OxPAPC-induced HO-1 gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We show that the HO-1 induction by OxPAPC depends on the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and is mediated via signaling pathways including PKA, PKC, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2, which promote the phosphorylation of CREB. By using luciferase promoter reporter constructs and mutational analysis, we demonstrate that a regulatory region, located 4 kb upstream the transcription start site, is responsible for the induction of the HO-1 transcription by OxPAPC and that a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and a Maf recognition element, both of which are present in this region, are involved responsive elements. Finally we show in gel shift assays that OxPAPC increases binding of several nuclear complexes, some of which include CREB, to the human HO-1 promoter. Materials—TNF-α was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), and l-α-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine and M199 were from Sigma. PD98059, SB203580, H89, and bisindolylmaleimide I (BisI) were obtained from Calbiochem. CDC (cinnamoyl-3,4-dihydroxy-a-cyanocinnamate) and AACOCF3 (arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone) were from Biomol. Polyclonal antibodies against HO-1 were from Stressgen. Antibodies against NFATc, CREB/ATF1, Nrf1, Nrf2, MafF/G/K, and c-Fos were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against phospho-CREB was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—HUVEC were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in M199 containing 20% supplemented calf serum (SCS), 1 unit/ml heparin, 50 μg/ml bovine endothelial cell growth supplement (Technoclone, Vienna, Austria), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Experiments were performed using cells at passage 4. In all experiments, before addition of the stimulus, HUVEC were incubated in M199 containing 1% SCS for 4 h, except in the experiment shown in Fig. 1D, where medium containing 5% SCS was used to provide HUVEC with enough serum-derived soluble CD14 to respond to LPS. Transfection and Enzyme Assays—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected after 48 h at ∼80% confluence. Transient transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated with a transfection mixture containing 1.5 μg of total DNA (including 0.25 μg of PRL-SV40 vector as transfection-efficiency control), 6 μl of Plus reagent, and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 1 ml of M199 for 130 min. After 48 h, cells were starved for 4 h and stimulated for, unless otherwise stated, 14 h in M199 containing 1% SCS. Luciferase activity of the cell lysates was determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Firefly activity was then normalized to SV40 Renilla activity. Plasmids—A bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing the human HO-1 gene and the complete 5′regulatory region was a kind gift from Dr. Markus Exner (Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). A 4.9-kb SacI-XhoI fragment containing the human HO-1 promoter including the previously described cadmium-responsive elements (43Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) to obtain hHO4.9luc. Plasmid hHO4.9luc was simultaneously digested at the SacI site and at a series of restriction endonuclease sites located in the promoter, blunt-ended, and re-circularized to generate a set of 5′-nested deletions. The end points of the deletion constructs and the enzymes used were as follows: -3870 (XbaI), -2245 (HindIII), -1435 (EcoRI), and -302 (PstI). The vector over-expressing the dominant-negative CREB (pCMV-CREB133) was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Lipid Oxidation—PAPC was oxidized by exposure of dry lipid to air for 72 h. The extent of oxidation was monitored by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (28Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W.

The mRNA sequences of the investigated genes were obtained from GenBank™. The primers for β-2 microglobulin were described previously (44Wellmann S. Taube T. Paal K. Graf V.E. Geilen W. Seifert G. Eckert C. Henze G. Seeger K. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The primers for E-selectin and HO-1 were designed using the PRIMER3 software from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (Cambridge, MA). The following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were used: HO-1: F, 5′-AAGATTGCCCAGAAAGCCCTGGAC-3′; R, 5′-AACTGTCGCCACCAGAAAGCTGAG-3′; E-selectin: F, 5′-GGTTTGGTGAGGTGTGCTC-3′; R, 5′-TGATCTTTCCCGGAACTGC-3′. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using LightCycler technology (Roche Diagnostics) and the Fast Start SYBR Green I kit for amplification and detection. In all assays, cDNA was amplified using a standardized program (10-min denaturing step; 55 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 65 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C; melting point analysis in 0.1 °C steps; final cooling step). Each LightCycler capillary was loaded with 1.5 μl of DNA Master Mix, 1.8 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), 10.1 μl of H2O, 0.4 μl of 10 μm stock of each primer. The final amount of cDNA per reaction corresponded to 2.5 ng of total RNA used for reverse transcription. Quantification of target gene expression was performed using a mathematical model by Pfaffl (45Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). The expression of the target molecule was normalized to the expression of β-2 microglobulin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from HUVEC were prepared as described previously (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), except that phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 + 2 (Sigma) were added. The protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To prepare probes for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 100 pmol of each complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide (VBC-Genomics, Vienna, Austria) were annealed in 20 μl of H2O to obtain a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequences 5′-GCTGCATTTCTGCTGCGTCATGTTTGGGAG-3′ (HO-CRE) or 5′-CTAGATTTTGCTGAGTCACCAGTGC-3′ (MARE). 1 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated initially for 10 min at room temperature in 20 μl containing 18 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). The mixture was then incubated for an additional 20 min after adding 105 cpm of the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe, with or without an unlabeled competitor or antibody for supershift. In antibody supershift assays, 2 μl (4 μg) of antibody were added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel in a 0.5% TBE buffer. The gel was dried, and the radioactivity was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—After stimulation, HUVEC were lysed in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and, after blocking with 5% dry milk/0.1% Tween 20, incubated with primary antibodies in the same solution. Bound antibodies were detected by anti-IgG conjugated with peroxidase and subsequent chemiluminescent detection. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The CRE and MARE of the HO-1 promoter were mutated by a PCR-based technique using the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For each mutation two complementary primers containing the mutation were synthesized (VBC-Genomics). The sequences of the primers used to mutate the HO-CRE site were F, 5′-CCCTCGTGCAGCTGCATTTCTGCGTAGATCTGTTTGGGAGGGGGG-3′ and R, 5′-CCCCCCTCCCAAACAGATCTACGCAGAAATGCAGCTGCACGAGGG-3′. To mutate the MARE in the HO-1 promoter, primers with the sequences F, 5′-GGCGGATTTTGCTAGATTTTGCGTAGGTACCAGTGCCTCCTCAGC-3′ and R, 5′-GCTGAGGAGGCACTGGTACCTACGCAAAATCTAGCAAAATCCGCC-3′ were used. Expression of HO-1 in HUVEC Is Induced by OxPAPC but Not by TNF-α and LPS—HO-1 mRNA expression and HO-1 protein levels after OxPAPC stimulation were determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. OxPAPC increased levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein in HUVEC in a concentration- and time-dependent manner starting at 25 μg/ml (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to OxPAPC, native PAPC did not affect HO-1 expression. To investigate the effect of OxPAPC on the human HO-1 promoter activity, we cloned the proximal 4.9 kb of the human HO-1 promoter into the PGL-3 vector to obtain a HO-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct (hHO4.9luc). hHO4.9luc activity was induced by OxPAPC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), whereas native PAPC had no effect. Among potential HO-1-stimulating agents that are involved in inflammation are substances like TNFα, LPS, or H2O2 (4Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 47Camhi S.L. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Chin B.Y. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

To compare the effect of these agents on the induction of HO-1 gene expression in endothelial cells, we stimulated HUVEC with OxPAPC, TNF-α, H2O2, or LPS. Then mRNA levels of HO-1 and E-selectin, which is known to be strongly induced by TNF-α and LPS, were determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Treatment of HUVEC with OxPAPC increased levels of HO-1 mRNA 17-fold (Fig. 1D). At concentrations where TNF-α and LPS strongly induced E-selectin expression, we did not detect a significant rise in HO-1 mRNA levels, whereas 400 μm H2O2 increased the expression of HO-1 mRNA ∼1.5-fold. Neither OxPAPC nor H2O2 induced a significant elevation of E-selectin mRNA levels (Fig. 1D). These results indicate the activation of distinct signaling pathways by OxPAPC and the pro-inflammatory stimuli TNF-α and LPS in endothelial cells. In accordance with these findings, we have shown previously that OxPAPC does not activate the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells (31Bochkov V.N. Mechtcheriakova D. Lucerna M. Huber J. Malli R.

https://openalex.org/W2165889806,"β-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (KAS III, also called acetoacetyl-ACP synthase) encoded by the fabH gene is thought to catalyze the first elongation reaction (Claisen condensation) of type II fatty acid synthesis in bacteria and plant plastids. However, direct in vivo evidence that KAS III catalyzes an essential reaction is lacking, because no mutant organism deficient in this activity has been isolated. We report the first bacterial strain lacking KAS III, a fabH mutant constructed in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis IL1403. The mutant strain carries an in-frame deletion of the KAS III active site region and was isolated by gene replacement using a medium supplemented with a source of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The mutant strain is devoid of KAS III activity and fails to grow in the absence of supplementation with exogenous long-chain fatty acids demonstrating that KAS III plays an essential role in cellular metabolism. However, the L. lactis fabH deletion mutant requires only long-chain unsaturated fatty acids for growth, a source of long-chain saturated fatty acids is not required. Because both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are required for growth when fatty acid synthesis is blocked by biotin starvation (which prevents the synthesis of malonyl-CoA), another pathway for saturated fatty acid synthesis must remain in the fabH deletion strain. Indeed, incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into fatty acids in vivo showed that the fabH mutant retained about 10% of the fatty acid synthetic ability of the wild-type strain and that this residual synthetic capacity was preferentially diverted to the saturated branch of the pathway. Moreover, mass spectrometry showed that the fabH mutant retained low levels of palmitic acid upon fatty acid starvation. Derivatives of the fabH deletion mutant strain were isolated that were octanoic acid auxotrophs consistent with biochemical studies indicating that the major role of FabH is production of short-chain fatty acid primers. We also confirmed the essentiality of FabH in Escherichia coli by use of a plasmid-based gene insertion/deletion system. Together these results provide the first genetic evidence demonstrating that FabH conducts the major condensation reaction in the initiation of type II fatty acid biosynthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. β-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (KAS III, also called acetoacetyl-ACP synthase) encoded by the fabH gene is thought to catalyze the first elongation reaction (Claisen condensation) of type II fatty acid synthesis in bacteria and plant plastids.

Together these results provide the first genetic evidence demonstrating that FabH conducts the major condensation reaction in the initiation of type II fatty acid biosynthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fatty acid biosynthetic pathways are of two classes called types I and II (reviewed in Refs. 1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholarand 2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). In the associated or type I fatty acid synthase system, each fatty acid synthetic reaction is catalyzed by a distinct domain of large multifunctional proteins. The dissociated or type II fatty acid synthesis system found in most bacteria and plant plastids consists of a series of discrete proteins, each of which catalyzes an individual reaction of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. In some cases, two or more enzymes are able to perform the same chemical reaction, but have differing substrate specificities and physiological functions. The β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS) 1The abbreviations used are: KASβ-ketoacyl-ACP synthaseACPacyl carrier proteinX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactosideTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineCRIMconditional-replication, integration, and modular.1The abbreviations used are: KASβ-ketoacyl-ACP synthaseACPacyl carrier proteinX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactosideTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineCRIMconditional-replication, integration, and modular. provide a good example. All organisms using a type II pathway contain at least two KAS enzymes, KAS II and KAS III (1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). KAS II is the generic enzyme responsible for the elongations required for synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, whereas KAS III is thought to catalyze the first condensation reaction to produce the butryl thioester of acyl carrier protein (ACP) (1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B.

C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). Butyryl-ACP is then thought to act as a substrate for the KAS II-catalyzed elongations that result in long-chain fatty acids (1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.

That is, KAS III is thought to provide a primer for KAS II (and other long-chain KAS isozymes, if present). The in vivo function of KAS II is clearly established because mutants (called fabF) lacking this enzyme have been well studied in Escherichia coli (1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar) and other bacteria (3Allen E.E. Bartlett D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Kutchma A.J. Hoang T.T. Schweizer H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5498-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the postulated role of KAS III is based only on biochemical analyses, despite considerable efforts no mutant organism lacking this enzyme has been described. Moreover in E. coli, which contains KAS III and two long-chain KAS enzymes (KAS I and KAS II), only KAS I appears essential. This premise is based on the observation that overproduction of KAS I, but not KAS III, conferred resistance to thiolactomycin, an antibiotic that inhibits all three KAS isozymes in vitro (5Tsay J.T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fabB mutations that confer thiolactomycin resistance to E. coli have been isolated (6Jackowski S. Zhang Y.M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, it has not been shown that the inhibitor is equally effective in vivo. The presence of a significant intracellular pool of acetyl-ACP in E. coli (7Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is also difficult to reconcile with the postulated role of KAS III because KAS III condenses acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP and is inactive with acetyl-ACP (8Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tsay J.T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The goal of the present study was to elucidate the pathways involved in the initiation of fatty acid synthesis and to clarify the physiological role of FabH. Despite numerous attempts we have failed to obtain fabH mutants of E. coli and Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium. A difficulty in these Gram-negative bacteria is that a low level of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is required to produce the acyl-ACP precursors of lipid A (10Silbert D.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 315-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Anderson M.S. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5159-5169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus null mutant strains lacking essential fatty acid synthetic genes cannot be isolated. We therefore turned to a Gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis (Gram-positive bacteria lack lipid A). L. lactis is one of the best characterized lactic acid bacteria and the genome of L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 has been sequenced (13Bolotin A. Mauger S. Malarme K. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 27-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Lactic acid bacteria require biotin for growth and it has been reported that oleate or a derivative of oleate such as Tween 80 can functionally replace biotin (14Potter R.L. Elvehjem C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 172: 531-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Williams W.L. Broquist H.P. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 170: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Williams V.R.

Chem. 1947; 169: 761-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin is the required cofactor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the essential enzyme carrying out the first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis (18Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The observation that biotin-free media (containing aspartate to bypass the loss of pyruvate carboxylase, a second biotin-requiring enzyme) cannot support the growth of lactic acid bacteria and that exogenous fatty acids (or Tween 80) that functionally replace biotin can be explained by a lack of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity that results from blockage of fatty acid synthesis. Because exogenous fatty acids have biotin-replacing capability in other lactic acid bacteria (14Potter R.L. Elvehjem C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 172: 531-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Williams W.L. Broquist H.P. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 170: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Williams V.R.

Chem. 1947; 169: 761-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that null mutants lacking essential fatty acid synthetic genes should grow with exogenous fatty acid supplementation unlike the case in Gram-negative bacteria (10Silbert D.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 315-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Anderson M.S. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

In this paper, we report the isolation of the first fabH null mutant obtained in any organism by gene replacement in L. lactis subsp. lactis.We also demonstrated the essentiality of KAS III in E. coli and conducted biochemical characterizations of the L. lactis fabH mutant to elucidate the physiological roles of KAS III.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. All bacterial strains are derivatives of E. coli K-12 or Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 except L. lactis subsp. lactis strain IL1403. Strain CL66 containing a fabH point mutation R271K (presumably resulting from a prior PCR amplification) was used as a template for PCR amplification of the S. enterica fabH. Plasmid pCL49 was obtained by insertion of the 2-kb plsX (truncated) plus fabH PCR product of S. enterica chromosomal DNA (amplified with primers SalS-N and SalH-C, Table II) into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pORI280 that contains an erythromycin resistance gene, the origin of lactococcal replication of plasmid pWV01, and the E. coli β-galactosidase gene expressed under lactococcal promoter P32 was used as the vector for gene replacement (19Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Kok J. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 35-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCL58 was constructed by insertion of the 1.2-kb fabH PCR product of L. lactis chromosome DNA (amplified with primers LacH-P and LacH-C, Table II) into pCR2.1. Plasmid pCL61 containing the complete L. lactis fabH gene was derived by insertion of the 1.2-kb BamHI-XbaI fabH fragment of pCL58 into pK18 (20Pridmore R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. Plasmid pCL62 containing the in-frame fabH deletion was constructed by digestion of pCL61 with BcgI followed by formation of blunt ends by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase plus the 4 dNTPs followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. To ensure that the expected fabH in-frame deletion had been made, the deletion region was checked by sequencing. Plasmid pCL66 was obtained by insertion of the 1.2-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment (containing the in-frame fabH deletion) of pCL62 into pORI280 cut with the same enzymes. All primers (Table II) used for PCR in this work were synthesized by the Genetic Engineering Facility, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this workStrains or plasmidRelevent characteristicsSources or referencesE. coli MG1655Wild-typeLab collection UB1005F-metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216 λrλ-Lab collection DY330W3110 ΔlacU169 gal490 λc1857 Δ(cro-bioA)23Yu D.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) liquid medium, or on agar plates made of rich broth or LB. L. lactis cultures were grown in GM17 medium (Difco) or on GM17 agar plates (19Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Kok J. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 35-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (in μg/ml): kanamycin, 50; ampicillin, 100; spectinomycin, 100; tetracycline, 12; and erythromycin, 150. Single copy integrants of E. coli were selected using a mixture of spectinomycin and streptomycin at 17.5 μg/ml each. Single copy integrants of L. lactis were selected using erythromycin at 5 μg/ml. Final concentrations of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.2% arabinose, 0.4% glucose, 0.005% fucose, 0.3 mg/ml avidin, 0.1% Tween 40, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.02% oleate, 0.02% octanoic acid, 0.02% cis-vaccinate, and 0.2% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 (a metabolically inert detergent used to solubilize fatty acids) were obtained by appropriate supplementation of the media.The minimal medium contained medium E and 4% vitamin-free casamino acids plus the following (final concentrations in mm) major components: glucose, 100; sodium acetate, 30; asparagines, 1.6; glutamine, 10; tryptophan, 1; sodium chloride, 50; ammonium chloride, 9.5, potassium sulfate, 0.28; potassium phosphate, 1.3 mm; and Tricine, 4.

The pantothenate was replaced with the radioactive species for labeling studies. The fatty acid supplement consisted of (final concentrations) 0.1% Tween 40 and Tween 80 plus 0.02% oleic acid.CRIM Plasmid Integration—Ligation mixtures containing EcoRI-digested pAH144 and the 2-kb S. enterica fabH EcoRI fragment of pCL49 were transformed into both strain UB1005 and strain DY330 carrying the CRIM helper plasmid pAH69, and transformants resistant to both spectinomycin and streptomycin were selected. The resulting S. enterica fabH integrants CL81 (from UB1005) and CL106 (from DY330) were verified by PCR using primers SalS-N, SalH-C (Table II), and the copy number of the integrants were checked by use of primers P1, P2, P3, and P4 (21Zhang Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Construction of an E. coli fabH Deletion Mutation in the Presence of S. enterica fabH—Linear DNA fragments carrying a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by the FRT sites were amplified by PCR from pKD13 using primers 1 and 2 (Table II). These primers were homologous at the 3′ end to priming sequences in pKD13 and contained 40-base 5′ end extensions homologous to E. coli fabH. The respective 1.4-kb PCR products were purified, treated with DpnI, and then transformed into CL106, the strain harboring a λ prophage that contains recombination genes exo, bet, and gam under control of a temperature-sensitive λcI-repressor (23Yu D.

The resulting strain CL110 that contained a replacement of the E. coli fabH gene by the kanamycin cassette was then transduced by phage P1 into strain CL81 with selection for kanamycin resistance. Strain CL111 carrying the E. coli fabH deletion and a copy of the S. enterica fabH integrated into the chromosomal attHK022 site was obtained and verified by PCR using primers SalS-N and SalH-C (Table II).Construction of the L. lactis fabH Null Deletion Mutant—The replacement of the L. lactis fabH gene was conducted according to the method of Leenhouts et al. (19Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Kok J. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 35-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Plasmid pCL66 containing an in-frame fabH deletion was transformed into strain IL1403 followed by selection on GSM17E5 agar plates (19Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Kok J. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 35-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 40, 0.1% Tween 80, and 0.02% oleate at 30 °C. These transformants were then plated on GM17E5 plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indoyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) plates supplemented with fatty acids as above and blue colonies were isolated. The integrant strain was grown in GM17 medium with fatty acid supplementation and the overnight culture was diluted 106 times and 2 μl were inoculated into 2 ml of GM17 medium containing fatty acids and grown overnight at 30 °C. Dilutions of the overnight culture were plated on GM17 plus X-gal supplemented with fatty acids and screened for white colonies. All white colonies were then PCR amplified using primers LacH-P and LacH-C (Table II) and the resulting PCR products were digested with either BcgI or HpaI. Strains having PCR fragments digested by HpaI, but not by BcgI, were candidate fabH deletion mutants. The PCR products of these strains were then cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 and checked by sequencing. One of these strains, CL112, had the expected sequence and was subjected to Southern blot analysisKAS III Assay—Acetoacetyl-ACP synthase activity was assayed according to Tsay et al. (5Tsay J.T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixtures contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 70 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), 265 μm ACP, 1.1 mm cerulenin, and 25, 50, or 100 μg of extract protein from either strain IL1403 or strain CL112 (ΔfabH) in a final volume of 80 μl. The mixture of ACP, sodium phosphate, and 2-mercaptoethanol was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min to obtain complete reduction of ACP. The remaining components excepting protein were then added. The reaction was initiated by addition of protein and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The assay mixture was then pipetted onto a 3MM filter disc. The discs were washed successively with 10, 5, and 1% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid at 20 ml/filter. The filters were then dried and counted in 4 ml of liquid scintillation fluor solution.Synthesis of [3-3H]Pantothenate—E. coli strain AT1371 carrying plasmid pEC (24von Delft F. Lewendon A.

Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 439-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was grown overnight at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium containing isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (70 μg/ml) and ampicillin. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 10 ml of TD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol), and disrupted in a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged in a JA-20 rotor at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h to remove cell debris. A protein fraction obtained by adding ammonium sulfate to the supernatant to 60% of saturation was collected. The protein pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of TD buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of the same buffer. Synthesis of [3H]pantothenate was performed according to Cronan (25Cronan Jr., J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 103: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The pantothenate synthetase reaction contained 5 mm d-pantoic acid, 10 mm ATP (potassium salt), 10 mm MgSO4, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10, 100 mm NH4Cl, 0.3 mm β-[3-3H]alanine (specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol), and 90 μl of crude extract of pantothenate synthetase in a final volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 28 h and then applied to a 0.6 × 2.5-cm column of AG 50W-X8 (hydrogen form) ion exchange resin. [3-3H]Pantothenate was eluted in 81% yield with 1 ml of H2O, evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and dissolved in the minimal medium given above (with pantothenate omitted) and sterilized by filtration.In Vivo Labeling of ACP Pools—Strains IL1403 and CL112 (ΔfabH) were grown at 30 °C for 72 h in the [3H]pantothenate-containing minimal medium described above. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cells were washed 3 times with cold M9 medium, and lysed on ice by the method of Clewell and Helinski (26Clewell D.B. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged to sediment the DNA and supernatant fluid was fractionated on a 15% PAGE gel containing 2.5 m urea at 4 °C. The ACP species were desterified by treating the lysate with 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h and analyzed on the same gel. The gels were then subjected to fluorography.Ph"
https://openalex.org/W2052913796,"Integrins are cell surface heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that, in addition to mediating cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins modulate cell survival. This mechanism may be exploited in cancer where evasion from apoptosis invariably contributes to cellular transformation. The molecular mechanisms responsible for matrix-induced survival signals begin to be elucidated. Here we report that the inhibitor of apoptosis survivin is expressed in vitro in human prostate cell lines with the highest levels present in aggressive prostate cancer cells such as PC3 and LNCaP-LN3 as well as in vivo in prostatic adenocarcinoma. We also show that interference with survivin in PC3 prostate cancer cells using a Cys84→ Ala dominant negative mutant or survivin antisense cDNA causes nuclear fragmentation, hypodiploidy, cleavage of a 32-kDa proform caspase-3 to active caspase-3, and proteolysis of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We demonstrate that in the aggressive PC3 cell line, adhesion to fibronectin via β1 integrins results in up-regulation of survivin and protection from apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In contrast, survivin is not up-regulated by cell adhesion in the non-tumorigenic LNCaP cell line. Dominant negative survivin counteracts the ability of fibronectin to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis, whereas wild-type survivin protects non-adherent cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Evidence is provided that expression of β1A integrin is necessary to protect non-adherent cells transduced with survivin from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the β1C integrin, which contains a variant cytoplasmic domain, is not able to prevent apoptosis induced by TNF-α in non-adherent cells transduced with survivin. Finally, we show that regulation of survivin levels by integrins are mediated by protein kinase B/AKT. These findings indicate that survivin is required to maintain a critical anti-apoptotic threshold in prostate cancer cells and identify integrin signaling as a crucial survival pathway against death receptor-mediated apoptosis.

This mechanism of integrin-dependent cytoprotection is operative against a variety of death-promoting stimuli, acting through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or extrinsic (death receptor) apoptotic pathway and involving growth factor withdrawal (2.Zhang Z.

Critical signaling intermediates involved in integrin-dependent cell survival have been identified, and integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM stimulates the production of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (10.Khwaja A.

In turn, active AKT interferes with the apoptotic machinery by phosphorylating thus sequestering the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BAD, by inactivating members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, and by promoting NF-κB-dependent cytoprotection via transcriptional activation of a plethora of downstream target genes (13.Datta S.R.

The effector molecules involved in integrin-dependent cell survival have not been completely elucidated. Engagement of fibronectin through α5β1 and αvβ1 and of vitronectin through αvβ3 integrins has been associated with up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and with Bcl-2-mediated protection from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (2.Zhang Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27757-27763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Whether other cytoprotective mechanisms for integrin-dependent cell survival exist in normal or tumor cells has not been determined. In addition to the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators, a second group of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins has been recently identified (15.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Survivin, a member of the IAP family of proteins, is expressed during embryonic and fetal development but undetectable in most normal adult tissues (16.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). However, survivin becomes the fourth most expressed transcript in human cancer (17.Velculescu V.E. Madden S.L. Zhang L. Lash A.E.

Several studies have shown that survivin expression inhibits cell death induced by various apoptotic stimuli in vitro (19.Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in vivo (18.Altieri D.C. Trends Mol.

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (21.Greenlee R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Murray T. Thun M. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Evolution from a localized to an invasive fatal disease is accompanied by progression from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state (22.Sadar M.D. Hussain M. Bruchovsky N. Endocrine-Related Cancer. 1999; 6: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and by the emergence of apoptosis-resistant cells within primary and/or metastatic tumors. Although several anti-cancer strategies have been shown to exert their cytotoxic effect via activation of an apoptotic program, the limited efficacy of anti-cancer drugs against epithelial neoplasms implies the ability of tumor cells to raise their anti-apoptotic threshold, thus evading cell death. Despite growing evidence regarding the important role of integrins in tumorigenesis and in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, the molecular mechanisms underlying integrin-mediated survival signaling in cancer cells are not completely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that cell adhesion to fibronectin via β1 integrins regulates survivin protein levels and provides protection against death-induced stimuli via AKT activation. Conversely, inhibition of survivin function reverses the cytoprotective effect of ECM proteins and results in tumor cell apoptosis. We also show that the β1A integrin cytodomain is essential for cytoprotection against death-inducing stimuli in a survivin-dependent manner. We conclude that the activation of survival pathways mediated by integrins and survivin may contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells.

Non-immune rabbit IgG and mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma and used as controls. Fibronectin and vitronectin were purified from human plasma and serum, respectively, as described previously (24.Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J.

RWPE-1 cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Invitrogen) and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen). To obtain PC3 stable cell lines expressing either β1C or β1A integrins under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter, chimeric cDNAs consisting of the chicken β1 extracellular and transmembrane domain and either human β1C or human β1A cytodomain sequences were generated by PCR-driven splice overlap extension (28.Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). These chimeric constructs allow one to distinguish between endogenous β1 integrin and exogenous β1C and β1A integrin variants in human cells. PCR reactions were performed using an automatic thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The conditions used for the PCR reactions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; annealing at 45 °C for 1 min; and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. 30 cycles of amplification were used. The amplification was performed in 1× Vent polymerase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), 200 μm each dNTP (PerkinElmer Life Science), 0.15 μm of each primer, 2 mm MgSO4 (PerkinElmer Life Science), and 0.5 units of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The following synthetic nucleotides were used as primers to amplify chicken β1 subunit from nucleotides (nt) 1787 to 2365 using chicken β1 cDNA template (29.Tamkun J.W. DeSimone D.W. Fonda D.

Additional primers were designed to amplify either human β1A cytodomain sequences from nucleotides 2357 to 2497 (30.Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or human β1C cytodomain sequences from nucleotides 2357 to 2613 (31.Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using human β1A or human β1C cDNA template, respectively. These primers were: CH2 (nt 2351–2365 of chicken β1 and nt 2357–2371 of human β1) 5′-TTGTTATTGATTTGGAAGCTTTTAATGATA-3′ and H1 (nt 2483–2505 of human β1) 5′-GGACTAGTTTTTCCCTCATACTT-3′. The chimeric primers CH1 and CH2 corresponded to a region that was identical between the species and were complementary to each other. The amplified chicken and human cDNA fragments were mixed and subjected to an additional amplification using C1 as forward primer and H1 as reverse primer. The resulting chimeric cDNA fragments (718-bp chicken/human β1A and the 834-bp chicken/human β1C) were subcloned into pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. The 718-bp chicken/human β1A and the 834-bp chicken/human β1C chimeras were excised from pCR2.1 using ClaI and SpeI and subcloned into pTet-Splice expression vector (32.Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were digested with SalI and ClaI to allow ligation of a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1–1787 of the chicken β1 extracellular domain, which was isolated from pECE-β1 (kindly provided by Dr. Hynes, Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, Boston, MA) using SalI and ClaI restriction enzymes. The chimeric constructs (pTet-chicken/human β1C and pTet-chicken/human β1A) were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method to confirm the nature of the chimeric inserts.

G418-resistant clones were isolated and screened for cell surface expression of either chicken/human β1C or chicken/human β1A integrin by FACS using W1B10, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of chicken β1 integrin, or 12CA5 as a negative control as described previously (34.Fornaro M.

In some experiments, subconfluent PC3 and LNCaP cells were serum-starved for 24 h, detached using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), and washed three times with serum-free medium. PC3 (4 × 105) and LNCaP (1 × 106) cells were then plated onto 60-mm Petri dishes coated with 10 mg/ml BSA, 5 μg/ml fibronectin, or with 10 μg/ml vitronectin for 8 and 24 h in serum-free medium in the absence or in the presence of either 20 μg/ml Act D or of 10 μg/ml CHX. Cells were then lysed as described above. Protein content in each lysate was quantitated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce).

PC3 cells were plated onto 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with the various GFP constructs using a mixture of 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). After a 7-h culture at 37 °C, the transfection mixture was aspirated and substituted with complete growth medium. Cells (floating plus attached cells) were harvested after 1–4 days from transfection, fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice, and spun for 5 min at 1,300 rpm. Cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C, propidium iodide was added at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and samples were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. Alternatively, cells were harvested 1–4 days after transfection, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22 °C. Cell nuclei were stained with 6.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), 16% polyvinyl alcohol (Air Products and Chemicals, Allentown, PA), and 40% glycerol. GFP-expressing cells were independently scored for morphologic signs of apoptosis (chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation) using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. In another set of experiments, PC3 cells (1 × 106) in 100-mm plates were transfected with 15 μg of dn AKT along with 3 μg of pEGFPc1 plasmid (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE. Cells were then detached using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, washed three times with serum-free medium, and plated (4 × 105) onto 60-mm Petri dishes coated with either 10 mg/ml BSA or with 5 μg/ml fibronectin for 8 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with 150 ng/ml TNF-α plus 3 μg/ml CHX for an additional 42 h at 37 °C. Survivin expression was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Caspase Activation—PC3 cells transfected with the various GFP constructs in the presence or in the absence of Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm) were harvested after a 2-day culture at 37 °C and assayed for caspase-3-dependent hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, BD Biosciences) as described previously (39.Mesri M.

DNA Fragmentation Assay—PC3 cells (4 × 105) were plated onto 60-mm Petri dishes coated with either 10 mg/ml BSA or with 5 μg/ml fibronectin for 4 h in serum-free medium. Cells were treated with 150 ng/ml TNF-α plus 3 μg/ml CHX or with 500 μm etoposide in the presence or in the absence of Z-VAD fmk (40 μm) for an additional 42 h at 37 °C. DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on floating plus attached cells was performed using the Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenoviral Targeting of Survivin in PC3 Cells—The experimental procedures for the generation and expansion in human embryonic kidney 293 cells of replication-defective adenovirus constructs encoding survivin (pAd-survivin), the phosphorylation-deficient survivin Thr-34→ Ala dn mutant (pAd-T34A), or control pAd-GFP have been described previously (37.Mesri M.

With this protocol, there was no generation of replication competent adenoviral particles. PC3 cells (1.5 × 106) in 100-mm plates were infected with pAd-GFP, pAd-survivin, or pAd-T34A at m.o.i of 50–100 for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then detached using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, washed three times with serum-free medium, and plated (4 × 105) onto 60-mm Petri dishes coated with either 10 mg/ml BSA or with 5 μg/ml fibronectin for 8 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then treated with 150 ng/ml TNF-α plus 3 μg/ml CHX for an additional 42 h at 37 °C. Cells (floating plus attached cells) were fixed in 70% ethanol, and GFP-expressing cells were analyzed for DNA content as described above. PC3-β1C and PC3-β1A stable cell lines were cultured for 72 h in growth medium either in the absence or in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were infected with pAd-GFP or pAd-survivin at m.o.i. of 50–100 for 24 h at 37 °C during the last 24 h of the 72-h culture. Cells were harvested using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA and then plated (4 × 105) onto 60-mm Petri dishes coated with 10 mg/ml BSA for 8 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then treated with 150 ng/ml TNFα plus 3 μg/ml CHX for an additional 20–24 h at 37 °C and then analyzed for DNA content as described above. Statistical Analysis—Group differences were compared using Student's t test. Survivin Targeting Causes Spontaneous Apoptosis in PC3 Cells—The relative levels of survivin expression among different prostate cell lines were compared by immunoblotting. Consistent with previous observations (19.Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar), survivin expression was detected in all of the prostate cancer cell lines analyzed. The highest levels of survivin were present in highly aggressive prostate cancer cells such as PC3 and LNCaP-LN3 (Fig. 1A). At variance with the results obtained in malignant epithelial cells, survivin expression was very low in non-tumorigenic and noninvasive LNCaP prostate cancer"
https://openalex.org/W2006524726,"Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with developmental features caused by mutations in the inward rectifier K+ channel gene KCNJ2. Patients harboring these mutations exhibit extremely variable expressivities. To explore whether these mutations can be correlated with a specific patient phenotype, we expressed both wild-type (WT) and mutant genes cloned into a bi-cistronic vector. Functional expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that none of the mutant channels express current when present alone. When co-expressed with WT channels, only construct V302M-WT yields inward current. Confocal microscopy fluorescence revealed three patterns of channel expression in the cell: 1) mutations D71V, N216H, R218Q, and pore mutations co-assemble and co-localize to the membrane with the WT and exert a dominant-negative effect on the WT channels; 2) mutation V302M leads to channels that lose their ability to co-assemble with WT and traffic to the cell surface; 3) deletions Δ95-98 and Δ314-315 lead to channels that do not traffic to the membrane but retain their ability to co-assemble with WT channels. These data show that the Andersen-Tawil syndrome phenotype may occur through a dominant-negative effect as well as through haplo-insufficiency and reveal amino acids critical in trafficking and conductance of the inward rectifier K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2078734222,"One of the most common DNA lesions arising in cells is an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site resulting from base loss. Although a template strand AP site impedes DNA synthesis, translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases can bypass an AP site. Because this bypass is expected to be highly mutagenic because of loss of base coding potential, here we quantify the efficiency and the specificity of AP site bypass by two Y family TLS enzymes, Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase 4 (Dpo4) and human DNA polymerase η (Pol η). During a single cycle of processive DNA synthesis, Dpo4 and Pol η bypass synthetic AP sites with 13–30 and 10–13%, respectively, of the bypass efficiency for undamaged bases in the same sequence contexts. These efficiencies are higher than for the A family, exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. We then determined AP site bypass specificity for complete bypass, requiring insertion or misalignment at the AP site followed by multiple incorporations using the aberrant primer templates. Although Dpo4, Pol η, and Klenow polymerase have different fidelity when copying undamaged DNA, bypass of AP sites lacking A or G by all three polymerases is nearly 100% mutagenic. The majority (70–80%) of bypass events made by all three polymerases are insertion of dAMP opposite the AP site. Single base deletion errors comprise 10–25% of bypass events, with other base insertions observed at lower rates. Given that mammalian cells contain five polymerases implicated in TLS, and given that a large number of AP sites are generated per mammalian cell per day, even moderately efficient AP site bypass could be a source of substitution and frameshift mutagenesis in vivo.

Several endogenous cellular processes and external environmental stresses generate a wide array of lesions in DNA. Although cells have evolved remarkably efficient systems to repair DNA damage, some lesions inevitably escape repair and may be encountered by one or more of the multiple DNA polymerases present in cells. Some of these lesions, including bulky adducts that alter helix geometry, strongly impede DNA synthesis by replicative and repair DNA polymerases in the A, B, and X families. However, organisms in all three kingdoms of life also contain DNA polymerases in the Y superfamily (1.Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W.

Pol ι, Pol κ, and Rev1. Y family enzymes are of special interest by virtue of their remarkable ability to perform translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). A compelling example is human Pol η, which bypasses a cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer produced by exposure to sunlight much better than do the major replicative DNA polymerases (2.Masutani C.

Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The importance of this unusual TLS capacity is illustrated by the fact that mutations in the human POLH gene that inactivate Pol η result in a 1000-fold increase in susceptibility to sunlight-induced skin cancer (4.Masutani C.

In the past four years, a number of investigations have defined the ability of Y family polymerases to perform TLS using a variety of structurally diverse and potentially mutagenic lesions in template DNA. These studies clearly show that TLS capacity depends on both the DNA polymerase and the lesion. For example, in addition to bypassing a thymine dimer, human Pol η can bypass cisplatin and acetylaminofluorene adducts but not 6–4 photoproducts or certain N2-guanine adducts (6.Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Yuan F. Zhang Y. Rajpal D.K. Wu X. Guo D. Wang M. Taylor J.S. Wang Z. J. Biol.

Pol κ has somewhat different TLS capacity, bypassing benzopyrene and acetylaminofluorene adducts but not cisplatin adducts or UV-photoproducts (9.Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang M. Rechkoblit O.

A. 2001; 98: 8355-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have also addressed the mutagenic potential of TLS with different polymerase-lesion combinations. These studies often involve non-quantitative primer extension reactions using a single correct or incorrect dNTP, or they measure steady-state kinetic parameters for nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion and, in some cases, single base extension from the resulting damaged primer terminus. Such studies of individual events in bypass reactions have led to inferences about what the error rate of a complete lesion bypass reaction containing all four dNTPs might be, and they have provided important initial insights into the probability that any particular TLS event might suppress or promote lesion-specific mutagenesis in vivo. The current study is intended to advance our understanding of complete lesion bypass, i.e. insertion at the lesion plus the additional incorporations involving the damaged primer-template and requiring that all four dNTPs are present. We describe two approaches that can be used to generate quantitative information on TLS efficiency and fidelity with a variety of polymerase-lesion combinations. Here we apply these approaches to one of the most common DNA lesions arising in cells, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site generated when the N-glycosyl bond between a base and a sugar is cleaved. In a mammalian cell, as many as 10,000 to 50,000 AP sites may arise per day by spontaneous depurination (13.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4412) Google Scholar, 14.Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar), and additional AP sites are produced by DNA glycosylases as they remove alkylated and oxidized bases. Because no DNA base is available to instruct incorporation of an incoming dNTP, bypass of an AP site is logically expected to be highly mutagenic. This high mutagenic potential and the sheer number of AP sites arising per day in a cell has prompted many investigations of the consequences of AP site bypass by DNA polymerases in vitro and in vivo. Early studies (reviewed in Refs. 15.Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar and 16.Strauss B.S. Cancer Surv. 1985; 4: 493-516PubMed Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that DNA polymerases in the A, B, C, and X families do not efficiently bypass template AP sites. However, when bypass was observed, the most common event (with exceptions) involved insertion of dAMP opposite an AP site, a specificity that became known as the “A rule” (reviewed in Ref. 17.Strauss B.S. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The more recent realization that Y family polymerases can bypass certain lesions more efficiently than do polymerases in other families logically led to several studies of AP site bypass by Y family polymerases. For example, in primer extension reactions using relatively high ratios of polymerase to primer-template and long incubation times that permit multiple polymerase-lesion encounters, human Pol η (18.Haracska L. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6861-6866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Sso Dpo4 (19.Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can both bypass AP sites. However, the efficiency with which this bypass occurs during a single polymerization cycle has not yet been determined. Moreover, the base insertion specificity and frameshift fidelity of a complete AP site bypass reaction containing all four dNTPs has not yet been quantified for Pol η, Dpo4, or other Y family polymerases. Therefore, to better appreciate the mutagenic potential of an encounter between an AP site and Y family TLS polymerases, here we quantify the synthetic AP site bypass efficiency and specificity of Pol η and Sso Dpo4. We chose to develop the two experimental approaches with this particular lesion/polymerase combination, because AP sites lack base coding potential and should be highly mutagenic, and because detailed information on fidelity with undamaged DNA and on protein structure is available for both Pol η (20.Matsuda T.

To place the results in perspective, we also apply the same approaches to the exonuclease deficient form of the large Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. This is an extensively studied A family polymerase for which structural information is also available and that has much higher fidelity on undamaged DNA (24.Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than do naturally exonuclease deficient TLS polymerases like Pol η (20.Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C.

Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase, the Klenow fragment (exonuclease-deficient) of E. coli (Kf (exo–)), and the restriction enzymes PstI and EcoRI were purchased from New England Biolabs. Gel-purified or high performance liquid chromatography-purified DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR) and Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and dNTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Human DNA polymerase η was expressed and purified as described previously (6.Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid p1914, which contains the P2 dpo4 gene of Sulfolobus sulfataricus, was obtained from R. Woodgate. Purification of Dpo4 —Dpo4 was purified as described previously (19.Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. BL21 (DE3) containing p1914 was grown to an A595 of 0.5 at 37 °C. Expression of Dpo4 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm and continued growth for 3 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KHPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The cleared lysate was treated at 75 °C for 5 min to allow for denaturation of many of the proteins from E. coli. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a heparin fractionation column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient containing 100–1000 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Dpo4 were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Dpo4 was further purified by fractionation on a MonoS column equilibrated in Buffer B. Proteins were eluted with a 50–1000 mm NaCl gradient. SDS-polyacrylamide gel fractionation of a sample from the pooled peak fractions showed a single polypeptide following Coomassie Blue staining. DNA Substrates for Primer Extension Reactions—For the AP site bypass experiments, two substrates containing an abasic site in different sequence contexts were constructed. The TFG substrate was formed by annealing a 5′[32P]-labeled 25-mer primer strand (5′-AATTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCCAAAGG-3′) and the 45-mer template oligonucleotide (5′-CCAGCTCGGTACCGGGCTFGCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGAAATT-3′), where F contains tetrahydrofuran, a functional mimic of an abasic site (27.Takeshita M. Chang C.N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TAF substrate was prepared by annealing a 5′[32P]-labeled 24-mer primer strand (5′-AATTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCCAAAG-3′) and the 45-mer template (5′-CCAGCTCGGTACCGGGCTAFCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGAAATT-3′). Identical control substrates containing undamaged nucleotides were likewise constructed. The undamaged control for the TFG substrate contained an A residue in place of F and the undamaged substrate paired with the TAF substrate contained a G residue substituted for F. For the fidelity experiments, TFG and TAF substrates were prepared using an unlabeled 25-mer primer strand. For all substrates, oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing primer and template DNA strands in a 1:1.5 ratio. Mixtures were placed at 85 °C and slowly cooled to 25 °C. Bypass Assay—All reactions (30 μl) contained 130 nm substrate. For Dpo4, reactions were run at 70 °C in mixtures containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (at 22 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 100 μm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 0.25–0.50 nm Dpo4. For DNA polymerase η, reactions containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 100 μm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 1.8–5.2 nm human DNA polymerase η were run at 37 °C. Reactions with Kf (exo–) were run at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 0.13–2.5 nm Kf (exo–). At time intervals from 2 to 8 min, aliquots were removed from the reaction and quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide in 25 mm EDTA. Reaction products were fractionated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified by phosphorimaging on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860. Assay for Specificity during AP Site Bypass—Reactions were performed as described above using 13 nm Dpo4, 25–130 nm human Pol η, and 13–130 nm Kf (exo–) with unlabeled substrates in the presence of 50 μCi (3000 Ci/mmol) of [α-32P]dCTP. Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the reaction products were digested with PstI and separated by electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Labeled primer strand extension products running from 32 to 36 nucleotides in length were excised from the gel and eluted by a crush-andsoak method (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 6.46-6.48Google Scholar). Recovery of the oligonucleotide DNA was quantified by the amount of radioactivity in the sample. The oligonucleotide was annealed to a gapped M13lac DNA at 5- to 10-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide to gapped DNA as described previously (26.Matsuda T. Vande Berg B.J. Bebenek K. Osheroff W.P. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25947-25951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting hybrids were transfected into E. coli and plated to score mutation frequency by plaque color (25.Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from a number of independent revertants and sequenced through the 35-nucleotide region to determine the specific sequence alteration responsible for the reversion event. To determine the efficiency of (–) strand expression following transfection, eight different 35-mer oligonucleotides (5′-GGTCGACTCCAAAGGCTAGCCCGGTACCGAGCTGG-3′), each containing a different single base at CTA (shown in bold), were hybridized as above to gapped circular M13 DNA. The sequences at this CTA region for the eight oligonucleotides are as follows: CCA, CAA, CGA, ATA, GTA, CTG, CTT, CTC. Each of these oligonucleotides creates a different mispair at a TAG stop codon within the lacZ coding sequence. Each of the eight hybrids were transfected and scored for plaque color as described above. Strategy To Measure TLS Efficiency—The approach uses DNA substrates with a 45-base template strand annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled 25-base primer strand. Two substrates are compared, one with an undamaged template strand and the other with a lesion located at a defined position. In this case we use a synthetic AP site (a tetrahydrofuran residue, designated F) located two nucleotides downstream of the 3′ terminus of the primer strand (Fig. 1). Primer extension is performed in reaction mixtures containing a large excess of template-primer over polymerase, such that once a primer is extended, the probability that it will be used a second time is negligible, i.e. the products reflect a single cycle of synthesis. Radiolabeled DNA products are resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a phosphorimager. As described previously (29.Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R.

Termination probability at any template position is defined (Fig. 1) as the band intensity at that position divided by the intensity at that position plus all longer products. Appropriate single-hit conditions are operating when termination probabilities remain constant with incubation time at any particular enzyme-substrate ratio, a condition that has been met for the values reported in this study. Termination of processive synthesis is usually followed by polymerase cycling to another, previously unused primer, as indicated by the fact that the ratio of original primers extended to polymerases molecules present is high. Importantly, the DNA product profile can also be used to calculate other parameters related to lesion bypass. Referring to the substrate in Fig. 1, these are as follows: (a) insertion probability, total products greater than or equal to (N2) divided by all products greater than or equal to (N1); (b) extension probability, products at (N3) or greater divided by products at (N2) or greater; (c) lesion bypass probability, products at (N3) or greater divided by (N1) or greater; (d) bypass efficiency, bypass probability with the damaged substrate over that seen with the undamaged substrate. Each of these parameters reflects the consequence of a single encounter of a polymerase with a lesion.Fig. 2Products of AP site bypass reactions. Reactions shown are for bypass reactions with Kf (exo–) (A), Dpo4 (B), and human DNA polymerase η (C). Panels on the left show bypass of an undamaged adenine residue within 5′-TAG substrate; panels on the right show bypass of an AP site within 5′-TFG substrate. Molar substrate-to-enzyme ratios and time of reaction in minutes are shown for each reaction product. All reactions are run with a substrate concentration of 130 nm. Locations of unreacted end-labeled primer (N0), full-length product (N20), and template moieties considered in bypass calculations (A and AP for undamaged and damaged substrates, respectively) are as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Efficiency of AP Site Bypass—Exonuclease-deficient Klenow polymerase is a moderately processive enzyme whose termination probability with undamaged DNA varies by template position from about 1 to 20% (31.Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13462-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results are observed with the undamaged template used here (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3 in left panel, 1000-fold excess of DNA). Termination probabilities are between 1 and 5% at template positions N1 through N7 (Fig. 3A, open bars). As expected based on earlier studies (16.Strauss B.S. Cancer Surv. 1985; 4: 493-516PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1981; 213: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a synthetic AP site strongly impedes synthesis by Klenow fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3 in right panel). When these data are quantified, termination probabilities (Fig. 3A, gray bars) are strongly increased at positions N1 (the base prior to the AP site) and N2 (the location of the AP site). The insertion probabilities opposite AP sites in two different sequence contexts (Fig. 4, top panel) are 77 and 55%, slightly lower than the probability of insertion opposite the equivalent undamaged positions (97 and 98%). However, extension probabilities from the resulting damaged primer-templates are only 3.8 and 6.5%, much lower than highly probable extension of undamaged substrates (95 and 97%). This reduces the percentage of AP sites that are actually bypassed to only 3% (Fig. 4, top panel). This strong barrier to synthesis is also seen with a 100-fold higher ratio of enzyme to DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7 in right panel). Even here, only 6% of primers resulting from insertion opposite the AP site are extended further, despite the fact that nearly all of the initially provided primers were extended indicating that repeated enzyme cycling occurred. AP site bypass efficiency increased beyond 3% only when the ratio of polymerase to DNA is 1:1 (Fig. 2A, right panel, lanes 8–10), and even then many of the primers resulting from insertion opposite the AP site are not extended.Fig. 4AP site bypass parameters. Insertion, extension, and bypass probabilities during replication at an AP site are shown for Kf (exo–) (top), Dpo4 (middle), and human DNA polymerase η (bottom). Measurements are given for AP site bypass in two different sequence contexts: 5′-TFG (left) and 5′-TAF (right). The nucleotide in the undamaged substrate for which these measurements are made is shown in bold in the legend at the top. Parameters are calculated as defined in Fig. 1 and the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For Dpo4, DNA synthesis using an undamaged template is moderately processive (19.Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the undamaged templates used here, termination probabilities vary from about 3 to 8% for positions N1 through N7 (see Fig. 2B, left panel and Fig. 3B, open bars). Just as for Klenow polymerase, Dpo4 termination probabilities at positions N1 and N2 were strongly increased with the AP site-containing substrate (Fig. 3, gray bars). Similar lesion-dependent increases were also detected at positions N3, N4, and N5. However, termination probabilities on the two substrates were not different at the position two nucleotides upstream of the lesion or at positions N6 through N8. When considered in light of Dpo4 structural information (see “Discussion”), this pattern likely reflects aberrant interactions between Dpo4 and AP sites present at various locations as bypass synthesis proceeds. Despite the increased termination probabilities at N1 through N5, Dpo4 is more efficient than Klenow polymerase in bypassing an AP site (e.g.Fig. 2B, right panel, lanes 2–9, all single-hit conditions as defined above). Bypass efficiency by Dpo4 with the TFG substrate is 30%, 9-fold higher than for Klenow polymerase (Fig. 4). Dpo4 is also more efficient than Klenow polymerase in bypassing an AP site in the TAF substrate (13 versus 3.7%). Interestingly, the higher overall bypass efficiencies of Dpo4 do not result from more probable insertion opposite the AP site, because in this parameter Klenow polymerase is actually greater than is Dpo4 (77 and 55 versus 45 and 38%, respectively). Instead, Dpo4 is more efficient in overall bypass because of the increased probability of extending an insertion opposite the AP site (60 and 31% for Dpo4 versus 3.8 and 6.5% for Klenow polymerase). Human Pol η has low processivity when copying undamaged DNA templates (see Refs. 6.Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

A. 2000; PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2C, left lanes 2–5), with termination probabilities of 40–80% observed with the undamaged 45-base templates used here (Fig. 3C, open bars). As with Klenow polymerase and Dpo4, Pol η termination probabilities at positions N1 and N2 were increased with the AP site-containing substrate (Fig. 3C, open bars). Thus, incorporation by all three polymerases is affected by the presence of an AP site in the template strand one position upstream of the polymerase active site. Pol η is relatively inefficient for nucleotide insertion opposite AP sites in the TFG and TAF substrates, as we"

To characterize the molecular basis of neuroligin interaction with neurexin-β, we expressed five soluble and exportable forms of neuroligin-1 from recombinant DNA sources, by truncating the protein before the transmembrane span near its carboxyl terminus. The extracellular domain of functional neuroligin-1 associates as a dimer when analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. By surface plasmon resonance, we established that soluble neuroligins-1 bind neurexin-1β, but the homologous α/β-hydrolase fold protein, acetylcholinesterase, failed to associate with the neurexins. Neuroligin-1 has a unique N-linked glycosylation pattern in the neuroligin family, and glycosylation and its processing modify neuroligin activity. Incomplete processing of the protein and enzymatic removal of the oligosaccharides chain or the terminal sialic acids from neuroligin-1 enhance its activity, whereas deglycosylation of neurexin-1β did not alter its association capacity. In particular, the N-linked glycosylation at position 303 appears to be a major determinant in modifying the association with neurexin-1β. We show here that glycosylation processing of neuroligin, in addition to mRNA splicing and gene selection, contributes to the specificity of the neurexin-β/neuroligin-1 association.

Appropriate differentiation and maturation of neurons are essential requirements for synapse formation and achieving patterns of fidelity for cell signaling. Because of the multiplicity of potential targets for any given axon and because of the asymmetric nature of the synapse, partner recognition is critical for developing and maintaining functional synapses (1.Brose N. Naturwissenschaften. 1999; 86: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2.Rao A. Harms K.J. Craig A.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

Association between the neurexin-β and neuroligins appears to be Ca2+-dependent and selectively blocked by insertion of an alternatively spliced region in NX1β (4.Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C.

Consistent with the hypothesis that NX1β and NL1 can mediate the assembly of the pre- and postsynaptic terminals, a recent investigation delineates some of the cellular processes involved in neuroligin-mediated synapse formation (12.Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Neuroligins have structural features typical of other type I cell surface receptors with an extended NH2-terminal globular region, an O-linked carbohydrate-rich domain linked to the single transmembrane region, and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain containing a PDZ recognition sequence (13.Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of NL1 consisting of 695 residues has an α/β-hydrolase fold that is characteristic of the cholinesterases and many other serine hydrolases. The NL1 extracellular domain contains two regions of alternative splicing: the first (residues 165–184) has a net charge of +8 and a potential disulfide formed between cysteines at positions 172 and 181; the second (residues 298–305) contains an N-glycosylation consensus sequence at Asn-303. NL1 contains a total of five potential N-glycosylation sites throughout the extracellular domain and, in the stalk region, a Ser-Thr-rich module that is likely to be highly O-glycosylated (10.Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of NL1 between the leader peptide and residue 638 shares ∼34% residue identity with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and probably the same α/β-hydrolase fold (14.Tsigelny I. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular determinants of the neuroligin-neurexin interaction, we constructed and expressed several truncated forms of NL1 in HEK293 cells. The truncated proteins are secreted into the cell culture medium, and can be purified as soluble neuroligins in milligram quantities. This enabled us to analyze several molecular features of NL1 that govern selectivity in its interaction with neurexin. Our findings indicate that specific post-translational modifications may provide an additional level of control in the NX1β-NL1 interaction. Plasmids, Mutagenesis—The rat-NX1β-1-hIgG fusion protein construct (hereafter referred as NX1β) was described previously (9.Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15.Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding rat-NL1 was subcloned into a FLAG-tagged vector (Sigma) for detection and purification, resulting in N-FLAG-NL1, encoding the FLAG octapeptide at the NH2 terminus, a linker peptide of 10 residues followed by the NL1 sequence beginning at Gln-46. Residue numbering begins at the methionine start site and includes the processed amino acid leader peptide (10.Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Five soluble mutants were also constructed by introducing stop codons at Tyr-692, Thr-652, Ile-639, His-634, and Leu-627 generating the proteins NL1–691, NL1–651, NL1–638, NL1–633, and NL1–626. To eliminate individual N-glycosylation consensus sequences Asn, Ser, or Thr were mutated to Ala generating the following proteins: T111A-NL1–638, N303A-NL1–638, N343A-NL1–638, and S549A-NL1–638. An N-FLAG-mouse-AChE expression plasmid, truncated at Pro-548 and lacking the most carboxyl-terminal cysteine and thus incapable of intersubunit cross-linking (mAChE-548), was also constructed. Mutation sequences were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and subsequently subcloned into vectors and verified by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. Large scale plasmid purifications used DEAE columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Mouse AChE truncated at Leu-539 was fused to the COOH-terminal part of NL1 starting at His-634, resulting in the AChE-NL1 chimera. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and periodically tested to ensure the absence of mycoplasma. Cells were transfected by (Ca)3(PO4)2 precipitation with 10 μg of plasmids carrying the neomycin acetyltransferase gene and were selected by growth in 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma). After 2–3 weeks, surviving cells formed colonies suitable for clonal selection. The best producing clones were further expanded for large scale production. NL1 and NX1β Expression and Purification—To purify soluble neuroligins and NX1β, 2–4 liters of media were typically collected over a few days from triple layer flasks (120 ml/flask) maintained in Ultraculture serum-free medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium containing expressed NL1 was passed over a column containing 6 ml of M2 anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) at ∼1 ml/min. After washing, the protein was eluted in 2.5 bed volumes of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) and the column was rinsed immediately with 2.5 bed volumes of Hepes buffer. The eluate and rinse were concentrated using Centriprep 30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to a final volume of 0.5–1 ml, and stored at 4 °C. For purification of the soluble NX1β fusion protein a similar set was used; however, protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was employed to bind the human-IgG portion of NX1β. Elution was accomplished with 10 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.5. The eluate was immediately pH-equilibrated with 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, per ml of eluate. To purify NL1 from cell extracts, 25–50 15-cm dishes were grown to confluence. The cells were then harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged, and resuspended in 5 ml of cold lysis buffer solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.04% benzamidine, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EGTA). The cell suspension was spun at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ° C to remove insoluble material and then at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing all the soluble proteins was cycled three times over a column containing 3 ml of M2 anti-FLAG affinity gel, washed, and eluted with FLAG peptide as above. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted in a Beckman Coulter XL-I centrifuge equipped with UV absorption optics using an An60 Ti rotor. Protein solutions of 30, 100, and 300 μg/ml NL1 were used in a six-channel charcoal-filled epon centerpiece loaded with 110 μl of sample and 125 μl of reference Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were spun at 20 °C for 16 h at 8,000, 10,000, and 12,000 rpm. Equilibrium was attained as judged by the overlay of the last three scans. Data were recorded in step mode with a Δr of 0.001 cm, and 5 replicate absorption measurements were performed at each step every 2 h. The partial specific volume, v̄, of NL1 was calculated using Sednterp software (version 1.06) accounting for total sugars. Molar masses of the proteins were calculated using XL-A/XL-I data analysis software version 4.0 based on the Origin™ program. Size Exclusion Chromatography—NL1–691, NL1–651, and NL1–638 were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column attached to a Pharmacia FPLC system. Columns were run at room temperature with Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, at 0.5 ml/min. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed on a PE Biosystems Voyager DE-STR instrument (Framingham, MA). Purified recombinant neuroligins at 1 mg/ml in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid were mixed 1:1 with a matrix of 10 mg/ml saturated sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) dissolved in 30% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.2. One-μl droplets of neuroligin/matrix mixture, containing ∼10 pmol of protein, were spotted and dried by slow evaporation. Mass spectra were collected using the linear mode and external calibration was performed using Yeast Enolase protein (+1 dimer, +1 and +2 monomer mass-to-charge species). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of the NL1-NX1β Complex— NL1 binding was analyzed at 25 °C using Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, on a BIAcore 3000. Protein A (Sigma) was covalently bound to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of a research grade CM5 chip (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) (16.Jonsson B. Lofas S. Lindqvist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). NX1β was indirectly captured by protein A via its IgG portion at a level between 100 and 1000 resonance units. This creates a stable surface without appreciable loss of signal over several hours at 25 °C. A separate reference surface contained protein A only. Reference data were subtracted from the sample flow channel to obtain specific NX1β binding. NL1 was usually injected over the NX1β surfaces as a set of 6 concentrations differing by 2-fold and compared with buffer alone. A flow rate of 50 μl/min was used to minimize sample diffusion and mass transport limitations. NX1β surface was regenerated by a 50 μl/min injection of regeneration solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) for 30 s. For kinetic experiments sensorgrams were fitted using a 1:1 stoichiometry model (Bievaluation 3.1, BIAcore Inc.). Primary Neuronal Culture, Co-culture Experiments, and Immunocytochemistry—Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 rats as previously described (17.Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips at a density of 150–500 cells/mm2 over a monolayer of glia. Cells were maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with 1 μg/well of cDNA (in a 6-well plate or in a 35-mm dish) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Transfected COS cells were added to the neurons at DIV 10–14. Two to 5 days after addition of the COS cells the cultures were fixed in cold 100% methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS or 0.1% saponin/PBS, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS with 1% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin. The following antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry of the cocultures: anti-neuroligin mouse monoclonal 4C12 (8.Song J.Y. Ichtchenko K. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal L067 (10.Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), anti-synapsin mouse monoclonal Cl10.22, and rabbit polyclonal E028 (18.Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Image Acquisition and Analysis—Images were acquired using the confocal microscope Leica TCS2. The same confocal acquisition settings were applied to all samples of the experiment. Collected z-section images were converted to maximal projection images and analyzed blindly using Leica confocal software. Transfected COS cells in close proximity to neurons were selected based on NL1 and synapsin labeling. The contours of the transfected COS cell were chosen as the region of interest. Fluorescence intensity was quantified for both green and red channels in the regions of interest. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Analytical Procedures—Western blots were performed using standard procedures. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford assay. To achieve deglycosylation 10–15 μg of NL1 in 200 μl was incubated: (a) with PNGase F (Glyko, Novato, CA), using 0.5 milliunits/μg of protein, at 37 °C for 16 h at pH 7.4; (b) with 10 milliunits of sialidase II (Glyko) at 37 °C for 16 h at pH 6.5; or (c) with both glycosidases under the same conditions, but at pH 6.5. Samples were then stored on ice and a 2-μl aliquot was taken for immunoblotting. Expression and Characterization of Soluble NL1—To express soluble recombinant forms of NL1, we introduced stop codons into the full-length NL1 cDNA at various positions NH2-terminal to the transmembrane spanning region (Fig. 1). The longest truncated neuroligin, NL1–691, contains a cleavable leader sequence that allows for export and processing of the proteins, an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope, the complete ChE-like domain, and the entire Ser-Thr-rich stalk region. All of the potential N- and O-linked glycosylation sites are retained. NL1–651 is devoid of 40 carboxyl-terminal residues that contain the Asn-662 glycosylation site and about half of the predicted O-glycosylation sites; NL1–638 lacks all the potential O-linked glycosylation sites. NL1–633 and NL1–626 further shorten the protein and terminate in the cholinesterase homologous domain. Residue homology comparisons indicate that NL1–638 is of comparable length to mouse AChE truncated at residue Pro-548 that expresses as a fully functional, soluble AChE. Recombinant NX1β, expressed as a soluble human-IgG fusion protein, appears in reducing SDS-PAGE gels as a broad band with an apparent Mr of 72,000 (data not shown). In immunoblots after SDS-PAGE, the soluble forms show distinctive migrations depending on whether they were harvested from the cell extract or medium. FLAG full-length NL1, with a calculated peptide mass of 91,175 Da appeared in SDS-PAGE as a double band with molecular mass of ∼140,000 and 120,000 (Fig. 2, left, and Table I). The relative density of the bands expressed in HEK293 cells, with the higher molecular mass band being more intense, resembles that seen in rat brain (4.Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8.Song J.Y. Ichtchenko K. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NL1–691 appears in SDS-PAGE at a Mr of ∼98,000 when extracted from the cell lysate, whereas after being exported outside the cell, presumably after completion of post-translational processing, it appears as a broad band at ∼126,000 (Fig. 2). Similar differences in apparent Mr depending on origin of harvest are visible in both NL1–651 and NL1–638.Table IMolecular masses in kDa, expression and relative binding of full-length and truncated neuroliginsFull-lengthAsp-691Ser-651Asp-638Leu-633Trp-626Sequence computed peptide mass91.274.069.668.267.666.8Apparent Mr; cell extractsaEstimated from SDS-PAGE migration120; 1409892909088Apparent Mr, mediumaEstimated from SDS-PAGE migrationNAbNA, not applicable.

Open table in a new tab Relative expression levels for each mutant were estimated from the amount of purified protein recovered from serum-free media. The three longer mutants (NL1–691, NL1–651, and NL1–638) have comparable expression but appearance in the medium markedly decreased for NL1–633 and was not detectable for NL1–626 (Table I). Because intracellular expression of the two shorter mutants revealed levels of antigenically reactive protein comparable with the intracellular expression of the exported mutants (data not shown), it is possible that folding of these mutants was compromised. Hydrodynamic properties and the oligomeric state of the NL1s were initially monitored by size exclusion chromatography. The retention times of the NL1–691, NL1–651, and NL1–638 were compared with globular, non-glycosylated protein standards giving an apparent mass between 260 and 280 kDa, indicative of dimensionally asymmetric proteins or oligomers. Samples were analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium, where the counterbalancing influences of the diffusion and sedimentation should reflect the molecular masses. Using different concentrations of NL1–691 (30–100-300 μg/ml) and three different rotor speeds, molecular mass was determined to be 174,000 ± 5,000 Da (n = 9). Comparison with the determined mass spectrometry (MS) weight averaged mass (88,900 ± 200 for the monomer, 178,000 Da for the dimer) indicated that truncated NL1 was a dimer at these concentrations. NL1–638 had a mass of 160,000 ± 6,000 Da (n = 6) from sedimentation equilibrium data (MS data: 79,900 ± 200 Da monomeric form, 160,000 Da for the dimer) (Fig. 3, A and B). The distribution of the residuals in the analysis appeared to be random, and the difference between the experimental and measured Mr is well within the 10% typically seen for ultracentrifugation sample columns of 2 mm in length. Binding of Soluble Truncated NL1 Is Dependent on Ca2+and the Amino-terminal NL1 Sequence Homologous to Acetylcholinesterase—To compare the relative NX1β binding of the different NL1 mutants, a range of NL1 concentrations extending between 62.5 and 2000 nm was injected and binding was monitored by SPR. NL1–651 and NL1–638 showed about 2.5-fold enhanced binding over NL1–691, indicating that the stalk region itself, when not associated to the cell membrane, reduces apparent binding of the soluble form (Fig. 4A). Rates of association and dissociation using recombinant, soluble entities provide an estimate of the kinetic parameters for the interaction. The calculated bimolecular association rate constant, ka = 5 × 104m–1 s–1 ; dissociation rate constant, kd = 0.015 s–1, gave an equilibrium dissociation constant KD of ∼300 nm. In SPR experiments we were unable to detect binding of the full-length NL1 to NX1β in either the absence or presence of detergent (0.5% Nonidet P-40). The detergent requirement for solubility of the full-length NL1 precludes our direct comparison with the soluble forms. Mouse AChE, when tested for NX1β binding over an extended concentration range (62.5 nm to 10 μm) using NX1β, showed no binding for the soluble monomeric form of mAChE in the subtracted sensorgram. A similar result was found for NX1β-3 (4.Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10.Ichtchenko K.

Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) that represents the unspliced isoform at position 4 (cf. Fig. 4B). Similarly, no binding to the immobilized NX1β was observed for bovine serum albumin over the same concentration range. To examine the Ca2+ dependence of NX1β-NL1 binding reported previously (4.Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9.Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), NL1–691 purified in Ca2+-free Hepes buffer was diluted in either Hepes-Ca2+ or Hepes-Mg2+ buffer and injected over the NX1β surface. Specific binding was detected only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5). Moreover, replacing the Ca2+ sample buffer with Mg2+ at the end of the injection resulted in a rapid diminution of the signal to baseline. Addition of a divalent cation chelator (EDTA, 5 mm) to the Hepes buffer showed a loss of specific binding that was more rapid than when Mg2+ simply replaced Ca2+, indicating that removal of Ca2+ does not require dissociation of the complex. Hence, the Ca2+ is not apparently sequestered at the NX1β-NL1 interface. To determine whether the ionic strength of the buffer plays a role in the NX1β-NL1 association, NL1–691 was diluted in different buffers with NaCl concentrations ranging from 37.5 to 600 mm. As the sensorgram overlay in Fig. 6 shows, at NaCl concentrations higher than 75 mm the binding becomes markedly reduced and is virtually lost above 300 mm, indicating that a significant component of the interaction is electrostatic. Removal of the NL1 N-Glycosyl Residues Leads to an Increased NX1β Binding—SPR and immunoblotting techniques were used to ascertain if the glycosylation processing that gives rise to apparent migration differences in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) influences NX1β binding. Unprocessed NL1–691 was purified from cell extract-bound NX1β with a specific activity 4–6-fold higher than NL1–691 purified from the cell culture medium (Fig. 7), indicating that the post-translational modifications dramatically decreased both binding affinity as well as mobility on SDS-PAGE. The slower apparent association and dissociation rates measurable for the NL1–691 from the cell extract, compared with the NL1–691 from the medium, are because of the influence of ligand depletion (mass transport) that becomes important at high surface density in the face of lower ligand concentrations. High density surfaces were necessary to detect the low signal generated by 16.25 nm NL1–691 purified from medium. NL1–691 and NL1–638 were subjected overnight to enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGase F under non-denaturing conditions and analyzed by SPR (Fig. 8, A and B). Each mutant showed approximately a 3-fold increase in binding after PNGase F treatment that correlates with the increased mobility in SDS-PAGE. PNGase F alone did not bind NX1β and does not influence binding when mixed with NL1–638 immediately before injection over a NX1β surface (Fig. 8C). Proportional increases in binding following treatment of the two mutants indicated that the N-linked glycosylation site at position Asn-662, which is not present"
https://openalex.org/W2080622768,"<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 proteins are involved in homologous recombination, non-homologous end-joining, DNA damage checkpoint signaling, and telomere maintenance. These proteins form a stable complex that has nuclease, DNA binding, and DNA end recognition activities. Of the components of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex, Xrs2 is the least characterized. The available evidence is consistent with the idea that Xrs2 recruits other protein factors in reactions that pertain to the biological functions of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex. Here we present biochemical evidence that Xrs2 has an associated DNA-binding activity that is specific for DNA structures. We also define the contributions of Xrs2 to the activities of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2 complex. Importantly, we demonstrate that Xrs2 is critical for targeting of Rad50 and Mre11 to DNA ends. Thus, Xrs2 likely plays a direct role in the engagement of DNA substrates by the Rad50· Mre11·Xrs2 complex in various biological processes."

We characterized the role of extracellular vesicle shedding in FGF-2 release. Viable cells released membrane vesicles in the presence of serum. However, in serum-free medium vesicle shedding was dramatically down-regulated, and the cells did not release FGF-2 activity into their conditioned medium. Addition of serum to serum-starved cells rapidly induced intracellular FGF-2 clustering under the plasma membrane and into granules that colocalized with patches of the cell membrane with typical features of shed vesicle membranes. Shed vesicles carried three FGF-2 isoforms (18, 22, 24 kDa). Addition of vesicles to endothelial cells stimulated chemotaxis and urokinase plasminogen activator production, which were blocked by anti-FGF-2 antibodies. Treatment of intact vesicles with 2.0 m NaCl or heparinase, which release FGF-2 from membrane-bound proteoglycans, did not abolish their stimulatory effect on endothelial cells, indicating that FGF-2 is carried inside vesicles. The comparison of the stimulatory effects of shed vesicles and vesicle-free conditioned medium showed that vesicles represent a major reservoir of FGF-2.

Cell Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All FGF-2 forms entail high affinity interactions with tyrosine kinase FGF receptors and low-affinity interactions with proteoglycans (HSPGs) containing heparan sulfate polysaccharides (10Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 11Rusnati M. Presta M. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1996; 26: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although FGF-2 is found associated with the extracellular matrix in vitro and in vivo and exerts its biological activities by binding to cell membrane receptors, it lacks a conventional secretory peptide and is not released through the classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway. It has been proposed that FGF-2 is released from cells through alternative pathways including cell death, wounding, or sublethal injury (12Schweigerer L. Neufeld G. Friedman J. Abraham J.A. Fiddes J.C. Gospodarowicz D. Nature. 1987; 325: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 13McNeil P.L. Muthukrishnan L. Warder E. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, FGF-2 release does not parallel the release of cytoplasmic markers (14Kandel J. Bossy-Wetzel E. Radvanyi F. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of protein secretion via the ER-Golgi complex do not block FGF-2 release. In contrast, reagents or treatments that inhibit exo/endocytosis or energy production block externalization of FGF-2 in transfected NIH 3T3 or COS-1 cells. A non-classic secretion pathway has therefore been proposed for FGF-2 release (15Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.A. Buechler R.D. Florkiewicz E. J.

Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Release of 18-kDa FGF-2 from transfected COS-1 cells is inhibited by ouabain, a known inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase (18Jorgensen J.R. Pedersen P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7301-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and FGF-2 coimmunoprecipitates with the α ATPase subunit (19Florkiewicz R.Z. Anchin J. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 544-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that Na,K-ATPase plays an important role in FGF-2 secretion (16Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.A. Buechler R.D. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Dahl J.P. Binda A. Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14877-14883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other extracellular proteins devoid of signal sequence include FGF-1, interleukin 1α, interleukin 1β, and lectin 14 (L-14). FGF-1 appears to be released in response to stress conditions as a component of multiprotein aggregates (21Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Secretory pathways via extracellular vesicle production have been proposed for both interleukin 1β and L-14. Externalization of L-14, a signaling molecule highly expressed in muscle cells, is developmentally regulated. As myogenic cells differentiate, cytosolic L-14 is concentrated in the cellular ectoplasm beneath regions of the plasma membrane that appear to evaginate and form extracellular vesicles. It has therefore been suggested that shed membrane vesicles represent a vehicle for L-14 secretion (25Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). IL-1β is released from activated immune cells after a secondary stimulus such as extracellular ATP acting on P2X (7Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) receptors. Mackenzie et al. (26MacKenzie A. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) reported that human THP-1 monocytes shed vesicles from their plasma membranes within 2-5 s after the activation of P2X (7Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) receptors; 2 min later the released vesicles contain IL-1β. The cytokine is then released in a vesicle-free form at later time points. Membrane vesicles originate from the plasma membrane through a mechanism morphologically similar to that of virus budding. The vesicles are relatively large and heterogeneous in size; their diameters ranging from ∼100 to ∼1000 nm (27Dainiak N. Blood. 1991; 78: 264-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicle shedding is an active process that requires RNA and protein synthesis (29Dainiak N. Sorba S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and occurs in viable cells with no signs of apoptosis or necrosis. Vesicle membranes carry most surface antigens expressed on the plasma membrane (30Dolo V. Pizzurro P. Ginestra A. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1995; 27: 535-541PubMed Google Scholar); however they originate from domains of the plasma membrane selectively enriched in membrane components including HLA class I molecules, β1 integrins, and membrane-bound matrix metal-loproteinase-9 (31Dolo V. Ginestra A. Cassara D. Violini S. Lucania G. Torrisi M.R. Nagase H. Canevari S. Pavan A. Vittorelli M.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4468-4474PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicle shedding has been implicated in cell migration and in tumor progression (32Poste G. Nicolson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), a function that may be mediated by vesicle membrane-bound proteinases (28Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J.

They were therefore proposed to possess procoagulant activity. In addition to membrane vesicles, exosomes, a population of exovesicles released by eukaryotic cells, have also been reported to vehicle secreted proteins. Exosomes are 40-80-nm extracellular vesicles released by exocytosis of multivesicular bodies. These structures are part of the endosomal system and are considered to belong to the category of late endosomes/lysosomes. Exosomes are probably generated by inward budding of the vesicle membrane (39Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 40Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J.

J. 1995; 308: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two cytosolic proteins found in exosomes, gelactin-3 and annexin II, are also found in the extracellular environment. Because these proteins do not posses a signal sequence, it has been suggested that exosomes represent an unconventional secretion pathway for these proteins (45Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Recently, FGF-2 secretion was analyzed in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing FGF-2-GFP fusion protein under control by the tetracycline resistance transactivator. FGF-2-GFP protein was shown to translocate to the outer surface of the plasma membrane; the secreted FGF-2-GFP fusion protein then accumulated in large HSPG-containing protein clusters on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (46Engling A. Backhaus R. Stegmayer C. Zehe C. Seelenmeyer C. Kehlenbach A. Schwappach B. Wegehingel S. Nickel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we tested the hypothesis that these large protein clusters are exovesicles and that vesicle shedding may represent a mechanism for FGF-2 release from the cell. Cells and Culture Media—Human SK-Hep1 hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Euroclone, Celbio). NIH 3T3 cells transfected with FGF-2 cDNA have been described (15Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Transfected and vector-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.6 g/liter NaHCO3, 500 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) and 10% FCS. Bovine GM7373 fetal aortic endothelial cells (47Grinspan J.B. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. J. Cell Physiol. 1983; 114: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, vitamins, and essential and non-essential amino acids. All the cells were negative for mycoplama contamination by the Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) staining assay. Immunofluorescence—SK-Hep1 cells seeded at low density (2.000 cells/well) onto microscope coverslips in 12-well culture plates (Nunc) were grown overnight in complete medium and then in serum-free medium for 1 week with three medium changes. To study the effect of serum on the intracellular distribution of FGF-2, medium supplemented with 10% FCS was added. After 5, 10, 20, and 30 min of incubation the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min. FGF-2 was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-FGF-2 (0.5 mg/ml, 1:200; Upstate Biotechnology type II) antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:200; Amersham Biosciences); biotinylated annexin V was added (2 mg/ml) to fixed cells, washed (five times for 5 min each) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and detected using FITC-streptavidin (Sigma) (1:500); β1-integrins were detected using FITC-conjugated C27 mAb (48Mueller S.C. Ghersi G. Akiyama S.K. Sang Q.X. Howard L. Pineiro-Sanchez M. Nakahara H. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24947-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In some experiments isolated vesicles were bound to poly-l-lysine on a coverslip, fixed, permeabilized, and treated with primary and secondary antibodies as described for cells. Immunostained vesicles were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus 1X70 with Melles Griot laser system). To detect interactions between vesicle-associated FGF-2 and the cell membrane, purified vesicles (50 μg/ml) were added to sparse GM7373 cell cultures pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 3 h. After 3 h of incubation the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min. FGF-2 was detected with mouse anti-FGF-2 monoclonal antibody (0.5 mg/ml, 1:500; Upstate Biotechnology type II) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:500; Amersham Biosciences). Ultrastructural Analysis—Transmission electron microscopy of vesicle shedding was carried out using a standard technique. Briefly, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in culture flasks, scraped, and post-fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. Samples were sectioned, post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with an electron microscope (Philips CM10, Eindhoven, Netherlands). For scanning electron microscopy cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Critical point dried samples were glued onto stubs, coated with gold in a SKD040 Balzer Sputterer, and observed using a Philips 505 scanning electron microscope at 10-30 kV. Vesicle Purification from Conditioned Medium—Vesicles were purified from conditioned medium as described (28Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, medium conditioned by subconfluent healthy cells for 3, 6, or 24 h were centrifuged at 2000 × g and at 4000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in PBS. In some control experiments, vesicles were purified by affinity binding of the 4000 × g supernatant to biotinylated annexin-V (Pierce) and bound to Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles (SAPMPs; Promega). To remove components that might bind to the magnetic beads in the absence of annexin-V, conditioned medium was pre-adsorbed with SA-PMPs, in the absence of annexin-V. Vesicles bound to SA-PMPs were solubilized by incubation with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, 20 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. The amount of isolated vesicles was determined by measuring protein concentration by the Bradford microassay method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Heparin-Sepharose Adsorption and SDS-PAGE—Purified vesicles were sonicated three times with 50 pulses for 10 s each and incubated at 4 °C overnight in an end-over-end mixer with 40-80 μl of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in PBS. After four washes with PBS, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of reducing Laëmmli buffer and electrophoresed in SDS-3-12.5% gradient polyacrylamide gels. Western Blotting—After electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences) that was saturated with 5% horse serum, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 h and then incubated with either monoclonal anti-FGF-2 (2.5 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology type II) or anti-HSP70 protein (0.8 μg/ml; Sigma H-5147) or anti CD-44 (10 μg/ml; Calbiochem 217604) antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:7500; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were visualized with the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) using Hyperfilms. ERK Phosphorylation—To characterize extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, GM7373 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (80,000 cells/cm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. The cells then were starved for 24 h in 0.5% FCS, followed by treatment with either 50 μg/ml SK-Hep1 cell-derived vesicles or 50 ng/ml human recombinant FGF-2 (49Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Presta M. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 161: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for the indicated time. Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence with the Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To judge uniform loading, the same membrane was stripped and re-incubated with anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Assay for uPA Activity—1.75 × 106 GM7373 cells (70,000 cells/cm2) were grown for 28 h in 5 ml of medium supplemented with different concentrations of vesicles. Cell cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 18-24 h in serum-free medium. After harvesting the culture supernatant, the cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently scraped with a rubber policeman. Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. Cell extracts (30 μg of proteins) were loaded onto SDS 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Zymography was performed as described (50Vassalli J.D. Dayer J.M. Wohlwend A. Belin D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1653-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with overlay gels containing 3% non-fat dry milk and 40 μg/ml bovine plasminogen (Sigma). Densitometric analysis of the lysis bands was performed using Eastman Kodak Co. Science 1D Image Analyzer software. White bands of caseynolysis of images were converted to dark bands to better display the activity. Cell Migration Assay—Falcon cell culture inserts with 8-μm pore polyethylene terephthalate membranes were coated with gelatin (50 μg/ml). Five hundred microliters of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 105 GM7373 cells was added to the upper chamber, whereas the bottom chamber received 500 μl of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with or without the indicated concentrations of vesicles, vesicle-free supernatants, and anti-FGF-2 neutralizing antibodies (type I; Upstate Biotechnology). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the inserts (16 mm diameter) were removed and fixed in methanol. The cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells migrated across the membrane were stained with 1% crystal violet and counted. Heparinase and NaCl Treatments—Conditioned media were incubated either with heparinase III 4 milliunits/ml for 2 h at 37 °C or with 2 m NaCl (final concentration) for 30 min at 37 °C without or after sonication (three times with 80 pulses for 30 s each). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, pelleted vesicles were resuspended in PBS and assayed for their ability to stimulate uPA expression in GM7373 cells. FGF-2 Is Associated with Membrane Vesicles Shed from SKHep1 Cells—SK-Hep1 cells produce high levels of FGF-2 (51Presta M. Moscatelli D. Joseph-Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4060-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Previous observations (52Seghezzi G. Patel S. Ren C.J. Gualandris A. Pintucci G. Robbins E.S. Shapiro R.L. Galloway A.C. Rifkin D.B. Mignatti P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) have shown that FGF-2 cannot be detected in serum-free medium conditioned by SK-Hep1 cells, consistent with the inhibitory effect of serum deprivation on FGF-2 externalization (15Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Similarly, serum deprivation inhibits vesicle shedding (28Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar, 53Chiba I. Jin R. Hamada J. Hosokawa M. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3972-3975PubMed Google Scholar) raising the hypothesis that FGF-2 externalization and vesicle shedding may represent related processes. We therefore characterized the effect of serum on the expression and intracellular localization of FGF-2 in SK-Hep1 cells. FGF-2 expression was analyzed by Western blotting of starved cells or cells collected 10 min, 2 h, and 24 h after serum addition. FGF-2 levels were not affected by serum (data not shown). Under serum-free conditions, immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal anti-FGF-2 antibody followed by confocal microscopy showed that FGF-2 localized in the nucleus and in the cell cytoplasm, where it formed small aggregates (Fig. 1a). Addition of serum caused rapid clustering of FGF-2 in larger patches (Fig. 1b). Under these conditions, FGF-2 immunoreactive material was found to colocalize with areas of the cell plasma membranes enriched in β1 integrins (Fig. 1d) and characterized by an increased capability to bind annexin V (Fig. 1f), in keeping with a localization of the growth factor in plasma membrane regions involved in vesicle formation (26MacKenzie A.

https://openalex.org/W2018497562,"Cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the key enzyme that commits cholesterol to the neutral bile acid biosynthesis pathway and is highly regulated. In the current studies, we have uncovered a role for the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α in CYP7A1 gene transcription. PGC-1α plays a vital role in adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and stimulates genes important to mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism. It is also involved in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesic gene expression during fasting. Because the mRNA for CYP7A1 was also induced in mouse liver by fasting, we reasoned that PGC-1α might be an important co-activator for CYP7A1. Here we show that PGC-1α and CYP7A1 are also co-induced in livers of mice in response to streptozotocin induced diabetes. Additionally, infection of cultured HepG2 cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing PGC-1α directly activates CYP7A1 gene expression and increases bile acid biosynthesis as well. Furthermore, we show that PGC-1α activates the CYP7A1 promoter directly in transient transfection assays in cultured cells. Thus, PGC-1α is a key activator of CYP7A1 and bile acid biosynthesis and is likely responsible for the fasting and diabetes dependent induction of CYP7A1. PGC-1α has already been shown to be a critical activator of several other oxidative processes including adaptive thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Our studies provide further evidence of the fundamental role played by PGC-1α in oxidative metabolism and define PGC-1α as a link between diabetes and bile acid metabolism. Cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the key enzyme that commits cholesterol to the neutral bile acid biosynthesis pathway and is highly regulated. In the current studies, we have uncovered a role for the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α in CYP7A1 gene transcription. PGC-1α plays a vital role in adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and stimulates genes important to mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism. It is also involved in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesic gene expression during fasting. Because the mRNA for CYP7A1 was also induced in mouse liver by fasting, we reasoned that PGC-1α might be an important co-activator for CYP7A1. Here we show that PGC-1α and CYP7A1 are also co-induced in livers of mice in response to streptozotocin induced diabetes. Additionally, infection of cultured HepG2 cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing PGC-1α directly activates CYP7A1 gene expression and increases bile acid biosynthesis as well.

PGC-1α has already been shown to be a critical activator of several other oxidative processes including adaptive thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Our studies provide further evidence of the fundamental role played by PGC-1α in oxidative metabolism and define PGC-1α as a link between diabetes and bile acid metabolism.

This is a crucial enzyme in mammalian cholesterol metabolism as diversion into the bile acid pathway is the main route for eliminating excess cholesterol from the body. Because of its key role in cholesterol metabolism, the CYP7A1 enzyme and its gene have been studied as an important model for dietary regulation for several years. These studies have revealed that there is a significant amount of regulation at the level of transcription initiation (2.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar); however, post-transcriptional mechanisms for control also occur (1.Russell D.W. Annu. Rev.

The CYP7A1 promoter has been extensively evaluated by several groups and the proximal regions of both the mouse and rat promoters contain two direct repeat type elements that bind several nuclear receptors, some of which are indicated in Fig. 1. There is also a binding site for the monomeric orphan receptor LRH-1 that overlaps the DR-1 element. The DR-4 is a target site for the nuclear receptor LXR, which confers positive regulation by cholesterol to the CYP7A1 promoter in mice and rats (2.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, the DR-4 is not conserved in the human gene which is not subject to feed forward regulation by cholesterol (4.Goodwin B. Watson M.A. Kim H. Miao J. Kemper J.K. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CYP7A1 is also activated in livers of fasted mice (5.Hunt M.C. Yang Y.-Z. Eggertsen G. Carneheim C.M. Gafvels M. Einarsson C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28947-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α is induced by fasting in liver where it activates transcription of the PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase genes during hepatic gluconeogenesis (6.Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.-Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because both PGC-1α and CYP7A1 were co-induced during fasting, we reasoned that the induction of CYP7A1 might be dependent on PGC-1α. We also reasoned that CYP7A1 might be induced under other physiologically important situations where PGC-1α is also induced such as in the liver of diabetic animals (6.Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.-Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In the current report we show that expression of the CYP7A1 gene is not only co-induced with PGC-1α during fasting but also when animals are made diabetic through streptozotocin injection. We also show that infection of HepG2 cells with an adenovirus expressing PGC-1α results in a robust activation of endogenous CYP7A1 gene expression, which in turn results in an overall increase in bile acid biosynthesis. Finally, we show that the CYP7A1 promoter is directly activated by PGC-1α co-expression in transient transfection assays. Plasmids—The pGL3R7α-342 has been described previously (7.del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1.rHNF-4α1 was a kind gift from F. Sladek (University of California, Riverside, CA). The pcDNA3.1(–).PGC 1α, was from D. Kelly (Washington University in St. Louis) and has been described previously (8.Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The adenovirus expressing PGC-1α was from Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Cancer Center, Boston) and was described before (9.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 350,000 cells/well. After incubation for 16 h, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Co-precipitates contained 2 μg/well of the luciferase reporter, 2 μg/well of the β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and the indicated amount of expression vector as described in the legend to Fig. 5. Salmon sperm DNA was added to equalize total amounts of plasmid DNA transfected into cells. After 4–6 h, cells were treated with 10% glycerol, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh normal medium, and incubated for an additional 40–48 h before harvest. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 300,000 cells/well the day before transfection. After an overnight incubation, cells were transfected for 16 h as describe above. The next day, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh normal medium, and cultured for an additional 24 h before harvest. Enzyme Assays—Luciferase assays were performed using a luminometer with a luciferin reagent (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Luciferase activities were corrected and presented as the ratio of luciferase activity over β-galactosidase activity. Values represent the mean of duplicate ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Animal Feeding Studies—For the fasting experiments, B6129 male mice were obtained from Taconic and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (dark cycle was from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) with free access of food and water. Mice were allowed to adapt to the new environment at least 1 week before experiments. Mice (7–8 weeks old) were randomly divided into three groups. One group was fed ad libitum with regular diet, a second group was fasted for 24 h, and a third group was fasted for 24 h followed by refeeding regular diet for 12 h before sacrifice. All mice were sacrificed at the same time between 8 and 10 AM. Livers were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA was extracted as described below. For the streptozotocin (STZ) experiments, 7–8-week-old mice were prepared as above and separated into two groups. After they were adapted, one group received daily intraperitoneal injections of STZ (100 μg/g of body weight) for 3 days. Ten days later, blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (One Touch Ultra from Lifescan), animals were sacrificed at 9:30 a.m., and livers were removed and processed as above. Adenovirus Infection of HepG2 Cells—Replication defective recombinant adenoviruses were propagated and titered in 293 cells. They were used to infect HepG2 cells that were plated in 100-mm dishes at the multiplicities of infection indicated in the legend to Fig. 4A. Medium was replaced and cells were processed at various times post-infection for total RNA harvest followed by blot hybridization studies as described below. Bile Acid Synthesis—Bile acid synthesis rates were quantified essentially as described previously (10.Pandak W.M. Ren S. Marques D. Hall E. Redford K. Mallonee D. Bohdan P. Heuman D. Gil G. Hylemon P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48158-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded on 60-mm plates at 2.5 × 106 cell/plate. Twenty-four hours later cells were infected at the indicated multiplicity of infection in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. After 2 h, the virus was diluted with 1.5 ml of medium, and 0.13 μCi of [14C]cholesterol (50 mCi/mmol) was added and incubation was continued for 40 h. Conversion of [14C]cholesterol to [14C]methanol/ water-soluble products was determined by scintillation counting after Folch extraction (11.Folch J.M. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the culture medium with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose-formadehyde gels and transferred to Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes overnight at 42 °C. A 80 base HindIII/EcoRI fragment of rat ribosomal protein L32 cDNA was used as a probe to normalize total amounts of RNA per lane. After hybridization, the blots were exposed to a Kodak BioMAX film, and mRNA levels were quantified by Quantity one (Bio-Rad). The following cDNA probes were used: CYP7A1, a 0.7-kb AccI/EcoRI fragment from the pBSK7a; PGC-1α, a 1.5-kb BglII/NcoI fragment from the pSV-SPORT-PGC-1 (gift of Peter Tontonoz, UCLA); fatty acid synthase (FAS), a 0.2-kb EcoRI fragment from mouse FAS cDNA; SHP, a 0.8-kb XhoI fragment from CDM8-SHP; PEPCK, a 1.3-kb SphI/SalI fragment from PC116 (gift of D. Granner, Vanderbilt University of School of Medicine); LDLR, a 0.3-kb BamHI/PstI fragment from mouse LDLR cDNA; h-CYP7A1, a 0.3-kb fragment from human CYP7A1 cDNA isolated by PCR from HepG2 cDNA. For over 2 decades, a fasting/refeeding protocol has been used to evaluate lipogenic and gluconeogenic gene responses. We noted that CYP7A1 gene expression was stimulated by fasting and returned to normal during the refeeding phase of this dietary manipulation (Fig. 2A). This pattern is exactly opposite to the expression of FAS, which was repressed by fasting and activated by the refeeding protocol as is typical for lipogenic genes (Fig. 2C). As mentioned in the introduction, expression of the mRNA for the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α was induced in mouse liver by a similar fasting protocol (9.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), and we noted this response in our experiment as well (Fig. 2B). SHP is a known negative regulator of CYP7A1 (2.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and although SHP levels were mildly reduced by fasting, they did not rebound by the refeeding protocol (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these observations are consistent with induction of CYP7A1 during fasting through a PGC-1α-dependent mechanism. We reasoned that if PGC-1α is a physiological regulator of CYP7A1, then they should also be co-induced under other conditions where PGC-1α expression increases in the liver such as during STZ-induced diabetes (9.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated CYP7A1 expression in this diabetic model. In Fig. 3, we show that both PGC-1α and CYP7A1 are robustly induced in livers of mice following STZ injection. As expected, PEPCK was also co-induced, however, levels of LDL receptor and SHP RNAs were either unaffected or slightly lower in the STZ treated animals, respectively. The experiments so far demonstrate that PGC-1α and CYP7A1 are co-induced during two different physiologically stressful situations: food restriction and diabetes. This strongly suggests that PGC-1α is a physiologically important co-activator for CYP7A1. To directly evaluate the response of CYP7A1 to an acute increase in PGC-1α we measured CYP7A1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells following infection with a recombinant adenovirus engineered to express PGC-1α. The experiment in Fig. 4A demonstrates that CYP7A1 was robustly activated by the PGC-1α virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, mRNA levels from other genes were not altered by the PGC-1α virus, and infection with a control virus had no effect on CYP7A1. Because CYP7A1 is the rate-controlling step of the neutral bile acid biosynthetic pathway, it was important to evaluate whether the induction of CYP7A1 by PGC-1α also resulted in increased production of bile acids. To evaluate this, bile acid synthesis was monitored in HepG2 cells following infection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing PGC-1α, CYP7A1, or a control virus (Fig. 4B). Infection with either the PGC-1α-or CYP7A1-expressing viruses resulted in a dose-dependent increase in bile acid production and there was no response to the control virus. These results indicate that not only is PGC-1α a critical co-activator for CYP7A1, but changes in its expression level can influence flux through the entire bile acid pathway as well. To directly evaluate whether the PGC-1α protein was acting directly as a co-activator of the CYP7A1 promoter, we performed a series of co-transfection studies in cultured cells. In the experiment in Fig. 5A, the rat CYP7A1 promoter was stimulated 20-fold when an expression vector for PGC-1α was co-transfected with a CYP7A1 promoter-luciferase promoter construct in HepG2 cells. Because PGC-1α does not bind DNA directly, it must be recruited to a promoter through a separate DNA bound protein. To determine which critical DNA binding protein(s) might be responsible for PGC-1α activation of CYP7A1, we utilized exogenous expression vectors for DNA-binding proteins that are known to activate CYP7A1 (2.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). When an expression vector for HNF-4 was simply added along with the wild type promoter, there was minimal stimulation on its own (lane 2), and there was no additional stimulation when the HNF-4 construct was added on top of PGC-1α (lane 6). Similarly, addition of a COUP TFII expression vector alone was ineffective (lane 3). However, when the COUP TFII expression plasmid was added together with PGC-1α a significant stimulation over the level achieved by PGC-1α alone was observed (compare lane 3 with lanes 5 and 7). Adding expression constructs for both HNF-4 and COUP TFII stimulated the promoter about 20-fold in agreement with a previous report (12.Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and when both expression constructs were added on top of PGC-1α a further significant increase in activation was observed (lane 8). HepG2 cells have endogenous HNF-4, COUP TFII, and LRH-1, which is known to be a critical co-activator for CYP7A1 (7.del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). To evaluate the protein requirements for CYP7A1 promoter stimulation in a naive setting where endogenous liver expressed proteins are absent, we used 293T cells. When the CYP7A1 promoter was transfected into 293T cells, a low level of activity was observed (Fig. 5, B and C). To achieve high levels of stimulation, expression vectors for HNF-4, LRH-1, COUP TFII, and PGC-1α were all required (Fig. 5, B and C). Elimination of any one of the four protein expression constructs resulted in a significant drop in promoter activity. There are several important observations in the current investigation. First, we have established a role for the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α in activation of the CYP7A1 promoter. Based on the fasting-dependent induction of CYP7A1 mRNA (Ref. 5.Hunt M.C. Yang Y.-Z. Eggertsen G. Carneheim C.M. Gafvels M. Einarsson C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28947-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and Fig. 2), we proposed that PGC-1α might be involved because it is a co-activator protein that is induced by fasting in the liver (Ref. 9.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). While we were in the finishing stages of our work, a paper was published on-line in the JBC by De Fabiani et al. (15.De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) demonstrating that PGC-1α stimulated CYP7A1. Importantly, our studies have gone further to demonstrate that CYP7A1 is co-induced with PGC-1α during STZ-induced diabetes (Fig. 3) and that infection of HepG2 cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing PGC-1α also induces CYP7A1 mRNA expression and the entire pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (Fig. 4). Expression of SHP mRNA was lower during fasting and STZ treatment. Because SHP is a negative regulator of CYP7A1 (14.Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 15.De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), part of the increase in CYP7A1 expression in our study could be due to the lower levels of SHP. However, SHP levels did not rebound during the refeeding phase in Fig. 2 when CYP7A1 levels returned to normal. Therefore, alterations in SHP cannot adequately account for the effects observed in the current report. Our cell culture-based transfection studies with a PGC-1α expression vector support a direct role for this co-activator in activation of CYP7A1 (Fig. 5). In these experiments, PGC-1α stimulated expression from the CYP7A1 promoter in HepG2 cells, and the effect was significantly enhanced by coexpression of COUP TFII and HNF-4. In 293T cells, high level expression of the promoter required co-transfection of expression vectors for HNF-4, COUP TFII, LRH-1, and PGC-1α. These results indicate that PGC-1α stimulation of CYP7A1 is likely mediated by more than one DNA binding protein acting on the promoter. This is similar to PEPCK where several different DNA binding factors are required for maximal stimulation by PGC-1α (9.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). CYP7A1 commits cholesterol to the bile acid pathway and represents a key control point in metabolism. Even though there are many irreversible enzymatic steps in metabolism, relatively few of these are defined as “committing” their substrate to a singular metabolic pathway or fate (16.Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Ahern K.G. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, CA2000Google Scholar). CYP7A1 represents one of these key metabolic points, and similar to other committed steps, there is a complex mechanism in place to ensure that metabolic flux can be integrated smoothly with variations in nutrient availability to provide balanced metabolism. The nutrient deprivation associated with fasting disrupted this balance, and CYP7A1 mRNA was induced. The physiological reason why CYP7A1 should be increased by fasting is not immediately apparent. In fact, there is evidence that bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 enzyme activity are down-regulated by prolonged fasting in the rat (17.Dumaswala R. Berkowitz D. Setchell K.D. Heubi J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G836-G842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differences with our studies may be related to different experimental parameters or timing and the species differences. Nonetheless, CYP7A1 was activated by fasting in both our study and a previous report (5.Hunt M.C. Yang Y.-Z. Eggertsen G. Carneheim C.M. Gafvels M. Einarsson C. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28947-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CYP7A1 and PGC-1α were also co-induced during streptozotocin induced diabetes (Fig. 3). Similar to nutrient deprivation, this is another physiologically stressful situation that throws lipid metabolism out of balance. The co-induction by fasting and STZ treatment provide strong correlative evidence that PGC-1α is a co-activator for CYP7A1. Evidence for a direct role was provided by the recombinant adenovirus and promoter studies of Figs. 4 and 5. Importantly, infection with the PGC-1α adenovirus not only resulted in an induction of CYP7A1 mRNA but also a significant stimulation in flux through the entire bile acid pathway. In fact, the increase was similar in magnitude to that obtained when HepG2 cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing CYP7A1 directly (Fig. 4B). These observations are particularly relevant to the mechanism connecting diabetes with bile acids. It has long been known that bile acid metabolism is altered in diabetes (18.Uchida K. Takase H. Kadowaki M. Nomura Y. Matsubara T. Takeuchi N. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 29: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the increased levels of circulating bile acids may be partially responsible for increased cholesterol absorption and atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. Insulin is also a potent negative regulator of CYP7A1 in primary hepatocytes (19.Twisk J. Hoekman M.F. Lehmann E.M. Meijer P. Mager W.H. Princen H.M. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, there is a strong clinical association between type II diabetes plus obesity on the one hand and gallstone disease on the other (20.De Santis A. Attili A.F. Ginanni Corradini S. Scafato E. Cantagalli A. De Luca C. Pinto G. Lisi D. Capocaccia L. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, whether the increased gallstone formation was due to the diabetes or other complications associated with obesity has been somewhat controversial (21.Pacchioni M. Nicoletti C. Caminiti M. Calori G. Curci V. Camisasca R. Pontiroli A.E. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2000; 45: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrating that CYP7A1 is increased in livers of diabetic mice support a direct association between diabetes and bile acid metabolism that could contribute directly to gallstone production independent of obesity. Taken together, our results indicate that PGC-1α is an important co-activator in the regulation of CYP7A1 and bile acid metabolism. Like bile acid synthesis, the other metabolic pathways simulated by PGC-1α are associated with oxidative metabolism (22.Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations provide further evidence that PGC-1α is a critical co-activator of oxidative metabolic processes.

https://openalex.org/W2024532487,"The sequestration of drugs away from cellular target sites into cytoplasmic organelles of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells has been recently shown to be a cause for ineffective drug therapy. This process is poorly understood despite the fact that it has been observed in a large number of MDR cancer cell lines. Analysis of drug sequestration in these cells has traditionally been done using fluorescent anthracycline antibiotics (i.e. daunorubicin, doxorubicin). This narrow selection of substrates has resulted in a limited understanding of sequestration mechanisms and the intracellular compartments that are involved. To better characterize this phenotype, we chose to examine the sequestration of molecules having different acid/base properties in the MDR HL-60 human leukemic cell line. Here we show that weakly basic drug daunorubicin is sequestered into lysosomes according to a pH partitioning type mechanism, whereas sulforhodamime 101, a zwitterionic molecule, is sequestered into the Golgi apparatus through a drug transporter-mediated process. Quantitative intracellular pH measurements reveal that the lysosome-tocytosol pH gradient is expanded in the MDR line. Moreover, the MDR cells overexpress the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1), which is localized to the Golgi apparatus. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that two distinct mechanisms for intracellular compartmentalization are operational in a single MDR cell line. The sequestration of drugs away from cellular target sites into cytoplasmic organelles of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells has been recently shown to be a cause for ineffective drug therapy. This process is poorly understood despite the fact that it has been observed in a large number of MDR cancer cell lines. Analysis of drug sequestration in these cells has traditionally been done using fluorescent anthracycline antibiotics (i.e. daunorubicin, doxorubicin). This narrow selection of substrates has resulted in a limited understanding of sequestration mechanisms and the intracellular compartments that are involved. To better characterize this phenotype, we chose to examine the sequestration of molecules having different acid/base properties in the MDR HL-60 human leukemic cell line. Here we show that weakly basic drug daunorubicin is sequestered into lysosomes according to a pH partitioning type mechanism, whereas sulforhodamime 101, a zwitterionic molecule, is sequestered into the Golgi apparatus through a drug transporter-mediated process. Quantitative intracellular pH measurements reveal that the lysosome-tocytosol pH gradient is expanded in the MDR line. Moreover, the MDR cells overexpress the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1), which is localized to the Golgi apparatus. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that two distinct mechanisms for intracellular compartmentalization are operational in a single MDR cell line. The resistance of tumor cells to anticancer agents remains a major cause of treatment failure in patients with cancer.

Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). The emergence of MDR is multifactorial. Decreased drug accumulation and/or increased efflux, increased detoxification, increased DNA repair, and altered cell cycle regulation have all been implicated (2.Simon S. Roy D. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many MDR cell lines have demonstrated the capacity to compartmentalize drugs away from intracellular target sites (3.Larsen A.K. Escargueil A.E. Skladanowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In drug-sensitive cell lines, chemotherapeutic agents are localized to a significant extent within the cell nucleus. In contrast, the MDR cells compartmentalize drug within distinct cytoplasmic organelles. This sequestration serves to protect the MDR cell from the cytotoxic effects of drugs since cellular targets are often associated with the nucleus. multidrug-resistant buthionine sulfoximine fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphatebuffered saline tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) N-hexanoylsphingosine seminaphthorhodafluor acetoxymethylester high pressure liquid chromatography 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide sulforhodamime 101 vacuolar (H+)-ATPases P-glycoprotein. There are at least two mechanistic explanations that can be used to rationalize the exaggerated drug sequestration capacity of subcellular compartments contained within MDR cancer cells (3.Larsen A.K. Escargueil A.E. Skladanowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The first involves members of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporter proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1). The overexpression of these transporter proteins in MDR cell lines is well known, and they are traditionally thought to participate in drug efflux at the plasma membrane (4.Van der Kokl D.M. De Vreis E.G. Muller M. Vellenga E. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2002; 43: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that these transporters may also drive sequestration into organelles (5.Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that a number of different ATP binding cassette transporters are localized to intracellular compartments in MDR cell lines (6.Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lee P. Yang Y.D. Ling V. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7.Meschini S. Calcabrini A. Monti E. Del Bufalo D. Stringaro A. Dolfini E. Arancia G. Int. J.

Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, some controversy exists as to whether or not the observed intracellular localization of these proteins is a normal component of their biosynthesis, processing, and transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, when these proteins are expressed at the plasma membrane, they have been shown to be involved in the transport of a wide range of substrates including weakly acidic, neutral, and basic compounds (12.Sharma R. Awasthi Y.C. Yang Y. Sharma A. Singhal S.S. Awasthi S. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For weakly basic drugs, the accumulation in sequestering organelles can be explained by alterations in intracellular pH gradients. The lumenal pH of lysosomes has been shown to be considerably lower in MDR cells, resulting in an enhanced lysosome-to-cytosol pH differential (3.Larsen A.K. Escargueil A.E. Skladanowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13.Martinez-Zaguilan R. Raghunand N. Lynch R.M. Bellamy W. Martinez G.M. Rojas B. Smith D. Dalton W.S. Gillies R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This can provide a driving force for the accumulation of weakly basic compounds into acidic organelles (2.Simon S. Roy D. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14.Skovsgaard T. Mihich E. Drug Resistance: Mechanisms and Reversal.

Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This phenomenon also occurs in normal non-transformed cells and is referred to as lysosomotropism (17.De Duve C. De Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Lysosomotropic agents are characteristically defined as weak bases with pKa near 7 and are membranepermeable in the non-ionized form but relatively impermeable in the ionized form. At cytoplasmic pH (pH ∼7.2), a significant fraction of these molecules will exist in the non-ionized form and will readily permeate lipid bilayers of subcellular organelles. When these drugs diffuse into acidic compartments such as lysosomes (pH 4–5), they become ionized to a greater extent and less able to diffuse back through the lipid bilayer. In transformation from a normal cell to a cancerous one, it has been shown that the lumenal pH of lysosomes from the cancer cell is elevated by at least 1.5 pH units (16.Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Consequently, the pH differential between the lysosomes and the cell cytosol is reduced. This, in turn, results in decreased sequestration of these compounds into the lysosomal compartment. In MDR cancer cells, lysosomal acidification is thought to be re-established (18.Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, the lysosome-to-cytosol pH differential is again expanded, which in turn provides the driving force for the accumulation of weakly basic drugs. In summary, both normal cells and MDR cancer cells have acidic lysosomes, which can result in weak base sequestration. Alternatively, drug-sensitive cancer cells have a significantly reduced sequestration capacity due to the less acidic nature of their lysosomal compartment. Previous reports on this topic have proposed either the involvement of drug transporters or the involvement of a pH partitioning type mechanism, but never both. We describe experiments here that show, for the first time, that both of these mechanisms are simultaneously operational in the MDR HL-60 human leukemic cell line. Daunorubicin, a weakly basic anticancer drug, is sequestered into the lysosomal compartment via a pH partitioning mechanism. The zwitterionic molecule, sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), is sequestered into the Golgi apparatus through an MRP1-mediated pathway. The human acute promyeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and its doxorubicin-selected resistant HL-60 ADR cell line were kindly provided by Dr. Yueshang Zhang (Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona). Cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1% penicillin, 0.1% streptomycin. Cells were maintained at a density of 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Daunorubicin, MK571, nigericin, monensin, concanamycin A, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Sigma. Sulforhodamine 101, NBD-C6-ceramide, FITC-dextran (molecular weight, 10,000), (5-and 6-) carboxyl SNARF1 AM acetate ester, Lysotracker Green DND-26, and Oregon Green were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescence Co-localization Experiments—Cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml prior to experimentation. Lysotracker Green or FITC-dextran was used to stain lysosomes. Lysotracker Green (100 nm) was incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C. FITC-dextran (5 mg/ml) was incubated with cells for 30 min, which was followed by a 24-h incubation in medium devoid of the dextran. To label the Golgi apparatus, cells were incubated with NBD-C6-ceramidine (5 μm) for 30 min. Following incubation with probe/drug, cells were pelleted (1,000 rpm, 5 min) and washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove unincorporated compounds. Cells were viewed with a microscope (Leica Diaplan, Leitz Weltzar, Germany) equipped for epifluorescence with a ×100 objective, and images were captured using an Orca ER camera (Hamamatsu Corp.) controlled by SimplePCI imaging software (Compix Inc.). The data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe PhotoShop. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked using 0.05% saponin, 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.05% saponin for 1 h. The primary rat monoclonal antibody for MRP1 (MRPr1, Monosan Antibodies, Uden, The Netherlands) and the primary mouse monoclonal antibodies to the trans-Golgi network-specific protein p230 and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) were all diluted 1:100. Following primary antibody incubations, cells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% saponin. Secondary antibodies (FITC-labeled goat anti-rat and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse, both from Sigma) were diluted 1:500. Cells were subsequently washed four times with PBS prior to fluorescence microscopy. Protein Expression in Cell Membranes—A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared from 50 × 106 cells pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 15 mm potassium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg of DNase I, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min followed by 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B). Subsequently, 0.2 ml of a solution containing 375 mm potassium chloride, 22.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 220 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 was added. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,500 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet cell debris and nuclei and to yield the post-nuclear supernatant. Total membrane protein was obtained by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant at 4 °C, 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS, and aliquots of this fraction containing 10 μg of protein (according to Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin standard) were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, MRP1, P-gp, and actin (control) were detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-MRP1 monoclonal antibody MRPm6 (1:200), anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody C219 (1:500), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody (1:500). MRP1 and P-gp antibodies were from Monosan Antibodies, and the actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Cellular pH Measurements—Ratiometric pH-sensitive probes, FITC dextran, and (5-and 6-) carboxyl SNARF1 AM acetate ester were used to determine the pH within the lysosomes and cytosol, respectively. Fluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer. Intralysosomal pH was determined using a slightly modified procedure of Altan et al. (16.Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml FITC-dextran for 30 min. The cells were then washed four times with RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red) and incubated in the same medium for 24 h in the cell culture incubator. Cells were transferred to PBS, and the fluorescence emissions at 530 nm were measured at two excitation wavelengths, 490 and 450 nm, respectively. The ratio of emission intensities was determined and converted to pH using the previously referenced standard calibration procedure. Cytosolic pH was determined using a slightly modified procedure of Belhoussine et al. (19.Belhoussine R. Morjani H. Millot J.M. Sharonov S. Manfait M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were incubated with 4 μm (5-and 6-) carboxyl SNARF1 AM acetate ester for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS prewarmed to 37 °C. Fluorescence emission intensities at 580 and 640 nm were measured at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm. The ratio of the emission intensities at the two emission wavelengths was determined and converted to pH using the referenced methodology. Quantitative Assessment of Daunorubicin Total Cell Uptake—Cells (107) were preincubated with 100 μm BSO for 24 h followed by incubation with daunorubicin (2 μm) for 1 h. Cells were pelleted (1000 rpm, 5 min) and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The pellet was suspended in 0.75 ml of acetonitrile, vortexed for 10 s, and sonicated for 15 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and a 500-μl portion of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness. The residue was analyzed by HPLC following dissolution in 100 μl of mobile phase (30% acetonitrile, 70% 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.2). The HPLC system was comprised of a Waters 600E system controller, 616 pump, 717 plus autosampler and 474 fluorescence detector set at 470-nm excitation and 560-nm emission wavelengths (Waters Corp., MA). A C18 reversed phase X-terra column (Waters Corp.) was used for analysis. Extraction efficiencies for daunorubicin from cells were determined by spiking in known amounts of drug (four in total, representing low, medium, and high concentrations) into blank cell pellets and carrying out the previously described extraction procedure. The extraction efficiency was found to be 48.2 ± 2.7%. This standard curve was linear and was subsequently used to calculate cellular drug accumulation from experimental samples. IC50 Evaluations—Cell sensitivity to daunorubicin was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described by Mosmann (20.Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983,. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in quadruplicate on 96-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and were treated with selected concentrations of either daunorubicin or SR101 and then incubated for a period of 3 days. At the end of the incubation period, 10 μl of a 5 mg/ml solution of MTT in PBS was added to each well, and the plates were returned to the incubator for an additional 4 h. A 100-μl portion of Me2SO was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 590 nm in a microplate reader. For SR101, cell viability was determined using trypan blue staining with a hemacytometer since the color of SR101 interfered with the MTT assay. IC50 was defined as the concentration of drug causing 50% inhibition of cell growth as compared with untreated control. Identification of Drug Sequestering Organelles—The model compounds utilized in this study had suitable fluorescence properties that allowed us to visualize their intracellular distribution in cells using a fluorescence microscope. We evaluated the intracellular distribution of daunorubicin, SR101, and Oregon Green in the HL-60 ADR cell line and compared this with the parental drug-sensitive cell line using identical incubation conditions. The structures of these three compounds are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that all three compounds displayed somewhat diffuse cellular fluorescence when incubated with drug-sensitive HL-60 cells. In the HL-60 ADR cell line, both daunorubicin and SR101 were sequestered into cytoplasmic organelles; the subcellular distribution of Oregon Green was not significantly altered. In the MDR line, daunorubicin consistently stained cytoplasmic vesicles throughout the cell cytoplasm, whereas SR101 stained a more restricted perinuclear location. This difference prompted us to investigate the identity of drug sequestering organelles. Direct co-localization of daunorubicin and SR101 could not be achieved because of significant overlap of the fluorescent properties for these two molecules. We therefore sought to independently identify drug-sequestering organelles using fluorescence co-localization experiments with organelle-specific fluorescent probes and vital stains. We found that daunorubicin co-localized with the lysosomal vital stain Lysotracker Green (Fig. 3A). Considering the fact that lysosomal vital stains such as Lysotracker Green can non-selectively stain additional organelles (21.Haugland RP. Gregory, J. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. 9th Ed. Moleuclar Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002: 483Google Scholar), we further demonstrated the co-localization of daunorubicin with FITC-dextran localized to lysosomes, which is a more specific stain (Fig. 3B). The co-localization of daunorubicin with the FITC-dextran further supports the involvement of lysosomes in the sequestration of this compound. Unlike daunorubicin, SR101 was not co-localized with lysosomes (Fig. 4B). SR101 was found to co-localize with NBD-C6 ceramide, a Golgi-specific vital stain (Fig. 4A).Fig. 2Both daunorubicin and SR101 are sequestered into cytoplasmic compartments in the HL-60 ADR cells, a process that does not seem to occur in drug-sensitive cells. The intracellular distribution of Oregon Green does not change. Cells were incubated with indicated compound for 1 h, washed, and visualized using fluorescence microscopy using appropriate filter sets. The concentrations of compounds used for incubations were 2, 5, and 5 μm for daunorubicin, SR101, and Oregon green, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Lysosomes are involved in the sequestration of daunorubicin in the HL-60 ADR cell line.

NBD-C6 ceramide incubation conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mechanistic Evaluation of Drug Sequestration—We next sought to obtain preliminary results with regard to relevant mechanism(s) for these two compound-sequestering organelles. We first examined the possibility that daunorubicin is sequestered into lysosomes via a pH partitioning mechanism. The theoretical basis for the pH partitioning mechanism requires the lysosome-to-cytosol pH differential to be greater in the MDR line relative to the sensitive line. To test this, we measured the pH of the cytosol and lysosomes for both cell lines. FITC-dextran was used to measure lysosomal pH, and (5-and 6-) carboxyl SNARF1 AM acetate ester was used to measure cytosolic pH. Table I shows that the pH differential is 1.95 in MDR cells but only 0.52 in sensitive cell lines, which is consistent with the pH partitioning mechanism. To further evaluate this, HL-60 ADR cells were preincubated with the proton ionophores nigericin and monensin, which abolish cellular endomembrane pH gradients (18.Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The distribution of daunorubicin in the HL-60 ADR cells with and without pH gradient disruption is shown in Fig. 5. Cells with disrupted pH gradients were no longer able to sequester daunorubicin into lysosomes, and the cellular distribution now resembled the distribution in drug-sensitive cells. Conversely, the localization of SR101 to the Golgi apparatus was not noticeably affected by pH gradient disruption. Immunofluorescence staining of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 confirmed that cells with disrupted pH gradients had lysosomal morphology similar to cells without pH disruption (data not shown). This supports the idea that daunorubicin is sequestered into lysosomes by a pH partitioning mechanism, whereas SR101 is sequestered into the Golgi apparatus by an alternative mechanism. For SR101, we anticipated the involvement of drug transporter proteins. We screened for the expression of common drug transporter proteins from whole cell homogenates from sensitive and MDR lines using Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). We found that resistant cells showed a significant overexpression of the drug transporter protein MRP1 in comparison with sensitive cell lines, which had no detectable expression of this protein. We also examined the distribution of the drug transporter P-gp and found no detectable expression in either sensitive or resistant cell lines (data not shown). The intracellular localization of MRP1 in the HL-60 ADR cell was determined using an immunofluorescence protocol. Cells were incubated with a rat monoclonal antibody against MRP1, which was then localized with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Fig. 6B, lower panel). This micrograph suggested that MRP1 had a significant degree of intracellular expression in addition to plasma membrane localization. Immunofluorescence staining of the trans-Golgi network with anti-p230 antibody in the same cell is shown in the middle panel. The significant overlap of the merged images is consistent with MRP1 presence in the Golgi apparatus. To further demonstrate the role of MRP1 in the sequestration SR101, HL-60 ADR cells were preincubated with the MRP1 inhibitor MK571, and the effect on the intracellular sequestration was evaluated. Fig. 7A shows that SR101 fails to be significantly sequestered into the Golgi apparatus in the presence of the MRP1 inhibitor. Contrary to this, the inhibitor had no apparent effect on daunorubicin sequestration. This finding suggests that MRP1 is involved in the sequestration of SR101 in the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, the lack of effect of MK571 on daunorubicin sequestration suggests that daunorubicin sequestration is not mediated by MRP1. MRP1-mediated transport of drugs is often associated with glutathione cotransport or with a covalent coupling of the substrate to glutathione prior to transport (22.Mao Q. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34166-34172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of an inhibitor of cellular glutathione biosyntheses (BSO) on the sequestration of SR101 in the Golgi apparatus. Like MK571, BSO nearly abolished the sequestration capacity of the Golgi apparatus for SR101 yet had no influence on daunorubicin sequestration (Fig. 7B). The lack of effect of BSO on daunorubicin sequestration in lysosomes is somewhat surprising since there is evidence that suggests that the activity of vacuolar H+ ATPases may be inhibited by oxidation resulting from glutathione depletion (23.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28149-28157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the case with HL-60 ADR cells under our experimental conditions for BSO treatment. Lysosomal pH was not significantly perturbed (pH values of 5.34 ± 0.08 and 5.15 ± 0.12 in HL-60 ADR cells with and without BSO treatment, respectively). We also did not see any observable change in lysosome morphology with BSO treatment. This was evaluated by comparisons of LAMP-1 immunofluorescence micrographs (data not shown). Nevertheless, this observation is consistent with the requirement of glutathione in the MRP1-mediated transport of SR101 into the Golgi apparatus. HPLC analysis of HL-60 ADR cell extracts revealed only parent SR101; therefore, we think that this step is a glutathione co-transport process rather than a covalent coupling.Table IExperimentally determined lysosomal and cytosolic pH values for HL-60 cellsCell lineLysosome pHCytosol pHΔaRepresents the lysosome to cytosol pH differential.HL-606.44 ± 0.176.96 ± 0.170.52HL-60 ADR5.17 ± 0.147.12 ± 0.041.95HL-60 ADR + nigericin and monensinbNigericin (10 μm) and monensin (20 μm) were incubated with cells in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at 37 °C.7.47.40HL-60 ADR + concanamycin AcConcanamycin A (20 nm) was incubated with cells for 24 hours at 37 °C prior to pH determinations.7.13 ± 0.117.21 ± 0.150.08a Represents the lysosome to cytosol pH differential.b Nigericin (10 μm) and monensin (20 μm) were incubated with cells in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at 37 °C.c Concanamycin A (20 nm) was incubated with cells for 24 hours at 37 °C prior to pH determinations.

The anthracycline antibiotics (i.e. daunorubicin, doxorubicin) represent one of the few classes of anticancer agents with suitable fluorescence properties for such analysis. Consequently, most reports studying this drug sequestration phenotype have focused on these weakly basic anticancer drugs. This has led to significant ambiguity regarding the underlying mechanism(s) that drive sequestration because weak bases can be considered likely candidates for drug transporter proteins as well as pH gradient-driven accumulation. An important consideration that has not been considered previously in the literature is the potential involvement of multiple sequestration mechanisms within a given MDR cancer cell. These mechanisms could function concertedly within a single organelle class, or they could act independently on different organelles. To investigate these possibilities, we evaluated the sequestration capacity for a set of compounds with different acid-base properties: daunorubicin (a weak base chemotherapeutic agent), SR101 (a zwitterionic fluorescent molecule), and Oregon Green (a weakly acidic fluorescent molecule). Of these three molecules, only daunorubicin would be expected to be sequestered into acidic cytoplasmic organelles via a pH-partitioning mechanism. Conversely, considering the broad substrate specificity of drug transporter proteins, all three would be potential candidates for sequestration according to transporter-mediated sequestration mechanism. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that the HL60 ADR cell line has the capacity to sequester different molecules according to different mechanisms into distinct organelles. Our results suggest that SR101 is sequestered into the Golgi apparatus by an MRP1-mediated process, whereas daunorubicin is sequestered into lysosomes according to a pH partitioning mechanism. In both cases, this compartmentalization event can be correlated with increased resistance to the sequestered compound. For daunorubicin, the IC50 values in HL-60 and HL-60 ADR cells are 42 ± 5 and 4196 ± 99 nm, respectively; for SR101, these values are 415 ± 94 and 1000 ± 287 μm, respectively. However, both sequestration events correlated with increased resistance, the degree of which appears to be most significant with daunorubicin. This difference can most likely be attributed to different locations and/or mechanisms of cellular toxicity for these two compounds. Previous mechanistic explanations for daunorubicin sequestration in MDR cell lines have been contradictory. Reports have proposed that a pH partitioning mechanism is responsible (16.Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18.Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3745-3754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet others have suggested that drug transporters are principally involved (26.Lutzky J. Astor M.B. Taub R.N. Baker M.A. Bhalla K. Gervasoni J.E. Rosado M. Stewart V. Krishna S. Hindenburg A.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4120-4125PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Benderra Z. Trussardi A. Morjani H. Villa A.M. Doglia S.M. Manfait M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The former studies are consistent with our findings in the HL-60 ADR cell line. We have demonstrated the importance of the lysosome-to-cytosol pH gradient in drug sequestration; however, this information alone does not rule out the potential involvement of drug transporter proteins since these proteins could be indirectly participating in drug sequestration through intracellular pH modulation. ATP binding cassette transporters such as P-gp and MRP1 have been shown to influence pH gradients across the plasma membrane of cells (28.Litman T. Pedersen S.F. Kramhoft B. Skovsgaard T. Hoffmann E.K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29.Thiebaut F.T. Currier S.J. Whitaker J. Haugland R.P. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, if these transporters are localized to intracellular organelles, it is possible that these transporters could cause acidification of the drug sequestering organelles, if properly oriented. The exact mechanism for reacidification of lysosomes in MDR cells is not known at this time. Normal regulation of organelle pH is carried out by vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (V-ATPase) and associated ion channels to dissipate membrane potential (30.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Our data with HL-60 ADR cells support the idea that lysosomal reacidification in HL-60 ADR cells is regulated by V-ATPase and not by MRP1. In addition, our data suggest that MRP1 is not localized with lysosomes, due to the lack of sequestration of SR101 with daunorubicin in lysosomes (Fig. 4). We have also shown that the specific V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A (Table I), is able to raise lysosomal pH from 5.17 to 7.13 in HL-60 ADR cells, and this resulted in diminished lysosomal sequestration capacity (data not shown), similar to that observed with the proton ionophores shown in Fig. 5. These findings are consistent with those of Ma and Center (31.Ma L. Center M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), who have shown that the gene encoding the V-ATPase subunit C is overexpressed in HL-60 ADR cells. Contrary to our findings, studies have suggested that daunorubicin is sequestered into cytoplasmic organelles of MDR K562 and HL-60 cells according to an MRP1-mediated process (26.Lutzky J. Astor M.B. Taub R.N. Baker M.A. Bhalla K. Gervasoni J.E. Rosado M. Stewart V. Krishna S. Hindenburg A.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4120-4125PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Benderra Z. Trussardi A. Morjani H. Villa A.M. Doglia S.M. Manfait M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Confusion in this identification might be attributed to the inability of the authors to directly co-localize drug transporter with sequestered drug. This is because the permeabilization steps required for immunofluorescence release sequestered compounds. We have circumvented this obstacle by colocalizing MRP1 with the Golgi-associated membrane protein P-230 and separately examining the co-localization of Golgi-specific vital stain NBD-C6 ceramide with either daunorubicin or SR101. We observed that SR101 was sequestered within the Golgi in HL-60 ADR cells, whereas daunorubicin was not. Studies implicating the involvement of MRP1 in the sequestration of daunorubicin arise from experimental observations using BSO to deplete cellular glutathione. As mentioned earlier, glutathione is thought to be required for the transport of drugs mediated by MRP1. When cells are treated with BSO, previous authors have shown that cells are more sensitive to daunorubicin and that nuclear concentrations of daunorubicin are increased relative to untreated cells (26.Lutzky J. Astor M.B. Taub R.N. Baker M.A. Bhalla K. Gervasoni J.E. Rosado M. Stewart V. Krishna S. Hindenburg A.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4120-4125PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Benderra Z. Trussardi A. Morjani H. Villa A.M. Doglia S.M. Manfait M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not show that BSO was able to directly alter the intracellular sequestration of daunorubicin. Our observations suggest that BSO has no effect on daunorubicin sequestration but indeed mediates the release of SR101 (Fig. 7B). We think that the reason for increased nuclear concentrations and increased sensitivity to daunorubicin is due to an increase in total cell accumulation capacity for daunorubicin in BSOtreated cells. To demonstrate this, we quantitatively evaluated daunorubicin sensitivity and total cell accumulation in the HL-60 ADR cell line in the presence or absence of BSO (Fig. 8). In the presence of BSO, we observe an approximately 3-fold increase in whole cell accumulation. We also observe a 3.5-fold increase in sensitivity to daunorubicin, which is in very close agreement with results seen with the 3.1-fold increase observed by Benderra et al. (27.Benderra Z. Trussardi A. Morjani H. Villa A.M. Doglia S.M. Manfait M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a result, we think that the increase in sensitivity and nuclear accumulation in the presence of BSO is not due to a redistribution of sequestered drug from cytoplasmic organelles, but instead, is directly caused by an overall increase in drug accumulation. Further investigations are required to understand the mechanistic basis for BSO-mediated increase in total cellular accumulation of daunorubicin in this cell line. In summary, we have shown for the first time that a single MDR cancer cell is capable of sequestering different compounds with different acid/base properties into different organelles. This work demonstrates that the sequestration phenotype associated with certain cancer cells is more complex than originally thought. Many important chemotherapeutic agents are neither weakly basic nor fluorescent. This work may help to rationalize their reduced effectiveness in MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, this information could lead to rational selection/design of new anticancer drugs with a reduced capacity for sequestration. Likewise, specific inhibitors of protein function described in this report may be evaluated as adjuvants in MDR cancer treatment."

Here, we show that HCMV UL33 is predominantly transcribed as a spliced mRNA of which the 5′ terminus is localized 55 bp upstream of the start codon. Like its homolog from rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV), R33, UL33 activates multiple signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. Although both receptors constitutively activate phospholipase C via Gq/11, and partially via Gi/o-mediated pathways, they exhibit profound differences in the modulation of cAMP-responsive element (CRE) activation. R33 constitutively inhibits, whereas UL33 constitutively enhances CRE-mediated transcription. For R33, the inhibition of CRE-driven transcription is entirely Gi/o-mediated. For UL33, however, CRE-mediated transcription is modulated not only through coupling to Gαi/o but also through coupling to Gαs. In addition, UL33 was found to enhance CRE activation through the Rho/p38 pathway, via Gβγ. Interestingly, by studying chimeric UL33/R33 proteins, we found the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of UL33, but not that of R33, to be responsible for the activation of Gi/o proteins. A UL33-deficient variant of HCMV was generated to analyze UL33-signaling properties in a physiologically relevant model system. Data obtained with infected cells show that HCMV induces CRE activation, and this effect is, at least in part, dependent on UL33 expression. Taken together, our data indicate that constitutive signaling of UL33 differs from that of R33 by promiscuous activation of G proteins of the Gq, Gi/o, as well as Gs class. Thus, HCMV may effectively use UL33 to orchestrate multiple signaling networks within infected cells.

A large number of viruses appear to have pirated genes encoding key regulatory cellular proteins (1.Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It is likely that these genes play important roles in strategies that are aimed at the subversion of antiviral challenges by the immune system of the viral host. One of the most prominent examples of such strategies is employed by representatives from the β- and γ-herpesvirus subfamilies.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), and human herpesvirus 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) revealed the existence of genes encoding proteins with high homology to chemokine receptors, belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (reviewed in Ref. 2.Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because GPCRs play a crucial role in cellular communication, and chemokine receptors in particular are essential for leukocyte trafficking, the virus-encoded GPCRs (vGPCRs) may be crucial determinants of viral pathogenesis.

The β-herpesvirus HCMV can cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals and has also been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases, like arterial restenosis and atherosclerosis (3.Sweet C. Collier L.S. Timbury M.C. Topley and Wilson's Principles of Bacteriology. 8th Ed. Vol. 4. Edward Arnold, London1990: 105-130Google Scholar). Within the HCMV genome, four genes encoding GPCRs have previously been identified (US27, US28, UL33, and UL78) (4.Chee M.S. Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the HCMV genome may contain additional putative GPCR genes (5.Rigoutsos I. Novotny J. Huynh T. Chin-Bow S.T. Parida L. Platt D. Coleman D. Shenk T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4326-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The US28-encoded receptor has been characterized most extensively and was shown to bind CC chemokines and the CX3C chemokine fractalkine (6.Kuhn D.E. Beall C.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochem. Biophys.

In addition, we and others have recently shown that US28 signals in a constitutive manner in both transfected and HCMV-infected cells (8.Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H.

For the other three HCMV-encoded GPCR-like genes, little information is available. The UL33 gene has homologs in all β-herpesviruses, including rat CMV (RCMV) R33, murine CMV (MCMV) M33, and the U12 genes of HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7, which may illustrate the biological significance of this gene family (reviewed in Ref. 11.Vink C. Smit M.J. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. J. Clin. Virol. 2001; 23: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The UL33, M33, and R33 genes were found to be dispensable for viral growth in vitro (12.Margulies B.J. Browne H. Gibson W. Virology. 1996; 225: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J.

However, the biological significance of the UL33 family members has been demonstrated in studies in vivo. Recombinant RCMV and MCMV strains lacking a functional R33 or M33 gene, respectively, are unable to replicate in the salivary glands and induce a lower mortality in infected animals (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Beisser P.S. Vink C. Van Dam J.G. Grauls G. Vanherle S.J. Bruggeman C.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2352-2363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results underline the importance of the UL33-like genes in the pathogenesis of infection. On the basis of sequence alignments, it was suggested that the UL33 gene family members of MCMV, HCMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7 may express spliced mRNAs (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, transcripts of M33, UL33, as well as HHV-6B U12 were demonstrated to be spliced (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Isegawa Y. Ping Z. Nakano K. Sugimoto N. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6104-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a previous report suggested that transcripts of UL33 were not spliced (12.Margulies B.J. Browne H. Gibson W. Virology. 1996; 225: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The RCMV R33 gene, on the other hand, was found to be transcribed into an un-spliced mRNA (14.Beisser P.S. Vink C. Van Dam J.G. Grauls G. Vanherle S.J. Bruggeman C.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2352-2363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the RCMV R33 gene, like US28, encodes a constitutively active receptor, modulating multiple signaling pathways (16.Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Also, the MCMV and HCMV homologs of R33, M33, and UL33, respectively, were shown to display constitutive activity (17.Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, a detailed analysis of the signaling pathways underlying the observed constitutive activity displayed by UL33 has not been performed. As yet, no chemokines were reported to bind or modulate the activity of UL33, R33, or M33 (16.Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17.Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, these proteins should be regarded as orphan receptors. In this study, we compared the pharmacological behavior of the HCMV-encoded UL33 with that of its RCMV homolog R33. Because only limited information is available on the UL33 gene and protein, transcriptional analysis was performed in HCMV-infected cells, and signaling pathways activated by UL33 have been extensively delineated. Like other vGPCRs, UL33 shows a considerable level of constitutive activity and couples to a wide variety of G proteins. Surprisingly, UL33 and R33 differentially modulate signaling, which was further addressed by studying UL33/R33 chimeras. Moreover, to analyze the signaling properties of the UL33 protein in HCMV-infected cells, a UL33-deficient variant of HCMV was generated and characterized. DNA Constructs—Plasmid pcDNA3/UL33(s) (gift from Dr. B. Margulies), contains the partial coding sequence of the HCMV strain AD169 UL33 gene (corresponding to position 43,253–44,425 of the HCMV AD169 genome sequence, GenBank™ data base accession number NC-001347) (12.Margulies B.J. Browne H. Gibson W. Virology. 1996; 225: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Within plasmid pcDNA3/UL33(s), the UL33 open reading frame (ORF) starts with an ATG codon downstream of the UL33 intron. Thus, this plasmid encodes a short (s) version of UL33, which is truncated at its N terminus. The expression vector pcDNA3/UL33, which contains the full-length coding UL33 cDNA sequence (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was generated as follows. First, PCR amplification was performed of the UL33 5′ coding region (corresponding to positions 43,066–43,089 and 43,211–43,394 of the HCMV AD169 genome) using HCMV AD169 cDNA as template and primers 5′-caggatcctggtgggcgtcg-3′ (the sequence in bold type is complementary to the sequence corresponding to position 43,377–43,394 of the HCMV genome; the underlined sequence indicates the position of the BamHI site) and 5′-gaggtaccacgatggacaccatc-3′ (the sequence in bold type corresponds to position 43,061–43,077 of the HCMV genome; the underlined sequence indicates the position of the Asp718 site). The resulting 220-bp PCR product was then digested with BamHI and Asp718, and subsequently used to replace the BamHI-Asp718 fragment containing the 5′ coding region of UL33(s) in plasmid pcDNA3-UL33(s), thus resulting in expression vector pcDNA3/UL33. To enable subsequent C-terminal tagging of the UL33 and UL33(s) gene products with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), a PCR-based procedure was used to modify the sequence surrounding the stop codons of UL33 and UL33(s). Using this procedure, the sequence 5′-GTATGAGCT-3′ (corresponding to position 44,420–44,428 of the HCMV genome), in which the sequence in italics represents the UL33 and UL33(s) stop codons, was changed into the sequence 5′-GTGCTAGCG-3′, in which the stop codon is disrupted and a unique NheI restriction site (in italics) is introduced. Subsequently, the 768-bp NheI-XbaI fragment from plasmid p368, which contains the EGFP ORF (16.Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was cloned in-frame into the introduced NheI sites at the 3′-end of the UL33 and UL33(s) ORFs, generating expression vectors pcDNA3/UL33-EGFP and pcDNA3/UL33(s)-EGFP, respectively. A PCR-based procedure was used to generate vectors pcDNA3/R33-R-UL33, pcDNA3/R33-Y-UL33, pcDNA3/UL33-R-R33, and pcDNA3/UL33-Y-R33, which express pR33/pUL33 chimeric proteins as schematically depicted below in Fig. 3. The vectors pcDNA3/R33-Y-UL33-EGFP, pcDNA3/R33-R-UL33-EGFP, pcDNA3/UL33-Y-R33, and pcDNA3/UL33-R-R33-EGFP, expressing the respective chimeric receptors with a C-terminal EGFP tag, were generated in a similar fashion as described above for the UL33 expression constructs. The integrity of all DNA constructs was verified by sequence analysis. The expression vectors pcDNA3/EGFP, pcDNA3/R33, and pcDNA3/R33-EGFP have been described previously (16.Gruijthuijsen Y.K.

The astrocytoma cell line U373 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Determination of cDNA Ends—Propagation of human embryo lung fibroblasts (HEL) and HCMV AD169 was performed as previously described (18.Beisser P.S. Laurent L. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5949-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Goossens V.J. Blok M.J. Christiaans M.H. Sillekens P. Middeldorp J.M. Bruggeman C.A. Transplant Proc. 2000; 32: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HEL were infected with HCMV AD169 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 as described earlier (18.Beisser P.S. Laurent L. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5949-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At 72 h postinfection, infected as well as uninfected HEL were detached from culture flasks by using a cell scraper. Approximately 107 cells per sample were subjected to poly(A)+ RNA extraction by using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 1-μg portions were used for cDNA synthesis and PCR using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech/Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the amplification of UL33-specific cDNA, a gene-specific primer with the sequence 5′-AAGCGGTTGTGGCATAACTGTTGAAGATCA-3′ (complementary to GenBank™ accession NC-001347, bases 43,976–44,424) was included in the reaction. The PCR reaction mixtures were incubated in a GeneAmp Systems 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Nieuwerkerk aan de IJssel, The Netherlands) with the following settings: 5 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, 5 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 70 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, and 22 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 68 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. Subsequent to the incubation, 5-μl samples from each of the PCR mixtures was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. In addition, a 1-μl sample from the UL33-specific PCR mix was used for cloning of the PCR product into vector pGEM®-T Easy (Promega Benelux BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). The resulting plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. Plasmids from several E. coli colonies were sequenced by using a Thermo Sequenase cycle sequence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and standard M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers. Finally, the sequences were compared with sequences from the non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (20.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Confocal Imaging—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips. After 48 h, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formol in phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were mounted for subsequent confocal imaging. Confocal images were collected at a wavelength of 488 nm and processed as described previously (16.Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Assay—COS-7 cells transiently co-transfected with the reporter plasmid pTLNC-21CRE (containing 21 cAMP-responsive elements upstream of the luciferase cDNA) and either pcDNA3 (mock) or any of the expression constructs were seeded in 96-well white plates in serum-free culture medium in the presence or absence of PTX (80 ng/ml). After 24 h, selected samples were stimulated with forskolin (1 μm) for a period of 6 h. Incubation was stopped by aspiration of the medium, and cells were assayed for luminescence as described previously. Luminescence was measured for 3 s in a Wallac Victor2 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). [3H]Inositol Phosphate Production—Experiments in COS-7 cells were performed as previously described (8.Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol.

BAC Mutagenesis—Recombinant UL33-deficient HCMV genome was generated in E. coli using a recently established new method that relies on homologous recombination of a linear PCR fragment with the HCMV BAC plasmid (21.Wagner M.

The kanamycin gene was excised via the flanking Flp recombination target sites by Flp-mediated recombination as described previously (21.Wagner M. Koszinowski U.H. Zhao S.

BAC DNA pUL33del was isolated from E. coli cultures with an alkaline lysis procedure (24.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and purified with NucleoBond PC 500 columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Correct mutagenesis was confirmed by PCR analysis using the primer pair UL33ATG, 5′-CGC ACA TCA ATG ACA CTT GC-3′ and UL33TGA 5′-TGA ATA AAG TAA CAG GAA AGC-3′. Reconstitution of UL33-deficient HCMV—Mutant viruses were reconstituted by transfection of BAC DNA pUL33del into human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μg of BAC DNA was incubated with 150 μl of medium without serum and 30 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent. The mixture was added to ∼3 × 105 HFF cells. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 2 h later, cultured with fresh medium. Cells were passaged 7 days after transfection. Infectious supernatants were harvested when 100% of cells showed cytopathic effects. Virus stocks were prepared on HFF. All virus titers were determined by standard assays. DNA of reconstituted virus mutants was analyzed in parallel by Southern blotting and PCR to prove the correct deletions of the UL33 gene. Viral Nucleic Acid Isolation and Analysis—Fibroblasts were infected at an m.o.i. of 1, harvested 3 days post infection when cultures reached 100% cytopathic effect, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. Proteinase K digestion (500 μg/ml) was performed for 3 h at 56 °C. Total DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol. Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously (25.Wagner M. Michel D. Schaarschmidt P. Vaida B. Jonjic S. Messerle M. Mertens T. Koszinowski U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10729-10736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CRE Activation in HCMV-infected Cells—U373 cells were plated in six-well plates (∼250,000 cells/well) and transiently transfected with the reporter gene pTLNC-21CRE with the calcium phosphate method. 16 h later, cells were infected with HCMV (strain AD169) or AD169-ΔUL33 at an m.o.i. of 3. At different time points after infection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (8.Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using the program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Transcriptional Analysis of UL33 in HCMV-infected Cells— Although HCMV UL33 was originally thought to express an unspliced mRNA (12.Margulies B.J. Browne H. Gibson W. Virology. 1996; 225: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Davis-Poynter and coworkers demonstrated that UL33 is transcribed as a spliced mRNA (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As a consequence, the UL33 gene encodes a protein that is 22 amino acids longer than the protein that was previously predicted to be encoded by UL33 (12.Margulies B.J. Browne H. Gibson W. Virology. 1996; 225: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has not yet been established whether UL33 can also be transcribed into unspliced mRNAs, potentially coding for alternative protein products. To investigate this possibility, fibroblasts were infected with HCMV AD169. After purification of mRNA from the cells, the 5′ termini of the UL33 transcripts were assessed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). First, the integrity of the cDNA samples was checked by using primers specific for the human transferrin receptor (TFR). As expected, the TFR-control 5′-RACE reaction produced a major DNA fragment of 2.3 kb (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Subsequently, a 5′-RACE reaction was performed using the UL33-specific antisense primer. This reaction resulted in the amplification of a major DNA species with a length of 0.9 kb (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Several minor, smaller fragments were also observed in this sample. To determine the sequence of these fragments, a portion of the 5′-RACE sample was used for subcloning into a sequencing vector. Plasmids purified from 15 independent bacterial colonies were sequenced. The resulting sequences were compared with those of the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data base. This comparison indicated that all 15 clones contained UL33-specific sequences. The length of the insert in 8 out of 15 clones corresponded to that of the major, 0.9-kb PCR product in Fig. 1B (lane 2). Each of these inserts was found to be the product of splicing, similarly as described previously (13.Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Out of these eight clones, seven were found to have the same 5′ cDNA end. This end was localized 55 bp upstream of the UL33 start codon (Fig. 1C), whereas one of these eight terminated at 31 bp upstream of the first start codon (Fig. 1C). The inserts from the other seven out of 15 clones were likely derived from the minor PCR products seen in F"

J.</i> 73, 2791–2797), plasmon-waveguide resonance spectroscopy, we have been able, for the first time, to directly measure the binding between the human brain δ-opioid receptor (hDOR) and its G-protein effectors in real-time. We have found that the affinity of the G-proteins toward the receptor is highly dependent on the nature of the ligand pre-bound to the receptor. The highest affinity was observed when the receptor was bound to an agonist (∼10 nm); the lowest when receptor was bound to an antagonist (∼500 nm); and no binding at all was observed when the receptor was bound to an inverse agonist. We also have found direct evidence for the existence of an additional G-protein binding conformational state that corresponds to the unliganded receptor, which has a G-protein binding affinity of ∼60 nm. Furthermore, GTP binding to the receptor·G-protein complex was only observed when the agonist was pre-bound. Similar studies were carried out using the individual G-protein subtypes for both the agonist and the unliganded receptor. Significant selectivity toward the different G-protein subtypes was observed. Thus, the unliganded receptor had highest affinity toward the Gα<sub>o</sub> (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> ∼ 20 nm) and lowest affinity toward the Gα<sub>i2</sub> (∼590 nm) subtypes, whereas the agonist-bound state had highest affinity for the Gα<sub>o</sub> and Gα<sub>i2</sub> subtypes (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> ∼ 9 nm and ∼ 7 nm, respectively). GTP binding was also highly selective, both with respect to ligand and G-protein subtype. We believe that this methodology provides a powerful new way of investigating transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2002302539,"Abstract Critical events for vasoconstrictor and growth factor signal transduction include stimulation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and elevation of intracellular calcium. c-Src has been proposed as a common mediator for these signals activated by both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors (TKRs). Here we show that the GPCR kinase-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a substrate for c-Src that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II (AngII) and EGF in vascular smooth muscle and 293 cells. GIT1 associates with PLCγ via the PLCγ Src homology 2 and 3 domains constitutively, and the interaction is unaltered by AngII and EGF. GIT1 interaction with PLCγ is required for PLCγ activation based on inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization after GIT1 knockdown with antisense GIT1 oligonucleotides. GIT1 interacts with PLCγ via a novel Spa homology domain (SHD) and a coiled-coil domain. Deletion mutation analysis showed that GIT1(SHD) is required for AngII- and EGF-mediated PLCγ activation (measured by phosphorylation of Tyr783 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation). We propose that GIT1 is a novel regulator of PLCγ function that mediates PLCγ activation by c-Src and integrates signal transduction by GPCRs and TKRs."
https://openalex.org/W2055525901,"In this study we present data supporting that most CD38 is pre-assembled in a subset of Brij 98-resistant raft vesicles, which were stable at 37 degrees C, and have relatively high levels of Lck and the CD3-zeta subunit of T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex in contrast with a Brij 98-soluble pool, where CD38 is associated with CD3-zeta, and Lck is not detected. Our data further indicate that following CD38 engagement, LAT and Lck are tyrosine phosphorylated exclusively in Brij 98-resistant rafts, and some key signaling components translocate into rafts (i.e. Sos and p85-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). Moreover, N-Ras results activated within rafts immediately upon CD38 ligation, whereas activated Erk was mainly found in soluble fractions with delayed kinetics respective to Ras activation. Furthermore, full phosphorylation of CD3-zeta and CD3-epsilon only occurs in rafts, whereas partial CD3-zeta tyrosine phosphorylation occurs exclusively in the soluble pool, which correlated with increased levels of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in the non-raft fractions. Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike the non-raft pool, CD38 in rafts is able to initiate and propagate several activating signaling pathways, possibly by facilitating critical associations within other raft subsets, for example, LAT rafts via its capacity to interact with Lck and CD3-zeta. Overall, these findings provide the first evidence that CD38 operates in two functionally distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2082030103,"Renal mesangial cells express high levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β. We demonstrate here that the stable ATP analog adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) potently amplifies the cytokine-induced gelatinolytic content of mesangial cells mainly by an increase in the MMP-9 steady-state mRNA level. A Luciferase reporter gene containing 1.3 kb of the MMP-9 5′-promoter region showed weak responses to ATPγS but confered a strong ATP-dependent increase in Luciferase activity when under the additional control of the 3′-untranslated region of MMP-9. By in vitro degradation assay and actinomycin D experiments we found that ATPγS potently delayed the decay of MMP-9 mRNA. Gel-shift and supershift assays demonstrated that three AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3′-untranslated region of MMP-9 are constitutively bound by complexes containing the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR. The RNA binding of these complexes was markedly increased by ATPγS. Mutation of each ARE element strongly impaired the RNA binding of the HuR containing complexes. Reporter gene assays revealed that mutation of one ARE did not affect the stimulatory effects by ATPγS, but mutation of all three ARE motifs caused a loss of ATP-dependent increase in luciferase activity without affecting IL-1β-inducibility. By confocal microscopy we demonstrate that ATPγS increased the nucleo cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR and caused an increase in the cytosolic HuR level as shown by cell fractionation experiments. Together, our results indicate that the amplification of MMP-9 expression by extracellular ATP is triggered through mechanisms that likely involve a HuR-dependent rise in MMP-9 mRNA stability.

Therefore, MMPs have mainly been implicated in various diseases accompanied with an altered turnover of ECM. Besides the altered synthesis of single ECM components the increased expression and/or activity of MMPs seems of paramount importance for pathological remodeling processes within the kidney such as acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (1Edelstein C.L. Ling H. Schrier R.W. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1341-1351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Lenz O. Elliot S.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 574-581PubMed Google Scholar). Mainly the altered expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are also denoted as gelatinases, is crucially involved in the progression of glomerular inflammatory processes (2Lenz O. Elliot S.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 574-581PubMed Google Scholar, 3Davies M. Martin J. Thomas G.J. Lovett D.H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to various inflammatory cytokines, the expression of MMP-9 can be activated by many other stimuli such as mitogens, growth factors, and activators of the Ras oncogene (for review, see Refs. 4Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3081) Google Scholar and 5Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Although most of these stimuli can modulate gelatinolytic activity by influencing MMP-9 gene expression, the regulation of MMP-9 activity is also achieved by the processing of the inactive proenzyme by the action of other proteases and by an inhibition of the active enzyme by its endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (4Woessner Jr., J.F.

Previously, we have demonstrated an additional mode of posttranscriptional regulation of MMP-9, which involves the reduction of cytokine-induced MMP-9 via reduction of mRNA stability exerted by exogenous and endogenouly produced NO (6Eberhardt W.

A variety of inducible genes including proto-oncogenes, transcription factors, cell cycle-regulating proteins, and cytokines have been demonstrated to be regulated by a modulation of mRNA turnover. Recent evidence has revealed that AU-rich sequences also denoted as AU-rich elements (AREs) located in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of these genes comprise specific cis-regulating elements which target mRNAs for rapid degradation (for review, see Refs. 7Chen C.Y.

For this reason we tested whether extracellular nucleotides can influence the expression of MMP-9 in MC. Our data provide the first report that ATP and UTP can potentiate the cytokine-induced expression and activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, we implicate modulation of the nuclear-cytosolic shuttling of the RNA stabilizing factor HuR in the posttranscriptional regulation of MMP-9 by extracellular nucleotides. Reagents—Human recombinant IL-1β was from Cell Concept (Umkirch, Germany). All nucleotides were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Actinomycin D (from Streptomyces species) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Laeufelfingen, Switzerland). Ribonucleotides, restriction enzymes, and modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized from Whatman-Biometra (Göttingen, Germany). Cell Culture—Rat glomerular MC were characterized as described previously (20Pfeilschifter J. Vosbeck K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 5 ng/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Serum-free preincubations were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 24 h before cytokine treatment. For experiments MC between passages 8 and 19 were used. All cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). A monoclonal anti-HuR and the anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). cDNA Clones and Plasmids—cDNA inserts for rat MMP-9 was generated as described recently (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A cDNA insert from mouse 18 S rRNA was from Ambion (Austin, TX). A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA clone from rats was generated as described previously (25Akool E.S. Kleinert H. Hamada F.M.A. Abdelwahab M.H. Forstermann U. Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4901-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Generation of Reporter Plasmids and Transient Transfection of MC— The MMP-9 reporter gene pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb) encompassing a 1.3-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the rat MMP-9 gene was cloned as described previously (22Eberhardt W. Schulze M. Engels C. Klasmeier E. Pfeilschifter J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1752-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The plasmid 3′-UTR-MMP-9 pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb) was generated by cloning of a 662-bp fragment from the 3′-UTR of rat MMP-9 mRNA into the pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb) promoter plasmid. The 3′-UTR sequence of the rat MMP-9 gene was generated by PCR from reverse transcriptase products using the XbaI-flanked (underlined) forward primer 5′-TATTCTAGACCAACCTTTACCAGCTACTCGAA-3′ and BamHI-flanked (underlined) reverse primer 5′-TATGGATCCATTCATT-TATTTAAAAAAGAGTGT-3, corresponding to a region from nucleotides 2315-2338 and 2954-2977 of the rat MMP-9 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U24441). The PCR products subsequently were digested with XbaI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned into the BamHI/XbaI cut pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb) plasmid, thereby allowing a forced insertion of the 3′-UTR of rat MMP-9 mRNA at the 3′-end of the luc+ coding region of pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb). Introduction of triple-point mutation into ARE sites (ATTTA to ACCCA) to generate ΔARE mutations were performed using the following (sense) primer: 5′-TACCGGCCCTTTTAC-CCATTATGTATGTGG-3′ (corresponding to a region from 2494 to 2523) to generate “3′-UTR-ΔARE1-pGL3-MMP-9(1.3 kb)” 5′-TTCACACACAT-GTACCCAACCTATAGAATG-3′ (corresponding to a region from 2529 to 2558) to generate “3′-UTR-ΔARE2-pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb)” 5′-TTAGGGA-CAGAGGAACCCATTGGATGTTGG-3′ (corresponding to a region from 2735 to 2764) to generate “3′-UTR-ΔARE4-pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb).” All mutants were generated by use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). The plasmid “3′-UTR-ΔARE1-2-4-pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb)” in which all three AREs have been mutated was generated by generation of a construct bearing double-mutated AREs (“3′-UTR-ΔARE1-2-pGL3-MMP-9(1.3kb)”), which then served as a template. Transient transfections of MC were performed using the Effectene reagent (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). Transfections were performed following the manufactorer's instructions. The transfections were done as triplicates and repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility of the results. Transfection with pRL-CMV coding for Renilla luciferase was used to control for transfection efficiencies. Luciferase activities were measured with the dual reporter gene system (Promega) using an automated chemoluminescence detector (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted from MC using the Tri reagent (Sigma), and RNA was hybridized following standard procedures as described previously (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extracts—Cytoplasmic lysates were separated as described previously (22Eberhardt W. Schulze M. Engels C. Klasmeier E. Pfeilschifter J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1752-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic lysates were prepared from rat MC by lysis in a hypotone extraction buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation (1200 × g for 15 min) and the supernatants used as cytoplasmic fractions. RNA Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Supershift Analysis— Radiolabeled single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were prepared by kinase reaction using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were subsequently separated by Nick-Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). The sequences for gene specific oligonucleotides are summerized in Table I. Approximately 30 fmol of the radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide (∼30,000 cpm/reaction) were incubated with 6 μg of cytoplasmic extract and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. To reduce nonspecific binding total yeast RNA (200 ng/ml final concentration) was added. The total volume of each reaction was 10 μl. RNA-protein complexes were separated in 6% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gels and run in Tris borate EDTA.Table IOligonucleotides used in EMSA The sequence of oligonucleotides was derived from the region encompassing AUUUA-rich motifs within the 3′-UTR region of the rat MMP-9 gene.

In Vitro Degradation Assay—Degradation assays were performed as described previously with the following modifications (23Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Instead of using in vitro transcribed radioactively labeled MMP-9 mRNA, we used preparations from cytokine-induced total RNAs, thereby yielding a high amount of endogenous MMP-9 mRNA. 20 μg of total RNA from one pool were aliquoted and subsequently incubated at room temperature with 130 μg of cytoplasmic extract derived from untreated or alternatively from ATPγS-treated MC for different time points. RNA from these incubations was isolated by standard procedures and assessed by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled cDNA insert specific for rat MMP-9 (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The remaining (undegraded) MMP-9 hybridized signals were analyzed and quantified on an imaging system from Fujifilm (Raytest, Struabenhardt, Germany). HuR Neutralization Experiments—The impact of HuR on the degradation of MMP-9 mRNA was tested by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal anti-HuR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 0.4 μg of the antibody was added to the cytoplasmic extracts from ATPγS-treated MC and preincubated at room temperature for 1 h before addition of the RNA samples. To exclude any unspecific inhibitory effects by the mouse serum, we tested in parallel normal mouse serum. Western Blot Analysis—The total cellular level of HuR protein was analyzed by Western blot analysis using total cellular extracts (50 μg) using a monoclonal antibody specifically raised against full-length human HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A polyclonal antibody specific for human α-actin was purchased from (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany). The secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were incubated for 45 min at room temperature and blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry of HuR—At ∼60-80% confluence, mesangial cells were rendered serum-free for 24 h and thereafter stimulated with nucleotides for the indicated time periods. Subsequently, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30min at -20 °C with methanol containing 0.02% (w/v) EDTA. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, blocked for 1h in PBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 h with monoclonal anti-HuR antibody. Cells were then washed several times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with an anti-mouse-Alexa 488-coupled secondary antibody and thereafter washed again with PBS. Cellular fluorescence was monitored using confocal microscopy (MicroRadiation, Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. The data are presented as x-fold induction compared with control conditions or compared with IL-1β-stimulated values. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for significance. p values <0.05, <0.01, and <0.005 were considered significant. Extracellular Nucleotides Potentiate IL-1β-induced Lytic Activity and mRNA Steady-state Levels of MMP-9 —To evaluate possible effects of extracellular nucleotides on the activity of MMP-9, MC were treated with IL-1β for 24 h in the presence or absence of either ATP (30 μm) or UTP (30 μm). Furthermore, we tested for possible effects of adenosine a degradation product of ATP, as well as ATPγS, a stable ATP analog. The gelatinolytic contents in the conditioned medium of MC were tested by zymography using gelatin as a substrate (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We chose the 24-h treatment to allow accumulation of extracellular MMP-9, which is high enough to be detected by gelatin zymography (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cytokine-mediated gelatinolytic content of latent MMP-9, which is represented by one lytic band at 92 kDa, is strongly increased when MC were cotreated with ATPγS or UTP (Fig. 1A). No effect on the IL-1β-caused lytic content is seen with ATP and its degradation product adenosine (Fig. 1A). We suggest that under cell culture conditions the rapid degradation by ectonucleotidases removes ATP and therefore prevents sustained signaling by ATP. We observed that the levels of lytic bands migrating at 68 and 72 kDa, which corresponds to latent and active MMP-2, were not significantly changed, which is consistent with the constitutive expression of MMP-2 in rat MC (21Eberhardt W. Beeg T. Beck K.F. Walpen S. Gauer S. Böhles H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-1β, none of the tested nucleotides or nucleoside was able to induce MMP-9 activity (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of ATPγS occurred in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect seen with 30 μm of ATPγS (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the higher concentrations did not further augment the cytokine-induced gelatinolytic content in the conditioned media (Fig. 1B, upper panel). To evaluate whether the increased level of gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 is preceeded by an enhanced expression of MMP-9 mRNA, we performed Northern blot analyses using a cDNA from the rat MMP-9 gene. As shown in Fig. 1B (lower panel) similar to the changes in the gelatinolytic contents, ATPγS dose-dependently augmented the cytokine-induced MMP-9 mRNA level with a maximal effect seen at 30 μm ATPγS, whereas higher concentrations than 30 μm blunted the amplification of cytokine-induced MMP-9. No MMP-9 mRNA was detected in the absence of IL-1β when stimulating with the nucleotide alone (Fig. 1B, lower panel). To test the time-dependence of cytokine-induced MMP-9 by ATPγS we monitored the time course of MMP-9 induction by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C the indcution of MMP-9 mRNA as caused by the treatment of MC with either IL-1β or with IL-1β plus ATPγS did not occur at the early time points tested (4 and 12 h), thus indicating that ATPγS cannot induce MMP-9 mRNA expression by its own. Furthermore, these data indicate that the alterations of cytokine-induced gelatinolytic activity by ATPγS predominantly result from changes in the MMP-9 expression levels. Involvement of the P2Y2 Receptor in the Amplification Cascade of MMP-9 by ATP—Many of the physiologcial actions exerted by ATP involve the G-protein coupled P2Y2 subtype of purinoceptors. We therefore tested by a pharmacological approach for the involvement of the P2Y2 purinoreceptor in the amplification of cytokine-induced MMP-9 expression by use of suramin, a putative antagonist of P2Y2 but not of P2Y4 purinoceptors (24Boarder M.R. Hourani S.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, suramin dose-dependently inhibited the ATPγS-mediated potentiation of IL-1β gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 without affecting the cytokine-caused gelatinolytic content of MMP-9. This suggests an involvement of the P2Y2 subtype of purinoceptor in the ATP signaling of MMP-9 expression. Nucleotides Have No Effects on Cytokine-induced MMP-9 Promoter Activity—To further evaluate whether the ATP-mediated amplification of IL-1β-induced MMP-9 expression resulted from an increase in MMP-9 gene transcription we assessed promoter activites derived from a 1.3-kb fragment of the rat MMP-9 promoter region (pGL-MMP-9(1.3 kb)) by luciferase reporter gene assays. This promoter region contains several functional elements necessary for cytokine-mediated regulation of MMP-9 expression most important one NF-κB binding site and one AP-1 response element which is close to a functional Ets-1 binding site (22Eberhardt W. Schulze M. Engels C. Klasmeier E. Pfeilschifter J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1752-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of MC with pGL-MMP-9(1.3 kb), comprising the 1.3-kb promoter fragment fused to the luciferase reporter gene, was followed by a 24-h treatment with either vehicle, IL-1β (2 nm), with or without either ATPγS (30 μm), or UTP (30 μm) or with each nucleotide alone and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3). IL-1β significantly stimulated luciferase activity (1.9-fold, p < 0.01), but the promoter activity was only weakly enhanced by either nucleotide alone. These data demonstrate that the amplification of cytokine-induced mRNA steady-state levels by ATPγS cannot be located to the upstream 1.3-kb MMP-9 promoter context. ATPγS Inhibits the Decay of Cytokine-induced MMP-9 mRNA—To test whether the ATP effects relay to some post-transcriptional events, we performed actinomycin D experiments. MC were stimulated for 20 h with IL-1β (2 nm) before transcription was blocked by actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Subsequently, cells were either directly homogenized (vehicle, 0 h) or left untreated (vehicle, 12 h) or alternatively treated with the stable ATP analog ATPγS (30 μm). After 12 h cells were homogenized for the isolation of total RNA. The MMP-9 mRNA from untreated MC displayed a strong reduction by almost 80% (p < 0.005) in the mRNA steady-state level (Fig. 4A). Most interestingly, the decay of MMP-9 mRNA was completely blocked in the presence of ATPγS, thus indicating that ATPγS can stabilize the IL-1β-induced MMP-9 mRNA (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, time course experiments revealed that the mRNA stabilizing effects on MMP-9 transcripts by ATPγS already occurred at 4 h and were maximal 12 h after the blockade of transcription by actinomycin D (Fig. 4B). Recently it has been reported that transcription blockage by actinomycin D can induce a redistribution of the mRNA stabilization factor HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and therefore may cause an increase in the mRNA half-life (10Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments all cells were equally treated with actinomycin D, and therefore, the net effect on MMP-9 decay exclusively depend on the presence or absence of extracellular ATPγS. In contrast, IL-1β by itself had no effect on the stability of cytokine-induced MMP-9 mRNA, since the addition of IL-1β (2 nm) after transcriptional blockade did not cause any changes in the mRNA decay of MMP-9 (Fig. 4C). In summary, these data indicate that ATPγS can augment the cytokine-induced MMP-9 expression by"
https://openalex.org/W2041518368,"Cells respond to physiological stress by phosphorylating the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. This adaptive response inhibits protein synthesis and up-regulates genes essential for cell survival. Cat-1, the transporter for the essential amino acids, arginine and lysine, is one of the up-regulated genes. We previously showed that stress increases cat-1 expression by coordinated stabilization of the mRNA and increased mRNA translation. This induction is triggered by amino acid depletion and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that cat-1 gene transcription is also increased by cellular stress. Our studies demonstrate that the cat-1 gene promoter/regulatory region is TATA-less and is located in a region that includes 94 bases of the first exon. Transcription from this promoter is stimulated 8-fold by cellular stress. An amino acid response element within the first exon is shown to be required for the response to amino acid depletion but not to the UPR. The stimulation of transcription by amino acid depletion requires activation of GCN2 kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2α. This phosphorylation also induces translation of the cat-1 mRNA, demonstrating that stress-induced transcriptional and translational control of cat-1 are downstream targets of a signaling pathway initiating with eIF2α phosphorylation. Our studies show that the increase in cat-1 gene expression by cellular stress involves at least three types of coordinate regulation: regulation of transcription, regulation of mRNA stability, and regulation of mRNA translation."

PRL regulates different processes such as those involved in mammary gland development, reproduction, and immune regulation (reviewed by Ref. 1Goffin V. Binart N. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Annu. Rev.

The hormone generates its multiple biological functions by interacting with the PRL receptor (PRLR), a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (2Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M.

Modulation of Jak kinase activity has appeared as an important mechanism of regulation of cytokine receptor signaling.

SOCS-1 is a member of the SOCS family of proteins that includes eight members, SOCS-1 to SOCS-7 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein. Similar to other members of the family, SOCS-1 contains a central SH2 domain followed by a conserved carboxyl-terminal region called the SOCS-box. The inhibitory role of SOCS-1 is in part due to the fact that Jak2/SOCS-1 interaction blocks substrate access to Jak2 kinase through a 24 amino acid segment denoted as the kinase inhibitory region (23Sasaki A.

Recruitment of SOCS-1 through its SH2 domain to phosphorylated Tyr-1007 in the activation loop of Jak2 leads to inhibition of the catalytic activity of Jak2. A second critical role for SOCS-1 in down-regulating signaling is through targeting associated proteins to proteasomal degradation. Various studies have indicated that this function of SOCS-1 is attributed to the highly conserved SOCS-box (25Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L.

The SOCS-box of SOCS-1 was shown to target both the fusion product TEL (the Ets-variant gene 6)-Jak2 (28Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J. Gilliland D.G. Mol.

This degradation process was dependent on Jak2 phosphorylation on Tyr-1007. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that SHP-2 contributes to PRL-mediated activation of the Jak2/Stat5 pathway by modulating the formation of a complex between Jak2 and SOCS-1, thus maintaining the activity and stability of Jak2. We determined that abrogating SHP-2 activity downstream of the PRLR by either using a mutant form of the PRLR, deficient in SHP-2 recruitment site, or by using a phosphatase inactive mutant of SHP-2 resulted in a significant increase in Jak2 phosphorylation on Tyr-1007 and in the formation of a Jak2/SOCS-1 complex, in turn leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of Jak2. Therefore, SHP-2 critically regulates PRLR signaling by dephosphorylating SOCS-1 recruitment site within Jak2, consequently allowing signal propagation/maintenance. Materials, Plasmid Constructs, and Antibodies—Expression plasmids encoding the Nb2 form of the PRLR and the corresponding COOH-terminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant form, Nb2PRLRY382F, as well as Jak2 were described previously (4Lebrun J.J.

Expression plasmids encoding the wild type form of SHP-2 and the catalytically inactive cysteine 463 to alanine mutant SHP-2CA were obtained from Axel Ullrich (Max-Plank Institute, Germany). Expression plasmids encoding Myc-SOCS-1 and an SH2 domain-inactivating mutant form, Myc-SOCS-1R105E, were kindly provided by Akihiko Yoshimura (Life Sciences Institute, Kurume, Japan). Monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (4G10) and polyclonal antibody to Jak2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated Tyr-1007/Tyr-1008 of Jak2 was from BIOSOURCE International.

Phosphothiolated SOCS-1 antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Alpha DNA Inc. (Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). Protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Ovine PRL used for treatment of cells was obtained from Sigma. Nb2 Cell Culture and SOCS-1 Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatments—The Nb2 rat pre-T lymphoma, which is PRL-dependent for growth, were provided by Peter Gout (BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). These were grown to confluence in growth media (RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% horse serum, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm glutamine) and then starved for 18 h in starvation media (RPMI 1640 media containing 10% horse serum, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 200 mm glutamine) and stimulated with ovine PRL at 1 μg/ml. For blocking SOCS-1 expression, phosphothiolated antisense oligonucleotides to SOCS-1 mRNA (sequence: 5′-CACCTGGTTGTGTGCTACCAT-3′) were designed to recognize the initiation site of SOCS-1 protein. Oligonucleotides were incubated with cells at a concentration of 15 μm for a 16-h period. HC11 Cell Culture—HC11, mouse mammary epithelial cells, obtained from Nancy Hynes (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) and Bernd Groner (Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt, Germany) were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS, insulin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Cells were then induced to differentiate by incubating them for 3 days in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS, insulin (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μm). Cells were starved in RPMI 1640 media containing insulin (5 μg/ml) and hydrocortisone (1 μm) and stimulated by ovine PRL at 1 μg/ml. Transient Transfection—The human embryonic 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% FBS. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were plated and then co-transfected (by calcium phosphate method) with expression plasmids encoding the Nb2 form of the PRLR, PRLRY382F, SHP-2WT, SHP-2CA, SOCS-1, ubiquitin, SOCS-1R105E, Stat-5, and Jak2 (0.1–1.0 μg). After 18 h of expression, the cells were starved overnight by serum deprivation and then stimulated by PRL at 1 μg/ml for different periods of time as indicated for each experiment. Cell Lysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford technique. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed on cellular lysates obtained from Nb2, HC11, or 293 cells that were transiently transfected as indicated for each specific experiment. Immunoprecipitations were carried out on cell lysates for 3 h at 4 °C using the specified antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were then washed with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and separated on SDS-PAGE. Western Blotting—Standardized amounts of protein obtained from either whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitations were loaded and separated on an appropriate concentration of SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis was performed using the specified antibodies for each experiment. Proteins were revealed using chemiluminescence (Lumi-Light Plus, Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase Assay—The assay was carried out as described previously (4Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors as described for each experiment along with the β-casein gene promoter/luciferase reporter construct (31Ali S. Edery M. Pellegrini I. Lesueur L. Paly J. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and the internal control expression vector encoding β-galactosidase. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 15 mm MgSO4, 4mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g to clear the lysates. Lysates were mixed with ATP buffer (1 mm ATP, 15 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgCl2), and luciferase assay was carried out following the addition of luciferin substrate (Roche Diagnostic) using the Dynex luminometer (Chantilly, VA). Relative luciferase units were normalized against β-galactosidase values, and a representative of five different experiments is presented as relative light units. Prolactin Dependent Jak2/SOCS-1 Association Leads to Ubiquitination and Degradation of Jak2—SOCS-1 protein negatively regulates the signaling of various cytokine receptors. It was shown to inhibit Jak2 kinase activity through an interaction between the SH2 domain of SOCS-1 and phosphorylated Tyr-1007 of Jak2 (24Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A.

Similar to other cytokines, the negative-feedback loop of SOCS-1 in PRL signaling has been previously established as PRLR activation leads to the induction of SOCS-1 mRNA (32Pezet A. Favre H. Kelly P.A. Edery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24497-24502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), Jak2/SOCS-1 interaction, inhibition of activation of gene transcription (33Tomic S. Chughtai N. Ali S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 158: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and prevention of lactation (34Lindeman G.J. Wittlin S. Lada H. Naylor M.J. Santamaria M. Zhang J.G. Starr R. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Ormandy C.J. Visvader J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We initially intended to determine whether the association of Jak2/SOCS-1 would lead to the ubiquitination and degradation of Jak2 kinase in response to PRL stimulation. The pre-T lymphoma Nb2 cells were grown to confluence, starved by serum deprivation for 18 h, and then stimulated with PRL for the time points indicated in Fig. 1A. Cells were then collected and lysed, immunoprecipitations using a polyclonal antibody to Jak2 were carried out, and a sample was included containing the antibody and lysis buffer as a negative control. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Initially, Western blotting analysis using either a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine or a polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated Tyr-1007/Tyr-1008 of Jak2 indicated that indeed PRL induces transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 at tyrosines 1007 and 1008, returning to basal level by 3 h post-treatment. Western blotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody to Jak2 revealed that there was a time-dependent decrease in Jak2 protein level starting at 3 h post-treatment and continued to decrease, reaching stable low levels of the protein by 6 h (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Blotting with the polyclonal antibody to Jak2 revealed two bands of which the upper one corresponded to Jak2 observed in the phosphotyrosine and phospho-Jak2 immunoblots. The nature of the lower band detected by the antibody to Jak2 is not yet clear. To determine whether the decrease in Jak2 protein level is due to ubiquitination, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody to ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1A, lower panel, ubiquitinated Jak2, migrating as a smear, could be detected starting at 1 h, reaching a maximum level by 3 h and gradually decreasing thereafter up to a 24-h time point examined. We also examined PRL-mediated Jak2 ubiquitination/degradation in the PRL-responsive mouse mammary epithelial HC11 cells and observed that it followed a pattern similar to that seen in Nb2 cells (Fig. 1B). Together, the data indicate that PRL stimulation leads to a time-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Jak2. Using Nb2 cells, we next investigated whether PRL stimulation would lead to an increase in SOCS-1 protein level and, consequently, the interaction between Jak2 and SOCS-1 as SOCS-1 is known to act in a negative-feedback loop. As shown in Fig. 1C, upper panel, PRL stimulation led to a time-dependent increase in SOCS-1 protein level as detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to SOCS-1. As a positive control for SOCS-1 detection, extracts of mouse thymus were used as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, there was a detectable amount of SOCS-1 protein present under basal conditions and the highest level detected was at a 3–6-h stimulation with PRL. SOCS-1 protein level returned to basal levels at 16–24 h following PRL stimulation. In agreement with the increase in SOCS-1 protein, SOCS-1 immunoprecipitations followed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to Jak2 revealed a time-dependent increase in the formation of a Jak2/SOCS-1 complex following PRL stimulation. Jak2/SOCS-1 association was detected at 30 min and peaked at 3–6 h following treatment (Fig. 1C, middle panel). When the membrane was stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody to SOCS-1, it revealed again the time-dependent increase in SOCS-1 protein levels (Fig. 1C, lower panel). To determine the contribution of PRL-induced SOCS-1 expression in Jak2 degradation, SOCS-1 protein expression was blocked in Nb2 cells using antisense oligonucleotides to SOCS-1 mRNA. Nb2 cells were grown and then starved and either left untreated or treated with the antisense oligonucleotides to SOCS-1 for an overnight period. As shown in Fig. 1D, the presence of the antisense oligonucleotides prevented the increase in SOCS-1 expression at all of the time points examined. The effect was particularly obvious at the 6-h time point. This correlated with an increase in the stability of Jak2 observed at the different time points in samples pretreated with the antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 1D, lower panel). At the 6-h time point, the attenuation in degradation of Jak2 was most apparent. Thus, blocking SOCS-1 protein expression impedes the time-dependent degradation of Jak2. Taken together, PRLR stimulation induces a time-dependent increase in SOCS-1 expression accompanied by an increase in the association of Jak2/SOCS-1, leading ultimately to a time-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Jak2. The Carboxyl-terminal Tyrosine of the PRLR Regulates the Kinetics of Jak2 Ubiquitination/Degradation—We have previously reported that the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR plays a vital role in the regulation of Jak2/Stat-5 signaling pathway leading to gene activation (4Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is a recruitment site for SHP-2 (9Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39073-39080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we examined initially the role of the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR in regulating Jak2 stability. For these studies, the human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding the wild type Nb2 form of the PRLR or the COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant form of the receptor in which tyrosine 382 was mutated to phenylalanine, PRLRY382F, along with expression vectors for Jak2 and SOCS-1. We specifically used the Nb2 form of the PRLR (35Ali S. Pellegrini I. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20110-20117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because we have previously shown that this form is biologically active and that the COOH-terminal tyrosine, Tyr-382, is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in this receptor form (4Lebrun J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39073-39080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 18 h, stimulated with PRL for 30 min, 1 h, or 3 h, and then collected and lysed. Cellular lysates were prepared for immunodetection with a polyclonal antibody to Jak2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the protein level of Jak2 remained relatively constant over the 3-h time course of PRL stimulation in samples overexpressing the Nb2 wild type receptor. In contrast, in samples overexpressing the COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant form of the receptor, there was a rapid decrease in the protein level of Jak2 starting at 30 min and clearly visible at 1 h post-treatment. After 3 h of PRL stimulation, there was little detectable Jak2 present. Therefore, the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR plays an important role in Jak2 stability. We next sought to determine whether protein degradation was specific to Jak2, and for that reason, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding either the Nb2 PRLR or Nb2 PRLRY382F mutant along with expression vectors for SOCS-1 and Stat5. As shown in Fig. 2A, lower panel, unlike the pattern for Jak2 degradation, Stat5 protein level did not change over the time course of PRL stimulation in the different samples. Therefore, Stat5 does not undergo a similar protein degradation pattern as that observed for Jak2. Together, the results indicate that the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR regulates the stability of Jak2 kinase in response to PRL stimulation. We next examined whether the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR regulates the interaction between Jak2 and SOCS-1, leading to the observed differential stability of Jak2. Cells transiently co-transfected as noted above were starved for 18 h and stimulated with PRL for 10 or 30 min. These time points of stimulation were selected because there was minimal degradation of Jak2. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using a polyclonal antibody to Jak2, and immune complexes were blotted with a monoclonal antibody to Myc, recognizing Myc-tagged SOCS-1 protein (Fig. 2B). As expected, PRL stimulation led to Jak2/SOCS-1 interaction in all of the samples. Interestingly, more SOCS-1 protein was found to co-immunoprecipitate with Jak2 in samples overexpressing the PRLRY382F compared with samples overexpressing wild type PRLR. Reprobing the membrane with a polyclonal antibody to Jak2 showed equal immunoprecipitations of Jak2 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). These data indicate that a mechanism(s) operating downstream of the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR regulates Jak2 and SOCS-1 to form a complex in response to PRL stimulation. Because SOCS-1-mediated degradation of associated proteins occurs through ubiquitination, we next examined the role of the COOH-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR in Jak2 ubiquitination. 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors for the wild type Nb2 form of the PRLR or the COOH-terminal tyrosine mutant of the Nb2 form, PRLRY382F, along with expression vector for SOCS-1. Cells were starved and stimulated with PRL"
https://openalex.org/W2057842968,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis. XIAP is structurally characterized by three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains that mediate binding to and inhibition of caspases and a RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity. The caspase inhibitory activity of XIAP can be eliminated by the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) during apoptosis. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel isoform of Smac/DIABLO named Smac3, which is generated by alternative splicing of exon 4. Smac3 contains an NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence required for mitochondrial targeting of Smac3 and an IAP-binding motif essential for Smac3 binding to XIAP. Smac3 is released from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli, where it interacts with the second and third BIR domains of XIAP. Smac3 disrupts processed caspase-9 binding to XIAP, promotes caspase-3 activation, and potentiates apoptosis. Strikingly, Smac3, but not Smac/DIABLO, accelerates XIAP auto-ubiquitination and destruction. Smac3-stimulated XIAP ubiquitination is contingent upon the physical association of XIAP with Smac3 and an intact RING domain of XIAP. Smac3-accelerated XIAP destabilization is, at least in part, attributed to its ability to enhance XIAP ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that Smac3 is functionally additive to, but independent of, Smac/DIABLO.

Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved and genetically regulated biological process that plays a fundamental role in the development and tissue homeostasis of metazoans (1Steller H.

Dysregulation of apoptosis has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases (4Thompson C. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar).Apoptosis is mainly orchestrated by a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases known as caspases. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens that bear three domains: an NH2-terminal prodomain, a large subunit, and a small subunit (5Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Caspases involved in apoptosis are generally divided into two categories, the initiator caspases, which include caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10, and effector caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7. A pro-apoptotic signal culminates in activation of an initiator caspase, which, in turn, activates effector caspases (6Thornberry N. Lazebnik Y.

There are two well characterized signal pathways leading to the activation of caspases, the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, death signals induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and the assembly of an apoptosome consisting of cytochrome c, adapter protein Apaf-1, and procaspase-9, triggering activation of caspase-9, which activates the effector caspases such as caspase-3, resulting in cleavage of a broad spectrum of cellular targets and leading ultimately to apoptosis (8Green D.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Among the most important regulators of caspases are the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IAPinhibitor of apoptosis proteinXIAPX-linked IAPBIRbaculovirus IAP repeatSmacsecond mitochondria-derived activator of caspasesDIABLOdirect IAP-binding protein with low PIMTSmitochondrial targeting sequenceHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinUbubiquitinFBSfetal bovine serumMEFsmouse embryonic fibroblastsHRPhorseradish peroxidaseECLenhanced chemiluminescencemAbmonoclonal antibodyGSTglutathione S-transferaseMG132carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinalIBMIAP-binding motifRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRPBSphosphate-buffered salineHEKhuman embryonic kidneySTAstaurosporineE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseCDDPcisplatin.1The abbreviations used are: IAPinhibitor of apoptosis proteinXIAPX-linked IAPBIRbaculovirus IAP repeatSmacsecond mitochondria-derived activator of caspasesDIABLOdirect IAP-binding protein with low PIMTSmitochondrial targeting sequenceHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinUbubiquitinFBSfetal bovine serumMEFsmouse embryonic fibroblastsHRPhorseradish peroxidaseECLenhanced chemiluminescencemAbmonoclonal antibodyGSTglutathione S-transferaseMG132carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinalIBMIAP-binding motifRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRPBSphosphate-buffered salineHEKhuman embryonic kidneySTAstaurosporineE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseCDDPcisplatin.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). The first IAP was discovered in baculoviruses (11Crook N. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and many cellular IAP orthologues have since been found in a number of species, ranging from insects to humans (9Salvesen G. Duckett C. Nat.

Eight IAPs have been identified in mammalian cells to date (9Salvesen G. Duckett C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 10Deveraux Q. Reed J.C.

The anti-apoptotic activity of IAPs, including XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and ML-IAP, has been attributed to their ability to bind to and inhibit caspases (13Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 14Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Of these IAPs, XIAP is the most potent inhibitor of caspases and apoptosis (12Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 13Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). XIAP is structurally characterized by three tandem repeats of the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain at its NH2 terminus and a COOH-terminal RING finger domain. The inhibitory activity is mediated through the BIR domains. Different BIR domains have been shown to exhibit distinct functions. The second BIR (BIR2) domain together with the immediately proceeding linker region is responsible for binding to and inhibition of active, processed caspase-3 and -7 (15Takahashi R. Deveraux Q.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), whereas the third BIR (BIR3) domain is involved in interacting with and suppressing caspase-9 (16Deveraux Q.

Like many RING domain-containing proteins, several IAPs, including XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, serve as ubiquitin ligases toward themselves and other target proteins, which are subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome (18Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 19Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Protein ubiquitination and degradation are subject to tight control (22Pickart C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how the auto-ubiquitination and degradation of IAPs are regulated.The caspase-inhibiting activities of IAPs can be relieved by a mitochondrial protein named Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) (23Du C. Fang M. Li Y.-L. L Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar), also known as DIABLO (direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) (24Verhagen A.

Similar to cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO is encoded by a nuclear gene and is subsequently compartmentalized in mitochondria. Upon receiving pro-apoptotic signals, Smac/DIABLO is released from mitochondria into the cytosol where it interacts with IAPs (XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and ML-IAP) and abrogates their caspase inhibitory activity, thereby potentiating apoptosis (23Du C.

MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is proapoptotic despite its inability to bind IAP in cells (30Roberts D. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the detailed mechanism by which Smac/DIABLO acts to enhance apoptosis remains to be fully elucidated. Besides antagonizing the caspase-inhibiting activity, it remains to be elucidated whether Smac/DIABLO and/or its isoform(s) are involved in the regulation of XIAP ubiquitination and stability.Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel splicing variant of the Smac/DIABLO family designated Smac3. Smac3 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Smac3 is localized to mitochondria and can be released into the cytosol during apoptosis. Smac3 is able to interact with XIAP. By binding to XIAP, Smac3 disrupts the association between XIAP and processed caspase-9, facilitates the activation of caspase-3, and antagonizes the anti-apoptotic function of XIAP. Most importantly, our results indicate that Smac3, but not Smac/DIABLO, promotes XIAP ubiquitination and destruction. Our study suggests that Smac3 is functionally additive to, but independent of, Smac/DIABLO and Smac-S/-β. Smac3 is the first molecule identified in mammalian cells to participate in the regulation of XIAP stability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs—To create full-length Smac3 with a COOH-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), PCR amplification was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with the following primers. The forward primer 5′-AAGGGATCCGCCACCATGGCGGCTCTGAAGAGTTGGC-3′ contains a BamHI site (underlined) and a translation initiation codon (in boldface). The reverse primer 5′-ATGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAATCCTCACGCAGGTAGGCCTC-3′ contains an XhoI site (underlined), a translation stop codon (in boldface), and a 27-bp sequence encoding an HA tag (in italics). pcDNA3-Smac3/HA was then generated by subcloning the PCR product into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. pcDNA3-Smac3 and pcDNA3-mature Smac3/HA were constructed by the same strategy. The construct pCMV-Smac3/FLAG expressing full-length Smac3 with FLAG tag at its COOH terminus was generated by cloning the PCR product into p3xFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma). cDNA encoding residues 1–53 of Smac3 was generated by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). To create a vector expressing mature Smac3 with a COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag, the sequence encompassing mature Smac3 was generated by PCR and subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-30c(+) (Novagen). To make a construct expressing mature Smac3 with an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag, the sequence encompassing mature Smac3 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET-30c(+). To construct vectors to produce different XIAP fragments in bacteria, the BIR1 (residues 1–124), BIR2 (residues 123–235), and BIR3 (residues 236–358) cDNAs were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences).

Human MCF7 breast cancer cells and Jurkat T leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. HeLa cells and Smac–/– MEFs were transfected by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 293T cells were transfected by either LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus) or calcium phosphate precipitation method.Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h at 4 °C. The debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble fractions were recovered, and proteins were quantified using the Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Cellular proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad) or a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following blocking, the membrane was incubated with an appropriate primary antibody and then incubated with a corresponding sheep anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were developed by ECL or ECL Plus method (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used in this study included the following: anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA mAb (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science), anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma), anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Clontech), antibody specific for ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-caspase-9 cleavage site 315/316 antibody (BIOSOURCE International Inc.), anti-caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-caspase-3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-XIAP mAb (Transduction Laboratories), anti-cytochrome c mAb (clone 7H8.2C12, Pharmingen), and anti-Smac polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.).Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (38Deshpande R. Woods T.L. Fu J. Zhang T. Stoll S.W. Elder J.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 477-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The precleared supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), anti-Myc mAb conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA mAb conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 4 h or overnight with constant agitation. The immunoprecipitated materials were analyzed by Western blotting.Far Western Blotting—Affinity-purified recombinant GST-XIAP fragments were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Proteins were denatured by incubating the membrane for 1 h at ambient temperature in denaturation buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 6 m guanidine HCl. Proteins were then renatured by several washes of the membrane using gradual reduction of guanidine HCl to 0.3 m. The membrane was incubated in the same buffer at 4 °C overnight. After blocking, the membrane was incubated with whole cell extract of 293T cells expressing Smac3/HA overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with an anti-HA mAb.Immunostaining—HeLa cells were transfected with a construct for Smac3/HA. Twenty four to 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated for 12–16 h with 30 μm cisplatin (Sigma), 50 μm etoposide (Sigma), 500 μm H2O2 (Sigma), 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody (clone CH11, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in PBST (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 5–10 min at room temperature, and then blocked in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with an anti-HA polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Following extensive washing with PBST, cells were probed with an anti-cytochrome c mAb (clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were visualized by a laser scanning confocal microscope system (Leica).Cycloheximide Experiment—Two or three μg of XIAP construct was cotransfected into 293T cells grown onto 60-mm plates with equal amounts of Smac3/FLAG, Smac/FLAG, or empty vector. After 36 h, cells from each transfection were equally split into multiple plates and cultured overnight. Cells were then treated with 30 μg/ml of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated time points, when cells were harvested. Cellular extracts were normalized for total protein content and subjected to immunoblotting using antisera recognizing Myc for XIAP and FLAG for Smac3 or Smac. The blot was stripped and re-probed with anti-β-actin as the loading control.Reverse Transcription-PCR—For cloning of Smac3, total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Five μg of total RNA was utilized to synthesize the first strand cDNA using the primer specific for Smac with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 1 time at 94 °C for 45 s, 30 times (94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s), and 1 time 72 °C for 10 min.

Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After an additional 4 h of growth at 30 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml lysozyme). Cells were then sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), recombinant proteins were eluted in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5 m imidazole). Proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm KCl.GST Pull-down Assay—About 2–4 μg each of a recombinant IAP fragment was bound to 20 μl of glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-blocked in PBS containing 0.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with an equal amount of recombinant Smac3 protein at 4 °C overnight in 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Alternatively, ∼2 μg each of recombinant GST fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione beads was incubated with 500 μg of cell extract from 293T cells transfected with wild-type or mutant Smac3/FLAG at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with wash buffer containing 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the complex was eluted with SDS sample buffer and visualized by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining or detected by Western blotting.In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—In vivo ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (35Treier M.

We used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the transmembrane segment residues and reaction with the thiol-reactive drug substrate analog of rhodamine, methane-thiosulfonate-rhodamine (MTS-rhodamine), to test whether P-gp could be trapped in an activated state with high levels of ATPase activity. The presence of such an activated P-gp could be used to further investigate P-gp-drug substrate interactions. Single cysteine mutants (149) were treated with MTS-rhodamine, and ATPase activities were determined after removal of unreacted MTS-rhodamine. One mutant, F343C(TM6), showed a 5.8-fold increase in activity after reaction with MTS-rhodamine. Pre-treatment of mutant F343C with rhodamine B protected it from activation by MTS-rhodamine, indicating that residue Cys-343 contributes to the rhodamine-binding site. The ATPase activity of MTS-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C, however, was not stimulated further by colchicine or calcein-AM. By contrast, verapamil and Hoechst 33342 stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the ATPase activity of the MTS-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C. These results indicate that the MTS-rhodamine binding site overlaps that of colchicine and calcein-AM but not that of verapamil and Hoechst 33342 within the common drug-binding pocket.

Because P-gp expression is relatively higher in organs such as the liver, kidney, intestines, and blood-brain/testis barrier, it has been postulated that P-gp likely protects the organism from cytotoxic agents in the environment and diet (3.Loo T.W.

Studies on deletion mutants have shown that the TM domains alone are sufficient for drug binding (32.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

This result is consistent with the observation that P-gp interacts with drug substrates that are in the lipid bilayer (33.Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol.

A method to map the location of the drug-binding sites is to use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis followed by reaction with thiol-reactive analogs of drug substrates (20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Identification of sites that cause permanent activation of ATPase activity are particularly informative because a key step in the transport cycle is stimulation of ATPase activity upon drug-binding. We showed previously that P-gp was permanently activated when residue I306C(TM6) was modified by MTS-verapamil (42.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of residues in the TM segments and reaction with MTS-rhodamine to determine whether covalent modification of any cysteine residue would permanently activate P-gp ATPase activity. Construction of Mutants—An active histidine-tagged P-gp without Cys was constructed by replacing the seven endogenous cysteines (positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227) with alanines (9.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 43.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the histidine tag facilitated purification of P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (44.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mutant P-gps containing a cysteine residue within the predicted TM segments were constructed as described previously (20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Expression of P-gp Cysteine Mutants, Reaction with MTS-rhodamine, Purification, and Measurement of Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity— For each P-gp mutant, 50 plates (10-cm diameter) of HEK 293 cells were transfected with mutant cDNA. After 24 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later, washed three times with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and suspended in phosphate buffered saline. The cells were solubilized at 4 °C by the addition of one volume (0.75 ml) of phosphate buffered saline containing 2%(w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. After 15 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a DNA Miniprep microfuge column (Qiagen) to remove any DNA. The flow-through material was divided and incubated for 15 min at 21 °C in the presence of no drug, 10 mm colchicine, or 10 mm verapamil (in the protection experiments), in 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (to test whether activation was caused by disulfide bond formation) or 0.2 mm sodium vanadate plus 10 mm ATP plus 20 mm MgCl2 (to test for vanadate trapping of nucleotide). The samples were then treated with 0 to 2 mm MTS-rhodamine (Toronto Research Chemicals) for 15 min at 21 °C. The samples were cooled in an ice bath for 10 min and then mixed with 0.15 ml of 3 m NaCl and 0.05 ml of 1 m imidazole, pH 7.0. P-gp(His)10 was then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (44.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The recovery of P-gp was monitored by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody (45.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 46.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The isolated P-gp(His)10 was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S; Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The P-gp and lipid mixture was sonicated, and a sample of the mixture was incubated with an equal volume of ATPase buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and either no drug substrate, 0 to 6 mm MTS-rhodamine, 1 mm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon), 2 mm verapamil, 10 mm colchicine, or 1 mm Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). These concentrations of substrates caused maximal stimulation or inhibition of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (47.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Effect of Rhodamine on Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—The cDNA for mutant L531C/C1074 was expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of cyclosporin A (16.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as described previously (48.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For disulfide cross-linking analysis, aliquots of membranes were added to equal volumes of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 with or without 1 mm rhodamine B. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for various intervals, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp and enhanced chemiluminescence. P-gp contains 12 TM segments (Fig. 1A) that contribute to the formation of the common drug-binding pocket. Cross-linking studies with thiol-reactive substrates as molecular rulers indicate that the binding pocket has a funnel/cone shape, with the cytoplasmic ends of the TMs being closer together than the extracellular ends (25.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). TM segments 4–6 from the NH2-half of P-gp along with TMs 9–12 from the COOH-half of P-gp appear to line the drug-binding pocket (20.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the TM segments followed by reaction with the thiol-reactive analog of rhodamine, MTS-rhodamine, to map the drug-binding site (22.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Of the 252 mutants analyzed, the activities of five mutants (I340C(TM6), A841C(TM9), L975(TM12), V981C (TM12) and V982C(TM12)) were protected by rhodamine B from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine. The locations of these residues are shown in Fig. 1A. An interesting aspect that was not measured in that study was activation of ATPase activity caused by labeling with MTS-rhodamine. To detect activation of ATPase activity, we treated the single cysteine mutants in TMs 4–6 and 9–12 with or without MTS-rhodamine after solubilization with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. P-gp(His)10 was then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography to remove unreacted MTS-rhodamine. Fig. 3 shows that Cys-less P-gp showed no difference in ATPase activity when it was treated with or without MTS-rhodamine and then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. This result shows that unreacted MTS-rhodamine was effectively removed by chromatography. The ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp is stimulated 6-fold in the presence of MTS-rhodamine (22.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the activity can be stimulated with an MTS-rhodamine concentration as low as 50 μm. To test whether covalent modification of any cysteine residue in the drug-binding pocket resulted in enhanced ATPase activity, 149 single cysteine mutants (a cysteine at each position in TMs 4–6 and 9–12) were expressed in HEK 293 cells, solubilized, and treated with or without 2 mm MTS-rhodamine. The mutant P-gps were then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The predicted boundaries of the TM segments are K213 to A233 (TM4), T294 to Y316 (TM5), Q330 to P350 (TM6), R832 to F851 (TM9), W855 to E875 (TM10), H936 to F957 (TM11), and V974 to F994 (TM12). The isolated P-gp mutants were mixed with lipid and sonicated, and the ATPase activities measured in the absence of drug substrate. The recovery of P-gp(His)10 after nickel-chelate chromatography was monitored by immunoblot analysis. Treatment of P-gp mutants with MTS-rhodamine before nickel-chelate chromatography did not affect recovery of the protein (data not shown). Only one mutant, F343C(TM6) was found to have increased ATPase activity (5.8-fold) after reaction with MTS-rhodamine, with maximum stimulation occurring after treatment with 1–3 mm MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 2). The covalent attachment of MTS-rhodamine to Cys-343 seems to mimic the interaction of MTS-rhodamine with Cys-less P-gp, because maximal stimulation of mutant F343C by MTS-rhodamine was 5.8-fold, whereas that of Cys-less P-gp was about 6.2-fold. Therefore, it is unlikely that labeling of mutant F343C by MTS-rhodamine is coincidental. It is likely a reflection of its natural binding position in P-gp. We then determined whether attachment of MTS-rhodamine to Cys-343 overlapped the binding sites of other drug substrates. The rationale is that substrates will not affect the activity of the MTS-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C if they occupy the same binding site as rhodamine but will further stimulate or inhibit the activity if their binding sites are distinct from that of rhodamine. Accordingly, mutant F343C was purified by nickel-chelate chromatography after incubation with or without 2 mm MTS-rhodamine, mixed with lipid and assayed for ATPase activity in the presence of different drug substrates. Fig. 3 shows that in the absence of substrate, covalent modification of F343C resulted in a 5.8-fold increase in activity over that of the untreated mutant F343C. The activity of untreated mutant F343C in the presence of calcein-AM or colchicine was stimulated 12- or 9.2-fold, respectively. Both calcein-AM and colchicine, however, did not affect the ATPase activity of the MTS-rhodamine-treated mutant (5.9- and 5.8-fold stimulation, respectively). In contrast, covalent modification of Cys-343 with MTS-rhodamine had little effect on the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. In the presence of verapamil, the MTS-rhodamine-labeled and untreated mutants F343C were stimulated 9.9- and 10.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). The drug substrate Hoechst 33342 inhibits the ATPase activity of P-gp (27.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 49.Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Hoechst 33342 would affect the activity of the MTS-rhodamine-labeled F343C mutant. It inhibited the ATPase activities of both labeled and untreated mutants. These results suggest that labeling of Cys-343 with MTS-rhodamine prevents binding of calcein-AM or colchicine or that the rhodamine-binding site overlaps that of calcein-AM and colchicine. The binding sites for verapamil and Hoechst 33342, however, do not overlap that of rhodamine because they still modulated the ATPase activity of the labeled mutant. We then tested whether drug substrates could protect mutant F343C from modification by MTS-rhodamine. The rationale is that the presence of another drug substrate in the rhodamine-binding site will prevent mutant F343C from being labeled by MTS-rhodamine. Similarly, if the binding site of the drug substrate is distinct from that of rhodamine, then mutant F343C should still be labeled by MTS-rhodamine in the presence of these substrates. These protection experiments usually require 10- to 100-fold excess of the protecting substrate, and efficient protection is limited by solubility of the compound. Therefore, colchicine and verapamil were used in these experiments because they have relatively high solubility in aqueous solutions. Accordingly, mutant F343C was pre-incubated with 10 mm colchicine, 10 mm verapamil, 3 mm rhodamine B, or no drug substrates, treated with or without 1 mm MTS-rhodamine and then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The presence of colchicine or rhodamine B prevented MTS-rhodamine activation of mutant F343C (5.8-fold) by 77% (2-fold) and 60% (2.8-fold), respectively. A higher level of protection would have been expected with rhodamine B, but this may be due to the low concentration of rhodamine B that had to be used. The solubility limit of rhodamine B in aqueous solution is about 3 mm. Labeling of mutant F343C by MTS-rhodamine, however, showed little protection with verapamil. The mutant retained more than 90% of its activity when labeling was carried out in the presence of verapamil. The disulfide bond between MTS-rhodamine and Cys-343 could be reduced with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The presence of the reducing agent inhibited activation of mutant F343C by MTS-rhodamine by more than 80% (Fig. 4). The characteristics of the ATPase activity of MTS-rhodamine-labeled mutant F343C were also examined. We tested for vanadate trapping of nucleotide. Trapping of nucleotide in the presence of vanadate plus Mg-ATP at one nucleotide-binding site resulted in the formation of a transition state and inhibition of ATP hydrolysis at the second nucleotide-binding site (50.Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that vanadate trapping inhibits the activity of the activated F343C mutant. Labeling of mutant F343C did not appear to affect the affinity of the enzyme for ATP. The modified mutant had a Km for ATP that was very similar to that of Cys-less P-gp (1.1 mm) (data not shown). Compounds that stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp cause conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) such that the Walker A consensus site for nucleotide binding in one NBD is brought closer to the “LSGGQ” signature sequence in the second NBD (27.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For example, verapamil-induced conformational change can be monitored by the rate of cross-linking between a cysteine introduced into NBD1 “LSGGQ” site (L531C) and the endogenous cysteine in the NBD2 Walker A site (C1074). The rhodamine- and verapamil-binding sites do not appear to overlap in the common drug-binding pocket. Therefore, we tested whether binding of rhodamine also caused long-range conformational changes in the NBDs. Rhodamine B, instead of MTS-rhodamine, was used to test the effect on cross-linking of mutant L531C/C1074 because MTS-rhodamine could potentially react with the cysteines in the NBDs. Accordingly, membranes were prepared from cells expressing mutant L531C/C1074 and incubated with or without 1 mm rhodamine B at 4 °C in the presence of oxidant (1 mm copper phenanthroline). The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cross-linked P-gp migrates with a slower mobility in SDS-PAGE gels (51.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that rhodamine B promoted cross-linking of mutant L531C/C1074. In the absence of drug substrate, only a small amount of cross-linked product was detected after 32 min. In the presence of rhodamine B, however, more than 50% of the mutant protein was cross-linked P-gp after 16 min. These results indicate that occupation of the rhodamine-binding site also induces long-range conformational changes in the NBDs. Covalent attachment of a single molecule of MTS-rhodamine was sufficient to activate the ATPase activity of mutant F343C(TM6). Activation of ATPase activity by MTS-rhodamine was quite specific because enhanced ATPase activity was observed in only 1 of 149 mutants that were tested. Labeling of the mutant resulted in an uncoupled transporter, such that ATP was constantly hydrolyzed at an increased rate in the absence of vectorial transport. It is interesting that residue F343C is on the same face of the TM6 α-helix as residue I340C (Fig. 6A). Labeling of I340C with MTS-rhodamine, however, resulted in inhibition of ATPase activity (22.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Rhodamine B also protected I340C from labeling by MTS-rhodamine, indicating that this residue must be close to rhodamine-binding site. Therefore, rhodamine must adopt a specific orientation to stimulate ATPase activity. Covalent modification of I340C may prevent P-gp from undergoing conformational changes during the transport cycle. Two observations suggest that MTS-rhodamine attached to F343C mimics the interaction of rhodamine compounds with P-gp. First, the ATPase activity of MTS-rhodamine-labeled F343C (5.8-fold) is similar to that observed with MTS-rhodamine and Cys-less P-gp (6.2-fold). Second, rhodamine B protected mutant F343C from labeling by MTS-rhodamine. Calcein-AM and colchicine did not affect the activity of MTS-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C. This suggests that the rhodamine-binding site must overlap those of calcein-AM and colchicine. Another explanation is that both calcein-AM and colchicine were not able to induce any further conformational change in the mutant after labeling with MTS-rhodamine. We had previously shown that drug substrates induce conformational changes in the TM segments upon binding (26.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Verapamil, however, was able to further stimulate the activity of the MTS-rhodamine treated mutant F343C indicating that verapamil could still bind to the mutant protein. It is unlikely that verapamil increased activity by binding to unlabeled mutant F343C because labeling of mutant F343C by MTS-rhodamine was saturable (Fig. 2). We also found that subjecting MTS-rhodamine treated F343C to a second round of labeling with MTS-rhodamine did not increase ATPase activity (data not shown). Therefore, the binding sites for rhodamine and verapamil must be separate in the common drug-binding pocket (Fig. 6B). This finding is consistent with cross-linking data on P-gp. Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA) is a homotrifunctional disulfide cross-linker and a substrate of P-gp (52.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) by TMEA was enhanced by the presence of verapamil. Cross-linking also resulted in inhibition of ATPase activity, indicating that both substrates could simultaneously bind P-gp and that ATPase activity requires conformational changes such as rotation (30.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and displacement of TM6 and/or TM12 (52.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The common drug-binding pocket is funnel-shaped and must have a finite volume (25.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 53.Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be a limit on the size of compounds (25.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) that can fit into the drug-binding pocket and how far apart the distinct drug-binding sites can be in this pocket. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) multidrug transporter Pdr5p has been reported to show a strong size dependence for transport of substrate that is independent of hydrophobicity (54.Golin J. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Habib A.D. Sczepanski J. Ziccardi W. May L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5963-5969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the verapamil- and rhodamine-binding sites appear to be separate, they must be close together. When residues in the TM segments of P-gp were mutated to cysteine and labeled with the thiol-reactive analog of verapamil, MTS-verapamil, only one mutant I306C(TM5) was permanently activated (42.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TMs 5 and 6 are likely next to each other because both TMs are separated by only 16 amino acids. There is no detailed structural information available for P-gp, but a comparison can be made to the crystal structure of bacterial ABC transporter MsbA (55.Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). MsbA is a lipid transporter, and substrate-stimulated ATPase activity has been demonstrated (56.Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In MsbA, TMs 5 and 6 are indeed next to each other. In disulfide cross-linking studies, we have shown that a residue in both TMs 5 and 6 could be cross-linked to a residue in TM12. I306C(TM5) was cross-linked to V982C(TM12) with a homobifunctional MTS cross-linker with a spacer arm of at least 13 Å (25.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, F343C(TM6) could be cross-linked to V982C(TM12) with TMEA that has a spacer arm of 10 Å (52.Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the verapamil- and rhodamine-binding sites are close to each other in the common drug-binding pocket. There is no high-resolution crystal structure of an ABC-type multidrug transporter. The crystal structures of several drug-binding regulatory proteins such as the Bacillus subtilis transcriptional activator BmrR (57.Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the human nuclear receptor PXR (58.Watkins R.E. Wisely G.B. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Lambert M.H. Williams S.P. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Redinbo M.R. Science. 2001; 292: 2329-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), and Staphylococcus aureus repressor QacR (59.Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) that have bound substrates, however, have been reported. For QacR, the crystal structures of six QacR-drug complexes were determined. The structures revealed the presence of separate but linked binding sites within one extended, multifaceted drug-binding domain (59.Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the PXR receptor, the ligand can assume multiple orientations in occupying a large binding pocket. It is possible that substrates of P-gp could also bind in more than one orientation in the common drug-binding pocket, but only some orientations may induce conformational changes in P-gp. This may explain why both F343C and I340C can be labeled with MTS-rhodamine, but only F343C is activated upon labeling. In summary, labeling studies with MTS-rhodamine and MTS-verapamil show that these molecules interact with distinct binding sites in the common drug-binding pocket. Further labeling studies with other thiol-reactive substrates will be needed to test for the presence of additional binding sites."

HPSE activity has also been directly correlated with pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis and autoimmune disease. The tight regulation of HPSE expression and function is critical to ensure homeostasis of the normal physiological processes to which it contributes and to prevent imbalance toward pathological situations. Little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate HPSE expression. In this study we have shown human HPSE gene transcription in Jurkat T cells is induced upon activation. Functional analysis of the HPSE promoter has identified a 280-bp region that is highly inducible. Mutation studies together with supershift experiments have identified a 4-bp motif that binds the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr1) and is critical in regulating inducible HPSE gene transcription. Furthermore, the overexpression of Egr1 resulted in the enhanced activation of the HPSE promoter. By using MAPK pathway inhibitors, we have also shown that inducible expression of HPSE mRNA and the activity of the 280-bp HPSE promoter element are dependent on the ERK1/2 (MEK1/2) pathway. This pathway is critical for induction of Egr1 expression at both the mRNA and protein level in T cells, an observation that provides further support to Egr1 playing an important role as a key activator of HPSE expression. In addition, HPSE and Egr1 were shown to co-localize by immunohistochemistry to invading mononuclear leukocytes in actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats. These findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms controlling inducible transcription of the HPSE gene, and could represent an important lead into understanding how HPSE expression is deregulated in metastatic tumor cells.

They comprise a protein core covalently linked to linear chains of the complex sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS) (1.Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

The HS side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans mediate the assembly and stability of the ECM through interactions with the various matrix components (e.g. collagen, laminin, and fibronectin) (1.Kjellen L.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The β-d-endoglycosidase heparanase (HPSE) cleaves HS and facilitates the degradation of the ECM and the release of HS-bound growth factors (6.Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin.

Heparanase is a normal constituent of activated leukocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cytotrophoblasts; however, its expression is also “hijacked” by metastatic tumor cells (6.Vlodavsky I.

The level of HPSE activity expressed by many of these cell types correlates with their activated or invasive states, and as such HPSE has been implicated in many important physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation, wound healing, embryonic development, angiogenesis, and metastasis (6.Vlodavsky I.

Northern blot analysis has identified two major HPSE mRNA transcripts, a 1.7-kb mRNA expressed only in immune tissues and placenta, and a 5-kb mRNA that shows similar distribution but is also expressed at low levels in most non-immune tissues (18.Hulett M.D. Freeman C.

For example, T cells have been shown to secrete high levels of HPSE activity only upon activation when they are required to migrate to a site of inflammation (27.Vlodavsky I. Eldor A.

A number of points of control of HPSE function are possible, including regulation at the transcriptional level, as well as in the translation, processing, and activity of the enzyme. Advances have been made in understanding the processing of the proenzyme (11.Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L.

Recently it was suggested that transcription factors of the Sp1 and ETS families play a role in controlling the basal activity of human HPSE gene expression (33.Lu W.C. Liu Y.N. Kang B.B. Chen J.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34.Jiang P. Kumar A. Parrillo J.E. Dempsey L.A. Platt J.L. Prinz R.A. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8989-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the mechanisms that may regulate inducible transcription of the HPSE gene. In this study we have shown that human HPSE transcription is induced upon activation of T cells. Furthermore, we have functionally analyzed the HPSE promoter in T cells and identified the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr1) as critical in binding to a specific element in the HPSE promoter and regulating inducible transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRACE-PCR—5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on human leukocyte Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the human HPSE-specific oligonucleotide primers P7R 5′-GTCCTGTGCTTGCGCAGGTCG-3 and Hep15L 5′-CCTCAGGTACGCAGGAGACAAG-3′.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 270 V and 975 capacitance with 5 μg of reporter construct being transfected per 5 × 106 cells. For the co-transfection experiments, a constant amount of total DNA was used, i.e. when decreasing amounts of pCB6-Egr1 were transfected, the balance was made up by using the backbone construct, pCB6+. After electroporation, cells were rested for 24 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) and 1 μm calcium ionophore (IO) (Sigma). Cell lysates were harvested after 24 h by three rounds of freezing/thawing, and 40 μg of total protein was used for luciferase assays according to a method published previously (35.Wood K.V. Stanley P. Cricka L. Chemiluminescence: Current Status. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 543Google Scholar). Light emission was measured using a Packard Top Count Luminescence Counter.Plasmid Constructs—Fragments of the human HPSE gene promoter (282 and 1399 bp) were amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA that had been purified from blood using JetQuick as per the manufacturer's instructions (Genomed, Research Triangle Park, NC). Oligonucleotide primers HHP1 and HHP3 or HHP1 and HHP6 were used to amplify the 282- or 1399-bp, fragments, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers HHP1 and HHP12 were used to amplify the 116-bp fragment using the construct, pXP-1/280 bp, as a template. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used are as follows: HHP1, 5′-TTCGAGCGCAGCAGCATC-3′; HHP12, 5′-AGGAGAAAAGGGCGCTGG-3′; HHP3, 5′-GTAAGTGAACGTGACC-3; and HHP6, 5′-TTAGATCTACATGATCACATGCCTGAGC-3′. The amplified fragments, either 1399, 282, or 116 bp, were cloned into the KpnI, BglII, or BamHI/XhoI sites, respectively, in the luciferase reporter construct pXP-1 (a gift of Dr. Frances Shannon, JCSMR, ANU, Canberra, Australia) to generate the pXP-1/1300bp, pXP-1/280bp, and pXP-1/120bp constructs, respectively. The pXP-1/1300bp construct was digested with XhoI to remove the 5′ end of the sequence and then re-ligated to produce the pXP-1/520bp construct containing a 509-bp promoter fragment. The Egr1 mutant construct, pXP-1/280bpMUT, was generated by splice overlap extension-PCR by mutating the core sequence of the putative Egr1-binding site GGCG motif to TTAT using the pXP-1/280bp construct as a template. Briefly two PCRs were performed to generate overlapping 5′ and 3′ fragments encoding each mutation, which were then spliced together in a third PCR. The oligonucleotide primers used to generate these fragments were MEGRT-1 and HHP1 or MEGRT-2 and HHP3. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers MEGRT-1 and MEGRT-2 were 5′-GGTGAGGATTATAACGGGGCGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCGTTAATAATCCTCACCCCTC-3′, respectively. The nucleotide integrity of all clones was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 377 sequencer. The pCB6-Egr1 expression vector, encoding rat Egr1, and the backbone pCB6+ were kind gifts of Dr. Vikas Sukhatme (Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School).Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed on Jurkat T cells that were either unstimulated, stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm IO for 1, 3, 24, or 48 h, or preincubated with either 30 μm PD98059 (Cell Signaling Technology™), 1 μm SB202190 (A. G. Scientific, Inc.), or both for 30 min prior to PMA and IO stimulation. Western blotting was used to detect Egr1 and Sp1 in nuclear extracts using commercial rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Egr1 or Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following the protocol described previously (36.Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Kavurma M.M. Chesterman C.N. Baker A. Atkins D.G. Khachigian L.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence was detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Extraction and Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Jurkat T cells (1 × 106 cells) that were unstimulated or stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm IO, using Trizol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 1 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). SYBR Green (Qiagen) real time PCRs were performed using a ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturers guidelines. For amplification of HPSE or Egr1 cDNA, primers were designed over intron/exon boundaries to prevent amplification of genomic DNA. Primer concentration and PCR conditions were optimized, and the final concentration used for all primers was 0.5 μm under the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The sequences of primers used for detection of HPSE cDNA were HEPRT3, 5′-GTTCCTGTCCGTCACCATTGA-3′, and HEPRT4, 5′-CTTGGAGAACCCAGGAGGAT-3′, and for the Egr1 cDNA were HEGR1-RT7, 5′-AGCACCTGACCGCAGAGTC-3′, and HEGR1RT8, 5′-CTCCACCAGCACCTTCTCG-3. A dissociation curve was performed after each experiment to confirm a single product was amplified. A standard curve was generated for both HPSE and Egr1 using known copy numbers of a plasmid containing the cDNA specific to the gene. This standard curve was then used to convert the Ct value of the sample to copy number of mRNA. An aliquot of each sample was also analyzed using the same method to detect ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) E2D 2 copy number. This was used for the normalization for variations in RNA input and cDNA synthesis, as the expression of UBC mRNA was determined to remain unchanged over time upon Jurkat T cell stimulation, in contrast to the expression of standard housekeeping genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin which showed marked induction. 2A. de Mestre, manuscript in preparation. The primers used to detect UBC cDNA are UBC1 5′-TGAAGAGAATCCACAAGGAATTGA-3′ and UBC2 5′-CAACAGGACCTGCTGAACACTG-3′.Nuclear Extraction and EMSA—Jurkat T cells stimulated previously with 20 ng/ml PMA, 1 μm IO, or both were harvested and washed in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extraction was then performed as described previously (37.Day F.L. Rafty L.A. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23726-23733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 104 to 1.5 × 104 cps of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)-poly(dI·dC), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. In antibody competition studies, 1 μl of either Egr1X-588 or YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the binding mixture for 15 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The samples were resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and then autoradiographed overnight. The nucleotide sequences of OligoA (38.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), hep, and mhep are 5′-GGGGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGAGGG-3′, 5′-GAGGGGTGAGGAGGCGTAACGGGGCGGAGG-3′, and 5′-GAGGGGTGAGGATTATTAACGGGGCGGAGG-3′, respectively.Induction of Active EAE and Immunohistochemistry—Lewis rats were immunized with 25 μg of myelin basic protein in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 4 mg/ml Mycobacterium butyricum as described previously (39.Willenborg D.O. Staykova M.A. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar). At the clinical stage of EAE, lumbar spinal cords were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following antigen retrieval with citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 4-μm serial sections were stained for HPSE, Egr1, or assessed for nonspecific binding, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat HPSE (generous gift of Dr. Craig Freeman, JCSMR, Canberra, Australia), Egr1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or the human testis specific four-transmembrane molecule TETM4 (40.Hulett M.D. Pagler E. Hornby J.R. Hogarth P.M. Eyre H.J. Baker E. Crawford J. Sutherland G.R. Ohms S.J. Parish C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively. Antibody binding was detected using the Dako LSAB-2 System HRP (Carpinteria, CA). Sections were counterstained with Gill's III hematoxylin.RESULTSHPSE Expression Is Induced by PMA and IO—In this study we selected Jurkat T cells as a model cell line to investigate the inducible expression of human HPSE. The agents used to activate the T cells were pharmacological agonists, PMA and IO, agonists that induce transcription factors typical of T cell activation. In initial experiments, HPSE mRNA expression in activated Jurkat T cells was quantified using real time RT-PCR. Jurkat T cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm IO for 8, 24, and 48 h. HPSE mRNA levels were up-regulated 8-fold compared with unstimulated cells at 24 h and 21-fold at 48 h (Fig. 1). This increase in HPSE mRNA expression correlates with the elevated HPSE activity observed in T cells activated physiologically (28.Naparstek Y. Cohen I.R. Fuks Z. Vlodavsky I. Nature. 1984; 310: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Identification of an Inducible cis-Responsive Element—Functional analysis of the human HPSE promoter was carried out to investigate the molecular basis of inducible transcriptional regulation of the HPSE gene. First, RACE-PCR was used to identify the transcription start site of the HPSE gene in human leukocytes. 5′-RACE-PCR using the HPSE antisense oligonucleotide primers P7R and hep15L on human leukocyte cDNA produced a PCR product of 212 bp which, when sequenced, indicated a transcription start site at nucleotide position 101 bp upstream of the ATG site. This is consistent with that reported previously for the transcription start site of the HPSE gene in tumor cell lines (11.Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 34.Jiang P. Kumar A. Parrillo J.E. Dempsey L.A. Platt J.L. Prinz R.A. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8989-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Four fragments of the promoter region, described relative to the transcription start site, i.e. –1281/+118 (1300 bp), –391/+118 (520 bp), –164/+118 (280 bp), and +3/+118 (120 bp) (Fig. 2A), were amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter construct pXP-1, and transient transfection analysis was performed. A time course was carried out to establish the optimal time to measure luciferase activity (data not shown), and the stimulation of cells with 20 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm IO for 24 h was chosen for all reporter studies as endogenous HPSE mRNA expression is induced and luciferase activity highly expressed under these conditions. By using this system, only the 280-bp fragment showed marked inducible luciferase activity after 24 h as opposed to the 1300-, 520-, and 120-bp fragments which had little inducible activity (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the 166-bp region at the 5′ end of the 280-bp fragment (i.e. –164 to +2 bp) contains a regulatory element that controls inducible transcription of the HPSE gene.Fig. 2Identification of an inducible cis-responsive element within the HPSE gene promoter.A, schematic of the varying lengths of HPSE promoter cloned into the luciferase reporter construct, pXP-1.

Here we show that the rupture of cytoplasmic membrane, the terminal event in necrosis, is shortly preceded by rapid depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. The rapid deenergization of mitochondria critically depended upon prior generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during ATP depletion stage. Accordingly, expression of catalase prevented mitochondrial depolarization and averted subsequent necrosis. Interestingly, trifluoperazine, a compound that protects cells from ischemic insults, prevented necrosis of H9c2 cells through inhibition of ROS production. Other factors that regulated the mitochondrial membrane depolarization and subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity include a stress kinase JNK activated at early steps of recovery from ATP depletion, as well as an apoptotic inhibitory protein ARC. Accordingly, inhibition of JNK or overexpression of ARC prevented mitochondrial depolarization and rescued H9c2 cells from necrosis. ROS and JNK affected mitochondrial deenergization and necrosis independently of each other since inhibition of ROS production did not prevent activation of JNK, whereas inhibition of JNK did not suppress ROS accumulation. Therefore, JNK activation and ROS production represent two independent pathways that control mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent necrosis of cells subjected to transient energy deprivation. Overexpression of ARC, although preventing mitochondrial depolarization, did not affect either JNK activation or production of ROS. The major heat shock protein Hsp72 inhibited JNK-related steps of necrotic pathway but did not affect ROS accumulation. Interestingly, mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent necrosis can be suppressed by an Hsp72 mutant Hsp72ΔEEVD, which lacks chaperone function but can efficiently suppress JNK activation. Thus, Hsp72 is directly implicated in a signaling pathway, which leads to necrotic death.

Thus, Hsp72 is directly implicated in a signaling pathway, which leads to necrotic death. Heart ischemia followed by reperfusion causes tissue damage due to both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Apoptosis is characterized by nuclear condensation, chromatin fragmentation, and breakdown of cells into multiple apoptotic bodies that retain membrane integrity. Research from many laboratories has established that apoptosis is a highly coordinated process subject to complex regulation (see e.g. Ref. 1.Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Necrosis, a morphologically distinct mode of cell death, is characterized by cell swelling, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and leakage of cellular constituents to the extracellular medium (2.Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In contrast to apoptotic cell death, necrosis was considered until recently to be an unregulated event triggered by severe stress that damages cells beyond their capability to repair. However, recently evidence started to emerge that under conditions of moderate stress that does not cause irreparable damage to cellular structures, cells could still die via necrosis (2.Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 3.Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This death appeared to be controlled by a specific program(s) that involves many signaling elements also implicated in early stages of apoptosis (for review see Ref. 3.Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). It appears that early events in these two modes of cell death could be the same, and signals bifurcate later leading to either apoptosis or necrosis. An interesting example of a regulated necrosis is death of cardiomyocytes after myocardial ischemia/reoxygenation. This type of cell death is associated with activation of stress kinases p38 and JNK. 1The abbreviations used are: JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMPTmitochondrial permeability transitionROSreactive oxygen speciesPIpropidium iodineTMRMtetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchloratePBSphosphate-buffered salineDHEdihydroethidiumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTFPtrifluoperazineCPZchlorpromazineAIFapoptosis-inducing factor.1The abbreviations used are: JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMPTmitochondrial permeability transitionROSreactive oxygen speciesPIpropidium iodineTMRMtetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchloratePBSphosphate-buffered salineDHEdihydroethidiumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTFPtrifluoperazineCPZchlorpromazineAIFapoptosis-inducing factor. Using isolated, Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, it was demonstrated that inhibition of p38 kinase with a pharmacological inhibitor SB 203580 greatly reduced not only myocardial apoptosis but also necrosis triggered by ischemia/reperfusion (4.Ma X.L. Kumar S. Gao F. Louden C.S. Lopez B.L. Christopher T.A. Wang C. Lee J.C. Feuerstein G.Z. Yue T.L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These results clearly implicated p38 kinase in execution of both apoptotic and necrotic modes of cell death. Similarly, ischemia/reperfusion of kidney resulted in activation of stress kinases p38 and JNK (5.Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Preconditioning of kidney by exposure to transient ischemia led to both suppression of JNK and p38 and reduction of necrosis triggered by a second more severe ischemic insult imposed 8–15 days later (5.Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate not only apoptotic mode of cell death but necrosis as well. c-Jun N-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitochondrial permeability transition reactive oxygen species propidium iodine tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate phosphate-buffered saline dihydroethidium green fluorescent protein trifluoperazine chlorpromazine apoptosis-inducing factor. c-Jun N-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitochondrial permeability transition reactive oxygen species propidium iodine tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate phosphate-buffered saline dihydroethidium green fluorescent protein trifluoperazine chlorpromazine apoptosis-inducing factor. Activation of three classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38, was observed in simulated myocardial ischemia in vitro, where primary cardiomyocytes or H9c2 myogenic cells were subjected to transient energy deprivation (6.Yue T.L.

Whether cells survive the treatment or die depends upon the intricate balance of the magnitude and duration of activation of individual kinases. ERK is generally implicated in cell survival, since specific inhibition of ERK dramatically decreased cell viability (6.Yue T.L. Wang C. Gu J.L. Ma X.L. Kumar S. Lee J.C. Feuerstein G.Z. Thomas H. Maleeff B. Ohlstein E.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Xia, Z., Dickens, M., Raingeaud, J., Davis, R. J., Greenberg, M. E.

In contrast, JNK and p38 appeared to promote cell death, since inhibition of these kinases led to cell protection (10.Stadheim T.A. Saluta G.R. Kucera G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11.Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A.

Prior data from this laboratory using H9c2 cells established that inhibition of ERK enhances while inhibition of JNK strongly reduces necrosis after transient energy deprivation, indicating that JNK activation facilitates this type of cell death (7.Gabai V.L.

In apoptosis, JNK promotes cell death most likely through phosphorylation and activation of a number of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members that serve as key regulators of programmed cell death (12.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar). For example, in tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis, JNK was shown to activate cleavage of BH3-only protein Bid, which stimulated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (13.Gabai V.L. Mabuchi K. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In UV-stimulated apoptosis, JNK phosphorylated a distinct set of BH3-only proteins, Bim and Bmf, which resulted in the Bax/Bak-dependent activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (14.Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). These data indicated that in the apoptotic pathway JNK acts upstream of mitochondria. However, the mechanism of involvement of JNK in regulation of cell necrosis is yet unclear. Mitochondria, being the source of both pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic factors (e.g. cytochrome c, Smac, or AIF), plays a key role in determining the fate of cells exposed to stress (15.Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). Release of these factors may be associated with the opening of a nonselective pore, known as mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore. Opening of the MPT pore, which could be regulated by Bcl2-related proteins, results in rapid uncoupling of mitochondria. In certain models MPT was implicated in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death (16.Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Cascio W.E. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For example, inhibition of MPT by cyclosporin A protected L929 cells from tumor necrosis factor-induced necrosis (17.Tafani M. Schneider T.G. Pastorino J.G. Farber J.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2111-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and primary rat hepatocytes from tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (18.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Ischemia/reperfusion-mediated cell death appeared to be associated with MPT opening since isolated hearts as well as cardiomyocytes can be protected from ischemia/reperfusion insult by the MPT inhibitor, cyclosporin A (19.Duchen M.R. McGuinness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20.Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the type of cell death, i.e. apoptosis or necrosis, that is suppressed by cyclosporin A was not specifically addressed in these works. More evidence for the role of mitochondria in regulation of cell death pathways comes from studies of the apoptotic regulatory protein ARC. ARC is specifically expressed in cells of myogenic origin, and its ectopic expression has a strong protective effect on cardiac cells under various types of deleterious conditions (22.Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius III, F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A.

Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Very importantly, overexpression of ARC prevented deenergization of mitochondrial membrane of H9c2 cells exposed to oxidative stress and potently rescued cells from necrotic-like death under these conditions (25.Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been implicated in both cell apoptosis and necrosis (2.Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 3.Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Indeed, in many systems it was shown that in the process of cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, and suppression of ROS production by anti-oxidants and the detoxifying enzymes catalase or superoxide dismutase has a protective effect (2.Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 3.Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, how ROS enhance cell death is yet unknown. The outcome of ischemic injury of cardiac cells also depends upon accumulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps), which are induced in response to ischemia or transient energy deprivation. Induction of Hsp72 and other Hsps was suggested to play an important role in preconditioning, a phenomenon of protection of a heart from strong ischemic insult by prior exposure to mild ischemia or other mild stresses. Importantly, it was demonstrated that both cardiomyocytes and isolated hearts could be protected from ischemic damage by adenovirus-mediated expression of Hsp72 (26.Mestril R. Giordano F.J. Conde A.G. Dillmann W.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2351-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Okubo S. Wildner O. Shah M.R. Chelliah J.C. Hess M.L. Kukreja R.C. Circulation. 2001; 103: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutive expression of Hsp72 in transgenic animals strongly enhanced functional recovery and reduced infarct size in hearts after transient ischemia (28.Plumier J.C. Ross B.M. Currie R.W. Angelidis C.E. Kazlaris H. Kollias G. Pagoulatos G.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1854-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 29.Hutter J.J. Mestril R. Tam E.K. Sievers R.E.

Sherry A.D. Malloy L.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Hsp72-mediated cardio-protection is not well understood. Energy-deprived ischemic cells accumulate misfolded proteins, and Hsps, being molecular chaperones, can assist in their refolding or rapid degradation (31.Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Heat Shock Proteins and Cytoprotection: ATP-deprived Mammalian Cells. R. G. Landes Co, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to their function as molecular chaperones Hsps also can directly interfere with signaling events that trigger apoptotic program, for example, through suppression of activation of JNK or p38. This effect of Hsp72 on suppression of stress kinases was shown to play an important role in prevention of necrosis of H9c2 cells after transient ATP depletion (7.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that execution of both apoptotic and necrotic modes of cell death depends upon many signaling events, such as activation of stress kinases, depolarization of mitochondria, generation of ROS, and induction of heat shock proteins. However, in contrast to apoptosis, very little is known about specific pathways that lead to necrosis since there have been no systematic studies that define relations between these players and establish the consequences of events. Here we undertake an investigation of pathways implicated in necrotic death of H9c2 myogenic cells triggered by transient energy deprivation. Specifically we studied the involvement of mitochondrial depolarization in this process as well as the roles of ROS, Hsp72, and JNK in regulation of mitochondrial depolarization during necrosis. Cell Cultures and Materials—Rat heart myocardium H9c2 cells were obtained from ATCC. H9c2 cells expressing dominant negative JNK1 and parental H9c2 clone were a kind gift from Dr. J. Wei (32.Turner N.A. Xia F. Azhar G. Zhang X. Liu L. Wei J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1789-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). H9c2 cells expressing ARC (ARC24) and parental H9c2/Neo line were described before (22.Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius III, F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 to 60–85% confluence. Rotenone, propidium iodine (PI), and anisomycin were from Sigma. Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM) were from Molecular Probes. JNK inhibitor SP600125 (used at 15 μm) was from Biomol. Trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine were from Alexis. Antibodies and Western Blotting—In this study we used antibodies against anti-phospho-JNK (Promega; rabbit polyclonal) and anti-γ-tubulin (Santa Cruz; mouse monoclonal). After immunoblotting analysis secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase were visualized with ECL substrates (Amersham Biosciences), and films were quantified by densitometry. Anti-Bax antibody specific for N terminus of the protein used for immunochemistry was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (6A7 mouse monoclonal). Anti-Bax Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed according to standard technique. Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with primary anti-Bax antibody diluted 1:50 in 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor 594 signal amplification kit (Molecular Probes). PI/TMRM Double Staining—Live cells were incubated with TMRM at a final concentration of 200 nm for 15 min. TMRM was washed out, and 4 μg/ml PI was added for an additional 5 min. Exposure to Metabolic Inhibitor—60–85% confluent H9c2 cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in PBS supplemented with 5 μm rotenone for the indicated period of time. Cells were then washed twice with complete medium and recovered in complete medium for the required period of time. Detection of ROS Generation—To detect ROS generation cells were labeled with 2 μm dihydroethidium (DHE) for 15 min. DHE was prepared as 5 mm stock in Me2SO, separated into aliquots, and stored at –20 °C for not longer than 1 week. The intensity of DHE fluorescence was analyzed with Image-Pro Plus software from Media Cybernetics. Adenoviral-based Expression of Hsp72, Hsp72ΔEEVD, and GFP— Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing Hsp72 or Hsp72ΔEEVD (AdTR5-DC/HSP70-GFP) were previously described (7.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13.Gabai V.L. Mabuchi K. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Inoculation of cells with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units of each virus per 35-mm dish was sufficient to infect almost 100% of cells. Thirty-six hours after infection, cells accumulated Hsp72 and Hsp72ΔEEVD, as judged by immunoblotting of cytosol extracts (not shown). As a control, adenovirus-expressing GFP under the regulation of tTA was used. Cytosol Extract Preparation and JNK Kinase Assay—Cells were washed twice with PBS, aspirated, and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer per 35-mm dish (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamedine, 5 μg/ml each leupeptine, pepstatin A, aprotinin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 7 min. Total protein concentration was measured in the supernatants, after which they were diluted with lysis buffer to achieve equal protein concentrations in all samples. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. JNK activity was assayed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-phospho-JNK antibody. The same membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-tubulin antibody to control for equal loading. Depolarization of Mitochondria Precedes Necrosis upon Transient Energy Deprivation of H9c2 Cells—To address the mechanism of cell necrosis after transient energy deprivation, we utilized the myogenic cell line H9c2. Previously, we showed that incubation of these cells in glucose-free PBS in the presence of the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor rotenone led to more than 80% reduction of ATP levels within 15 min (7.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). H9c2 cells were incubated in PBS/rotenone for 2.5 h, and then rotenone was washed out, and cells were allowed to recovered in complete media supplemented with glucose, where the ATP levels were restored within 15–30 min (7.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As we have reported previously, these treatments led to cell death with features typical of necrosis, where no activation of caspases was observed, and the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD could not protect cells (7.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells died within 2–3h, indicating that death was not due to the secondary necrosis, which follows apoptosis. The major hallmark of cell death was the breakdown of the plasma membrane, as manifested by the appearance of membrane permeability to the fluorescent dye PI, which binds to chromosomal DNA and, thus, mainly accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). The number of necrotic cells critically depended upon the duration of ATP depletion. Indeed, ATP depletion for 2 h triggered almost no necrotic death, 2.5 h of depletion led to necrosis in 40% of cells, and incubation in the PBS/rotenone medium for 3 and 4 h resulted in 80 and 100% of necrosis, respectively (Fig. 1B). The number of PI-positive cells gradually increased upon incubation in complete medium. For example, the extent of necrosis right at the beginning of recovery after 2.5 h of metabolic inhibition was about 10% (data not shown). Upon further recovery in complete media, the fraction of necrotic cells gradually increased and by 3 h reached about 40% (Fig. 1B). No further increase was observed, so that even after an overnight incubation the fraction of necrotic cells remained close to 40% (data not shown). Mitochondrial collapse is a common and essential step in cell death pathways activated by certain death-promoting signals. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether depolarization of mitochondrial membrane takes place during necrotic death of H9c2 cells triggered by transient energy deprivation. Live H9c2 cells were incubated with the fluorescent dye TMRM, which accumulates in energized mitochondria and rapidly leaks out upon depolarization of mitochondrial membrane (see e.g. Ref. 33.Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when control cells were loaded with TMRM for 15 min, we observed characteristic mitochondrial punctuate staining (Fig. 2A, left panel). Upon 15 min of incubation of cells with rotenone in PBS, punctuate staining disappeared, and instead, TMRM showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Importantly, within 15 min after the start of recovery in complete medium with glucose almost 100% of cells again acquired typical punctuate mitochondrial TMRM staining (Fig. 2A, right panel) (in the last panel, cells looked somewhat shrunken due to prior incubation with rotenone; however, the intensity of mitochondrial TMRM staining was similar to that in control cells). These data indicate that recovery of cells in complete media led to restoration of mitochondrial potential to normal levels. Unexpectedly, prolonged incubation of H9c2 cells in complete medium led to the secondary loss of TMRM fluorescence in a fraction of cells, and by 3 h ∼40% of cells became TMRM-negative. When H9c2 cells were stained simultaneously with TMRM and PI, there were no double-stained cells observed; cells with energized mitochondria (i.e. those with mitochondrial TMRM staining) had intact cytoplasmic membrane and were PI-negative, whereas cells with de-energized mitochondria (TMRM-negative) had their cytoplasmic membrane permeable for PI (Fig. 2B). Of note, TMRM and PI accumulate in different cellular compartments (PI is nuclear, whereas TMRM is cytoplasmic/mitochondrial), allowing easy differentiation between these two dyes (see Fig. 2B). These data suggest that either deenergization of mitochondrial membrane precedes the loss of plasma membrane integrity, or mitochondrial deenergization is an immediate consequence of plasma membrane rupture and cell death. To distinguish between these two possibilities we took advantage of time-lapse microscopy. H9c2 cells were incubated in PBS/rotenone for 2.5 h, recovered in the complete medium, and 2 h later stained with both PI and TMRM. Then cells were placed under the fluorescent microscope on the temperature-controlled table, and a series of pictures with 2-min intervals were taken (Fig. 2C). Cells that undergo necrosis (marked with arrows) originally had punctuate mitochondrial TMRM staining, and their nuclei were devoid of PI (see the first column), indicating that these cells were alive and had energized mitochondria. At a certain time point these cells lost TMRM staining, which was followed by rapid accumulation of PI within 4–6 min. Therefore, in the last column marked cells have nuclei brightly stained with PI and no mitochondrial TMRM staining (Fig. 2C). In no instances did we"

In turn, JNK phosphorylates Jun members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, thereby controlling processes as different as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Still, very few targets of the JNK-Jun pathway have been identified. Here we show that JNK is required for the induction of c-myc expression by PDGF. Furthermore, we identify a phylogenetically conserved AP-1-responsive element in the promoter of the c-myc proto-oncogene that recruits in vivo the c-Jun and JunD AP-1 family members and controls the PDGF-dependent transactivation of the c-myc promoter. These findings suggest the existence of a novel biochemical route linking tyrosine kinase receptors, such as those for PDGF, and c-myc expression through JNK activation of AP-1 transcription factors. They also provide a novel potential mechanism by which both JNK and Jun proteins may exert either their proliferative or apoptotic potential by stimulating the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene.

A wide range of growth factors, cytokines, and mitogens is able to induce the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene (1.Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar, 2.Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J.

Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In normal cells as well as in tumors, the ability of c-myc to control cellular proliferation has been mostly correlated to changes in its mRNA levels through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In fact, most of the oncogenic alterations that target c-myc result in the increase of its messenger RNA and, in turn, of its protein (4.Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression or gene amplification and translocations of c-myc are frequent causes of numerous solid and blood human tumors (5.Dang C.V. Resar L.M. Emison E. Kim S. Li Q. Prescott J.E. Wonsey D. Zeller K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In line with its ability to promote cell cycle progression, in quiescent fibroblasts c-myc expression is virtually undetectable. However, upon stimulation with growth factors such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorHDACshistone deacetylasesHAhemagglutininSIDSin3-binding domainJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseAP-1activator protein 1MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKKMAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinaseErkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assayEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayStat-3signal transducer and activator of transcription-3DBDDNA-binding domainLucluciferaseATFactivating transcription factorMLKmixed lineage kinase. its mRNA and then protein levels are rapidly induced until cells progress through the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (6.Chiariello M.

J. 2000; 349: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Still, the mechanism by which growth factors promote the expression of c-myc is poorly understood. In this regard, we have recently described a Rac-dependent signaling pathway initiated by PDGF, controlling the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene (6.Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S.

In this study, we show that JNK is required for PDGF induction of c-myc expression. Furthermore, we identify a phylogenetically conserved AP-1-responsive element in the human, mouse, and even Drosophila c-myc promoter. Such element binds in vivo to members of the Jun family of transcription factors, c-Jun and JunD, as indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Finally, we show that through this element PDGF is able to control the activity of the c-myc promoter in an AP-1-dependent fashion, implying the existence of a novel signaling pathway linking the PDGF receptor through JNK and Jun proteins to nuclear events culminating in the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene. Reagents—Human recombinant PDGF (Intergen) was used at a final concentration of 12.5 ng ml–1. The selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Biomol) was added to the cells 30 min before stimulation at the indicated concentrations. pcDNAIII/GS-Myc-V5 was purchased from Invitrogen. Myelin basic protein was purchased from Sigma. Expression vectors for Rac12V and the corresponding effector domain mutants Rac12V/33N, Rac12V/37L, and Rac12V/40H were kindly provided by C. J.

The pmycAP-1 luciferase reporter vector was obtained by cloning two mouse AP-1 elements in the pGL3 reporter vector (Promega). PCR amplifications of the c-Fos and c-Jun cDNAs were cloned in the pCEFL AU5 and pCEFL AU1 expression vectors, respectively. The JunDBD-Sin3-binding domain of Mad (SID) expression vector was prepared cloning in pCEFL HA the DNA-binding domain of c-Jun and the Sin3-binding domain of Mad. The Gal4-driven luciferase reporter plasmid pGal4-Luc was constructed by inserting six copies of a Gal4-responsive element and a TATA oligonucleotide to replace the simian virus 40 minimal promoter in the pGL3 vector (Promega). The Gal4-VP16 expression vector was prepared cloning the transactivation domain of the VP16 transcription factor in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 into the pCDNA III vector. Specific maps and restriction sites will be made available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent or LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Northern Blot Analysis—After 24 h of starvation, NIH 3T3 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA was extracted by homogenization with TRIzol (Invitrogen) in accordance with manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated in 2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes prepared with the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). As a probe, we used a 450-bp PstI DNA fragment from the human c-myc gene (pcDNAIII/GS-Myc-V5). The RNA membranes were pre-hybridized for >2 h in hybridization solution (ExpressHyb, Clontech) at 70 °C. The 32P-labeled probe was added to the blots and hybridized for another 16 h at 60 °C. The blots were washed twice for 30 min each in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice for 30 min each in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Accuracy of RNA loading and transfer was confirmed by fluorescence under ultraviolet light after staining with ethidium bromide. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin from NIH 3T3 cells has been fixed by directly adding formaldehyde (1% final) to the cell culture medium. Nuclear extracts have been isolated from the cells and then sonicated to obtain mechanical sharing of the fixed chromatin. Transcription factor-bound chromatin has been immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, cross-linking has been reversed, and the isolated genomic DNA has been amplified by PCR using specific primers encompassing the murine c-myc promoter: forward AP66 (5′-ATACCTGTGACTATTCATTT-3′) and reverse AP67 (5′-GATGCTTCCTTGCCTAAGAC-3′). The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Primers used as a control for the ChIP analysis amplify an unrelated DNA sequence located on murine chromosome 5: forward DE1 (5′-AGGACCCATCCAGATGGAGT-3′) and reverse DE2 (5′-CAATGCTCCAAATCCTGTCA-3′). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were obtained from NIH 3T3 cells plated in 10-cm plates and grown to 70% confluency, starved overnight, and then stimulated with PDGF when needed. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and vigorously vortexed for 10 s. Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 s. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rocked at 4 °C for 15 min. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. After determining protein concentrations using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), 2 μg of proteins were incubated at room temperature with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12% glycerol) for 15 min. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing the AP-1-responsive element plus adjacent sequences from the mouse c-myc promoter (AP1F, 5′-ATACCTGTGACTCATTCATTT-3′, and AP1R, 5′-AAATGAATGAGTCACAGGTAT-3′) were obtained from MWG Biotech and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and used as probes (20,000 cpm/reaction) and added to the reactions for an additional 15 min. Complexes were analyzed on non-denaturing (4.5%) polyacrylamide gels in TGE buffer (40 mm Tris, 270 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and run at 13 V/cm at 4 °C. For supershift assays, 1 μg of the indicated antisera was added to the binding reaction. Kinase Assays—Methods to evaluate the phosphorylating activity of MAPK and JNK by in vitro kinase assays have been described previously (11.Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Methods to evaluate the phosphorylating activity of MAPK and JNK by in vitro kinase assay have been described previously (11.Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Lysates of total cellular proteins were analyzed by protein immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE with specific rabbit antisera or mouse monoclonal antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) by using goat antiserum against rabbit or mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). EMSA, Western blots, immunoprecipitations, and ChIP analysis were performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against JNK1 (C-17), Erk2 (C-14), Rac1 (C-14), c-Jun (H-79), JunD (329), JunB (N-17), and ATF2 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser-73) (Cell Signaling Technology); mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA and AU5 epitopes (Berkley Antibody Company); and JNK1 (BD Biosciences). Reporter Gene Assays—For each well, cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE reagent with different expression plasmids together with 50 ng of the indicated reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-null (a plasmid expressing the enzyme Renilla luciferase from Renilla reniformis) as an internal control. In all of the cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with empty vector. After 16–20 h from transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates from serum-starved cells were assayed using the Dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) and light emission was quantified using the Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) as specified by the manufacturer. Rac Effector Domain Mutants Differentially Impair Endogenous c-myc Expression—To investigate the signaling pathways activated by Rac impinging on the regulation of c-myc expression, we used specific constitutively active Rac effector domain mutants that are differentially impaired in their downstream signaling activities (8.Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 12.Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the ability to stimulate c-myc expression of a constitutively active Rac12V mutant with that of Rac alleles harboring additional mutations in their effector domain (Rac12V/33N, Rac12V/37L, and Rac12V/40H). We first explored, by Northern blot analysis, the ability of Rac12V to induce c-myc expression using PDGF as a positive control. As expected, the activated Rac12V mutant significantly induced c-myc expression as evidenced by an increase in the level of c-myc mRNA (Fig. 1A). We next investigated the effect of the double mutants. As shown in Fig. 1B, both the Rac12V/37L- and Rac12V/40H-mutated proteins were ineffective in stimulating the expression of c-myc, whereas the Rac12V/33N protein was fully competent to induce the transcription of the c-myc proto-oncogene. Recent work has established an impairment of JNK activation as a consequence of the transfection of the Rac12V/37L and Rac12V/40H effector domain mutants (8.Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In line with these studies, the data in Fig. 1C show that both Rac12V/37L and Rac12V/40H not only were unable to stimulate c-myc expression but they were also incapable of stimulating the activity of JNK, thereby suggesting the involvement of this kinase in Rac-induced c-myc expression. Conversely, the Rac12V/33N-mutated protein activated JNK at a level similar to the positive control, Rac12V (Fig. 1C). All of the Rac mutants were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1D). Together, these results strongly suggest that the JNK pathway is involved in the regulation of c-myc expression. JNK Activity Is Necessary for PDGF Induction of c-myc Expression—The possibility that JNK participates in the regulation of c-myc expression prompted us to test whether the constitutive activation of this signal transduction pathway could stimulate the expression of the endogenous c-myc proto-oncogene. Therefore, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with vectors expressing two upstream activators of the JNK cascade, the MEKK1 and MLK3 MAPK kinase kinases (10.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, both proteins induced the transcription of the endogenous c-myc gene at levels comparable to the positive control Rac12V, indicating that JNK activation is sufficient to trigger the expression of c-myc. Although JNKs have been isolated and characterized as stress-activated kinases based on their strong response to environmental stresses and inflammation stimuli, different growth factors are also able to stimulate their activity (14.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Moreover, they have recently been involved in mediating the proliferative effects of some oncogenes, including the product of the bcr-abl oncogene (15.Hess P. Pihan G. Sawyers C.L. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on our data, we next explored the participation of JNK in the regulation of c-myc expression induced by PDGF. We began exploring the ability of this mitogen to activate JNK. As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to PDGF induced the activation of JNK, which peaked 30 min after stimulation. As an approach to examine the involvement of JNK in PDGF-induced c-myc expression, we took advantage of the availability of a synthetic compound, SP600125, a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor that blocks JNK without significantly affecting other related kinases (16.Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). We first confirmed the ability of the drug to inhibit JNK-dependent pathways in our experimental model. Indeed, SP600125 abolished PDGF-induced phosphorylation of the endogenous c-Jun protein in a dose-dependent manner as scored by Western blot analysis using a mixture of anti-phospho-Ser-63 and phospho-Ser-73 c-Jun antibodies (Fig. 2C). Conversely, identical concentrations of the drug had no effect on PDGF-induced Erk1/2 activation (Fig. 2D) and on Erk-dependent c-Fos phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the SP600125 for the JNK pathway as compared with other highly related MAPK-signaling pathways. To test the involvement of JNK in PDGF-induced c-myc expression, we performed Northern blot analysis on NIH 3T3 cells pretreated with increasing concentrations of the JNK inhibitor and then stimulated with PDGF for 1 h. As a result, the drug strongly inhibited PDGF-induced c-myc expression, even at the lowest concentration of the drug (Fig. 2E). Remarkably, the kinetic of inhibition of c-myc expression was coincident with the results obtained for the inhibition of PDGF-induced JNK activation by SP600125 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the emerging picture from these data is that activation of the JNK pathway may regulate c-myc expression and, in turn, PDGF exploits JNK as a key molecule to promote c-myc expression, possibly through phosphorylation and activation of nuclear transcription factors. A Typical AP-1-responsive Element in the c-myc Promoter— Two principal promoters, P1 and P2, drive the transcription of the human c-myc gene (17.Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the extraordinary complexity in the regulation of c-myc expression, the rate of transcription from these two promoters is mainly governed by composite negative and positive regulatory elements comprised within a 2.3-kb domain located upstream of the promoters (18.Hay N. Bishop J.M. Levens D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Among these elements, E2F, Stat-3, NF-κB, and F cell receptor 4-binding sites have been identified (19.Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 20.He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar, 21.Wong K.K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6535-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22.Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In search for additional responsive elements that could mediate the JNK-dependent regulation of the c-myc gene, we performed computer-assisted analysis of its promoter region by the TRANSFAC data base (23.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we could identify 1.3 kb upstream the human c-myc transcription start site, a TGAGTCA motif perfectly matching the canonical AP-1-responsive element (Fig. 3A) (24.Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a similar analysis found conserved responsive elements also in the promoters of murine and even Drosophila c-myc genes (Fig. 3A). The sequences of the respective responsive elements were highly related to each other (Fig. 3A, boxed nucleotides) as opposed to their immediate flanking regions, suggesting that a strong selective pressure was exerted to maintain these sites intact during evolution. Several short sequences similar to known response elements are frequently found in promoter regions of a variety of genes. However, the arrangement of these sites in relation to neighboring sequences often determines the functionality of the predicted binding site. Thus, we first studied the ability of an oligonucleotide containing the murine c-myc AP-1-responsive element plus adjacent sequences to form DNA/proteins complexes by means of EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3B, left panel, proteins from NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts recognized and strongly bound the c-myc AP-1-responsive element as evidenced by the presence of a shifted complex that was more prominent 4 h after PDGF addition as a consequence of the accumulation of AP-1 proteins in the stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (25.Lallemand D. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Pfarr C.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The binding was specific, because it was efficiently competed by adding an excess of unlabeled c-myc AP-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, right panel). To further investigate the nature of the transcription factors bound to the described c-myc AP-1 element, we next performed supershift experiments by incubating the binding reactions in the presence of specific antibodies against Jun family members. These proteins have been in fact described as substrates of the JNK signaling pathway, and they could therefore possibly mediate the effect of this kinase on the c-myc promoter. As shown in Fig. 3C, both c-Jun and JunD antibodies strongly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of the complexes derived from NIH 3T3 cells stimulated 30 min with PDGF, whereas the JunB antibody had a much lower effect. As an additional control, no ATF2 was detected in the complexes (Fig. 3C), in line with the fact that Jun:ATF2 heterodimers bind more efficiently atypical 8-bp TGACGTCA sites (26.van Dam H. Huguier S. Kooistra K. Baguet J. Vial E. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. Castellazzi M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Conversely, among Fos proteins, only Fra2 was detected as part of the complexes (data not shown). On the basis of the binding observed in vitro, we next examined by ChIP analysis whether members of the Jun family could actually bind in vivo the endogenous c-myc promoter. In NIH 3T3 cells, ChIP assays clearly demonstrated the binding of both c-Jun and JunD to the endogenous c-myc promoter 30 min after PDGF addition (Fig. 3D), coincidently with the time point at which PDGF induces maximal JNK stimulation (see Fig. 2B). Conversely, we did not observe any in vivo binding of JunB to the promoter (Fig. 3D). As expected (see above), we could not detect ATF2 bound to the c-myc promoter (Fig. 3D), whereas it was able to bind the c-jun promoter, which harbors an atypical 8-bp TGACATCA element (data not shown). The same analysis, performed on untreated quiescent NIH 3T3 cells, gave similar results (data not shown), confirming that Jun family members are pre-bound to their responsive elements (25.Lallemand D. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Pfarr C.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and can be rapidly trans-activated by phosphorylation in response to external stimuli (27.Mechta-Grigoriou F. Gerald D. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2378-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As an additional control, no amplification was observed from the same immunoprecipitates when using primers recognizing DNA sequences unrelated to the c-myc promoter (Fig. 3D, lower panel). At this point, it is important to notice that although ChIP analysis was not able to detect binding of JunB to the c-myc promoter, EMSA experiments showed a small amount of this protein bound to the c-myc AP-1-containing EMSA probes. We have attributed this apparent difference to the in vitro nature of the EMSA and its limitations to precisely recapitulate the binding of the transcription factors at the level of the endogenous promoters. At the same time, this situation underscores the importance of the results from the ChIP assay, showing in vivo binding of c-Jun and JunD to the promoter. Altogether, these results indicate that proteins of the AP-1 family, specifically c-Jun and JunD, are able to recognize and bind in vivo the AP-1 element present in the c-myc promoter, thus suggesting this element as a potential mediator of JNK-dependent regulation of c-myc expression induced by PDGF. The AP-1 Element Controls PDGF Stimulation of c-myc Expression—We next investigated whether the c-myc AP-1 element was able to mediate PDGF-induced stimulation of c-myc expression. The control of histone acetylation is a key step in the general regulation of cellular transcriptional events (28.Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). In turn, a model has been recently proposed in which the transactivation potential of c-Jun and possibly that of its related proteins is constitutively repressed by a histone deacetylases (HDACs) containing complex, which physically interacts with c-Jun itself and can be released upon JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the protein (29.Weiss C. Schneider S. Wagner E.F. Zhang X. Seto E. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3686-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that an artificial molecule specifically targeting HDACs to AP-1 elements could recapitulate HDAC-dependent negative regulation of AP-1-containing promoters but in a dominant repressive fashion (unable to be relieved by upstream stimuli). Therefore, we engineered a molecule in which the DBD of c-Jun has been fused to the SID. The resulting protein (JunDBD-SID) is able to bind Sin3 and, through this, recruit HDACs (30.Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We expect this repressor to be able to specifically inhibit transcription by targeting through the c-Jun DBD, AP-1 elements that are present in the endogenous promoters. To control the specificity of the repressor, we first engineered a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene expressed under the control of a tandemly repeated AP-1 element from the murine c-myc gene (pmycAP-1-Luc). Such a construct behaves as a typical AP-1 reporter, its activity being readily induced by the c-Jun and c-Fos members of the AP-1 family (Fig. 4A) and by upstream stimulators of the JNK pathway, MEKK1 and MLK3 (Fig. 4B) (10.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). As expected, the activity of the pmycAP-1-Luc plasmid was also readily induced by PDGF, its effect being much stronger when the corresponding oncogene (Sis) was cotransfected with the reporter (Fig. 4C). We hypothesized that the expression of luciferase from this construct should be strongly inhibited by the JunDBD-SID repressor through specific targeting to the c-myc AP-1 and recruitment of HDACs. As expected, very low amounts of the JunDBD-SID repressor were sufficient to completely abolish the activity of the pmycAP-1-Luc reporter induced by sis, the oncogenic form of the PDGF-proto-oncogene (Fig. 4D), while not affecting the luciferase activity induced by a Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 4E) or a p53 molecule (data not shown) on their respective reporter vectors. Therefore, these data confirmed the effectiveness and specificity of the engineered protein and the dependence of its activity upon the presence of functional AP-1 elements. It is also important to notice that such experiments not only control the specificity of our approach but also contribute to establish that the c-myc AP-1 is a fully functional element that can be stimulated by PDGF and the JNK pathway. This finding further supports the hypothesis that JNK plays a key role in the regulation of c-myc expression, possibly induced by PDGF activation of its cognate receptors. Finally, to prove the ability of the AP-1 element to regulate the transcription of the c-myc promoter, we analyzed by Northern blot the RNAs produced by PDGF-treated cells expressing the JunDBD-SID protein. Strikingly, the AP-1 repressor clearly inhibited PDGF-induced accumulation of c-myc mRNA (Fig. 4F). Altogether, these findings strongly support the idea that the AP-1 sequence identified in the c-myc promoter is functional, being able to control the c-myc expression induced by PDGF through the recruitment of members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. In all, these findings also contribute to understand some of the molecular mechanisms by which c-Jun acts as a positive regulator of the cell cycle (24.Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 27.Mechta-Grigoriou F. Gerald D. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2378-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) because only very few c-Jun targets involved in the control of the cell cycle have been yet identified. In fact, this study adds c-myc to the short list of prototypes genes, such as cyclin D1 and p53 (31.Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 32.Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), that are regulated by c-Jun and involved in cellular proliferation. Our finding also show that JunD is bound to the c-myc promoter and can regulate c-myc expression, which may help to explain the role of this protein as mediator of cellular survival (33.Weitzman J.B. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34.Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The ability of JNK to mediate a typical proliferative pathway such as the one connecting PDGF to c-myc induction contrasts with the pro-apoptotic effects attributed to JNK in response to different environmental stresses (14.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, JNK has been also implicated in mediating survival signals in response to integrins (35.Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (34.Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and cellular oncogenes (15.Hess P. Pihan G. Sawyers C.L. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent evidence shows that JunD is able to act downstream of JNK as a sensor that transmit survival or apoptotic signals depending on the state of others transcription factors (34.Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms are usually taken into account to explain the possibility for JNK to mediate both apoptotic and survival signaling. The latter mechanism considers the possibility that cells may interpret a transient JNK activation as a survival signal as opposed to the apoptotic response elicited by a sustained JNK activity (36.Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism considers the possibility that JNK signals for cellular survival depend on the cooperation with other pathways such as Akt and NF-κB (34.Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Indeed, both these mechanisms could operate in our PDGF-dependent system. In fact, we have shown a transient activation of JNK in response to PDGF (Fig. 2B) and PDGF itself is able to contemporarily stimulate multiple signaling pathways, including Akt and NF-κB (37.Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the possibility remains that specific stimuli, activating JNK in the absence of pro-survival signals, may induce apoptosis through a c-myc-dependent pathway. As c-myc itself has been involved in both pro- and anti-apoptotic responses, the mechanism by which regulation of c-myc expression by JNK-c-Jun/JunD relates to these two opposite responses will warrant further investigation. Our previous results indicated that PDGF induces c-myc expression through the Src-dependent activation of the Vav2 exchange factor, acting on the small GTPase Rac (6.Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J.

By studying the downstream components of the Rac pathway, we now show that JNK and two AP-1 family members, c-Jun and JunD, are essential components of the signaling cascade that mediate PDGF stimulation of c-myc expression (Fig. 5), which significantly establishes a new functional connection between Jun proteins and the c-myc proto-oncogene. The proposed pathway also suggests a mechanism by which both JNK and Jun proteins might exert their proliferative or apoptotic potential through the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene. Further work will be required to establish the contribution of the “JNK-Jun pathway” to the biological responses of tyrosine kinase receptors such as the PDGF receptors as well as other membrane receptors that use the c-Myc protein to signal cellular proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2030232210,"Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase is a surface enzyme of this Gram-positive bacterium. The enzyme degrades hyaluronan and chondroitin/chondroitin sulfates by cleaving the β1,4-glycosidic linkage between the glycan units of these polymeric substrates. This degradation helps spreading of this bacterial organism throughout the host tissues and facilitates the disease process caused by pneumococci. The mechanism of this degradative process is based on β-elimination, is termed proton acceptance and donation, and involves selected residues of a well defined catalytic site of the enzyme. The degradation of hyaluronan alone is thought to proceed through a processive mode of action. The structures of complexes between the enzyme and chondroitin as well as chondroitin sulfate disaccharides allowed for the first detailed insights into these interactions and the mechanism of action on chondroitins. This degradation of chondroitin/chondroitin sulfates is nonprocessive and is selective for the chondroitin sulfates only with certain sulfation patterns. Chondroitin sulfation at the 4-position on the nonreducing site of the linkage to be cleaved or 2-sulfation prevent degradation due to steric clashes with the enzyme. Evolutionary studies suggest that hyaluronate lyases evolved from chondroitin lyases and still retained chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate degradation abilities while being specialized in the degradation of hyaluronan. The more efficient processive degradation mechanism has come to be preferred for the unsulfated substrate hyaluronan.

Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase is one of the major surface proteins of this human bacterial pathogen and is present on the majority of strains of this organism examined to date (1.Linker A.

The four HL domains are an N-terminal carbohydrate binding domain, followed by a spacer domain, the catalytic domain, and finally the C-terminal domain, which modulates access to the catalytic cleft of the enzyme transversing the catalytic domain (7.Rigden D.J.

The full-length molecule readily degrades when produced in a recombinant form, probably by an autocatalytic process, leaving the two C-terminal domains as a stable derivative, resistant to further degradation (2.Berry A.M.

Biol. 2003; 328: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and have additionally included the more distantly related alginate lyase from Sphingomonas (21.Yoon H.J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in the superfamily. In each case, the catalytic domains, containing incomplete α/α toroids, bear strong structural similarity. Nevertheless, these enzymes are remarkably different in terms of domain composition. Alginate lyase contains the catalytic toroidal domain alone (21.Yoon H.J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In F. heparinum CL, a C-terminal all-β domain is added (17.Fethiere J. Eggimann B. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The P. vulgaris structure contains an N-terminal presumed carbohydrate binding domain in addition to these two domains (20.Huang W. Lunin V.V. Li Y. Suzuki S. Sugiura N. Miyazono H. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Streptococcus agalactiae crystal structures also show three domains, a small all-β domain preceding the catalytic and C-terminal domains. However, sequence analysis show that both this and the HL from S. pneumoniae in fact contain four domains, an N-terminal presumed carbohydrate binding domain (which may be homologous to the N-terminal domain of P. vulgaris CL), the small all-β domain, which probably acts as a spacer, and then the catalytic and C-terminal domains. Although both streptococcal HLs and P. vulgaris CL contain N-terminal presumed carbohydrate-binding domains, there appears to be a key difference in their relationships to the rest of the molecule. In P. vulgaris, there is a large interface between the presumed carbohydrate binding domains and the catalytic domain (22.Huang W. Boju L. Tkalec L. Su H. Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Linhardt R.J. Kim Y.S. Matte A. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In streptococcal HLs, the presence of the spacer domain suggests that the presumed carbohydrate-binding domain is placed further from the catalytic domain. The lack of success in crystallizing full-length streptococcal HL is also suggestive of flexibility between carbohydrate binding and catalytic domains (i.e. a dynamic independence with possible implications for function) (7.Rigden D.J.

Functionally, the hyaluronate lyase enzyme degrades primarily hyaluronan and also certain chondroitin/chondroitin sulfates (1.Linker A. Meyer K. Hoffman P. J. Biol.

Chondroitin (Ch) and chondroitin sulfates (ChS) are built from repeats of a disaccharide composed of d-glucuronate connected through a β1,3 linkage to N-acetyl-d-galactosamine. The disaccharides are connected through β1,4-glycosidic linkages (Fig. 1). They differ from hyaluronan (polymeric d-glucuronate-β1,3-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine connected by β1,4-glycosidic linkages) only in the anomeric configuration at the C-4 carbon of the N-acetyl-d-glycosamine. The predominant chondroitins isolated from natural tissues are unsulfated chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate. 4- and 6-sulfation of chondroitin occur at the C-4 and C-6 positions of the GalNAc (e.g. see Ref. 30.Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Chondroitin-2-sulfate has also been identified, but in this case the 2-sulfation occurs at the C-2 carbon of the GlcA (d-glucuronate) ring (31.Lauder R.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A.

In addition to normal physical properties expected from being a part of the extracellular matrix, especially cartilage, chondroitins have multiple other functions such as macromolecular interactions and cytoadherence (38.Cooke B.M. Rogerson S.J. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4040-4044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information regarding the structures of hyaluronan, chondroitin, and chondroitin sulfate structures has been obtained from x-ray crystallography, NMR, and other biophysical and computational methods. However, whereas crystallography reveals a variety of structures (3- and 4-fold helices for short chain hyaluronan (39.Winter W.T. Smith P.J. Arnott S. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and 2-fold helices for 4-sulfated chondroitin (40.Winter W.T. Arnott S. Isaac D.H. Atkins E.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)), some NMR studies in D2O support a 2-fold helical conformation for hyaluronan, chondroitin, and chondroitin sulfate in solution (41.Scott J.E. Heatley F. Wood B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15467-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42.Scott J.E. Pathol. Biol.

The presence of such a 2-fold helical structure could explain the ability of these polymers to form higher order structures, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, such as through antiparallel association of chains for hyaluronan (41.Scott J.E. Heatley F. Wood B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15467-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42.Scott J.E. Pathol. Biol.

These studies suggest that the ability of chondroitin and its sulfates to form higher order structures depends on the presence and position of sulfate group. Full sulfation at the 4-position, but not at the 6-position, impedes association (45.Scott J.E. Chen Y. Brass A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The bound conformations of these polymers revealed by complexes to lyases (15.Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol.

The binding of substrate in conformations close to those found in solution presumably enhances binding. However, many other NMR studies do not support such a structure for, at least, hyaluronan in aqueous solution, whereas it may exist in Me2SO or possibly in the solid phase at low pH (46.Toffanin R.

The dynamic/flexible character of hyaluronan seems to emerge from this work. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations have provided considerable insight into this question, suggesting that hyaluronan is highly dynamic in solution (51.Almond A. Brass A. Sheehan J.K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 5634-5640Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 52.Almond A. Brass A. Sheehan J.K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 53.Almond A. Brass A.

In addition, recent studies have found no evidence for chain-chain association in concentrated hyaluronan solutions (54.Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More studies are clearly needed to elucidate structural properties of hyaluronan and chondroitins. In this work, we report the results of cocrystallization of S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase with unsulfated and 2-, 4-, and 6-sulfated chondroitin disaccharides. This information is related to biochemical knowledge regarding the ability of the enzyme to cleave different chondroitins. Further modeling and structural comparisons shed light on the structure-function relationships of HL and the related enzyme CL and help to understand the adaptation of each to their respective favored substrates. Materials—Chondroitin and chondroitin sulfates used in this study were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased either from Fisher or Sigma. Complex Formation, Crystallization, and Diffraction Data Collection—The wild-type, H399A, and Y408F mutant forms of S. pneumoniae HL were produced as previously reported (11.Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 55.Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm EDTA, 2 mm EDTA. The unsulfated chondroitin (α-ΔUA-[β1→3]-Gal-NAc; ΔDi0S) and chondroitin sulfates with various sulfation patterns (chondroitin-2-sulfate (α-ΔUA-2S-[β1→3]-GalNAc; ΔDi-UA-2S), chondroitin-4-sulfate (α-ΔUA-[β1→3]-GalNAc-4S; ΔDi4S), and chondroitin-6-sulfate (α-ΔUA-[β1→3]-GalNAc-6S; ΔDi6S)) were purchased from Sigma. The crystals of the complexes with these various chondroitin and chondroitin sulfates were obtained by co-crystallization. The hanging drop vapor diffusion method was employed (56.McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar), and equal volumes (1 μl each) of the enzyme, 50 mm chondroitin solution (in 10 mm Tris-HCl), and reservoir solution were used. The crystallization conditions were essentially identical to those of the wild type enzyme as previously reported (55.Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These crystals grew within 2 weeks and were of similar size and shape of those of the wild-type enzyme. The crystals were cryoprotected and frozen as previously described for the native crystals (8.Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J.

The diffraction data were collected using a synchrotron source, beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Light Source, Argonne National Laboratory or beamline x25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. 3x3 Oxford or Brandeis-4 CCD detectors were used, and the data were collected in oscillation mode (57.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) as reported (8.Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J.

The crystals of the complexes were isomorphous to those of the wild-type enzyme (8.Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J.

Structure Solution and Refinement—Of the various combinations of wild-type and mutant enzymes with different sulfated and unsulfated chondroitin disaccharides, full refinement was only carried out for the best diffracting crystal for each ligand. An exception was made for ΔDi6S, for which both wild-type and Y408F protein complexes were refined in order to verify that the introduction of the mutation had no effect on the mode of ligand binding. The structures of crystals grown in the presence of ΔDi-UA-2S were also not refined, since it was clear from the outset that ligand was not bound. The structures were solved by rigid body refinement in CNS (58.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) were used throughout. An Rfree value (61.Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar), calculated from 5% of reflections set aside at the outset, was used to monitor the progress of refinement. Water molecules were placed into 3σ positive peaks in Fo - Fc maps when density was also evident in 2Fo - Fc maps and suitable hydrogen bonding partners were available. Strong difference density at the catalytic site corresponding to the chondroitin disaccharides was evident. Sulfate ions deriving from the crystallization solution were modeled into suitably shaped regions of electron density.

https://openalex.org/W1986096299,"The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is pivotal in the transforming activity of this virus. We found that the common LMP1-95-8 variant interacts with Homologue of Slimb (HOS), a receptor for the SCFHOS/βTrCP ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) via one canonical and one cryptic HOS recognition site. These sites are mutated or deleted in the tumor-derived LMP1-Cao variant, which did not bind to HOS. Mutations within these sites on LMP1-95-8 abrogated HOS binding and increased transforming activity of LMP1. HOS did not regulate stability of LMP1-95-8 unless it was mutated to bear additional lysine residues near the cryptic motif. LMP1 proteins that could not bind to HOS exhibited an increased ability to induce IκB degradation and NF-κB-mediated transcription without further increase in activation of IκB kinases. Expression of LMP1-95-8 reduced the levels of endogenous HOS available to interact with phosphorylated IκBα. Degradation of IκBα and dose dependence of NF-κB activation by LMP1-95-8 were promoted by co-expression of HOS. Our data suggest that LMP1-95-8 is a pseudo-substrate of SCFHOS/βTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and that interaction between LMP1 and HOS restricts the extent of LMP1-induced NF-κB signaling.

LMP1 plays a pivotal role in immortalization and proliferation of human B-lymphocytes infected with EBV, which is associated with a wide spectrum of human malignancies (reviewed in Ref. 1.Rickinson A. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). LMP1 resembles a viral oncogene by virtue of its capability to transform rodent cells in vitro and to induce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice (2.Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E.

LMP1 elicits its effects by constitutively engaging multiple signaling pathways, including those that activate NF-κB, jun/AP-1, ATF2, signal transducers and activators of transcription, and Sma and Mad-related protein transcription factors, which, in turn, mediate pleiotropic events in cells infected with EBV or transfected with LMP1 vector (5.Prokova V.

NF-κB, a dimeric transcription factor, activates transcription of a large number of target genes that play key roles in cell growth and death, as well as in immune and inflammatory responses. NF-κB activity is frequently increased in human tumors; it is essential for growth and survival of tumor cells. Cells tightly regulate activation of NF-κB by expression of a family of inhibitory proteins (IκB). In the absence of stimuli, IκB binds tightly to NF-κB and masks the domains responsible for NF-κB nuclear localization and DNA binding (13.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar, 14.Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J. Fu M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). LMP1 induces the NF-κB pathway by mimicking a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor (15.Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). LMP1 interacts with tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor and tumor necrosis receptor-associated death domain adapter proteins and activates IκB kinases (IKK) (10.Izumi K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc.

Specifically, phosphorylated IκB is recognized by WD40 domains of ubiquitin ligase receptors, which belong to the β-TrCP/Fbw1 subfamily of F box proteins, including β-TrCP1 (also termed FWD1/Fbw1a (18.Margottin F.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). These E3 ligases ubiquitinate IκB at lysines located 9–10 amino acids proximal to the destruction motif (23.Rodriguez M.S. Wright J. Thompson J. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Hay R.T. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2425-2435PubMed Google Scholar). 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated IκB relieves inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription (13.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). An increased capacity of some natural LMP1 isolates from tumors to induce NF-κB activity is thought to be linked to their higher efficacy in transforming rodent cells in vitro compared with a canonical B95-8 variant of LMP1 (LMP1-95-8) (24.Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hu L.F. Chen F. Zheng X. Ernberg I. Cao S.L. Christensson B. Klein G. Winberg G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1575-1583PubMed Google Scholar). These highly transforming LMP1 proteins (including LMP1-Cao, 1510, and C15) bear numerous point mutations and a 30-bp deletion in the C-terminal domain (26.Hu L.F. Zabarovsky E.R. Chen F. Cao S.L.

Whereas the 30-bp deletion increases transforming activity of LMP1-95-8 (29.Li S.N. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2129-2135PubMed Google Scholar) and is frequently found in EBV-associated tumors (30.Sandvej K. Peh S.C. Andresen B.S. Pallesen G. Blood. 1994; 84: 4053-4060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying either increased tumorigenicity or augmented induction of NF-κB by these LMP1 variants remain unknown. Surprisingly, in transfected cells, when LMP1-95-8 is expressed at very high levels, it inhibits NF-κB activity (31.Coffin III, W.F. Geiger T.R. Martin J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3749-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32.Kaykas A. Worringer K. Sugden B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11551-11560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and causes cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effects, indicating a role of the tight regulation of LMP1-95-8 levels in the maintenance of EBV latency (33.Dawson C.W. Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Barker R. Young L.S. Virology. 2000; 272: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.Floettmann J.E. Ward K. Rickinson A.B. Rowe M.

This inhibition is not observed upon expressing LMP1-Cao (33.Dawson C.W. Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Barker R. Young L.S. Virology. 2000; 272: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36.Johnson R.J. Stack M. Hazlewood S.A. Jones M. Blackmore C.G. Hu L.F. Rowe M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that LMP1-Cao protein is more stable than LMP1-95-8 and accumulates to a greater extent in cells (37.Blake S.M. Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. Virology. 2001; 282: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In human cells, LMP1-95-8 protein undergoes rapid degradation, which depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (38.Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) responsible for ubiquitination of LMP1 have not been identified as yet. We have noted that the C-terminal domain of LMP1-95-8 contains a potential β-TrCP recognition motif (DSGHES) and that this motif is mutated in LMP1-Cao. In this study, we investigated a potential role of SCFHOS/βTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligases in degradation of LMP1. We found that LMP1-95-8, but not LMP1-Cao, interacted with β-TrCP2/HOS. Although SCFHOS ligase did not regulate LMP1 stability, the association between LMP1-95-8 and the SCFHOS complex affected the availability of HOS to interact with phosphorylated IκB as well as IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. These data provide an insight into mechanisms underlying differences between LMP1-95-8 and highly tumorigenic LMP1 variants in their ability to activate NF-κB signaling.

Cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) supplemented with inhibitors of phosphatases (20 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4) and a “mixture” of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were measured using Bradford reagent (Pierce). pRSV-β-gal expression vector was added to the transfection mixture to normalize the transfection efficiency on the basis of β-galactosidase activity (measured with a Promega kit). Expression of recombinant SCFHOS complex components (HOS-HA, Cullin1, Skp1, and Roc1) in 293T cells and their purification were carried out as described previously (45.Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Immunotechniques—Monoclonal antibodies against HA tag (Roche Applied Science), LMP1 (CS1-4, Dako), IKKγ (Pharmingen), β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories), IKKα and IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-tubulin (Sigma) as well as Cullin1 polyclonal antibody (NeoMarkers) were purchased. Polyclonal antibody against HOS (HOS-N) was described earlier (46.Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis was performed as described previously (40.Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells grown on 100-mm dishes and transfected with indicated plasmids were starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine, metabolically labeled with a 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chased with medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine for various time points. Cells were harvested, and LMP1 proteins were immunopurified by CS1-4 antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Results were quantified using a Storm 860 Imager (Amersham Biosciences). An IKK immunokinase assay was carried out with IKKγ antibody as described elsewhere (47.Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were described earlier. Data were analyzed using Scion Image Software (version Beta 4.0.2). Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays in the cells plated in 24-well plates and co-transfected with either κB- or jun2-driven luciferase reporter constructs and pRSV-β-gal plasmid were performed using the appropriate kit (Promega) as described earlier (40.Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. Foci Formation Assay—Rat1a cells were transfected with LMP1 expressing constructs (0.5 μg) and pBABE-puro (3.5 μg) and grown for 14 days in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml, Sigma). The appearance of foci of transformed cells characterized by lack of contact inhibition was observed 14 days after transfection, and the number of foci was scored in a double blind manner. Measurement of Substrate-free HOS Levels—IκBα-derived phosphorylated peptide (KKERLLDDRHDpSGLDpSMKDE, where pS is phosphoserine) and its non-phosphorylated counterpart were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Peptides were covalently coupled with beads using an AminoLink kit (Pierce), and the beads were washed and incubated with 1 mg of lysates from 293T cells transfected with LMP1 constructs for 1 h at 2 °C. After extensive washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Nonidet P-40 (0.1%), the proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with HOS-N antibody. LMP1-95-8 but Not LMP1-Cao Interacts with HOS— We sought to investigate whether LMP1 is a target for SCFβ-TrCP/HOS E3 ubiquitin ligases. Both β-TrCP1 and HOS recognize the DpSGXXpS motif (22.Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and play a redundant role in ubiquitination of IκB and β-catenin (48.Guardavaccaro D. Kudo Y. Boulaire J. Barchi M. Busino L. Donzelli M. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Because a similar motif is found within the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of LMP1-95-9 (Fig. 1C), we chose to focus our studies on interaction of LMP1 with HOS, which, unlike β-TrCP1, is primarily localized in the cytoplasm (49.Davis M. Hatzubai A. Andersen J.S. Ben-Shushan E. Fisher G.Z. Yaron A. Bauskin A. Mercurio F. Mann M. Ben-Neriah Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 50.Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). LMP1-95-8 protein expressed in 293T cells interacted with immobilized recombinant SCFHOS complex in vitro (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of LMP1-95-8 and HOS-HA in 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis revealed that LMP1-95-8, but not LMP1-Cao, was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged HOS (Fig. 1B, lane 4 versus lane 5). As the G212S substitution mutation within the sequence of a putative degradation motif (DSGXXS) in LMP1-Cao was absent from canonical motifs in LMP1-95-8 and other HOS substrates (Fig. 1C), this motif is likely to contribute to the interaction between HOS and LMP1-95-8. Interaction of HOS with LMP1-95-8 Requires Both Canonical and Cryptic HOS Recognition Sites—We next substituted Gly-212 in LMP1-95-8 for serine. Intriguingly, this mutation alone did not affect the ability of the LMP1 protein to interact with HOS (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that LMP1-95-8 may contain additional sites for HOS binding that are altered in LMP1-Cao. Although the DpSGXXpS motif is known to mediate HOS binding in IκB and β-catenin, it has been shown that motifs with more than three amino acids between the phosphoserines may also be recognized by β-TrCP proteins in precursors of NF-κB transcription factors (51.Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ATF4 transcription factors (50.Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Another DSG sequence containing Ser-350 residue within LMP1-95-8 is absent in LMP1-Cao as a part of 30-bp deletion frequently found in LMP1 isolates from tumors (30.Sandvej K. Peh S.C. Andresen B.S. Pallesen G. Blood. 1994; 84: 4053-4060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, distally located serine 366 is substituted for threonine in LMP1-Cao protein (Fig. 2B), and mutation of Ser-366 is one of the most frequently observed among natural LMP1 isolates (see “Discussion”). We further assessed a potential role of Ser-350 and Ser-366 in HOS binding. Neither S350A nor S366T individual mutants lacked the ability to interact with HOS (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). However, double mutations of LMP1-95-8 such as G212S/S350A or G212S/S366T as well as the triple amino acid substitution (Triple, G212S/S350A/S366T) dramatically inhibited the ability of LMP1 to interact with HOS (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9). These results suggest the existence of a cryptic HOS recognition site that requires the integrity of serines 350 (within the DSG sequence) and 366 in LMP1-95-8, which are deleted or mutated in LMP1-Cao. In addition, these data indicate that both canonical and cryptic HOS recognition sites are required for binding of HOS to LMP1-95-8 and provide a plausible explanation for the inability of LMP1-Cao, in which both sites are altered, to interact with HOS. HOS Is Not Required for LMP1-95-8 Degradation—As LMP1-Cao protein, which cannot bind HOS (Fig. 1B), is more stable than LMP1-95-8 (37.Blake S.M. Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. Virology. 2001; 282: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we were prompted to investigate the role of HOS in the regulation of LMP1 protein stability. To this end, we compared the rate of proteolysis of LMP1-95-8 with its Triple mutant, which exhibited no binding to HOS (Fig. 2A). Contrary to our expectations, pulse-chase analysis of LMP1 proteins showed that the half-life of the Triple mutant was no longer than that of LMP1-95-8 (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that abrogation of HOS binding is not sufficient for stabilization of LMP1 proteins. Furthermore, LMP1-95-8 protein was not stabilized by co-expression of the dominant negative mutant HOSΔF (Fig. 3A). This mutant, which was shown to abrogate degradation of known HOS/β-TrCP substrates (40.Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 41.Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Chan A.M. Igarashi M. Aaronson S.A. Sassoon D.A. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36624-36630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was evidently expressed under the conditions of our experiments, resulting in accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3B). In some experiments we observed a modest stabilization of Triple-LMP1 protein in cells overexpressing HOS; the significance of these observations remains unclear. In addition, although SCFHOS could be successfully bound to LMP1-95-8 (Fig. 1A), we failed to ubiquitinate this protein in vitro under conditions that enabled efficient ubiquitination of IκBα. 2W. Tang, V. Spiegelman, and S. Fuchs, unpublished data. Taken together, these results suggest that despite the ability of LMP1-95-8 to interact with SCFHOS E3 ubiquitin ligase, LMP1-95-8 is not a genuine substrate for this E3 ligase. These findings are in line with conclusions of another group that the C-terminal domain of LMP1-Cao does not contribute to its increased stability (37.Blake S.M. Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. Virology. 2001; 282: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). LMP1-95-8 Is a Pseudo-substrate of SCFHOS Because of the Absence of Ubiquitin-Acceptor Lysines—The recently solved SCFβ-TrCP1 structure predicts that efficiency of ubiquitination by this ligase depends on the location of the ubiquitin-accepting lysine(s) relative to the destruction motif (52.Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). LMP1-95-8 contains a single lysine residue (Lys-330) that is not essential for its ubiquitination (38.Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Lack of convenient ubiquitin conjugation site(s) in proximity to HOS-binding sequences similar to Lys-21/22 within IκBα (23.Rodriguez M.S. Wright J. Thompson J. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Hay R.T. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2425-2435PubMed Google Scholar) or Lys-19 within β-catenin (52.Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) may explain why LMP1-95-8 is not a bona fide substrate for SCFHOS. To investigate this possibility, we substituted two amino acids positioned at a similar spacing from the cryptic HOS recognition site within LMP-95-8 with two lysine residues and compared the rates of degradation of LMP-95-8 and of this 95-8-KK mutant (L339K/M340K). Pulse-chase analysis showed that introduction of the lysines noticeably decreased the half-life of the mutant LMP1 protein (Fig. 4, A and D). Furthermore, inhibition of HOS activities by co-expressing HOSΔF protein stabilized 95-8-KK (Fig. 4, B and D). This result indicates that introduction of lysines in proximity to the HOS cryptic recognition site creates a protein whose degradation is regulated by SCFHOS. To confirm the role of HOS in controlling stability of 95-8-KK, we introduced the L339K/M340K substitution mutation into the background of the Triple mutant, which cannot bind HOS (Fig. 2A). The resulting Triple-KK mutant protein exhibited a half-life similar to that of LMP1-95-8, and the stability of Triple-KK was not increased by co-expression of HOSΔF (Fig. 4, B and D). To corroborate our hypothesis that an increase in the rate of ubiquitination of 95-8-KK results in destabilization of this protein, we carried out in vivo ubiquitination experiments. Co-transfection of LMP1-95-8 with hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin in 293T cells followed by purification of ubiquitinated proteins under stringent denaturing conditions (44.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) revealed that LMP1 is covalently conjugated with ubiquitin in vivo under these conditions (Fig. 4C). Compared with the LMP1-95-8 protein, the 95-8-KK mutant exhibited a noticeably higher extent of ubiquitination (Fig. 4C, lane 5 versus lane 3), and this increase was inhibited by co-expression of HOSΔN (lane 6 versus lane 5). Mutation of HOS recognition sites in the Triple-KK protein abrogated the effect of introducing lysines (Fig. 4C, lane 7). In addition, the dominant negative HOSΔF mutant did not inhibit ubiquitination of either LMP1-95-8 or Triple-KK proteins. These results indicate that introduction of lysines into an LMP1 protein capable of binding to HOS converts the protein into a substrate for HOS-dependent ubiquitination. In all, our evidence suggests that LMP1-95-8 is a pseudo-substrate"
https://openalex.org/W2075377743,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1p plays a critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis. The activity of Aft1p is induced in response to iron starvation and as a consequence the expression of the iron-regulon is increased. We have shown previously that Aft1p is localized to the cytoplasm under iron-replete conditions but that it is localized to the nucleus under iron-depleted conditions. In this study, we identified the transport receptor that mediates the import of Aft1p into the nucleus, located the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences of Aft1p, and examined whether the nuclear import of Aft1p is affected by iron status. In pse1-1 cells, which bear a temperature-sensitive mutation of PSE1, Aft1p was misdirected to the cytoplasm during iron starvation at the restrictive temperature. Aft1p could also directly bind to Pse1p and was dissociated from the complex by Ran-GTP in vitro. These results indicate that Aft1p is imported into the nucleus by Pse1p. Supporting this is that the induction of an Aft1p target gene, FTR1, in response to iron starvation was greatly reduced in pse1-1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the nuclear localization of a mutant Aft1 protein that contains an NLS derived from SV40 was regulated by iron status regardless of whether Pse1p could interact with Aft1p. This suggests that the interaction between Aft1p and Pse1p is not a critical step that controls the iron-regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of Aft1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1p plays a critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis.

This suggests that the interaction between Aft1p and Pse1p is not a critical step that controls the iron-regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of Aft1p. Regulation of the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of transcription factors is a strategy by which eukaryotic cells respond to environmental changes. The nuclear translocation of transcription factors occurs commonly in response to extracellular signals and appears to be a key mechanism by which these factors alter the expression of their target genes (1.Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2.Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The nucleus and the cytoplasm are separated by the nuclear envelope (NE). Molecules are exchanged through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is embedded in the NE. Macromolecules, such as proteins with molecular masses exceeding 40–60 kDa, are imported to or exported from the nucleus via sequence-mediated processes. Transport receptors called karyopherins (also called importins or exportins) recognize specific nuclear import and export sequences (called nuclear localization signals (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization signalMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization signalMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and nuclear export signals (NES), respectively) within their cargo proteins and mediate their translocation across the NPC. The small GTPase Ran plays an essential role in this transport process since it, along with its effector molecules, establishes the directionality of transport. A large family of transport receptors that contain the conserved region required for binding to Ran-GTP have been identified and shown to operate within the multiple pathways of nucleocytoplasmic transport (3.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 4.Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Fourteen transport receptors that are members of the karyopherin β family have been identified in yeast genome databases (6.Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To date, eight of these have been designated as import receptors, five as export receptors, and one as an import and export receptor. In metazoans, the existence of more than 25 karyopherin β members has been demonstrated (7.Yoshida K. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8.Strom A.C. Weis K. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3008.1-3008.9Crossref Google Scholar). These include importin β, the best studied karyopherin β, which often functions in association with an adaptor protein, importin α, to bind cargo proteins (9.Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10.Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr.

Importin α recognizes cargo proteins containing one or two stretches of basic amino acid residues termed the classical NLS (11.Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The sequences recognized by other receptors identified so far are not similar to the classical NLS (2.Jans D.A.

Fluctuation in environmental nutrient concentrations elicits signals that modulate gene expression. Iron is an essential nutrient, but it can be toxic in excess. Therefore, cells have acquired mechanisms through which they maintain iron homeostasis (12.Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.De Freitas J. Wintz H. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Fox T. Vulpe C. Biometals. 2003; 16: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The major iron-responsive transcriptional activator Aft1p plays a critical role in iron homeostasis in budding yeast as its activity is induced in response to iron starvation and as a consequence the expression of the iron-regulon is up-regulated (14.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Aft2p, a paralog of Aft1p, shares 39% homology with Aft1p (16.Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and plays overlapping but non-redundant roles with Aft1p in the transcriptional regulation of the iron regulon (17.Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Aft1p is localized to the cytoplasm in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under iron-replete conditions, but that it is localized to the nucleus under iron-depleted conditions (18.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Aft1p is imported into the nucleus of S. cerevisiae by the nonclassical import receptor Pse1p/Kap121p. Consistent with the importance of PSE1 in the nuclear localization of Aft1p is that the iron-regulon was poorly expressed in a mutant strain deficient in the Pse1p activity and had been subjected to iron-impoverished conditions. We also identified two NLSs of Aft1p and demonstrate that each is sufficient for its PSE1-dependent nuclear import in vivo, which suggests that these two regions are independently recognized by Pse1p. In addition, we demonstrate that a mutant Aft1p containing a classical NLS responds to iron status independently of Pse1p, which suggests that the recognition of Aft1p by Pse1p is not important for the iron-regulated nuclear localization of Aft1p. Yeast Strains and Media—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Aft1p (Aft1p-HA) or its derivatives were created by transforming the strain indicated with pRS416-AFT1-HA or its derivatives. Cells were grown routinely in YPD or synthetic dextrose (SD) medium supplemented with amino acids. To create iron-deprived conditions, cells were grown in SD-Fe media consisting of yeast nitrogen base lacking iron, 2% glucose, amino acid supplements, and 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.1). To create iron-replete conditions, ferrous sulfate and ferrozine were added to final concentrations of 200 and 500 μm, respectively.Table IYeast strain genotypeStrainGenotypeSourceY21MATα ura3-52 his3-609 trp1-63 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101 FRE1-HIS3::LEU2 Δaft1::TRP1(18.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Silver Open table in a new tab Plasmids—pRS416-AFT1-HA has been described previously (18.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To create pRS416-AFT1-SV40-HA, the DNA fragment containing SV40 NLS was excised from pPS1372 (19.Taura T. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7427-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and introduced into the BglII site of pRS416-AFT1-HA. As a template for histidine-tagged Aft1 protein (Aft1p-His) synthesis in vitro, pEU-AFT1-His×6 was constructed by inserting the SmaI-HindIII fragment encoding the region encompassing amino acids 1–473 of Aft1p and the HindIII-BamHI fragment encoding the histidine tag into the EcoRV and BamHI sites of pEU-NII (Invitrotech). pGEX-PSE1 (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and pGEX-KAP95 (21.Noguchi E. Saitoh Y. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were used to express glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Pse1 protein (GST-Pse1p) and GST-fused Kap95 protein (GST-Kap95p), respectively. pET-GSP1G21V (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and pET-GSP1T26N were used to express mutant histidine-tagged Gsp1 proteins. pET-GSP1T26N was constructed by inserting the NdeI-XhoI fragment encoding Gsp1pT26N into NdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b (Novagen). Expression plasmids for the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused proteins were constructed as follows: Within pPS 1372, the ADH promoter was replaced with the MET25 promoter, and the NES derived from the protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) was mutated to create pMET25-SV40 NLS-GFP. The DNA fragments encoding various regions of Aft1p with a ClaI site and SmaI site at each end were then inserted between ClaI and SmaI sites of pMET25-SV40 NLS-GFP. Indirect Immunofluorescence and GFP Microscopy—For indirect immunofluorescence, cells expressing HA-tagged proteins were fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4% for 30 min, followed by the addition of buffered formaldehyde (4% formaldehyde, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2) for 90 min. Cell walls were digested with 300 units of zymolyase (Seikagaku Kogyo) in SPM (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 2% SDS for 2 min. Spheroplasts were fixed on polylysine-coated cover glass using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 10 min, and then incubated with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Signals were amplified by Alexa Fluor 594 Signal-Amplification Kit (Molecular Probes) and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. For GFP microscopy, cells were cultured in medium lacking methionine to induce the expression of the GFP-fused proteins. Shifting the temperature from the permissive temperature to the restrictive temperature was performed before the proteins were induced. GFP-fused proteins were visualized directly by fluorescent microscopy. The expression of the tagged proteins was measured by Western blot and found to be similar in each of the strains under the different iron conditions employed. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The expression and purification of recombinant GST-Pse1p and GST-Kap95p were performed as follows: Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pGEX-PSE1 or pGEX-KAP95 were grown in LB at 37 °C. At an OD600 nm of 0.5, the incubation temperature was shifted to 20 °C and then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After another 2 h at 20 °C, the cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS. The cells were then lysed using 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h and nucleic acids were digested with 5 μg/ml DNaseI and 5 μg/ml RNaseA. The recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The expression and extraction of His-Gsp1pG21V and His-Gsp1pT26N were performed in the same way as for the GST-fused proteins except that 5 μm GTP or GDP was added to all buffers. After purification of His-Gsp1pG21V and His-Gsp1pT26N by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography, the buffer was exchanged with Ran buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) using HiTrap Desalting (Amersham Biosciences). Aft1p-His was synthesized using a PROTEIOS kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrotech). Binding Assay—To examine the direct interaction between Pse1p and Aft1p, glutathione-Sepharose 4B bound to GST-Pse1p or GST-Kap95p was incubated with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing Aft1p-His for 8 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), the protein bound to the beads was eluted, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and detected by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with an anti-histidine tag antibody (Qiagen). Dissociation of Aft1p-Pse1p Complexes by Ran-GTP—His-Gsp1pG21V and His-Gsp1pT26N were loaded with GTP or GDP as follows: His-Gsp1pG21V and His-Gsp1pT26N dissolved in Ran buffer were incubated in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 4 mm GTP or GDP for 2 h at room temperature. After the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 50 mm, the mixture was further incubated for 20 min on ice, and then the buffer was exchanged for Ran-G buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). GST-Pse1p and Aft1p-His were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as above. The beads were divided into two equal parts and incubated with the GTP-loaded form of His-Gsp1pG21V (His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP) or the GDP-loaded form of His-Gsp1pT26N (His-Gsp1pT26N-GDP) for 2 h at room temperature. The supernatant, which contained the unbound fraction, was collected and concentrated by acetone precipitation. The proteins bound to the beads were eluted as the bound fraction. These samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Total Yeast RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Cells cultured to mid-log phase were harvested and subjected to total RNA preparation as described (22.Erkine A.M. Magrogan S.F. Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a Biodyne B membrane (Pall corporation) and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes for FTR1 (nucleotides from 1 to 649 of the FTR1 open reading frame) and ACT1 (nucleotides from 37 to 1070 of the ACT1 open reading frame). The hybridized membrane was analyzed by BAS-2000 (Fuji Film). Pse1p Is Required for the Nuclear Localization of Aft1p—We have previously shown that Aft1p stays in the cytoplasm under iron-replete conditions (Fig. 1A, panel 2) but that it localizes to the nucleus under iron-depleted conditions (Fig. 1A, panel 1) (18.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether the nuclear import of Aft1p is regulated by iron, we first tried to identify the import receptor for Aft1p. The Aft1p sequence contains several short stretches of basic amino acids that could potentially act as classical NLSs (although nuclear proteins that are imported via the non-classical pathway are also rich in basic amino acids). As described above, proteins containing classical NLSs are imported into the nucleus by the transport receptor complex that consists of Importin α and Importin β. The yeast homologs of these proteins are Srp1p/Kap60p and Rsl1p/Kap95p, respectively. Thus, we examined the nuclear localization of Aft1p in temperaturesensitive mutants of SRP1 (srp1-31) or RSL1 (rsl1-4) (Table I) expressing Aft1p-HA by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A (panels 3 and 5), Aft1p localized to the nucleus under iron-depleted conditions in both strains even at the restrictive temperature (37 °C), as was also observed for the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A, panel 1). However, as expected, GFP fused with a classical NLS derived from SV40 (SV40 NLS-GFP) driven by the MET 25 promoter as a control could not accumulate in the nucleus in these mutant strains at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) whereas it did localize in the nucleus in the wild-type strain (compare Fig. 1B, panel 1 with panels 2 and 3). This indicates that Aft1p is not imported into the nucleus by the classical NLS pathway. We next studied the localization of Aft1p in other strains that harbor mutations in karyopherin β family members. In strains carrying mutations in KAP104, KAP123, SXM1, NMD5, and PDR6, no defect in the nuclear accumulation of Aft1p was observed (data not shown). However, we found that when the strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in PSE1 (pse1-1) was cultured at the restrictive temperature (37 °C), Aft1p-HA does not accumulate in the nucleus during iron starvation (Fig. 1A, panel 7), which suggests that the nuclear localization of Aft1p requires Pse1p. However, the import of proteins with classical NLSs was not perturbed in pse1-1 cells because SV40 NLS-GFP accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, panel 4). Thus, not all nuclear proteins are mislocalized in pse1-1 cells under the conditions used in these experiments. Pse1p Directly Binds to Aft1p and Is Dissociated from Aft1p by Ran-GTP—To confirm that Pse1p is the transport receptor for Aft1p, we examined the interaction between Aft1p and Pse1p in vitro. GST-fused Pse1 protein (GST-Pse1p) and histidine-tagged Aft1 protein (Aft1p-His) were synthesized and subjected to a GST pull-down assay. Thus, GST-Pse1p was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with Aft1p-His. GST-fused Rsl1p/Kap95p (GST-Kap95p) was used as a negative control. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-His antibody and by protein staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, Aft1p-His was retained by GST-Pse1p but not by GST-Kap95p, which indicates that Pse1p directly interacts with Aft1p. In general, stable complexes of the import receptors and cargos that are formed in the cytoplasm are dissociated in the nucleus by binding to the GTP-bound form of Ran (3.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 4.Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). To further investigate the specificity of the interaction between Pse1p and Aft1p, the disassembly of this interaction by the GTP-bound form of Gsp1p, a yeast homolog of Ran, was examined using histidine-tagged mutant Gsp1 proteins (His-Gsp1pG21V and His-Gsp1pT26N) that had been purified from E. coli. Gsp1pG21V harbors a mutation that causes the loss of the GTPase activity of Gsp1p (23.Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), while Gsp1pT26N is known to bind only GDP (24.Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, GTP-loaded His-Gsp1pG21V (His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP) or GDP-loaded His-Gsp1pT26N (His-Gsp1pT26N-GDP) was added to glutathione-Sepharose bead-immobilized GST-Pse1p to which Aft1p-His was bound. In the presence of His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP, Aft1p-His was dissociated from GST-Pse1p (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). However, unlike His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP, Aft1p was still associated with Pse1p in the presence of His-Gsp1pT26N-GDP (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Together, these results suggest that Pse1p mediates the nuclear import of Aft1p. pse1-1 Cells Have a Defect in Aft1p-induced Transcription—As revealed above, Pse1p mediates the nuclear import of Aft1p. Consequently, we hypothesized that the impaired nuclear import of Aft1p may cause the pse1-1 cells to be defective in the induction of the Aft1p regulon, thereby leading to a defect in iron homeostasis. To address this, we analyzed the expression in wild-type and pse1-1 cells at 37 °C of an Aft1p target gene, FTR1, which encodes the iron permease that is required for high affinity iron uptake in response to iron starvation. The mRNA levels of FTR1 in pse1-1 cells were indeed much lower than in wild-type cells in iron-starved conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4), although the induction of FTR1 was not completely lost in pse1-1 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). This implies that pse1-1 cells have a defect in iron homeostasis. Identification of Two Independent NLSs of Aft1p—To identify the region in Aft1p required for its nuclear import, we constructed a series of vectors that express various regions of Aft1p fused in-frame with GFP under the control of the MET25 promoter. The fusion proteins were then expressed in the wild-type strain cultured under iron-depleted conditions, and their localization was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B (panels 1 and 2), fusion proteins containing amino acids 198–225 or 332–365 of Aft1p (Aft1p-(198–225)-GFP and Aft1p-(332–365)-GFP) both localized to the nucleus, which suggests that each of these two regions mediates the nuclear import of Aft1p. Each of these two regions contains a stretch of basic amino acid residues, namely, KPKKKR (residues 202–207) and RKPK (residues 352–355), respectively. This is similar to what is seen in classical NLSs and consequently we wondered if these regions could be recognized by the classical nuclear import receptor complex, even though whole Aft1p is imported into the nucleus by Pse1p. However, when Aft1p-(198–225)-GFP and Aft1p-(332–365)-GFP were expressed in the srp1-31 and rsl1-4 strains, both regions were able to localize to the nucleus at the restrictive temperature (data not shown). In contrast, the mislocalization of these fusion proteins was evident in pse1-1 cells cultured at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 4B, panels 3 and 4). This implies that each region in Aft1p (namely, amino acids 198–225 or 332–365) functions independently as an NLS for Pse1p. Further deletion of each region led to the loss of nuclear localization (data not shown), as has been previously reported for the NLSs in other cargo proteins that are imported by Pse1p (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25.Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17712-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some of the sequences that have been reported to date as being NLSs recognized by Pse1p are not homologous to each other except in that they contain basic amino acids (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25.Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26.Chaves S.R. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2544-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As described above, many basic amino acids are located in the Aft1p NLSs. Thus, we assessed the contribution of these residues to NLS function. The residues within or proximal to the basic amino acid stretch were mutated, and the subcellular localization of the resulting mutant Aft1p-GFPs in wild-type cells under iron-depleted conditions was then determined. Aft1p-(198–225)-GFP that contains six alanine substitutions in amino acids 202–207 (m(198–225)-GFP) was misdirected (Fig. 5, A and B, panel 1). Mutation of amino acids 332–335 (m1(332–365)-GFP) or 352–356 (m2(332–365)-GFP) to alanine residues also partially impaired the NLS function of the 332–365 region, and the double mutation (m3(332–365)-GFP) completely abolished the nuclear localization of Aft1p-(332–365)-GFP (Fig. 5, A and B, panel 2). In addition, we tested whether the mutations introduced in these two regions abolish the nuclear localization of Aft1p. Thus, we introduced the same alanine substitutions in m(198–225)-GFP and m3(332–365)-GFP into the full-length Aft1p fused with GFP (Aft1p(mut-nls)-GFP) (Fig. 5C), and observed its subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 5D (panel 2), GFP-fused Aft1p(mut-nls) no longer accumulates in the nucleus, even under iron-starved conditions. However, when the alanine substitutions in either m(198–225)-GFP or m3(332– 365)-GFP were singly introduced into the full-length Aft1p so that one of the NLSs would remain intact, the mutant Aft1p-GFPs accumulated in the nucleus, albeit more weakly than the wild-type Aft1p-GFP (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both of the Aft1p NLS regions, namely, amino acids 198–225 and 332–365, are necessary and sufficient for the nuclear import of intact Aft1p. Pse1p Does Not Play a Key Role in the Iron-regulated Subcellular Localization of Aft1p—We examined the effect of iron concentration on the nuclear import of Aft1p and thus assayed the subcellular localization of Aft1p-(198–225)-GFP and Aft1p-(332–365)-GFP in iron-rich medium. Both Aft1p-(198–225)-GFP and Aft1p-(332–365)-GFP were localized in the nucleus under iron-replete conditions (Fig. 4A), which indicates that the direct interaction between Pse1p and NLSs of Aft1p is not affected by iron levels. Although the NLSs of Aft1p are imported to the nucleus irrespective of the iron levels, it is still possible that under iron-replete conditions the Aft1p NLSs are masked either by a conformational change of Aft1p itself or by an unknown partner. To examine this possibility, we constructed two Aft1p mutants, Aft1p-SV40 and Aft1p(mut-nls)-SV40. In these mutants, the C terminus of either the wild-type or the NLS-mutated Aft1p was fused to the NLS of SV40, which is recognized by the classical import receptor complex (Fig. 6A). It is unlikely that an exogenous NLS located at the extreme C terminus of Aft1p would be routinely masked if an NLS-masking mechanism is involved in the regulation of Aft1p localization. As shown in Fig. 1, wild-type Aft1p cannot localize to the nucleus during iron starvation in pse1-1 cells. In contrast, Aft1p-SV40, which is imported into the nucleus via the classical NLS pathway, localized to the nucleus under iron-depleted conditions and stayed in the cytoplasm under iron-replete conditions in pse1-1 cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 6B, panel 1 and 2). Alternatively, Aft1p(mut-nls)-SV40, which is no longer imported to the nucleus by Pse1p (see Fig. 5A), localized to the nucleus and the subcellular localization of Aft1p(mutnls)-SV40 expressed in Δaft1 cells was regulated by iron status similar to wild-type Aft1p expressed in Δaft1 cells (Fig. 6C, panels 1 and 2). These results indicate that the accessibility and subsequent interaction of Pse1p with Aft1p are not critical events that control the iron-regulated subcellular localization of Aft1p. We have previously reported that the subcellular localization of Aft1p is regulated by iron status. To understand the mechanisms regulating Aft1p activity, the molecular basis of its nucleo-cytoplasmic transport needs to be elucidated. In this report, in vivo genetic evidence and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that Pse1p is an import receptor for Aft1p. Moreover, the pse1-1 mutant strain, which is impaired in the nuclear import of Aft1p, showed a defect in iron homeostasis since FTR1, a target gene of Aft1p, is expressed at lower levels in these cells upon iron starvation. Pse1p was first reported as an auxiliary import receptor of ribosomal protein L25, since the defective import of L25 observed in the kap123Δ strain was reversed by the overexpression of Pse1p (28.Schlenstedt G. Smirnova E. Deane R. Solsbacher J. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Ponstingl H. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6237-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, Pse1p was also shown to be a transporter for several transcription factors (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25.Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17712-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The NLS-containing regions identified within these proteins to date do not share any distinct homology. However, it appears that the regions required for NLS function within these proteins are relatively large compared with classical NLSs and that they all contain a short stretch of basic amino acids, including serine and proline amino acids. In this regard, the Aft1p NLSs that we identified here are similar to those observed in other proteins transported by Pse1p. We found that multiple successive mutations in the basic amino acid stretches were needed to impair the NLS activity of these regions, since single alanine substitutions within these residues was not effective (data not shown). This suggests that proper folding may be needed before these NLSs in the cargo proteins can be recognized by Pse1p. It has been reported that Pse1p preferentially binds to unphosphorylated Pho4p (25.Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As Aft1p has been reported to be a phosphoprotein (30.Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it would be of interest to determine if the phosphorylation of Aft1p affects its interaction with Pse1p. The data reported here suggest that the interaction of Aft1p and Pse1p is not regulated by iron status, as we found that the iron concentration did not affect the nuclear localization of the two Aft1p NLS-GFP fusion proteins. This indicates that the binding of Aft1p NLSs to Pse1p occurs with similar affinity in iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions, although we did not extensively compare the rate of import. It has been reported that the nuclear localization of a protein can be regulated by the intraor intermolecular masking of the NLS that inhibits the interaction between the NLS and its import receptor (31.Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 32.Akakura S. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14649-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to be a mechanism affecting the recognition of Aft1p by Pse1p since SV40 NLS fused to the C terminus of Aft1p can substitute for the Aft1p NLSs. Nevertheless, these findings do not completely exclude the possibility that the import of Aft1p may play some role in regulating its activity. It may be that this protein is anchored in the cytoplasm, which overrides the presence of any NLS, even though the NLS of the cargo is accessible to the import receptor. Supporting this notion is a recent report that demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf2, which is essential for the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying and oxidative stress enzymes, is bound in the cytoplasm to Keap1. Keap1 is closely related to the Drosophila actin-binding protein Kelch, which is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton. Upon exposure to electrophiles, the Keap1-Nrf2 complex is disrupted and Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus (33.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Aft1p interacts with such an anchoring protein and is located to the cytoplasm in the presence of iron but that when iron is scarce, it is released and results in its translocation into the nucleus. It is also possible that the subcellular localization of Aft1p might be regulated solely at the export step, as is the case for Yap1p (20.Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The recognition of Yap1 by the export receptor, Crm1p/Xpo1p is regulated in a redox-sensitive manner (34.Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I.

Further investigation is required to determine which of these possibilities are true and to fully understand the mechanisms that regulate Aft1p localization in response to iron status.

https://openalex.org/W2020402589,"GCP170, a member of the golgin family associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane, was found to have a Golgi localization signal at the NH2-terminal region (positions 137–237). Using this domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified a novel protein that interacted with GCP170. The 2.0-kilobase mRNA encoding a 137-amino acid protein of 16 kDa designated GCP16 was ubiquitously expressed. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that GCP16 was co-localized with GCP170 and giantin in the Golgi region. Despite the absence of a hydrophobic domain sufficient for participating in membrane localization, GCP16 was found to be tightly associated with membranes like an integral membrane protein. Labeling experiments with [3H]palmitic acid and mutational analysis demonstrated that GCP16 was acylated at Cys69 and Cys72, accounting for its tight association with the membrane. A mutant without potential acylation sites (C69A/C72A) was no longer localized to the Golgi, indicating that the acylation is prerequisite for the Golgi localization of GCP16. Although the mutant GCP16, even when overexpressed, had no effect on protein transport, overexpression of the wild type GCP16 caused an inhibitory effect on protein transport from the Golgi to the cell surface. Taken together, these results indicate that GCP16 is the acylated membrane protein, associated with GCP170, and possibly involved in vesicular transport from the Golgi to the cell surface."

We were able to insert micromolar affinity binding sites for zinc between transmembrane region (TM) 2 and TM3 where the metal ion alone was able to activate this peptide binding G-protein-coupled receptor. The exact conformation of the metal ion interactions allowed us to predict the orientation of the helices, and remodeling of the receptor protein indicated that Glu100 and Ile104 in TM2 and Asp122 and Ile125 in TM3 are directed toward a putative area of activation of the receptor. The molecular model suggests that a rotation of TM3 may be important for activation of the MC4R. Previous models of G-protein-coupled receptors have suggested that unlocking of a stabilizing interaction between the DRY motif, in the cytosolic part of TM3, and TM6 is important for the activation process. We suggest that this unlocking process may be facilitated through creation of a new interaction between TM3 and TM2 in the MC4R.

The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorMC4Rmelanocortin 4 receptorTMtransmembrane. require a membrane to maintain their functionality and structural integrity. This makes crystallization of these receptors difficult, hampering structural determination. Crystallization of the first mammalian GPCR, the bovine rhodopsin, was an important break-through (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Earlier three-dimensional models of GPCRs were mainly based on cryoelectron microscopy data generated from bacteriorhodopsin (2Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), assuming a common fold in the transmembrane (TM) regions. Such assumptions had clear limitations as bacteriorhodopsin is not a GPCR and has no sequence homology to human GPCRs. Even though the bovine rhodopsin model is detailed, it is not clear how applicable it is for different GPCRs, considering the large variety of these receptors in the human genome. Today it is still an unrealistic task to crystallize the hundreds of GPCRs found in the human genome mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining material suitable for solubilization and crystallization studies. Site-directed mutagenesis has played an important role in determining the putative interaction of a ligand to a single amino acid within a GPCR. Such interactions, however, may not always be informative about the orientation of the helix bundles, which is crucial information for building structural models. Moreover, the results of alanine replacement studies in most cases cannot discriminate between specific ligand-receptor interactions and changes that cause unspecific conformational alterations that perturb the binding. This is particularly evident when the ligand is a flexible molecule like a peptide or a protein. One alternative approach for studying the three-dimensional structure of GPCRs is construction of a high affinity zinc-binding site between the helices, using two His residues facing each other (3Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Nielsen S.M. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Such artificial intrahelical and interhelical binding sites have been used effectively to determine the orientation and exact distances between the α-helices of the tachykinin, opioid, and the β-adrenergic receptor families (4Thirstrup K.

A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, in two previous studies (6Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), an interhelical binding site has been created that allowed the metal ion to act as an agonist and activate a GPCR. The coordination of the metal ion binding sites is well characterized in numerous x-ray structures of soluble proteins, and the distances between the chelating atoms and the metal ion are known, providing excellent specific information regarding the orientation of the relative helices (3Elling C.E.

Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptor melanocortin 4 receptor transmembrane. The MC4R is a Gs-coupled receptor belonging to the group of rhodopsin-like class α receptors (9Fredriksson R. Lagerstrom M.C. Lundin L.G. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). The MCRs seem to be remarkably well conserved through evolution (10Ringholm A. Fredriksson R. Poliakova N. Yan Y.-L. Postlethwait J.H. Larhammar D. Schiöth H.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 6-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The MC4R is exclusively expressed in brain, particularly in hypothalamus, and has an important role for central regulation of food intake and energy balance. Agonistic stimulation of the receptor reduces food intake, whereas antagonists are among the most potent orexigenic agents available (11Kask A. Mutulis F. Muceniece R. Pahkla R. Mutule I. Wikberg J.E. Rago L. Schioth H.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5006-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This receptor, and the closely related MC3R, also has an important role in regulating the metabolic rate and general body weight homeostasis. The MC4R is thus one of the most pursued targets for the development of drugs to treat obesity and anorexia (12Schioth H.B. Watanobe H. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 38: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study we constructed a molecular model of the human MC4R based on the crystal structure of rhodopsin (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). We also inserted His residues into several positions in the receptor in order to generate metal ion binding sites. We were able to create artificial high affinity zinc sites where the zinc ion was able to concentration dependently increase cAMP levels. The results were used to construct a refined model for the MC4R protein that suggests that interaction between TM2 and TM3 is important for the activation process of this receptor. Molecular Modeling—The model was based on the coordinates from the high resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The TM regions were reconstructed to avoid problems with structural features derived from specific amino acid sequences found in the rhodopsin receptor but not in the MC4R or vice versa. The resulting TM (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

The positions of the three first amino acids in the cytosolic part of the helices in the rhodopsin model were used to orientate the helical segments in relation to each other. Segments of the extra- and intracellular parts of the receptor were excluded from the model due to length differences between the rhodopsin and the MC4R and due to inaccuracy in computer predictions of random coil structures. Modeling was performed with Sybyl 6.4 software (Tripos, Germany) running on work station O2 (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). Helices were given ideal α-helical conformation, and charges were assigned and helical structure refined using energy minimization in the subroutine Powell. Minimizations were carried out until convergence at 0.05 kcal/(mol A) energy gradient difference between successive minimizations steps was reached (maximum iteration 1000, non-bonded cut-off = 8 Å, dielectric constant = 1). Initial optimization was carried out using simplex to decrease the number of iterations required for convergence. The whole model was then minimized giving a receptor model with the energy of –288.3 kcal/mol. Refinements of the model were made after mutational data and then re-minimized giving a final energy of –294.6 kcal/mol. Distance measurements were made between the α-carbons of the pinpointed residues. Construction of Receptor Mutants—Point mutations were introduced in the human MC4R by PCR in two steps using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). Specific end primers containing HindIII (Amersham Biosciences) and XhoI (Amersham Biosciences) sites were used together with mutated internal primers in two steps using the following conditions: 30 s at 95 °C for one cycle, then 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 50 °C and 1 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles followed by 5 min at 72 °C. In the first step, overlapping fragments containing the desired mutation were generated. Fragments were purified using Qiagen Gel Extraction MiniElute kit (Qiagen, Stockholm, Sweden) and subsequently used as templates for a second PCR amplification to obtain the full-length mutated receptor. These fragments were digested with HindIII and XhoI, purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and ligated into the modified pCEP4 turbo expression vector. The integrity of each construct was controlled with restriction analysis and DNA sequencing using ABI PRISM Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The extension products were analyzed on an ABI PRISM-310 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analyzed using Sequencer 3.0 (Gene Codes) and found to be identical to the sequence of the desired MC4R mutant. Expression of Mutant Receptor in HEK 293-EBNA—Semi-stable cell lines expressing the different constructs were made from HEK 293-EBNA cells through transfection with 15 μg of plasmid-DNA using FuGENE™ Transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was diluted in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nut Mix F-12 without l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplied with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2.4 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 250 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml) (Invitrogen) for 48 h before addition of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested in 1× PBS after 3 weeks of selection. Membrane Preparation—After the harvest, the cells were homogenized using an UltraTurrax. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 3 min at 1300 rpm, and the supernatant was recentrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Receptor Binding Assays—Binding studies were performed using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl (for optimization of buffer system see Supplemental Material, 1A–C), in a final volume of 100 μl for 3 h at room temperature using 10–20 μg of membrane preparation per well, aiming at 60–70% specific binding. Competition studies were performed with various concentrations of ZnCl2 (Sigma) or non-labeled NDP-MSH peptide (Neosystem, France) included in the incubation mixture along with 0.6 nm125I-labeled NDP-MSH. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of radioactivity remaining bound to the cell homogenate after incubation in the presence of 1000 nm unlabeled NDP-MSH. Incubation was terminated by filtration through GF/C filters, Filtermat A (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland), which had been pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Sigma), using a TOMTEC Mach III cell harvester (Orange, CT). The filters were washed with 5.0 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, per well at 4 °C and dried at 60 °C. The dried filters were then treated with MeltiLex A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) melt-on scintillator sheets and counted with Wallac 1450 (Wizard automatic Microbeta counter). The results were analyzed with Prism 3.0 GraphPad (San Diego, CA). All binding assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Non-transfected HEK 293-EBNA cells did not show any specific binding for 125I-labeled NDP-MSH. The radioligand NDP-MSH was labeled by the chloramine-T method and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). cAMP Assay—cAMP was assayed on semi-stable HEK 293-EBNA cells pre-treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 250 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma). For antagonist studies, 10–20 μg of cells were incubated in a 300-μl reaction volume with ZnCl2 at three different concentrations together with various concentrations (serial dilutions) of NDP-MSH for 1 h at 37 °C. All points were done in duplicate, and the measurements for each concentration were repeated at least three times. Agonistic studies were performed with various concentrations (serial dilutions) of NDP-MSH or ZnCl2. Non-transfected HEK 293-EBNA cells showed no cAMP response to NDP-MSH or ZnCl2. The incubations were terminated by addition of 25 μl of 4.4 m perchloric acid and neutralized by addition of 45 μl of 5 m KOH. Levels of cAMP were then measured using radioassay (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular Modeling and Placement of Initial Mutations—A preliminary molecular model of the MC4R was generated using the coordinates from the high resolution structure of the inactive conformation of bovine rhodopsin (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). We deliberately did not take into account any constraint from previous mutagenesis studies on the MCRs (13Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E. Harmon C.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 164-179Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on our preliminary model, His residues were inserted into several positions close to the extracellular parts of the receptor. These positions were predicted to be facing the binding pocket, thus enabling the formation of a zinc-binding site possible to induce activation of the receptor or to inhibit ligand binding thereon. In this way we created the following single mutants (among a number of others): MC4R-I103H and MC4R-I104H at the top of TM2, MC4R-I125H at the top of TM3, and MC4R-F284H and MC4R-N285H at the top of TM7. In the preliminary model Ile104 was orientated toward TM3, 11 Å away from the TM3 backbone. Position Ile103 was in close proximity to Ile104 but turned toward the lipid bilayer. Ile125 was facing TM2, 14 Å from the α-carbon of Ile104 but one helical turn up. Position Phe284 was placed in TM7, facing TM3 at a distance of 17 Å from the α-carbon of Ile125. Asn285 was positioned in TM7, 18 Å away from the backbone of Ile104 in TM2. Naturally occurring zinc-binding residues, His and Asp, in these areas of the TM regions were also investigated by creating Ala-substituted mutants: MC4R-D122A (TM3), MC4R-D126A (TM3), MC4R-H283A (TM7), and MC4R-D298A (TM7). Receptor Binding Analysis of Initial Mutants—At first we optimized the ligand binding conditions (see Supplemental Material, 1C). The binding results show that the wild-type MC4R bound zinc with about 20 μm affinity (Table I). This natural binding site for zinc in the human MC4R was reported during our studies by another group (16Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with ours. The introduction of the His residues listed above did not affect the binding of NDP-MSH significantly. However, MC4R-I104H (TM2) and MC4R-I125H (TM3) both gained 26-fold in affinity for zinc compared with the wild-type receptor (Table I). Moreover, the MC4R-I103H mutant in TM2 showed a 49-fold increase in zinc affinity. We also found an increase in affinity to zinc for two mutants in TM7, MC4R-F284H and MC4R-N285H, 8- and 19-fold, respectively. As mentioned above several alanine mutations were made on residues that may have the capability to create a high affinity binding site for zinc. Several of these mutants showed reduced zinc binding affinity without greatly influencing the NDP-MSH binding. The MC4R-D122A (TM3) lost all detectable affinity to zinc but maintained its affinity to NDP-MSH. The MC4R-H283 (TM7) mutant showed a 21-fold decrease in affinity for zinc without affecting the binding to NDP-MSH. Replacing Asp in position 298, creating MC4R-D298A, did not affect the Ki value for NDP-MSH, although the affinity of zinc was reduced below 1000 nm or at least 500-fold. The MC4R-D126A (TM3) mutant did, in agreement with previous results on the mouse MC4R (14Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E. Harmon C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), lose all affinity to NDP-MSH and was therefore impossible to study further.Table ICompetition binding experiments with NDP-MSH or ZnCl2 on HEK 293-EBNA cells expressing the human wild-type receptor (hMC4 wt) or MC4 mutant receptorReceptorKi NDP-MSHKi ZnCl2Fold change in ZnCl2 affinity (+/-)nmμmhMC4 wt12.3 ± 1.620.07 ± 1.33I103H58.0 ± 3.20.41 ± 0.07+49.0I104H6.73 ± 1.10.76 ± 0.03+26.4D122A37.2 ± 1.3>1000I125H39.4 ± 2.40.76 ± 0.04+26.4H126ANBaNB, no detectable binding.NBH283A9.43 ± 0.8429 ± 45-21.5F284H5.9 ± 0.612.52 ± 0.52+8.0N285H4.4 ± 0.61.07 ± 0.61+18.8D298A3.9 ± 0.7>1000a NB, no detectable binding. Open table in a new tab Studies of Intracellular Coupling and Further Mutagenesis— Repeated second messenger studies on the wild-type receptor revealed no increased levels of intracellular cAMP upon exposure to zinc in our assay. Our antagonistic studies unveiled an inhibitory effect of zinc at 32.9 μm (see Table II and Fig. 1) in accordance with the binding studies (Table I). In agreement with several previous studies, NDP-MSH stimulation showed an agonistic response of 8.9 nm for the wild-type construct. The single mutants mentioned above responded agonistically to NDP-MSH displaying decreased EC50 values in comparison with the wild-type receptor (Table III). Cells expressing these constructs showed no increase in basal cAMP production. Interestingly, zinc induced cAMP production with a potency of 5.9 μm (Table III) in cells expressing the MC4R-I104H mutant, whereas cells transfected with MC4R-I103H showed no agonistic response. Moreover, zinc was able to inhibit the agonistic response of NDP-MSH, in cells expressing the MC4R-I103H mutant, with a Ki value of 42.1 μm (Table II). We subsequently investigated whether zinc was forming an interhelical or intrahelical agonistic binding site between the His in position 104 and a naturally occurring amino acid residue in TM3 or TM2. The most likely residues according to the original model were Asp122 in TM3 and Glu100 in TM2. Therefore, we replaced these residues with Ala forming the double mutants MC4R-I104H/D122A and MC4R-I104H/E100A. Double mutant MC4R-I104H/D122A was unable to respond to zinc, whereas the double mutant MC4R-I104H/E100A showed an agonistic response to zinc at 0.7 μm. These data are shown in Fig. 2A.Table IIZinc induced inhibition of cAMP production on HEK 293-EBNA cells expressing the human wild type receptor (hMC4 wt) or the mutated receptor constructs MC4-I103H or MC4-D122AReceptorEC50 NDP-MSHIC50 ZnCl2nmμmhMC4 wt8.9 ± 0.4532.9I103H258 ± 24.942.1D122A115 ± 29.6110.0 Open table in a new tab Table IIIcAMP production in response to NDP-MSH or ZnCl2 in HEK 293-EBNA cells expressing the wild-type receptor (hMC4 wt) or mutated receptor constructsReceptorEC50 NDP-MSHEC50 ZnCl2nmμmhMC4 wt8.90 ± 0.45NSaNS, no stimulation.E100A905 ± 87NSI103H258 ± 25NSI104H43.0 ± 19.25.91 ± 0.92D122A115 ± 30NSI125H28.4 ± 1.43.87 ± 1.69I104H/D122A8960 ± 200NSI104H/I125H7.45 ± 4.513.00 ± 1.49I104H/E100A433 ± 2380.70 ± 0.34I125H/E100A3890 ± 2140NSI125H/D122A554 ± 622.18 ± 1.18a NS, no stimulation.

According to the original model, one highly plausible residue for interhelical interaction with the His in position 125 was Glu100 in TM2. There was also a possibility for an intrahelical interaction between I125H and Asp122. However, this did not appear to be the case since the double mutant MC4R-I125H/D122A responded to zinc with a potency of 2.2 μm. Upon replacement of Glu100 with Ala, the double mutant MC4R-E100A/I125H was unable to respond to zinc. These results are shown in Fig. 2B. Remodeling of the MC4R—An interaction between the carboxylate group of Asp or Glu and a zinc ion typically occurs when the metal-oxygen distance is in the range of 2.3–2.6 Å (8Christianson D.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the distance between the distant nitrogen in the imidazole of His and the zinc ion is expected to vary between 1.9 and 2.2 Å (17Chakrabarti P. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After inclusion of the zinc atomic radius of 0.74 Å, a measurement between the respective α-carbons will increase the distance with 7.5–9.2 Å, giving a maximum distance of 12.3–14.8 Å between two zinc-chelating amino acids. Our preliminary MC4R model was re-defined in order to fit the data mentioned above. Accordingly, TM3 was rotated around its own longitudinal axis ∼76° counterclockwise, making the interacting residues in TM3 facing the corresponding residues in TM2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The distance between the α-carbon of Asp122 in TM3 and I104H in TM2 was calculated to 10 Å. The corresponding distance between the α-carbon of Glu100 in TM2 and I125H in TM3 was estimated to be 8 Å, both interactions clearly within the maximum chelating distance of 12.3–14.8 Å. The distances in the perimeter of the helical bundle were measured as described in Fig. 3D. Comparison between orientations in the crystallized bovine rhodopsin receptor and the remodeled human MC4R shows a clear spatial agreement (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). TM1 and TM2 show agreement regarding the orientations of the highly conserved residues Asn62 (TM1) and Asp90 (TM2). The rhodopsin model and our new model also share the same spatial arrangement for Asp298 and Tyr302 in the well conserved (D/N)PXXY motif in the bottom of TM7. The highly conserved Asp90 in TM2, which corresponds to Asp83 in bovine rhodopsin, is pointing toward the cavity between TM7, TM1, TM2, and TM3 as in the rhodopsin model, where it is participating in an interaction with Asp298 in TM7 (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), and Trp258 in the well conserved CWXP motif in TM6 is directed toward the binding cavity. This amino acid is believed to interact with the C13-methyl group of retinal in the bovine rhodopsin model (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Initially, we created a preliminary model of the MC4R based on the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin receptor. Subsequently, His residues were inserted into several positions in order to create artificial metal ion binding sites. The most interesting mutagenesis results were obtained from those at the extracellular parts of TM2 and TM3. Three of our mutants, MC4R-I103H (TM2), MC4R-I104H (TM2), and MC4R-I125H (TM3), remarkably increased the zinc affinity of the receptor by 25–50-fold. Moreover, zinc was able to induce cAMP production with a potency of 5.9 μm in cells expressing the MC4R-I104H mutant, whereas cells transfected with MC4R-I103H showed no agonistic response. Furthermore, zinc was able to inhibit the agonistic response of NDP-MSH in cells expressing the MC4R-I103H mutant, with a Ki value of 42.1 μm (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the single His-substituted MC4R-I125H construct also showed an agonistic response of 3.9 μm upon exposure to zinc. The residues highly plausible to interact with the His-substituted positions were subsequently replaced by Ala which is unable to bind zinc. Strikingly, the double mutant MC4R-I104H/D122A was unable to respond to zinc, whereas the double mutant MC4R-I104H/E100A showed an agonistic response to zinc at 0.7 μm (Fig. 2A). This indicates that I104H is forming an agonistic interhelical zinc site with Asp122, connecting TM2 and TM3 horizontally. Since MC4R-I104H/E100A could respond to zinc, the possibility of a solitary intrahelical site was unlikely. It was evident that the agonistic response derived by the single mutant MC4R-I125H was due to Glu100 (TM2) since the double mutant MC4R-E100A/I125H was unable to respond to zinc. There was also a possibility for an intrahelical interaction between I125H (TM3) and Asp122 (TM3). However, this did not appear to be the case since the double mutant MC4R-I125H/D122A responded to zinc with a potency of 2.2 μm (Fig. 2B). Taken together this shows that we have created two separate interhelical agonistic binding sites for zinc between TM2 and TM3 in the human MC4R. This clearly shows that this area of the receptor is crucial for activation, and t"
https://openalex.org/W1986285358,"Two dominant negative mutants of Rab3D, N135I and T36N were recently reported to inhibit the early phase of regulated amylase secretion from mouse pancreatic acini (Chen, X., Edwards, J. A., Logsdon, C. D., Ernst, S. A., and Williams, J. A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 18002–18009). Immunocytochemical studies showed that while the wild-type Rab3D localized to zymogen granules, the two dominant negative mutants did not localize to granules and were primarily in the basolateral regions of the cell. The present study, therefore, evaluated the potential mechanisms by which the dominant negative mutants might act. An affinity precipitation assay based on the property of the Rab3 effector Rim1 to interact only with GTP-bound Rab3D was developed. 78.9 ± 4.5% of total endogenous Rab3D was found in the GTP-bound form. Overexpression of HA-tagged Rab3D, and its Q81L, N135I, and T36N mutants had no effect on the total amount of endogenous Rab3D. However, the dominant negative mutants, T36N and N135I, reduced GTP-bound endogenous Rab3D by 70.0 ± 3.5% and 72.7 ± 1.2%, respectively, while the wild-type Rab3D and Q81L mutant had no effect. Triton X-114 phase separation and cell fractionation studies showed that dominant negative Rab3D mutants did not alter isoprenylation or membrane association of endogenous Rab3D. The dominant negative Rab3D did not affect the amount of endogenous Rab3D on purified zymogen granules as assessed by either Western blotting or immunocytochemistry, but reduced the GTP-bound form by 78.6 ± 3.3%. The two dominant negative Rab3D mutants, therefore, interfere with endogenous Rab3D function by blocking the GDP/GTP exchange but not zymogen granule targeting of endogenous Rab3D. Two dominant negative mutants of Rab3D, N135I and T36N were recently reported to inhibit the early phase of regulated amylase secretion from mouse pancreatic acini (Chen, X., Edwards, J.

Small GTPases of the Rab/Ypt family form the largest branch of the Ras-related small G-protein superfamily and are recognized as key protein components involved in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells (1.Takai Y.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A characteristic of Rab proteins is that a cycle of association with and dissociation from membranes is superimposed onto their GDP/GTP cycle. These two types of cycling are essential for Rab function in vesicle trafficking and fusion. At steady state, a portion of a Rab protein is detected in the cytosol. This pool is maintained in the GDP-bound form through interaction with another important regulator of Rab cycling, Rab GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) (1.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol.

A model of Rab GDP/GTP and membrane/cytosol cycling had been developed based on pioneering studies of Rab9 and Rab5 (4.Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R.

In a consecutive but separate step, the membrane-associated, inactive Rab proteins are converted into their active forms by compartment-specific GEFs (11.Wang W. Sacher M. Ferro-Novick S. J.

The Rab, now in its GTP-bound form, recruits its effector(s) to the vesicle. Following fusion with the acceptor compartment, a GAP stimulates the Rab protein to hydrolyze its bound GTP and the resulting GDP-bound form is recognized and retrieved from acceptor compartment by Rab GDI, possibly facilitated by other factors. Pancreatic acinar cells are the functional unit of digestive enzyme secretion and have long been used as a model to study the packaging and secretion of secretory proteins and its control by neurotransmitters and hormones (14.Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 15.Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 16.Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In acinar cells, secretory proteins are transferred by vesicular fusion through a series of compartments to the mature zymogen granule, which upon cellular stimulation fuses with the apical plasma membrane to release its contents into the lumen. The Rab3 proteins are the Rab species associated with synaptic or secretory vesicles in neurons, neuroendocrine, endocrine, and exocrine cells and are thought to play an important role in regulated exocytosis (17.Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18.Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Roa M. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P. Darchen F.

Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Rab3D is the only detectable Rab3 isoform in rodent pancreatic acini and is localized on zymogen granules. More recently, we reported (24.Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that dominant negative mutants of Rab3D, N135I and T36N, introduced by adenoviral vector expression, inhibited regulated amylase secretion by mouse pancreatic acini, while the wild-type and active mutant Q81L had no effect. Localization of adenoviral expressed Rab protein showed that wild-type Rab3D localized to zymogen granules. The two dominant negative mutants did not localize to granules and were primarily in the basolateral cytoplasmic region of the cell. These observations raise the question of how the cytosolic dominant negative Rab3D mutants interfere with the zymogen granules (ZG)-associated endogenous Rab3D and inhibit its function in acinar secretion. To evaluate the potential mechanisms by which the dominant negative mutants might act, it is necessary to directly monitor active, GTP-bound Rab3D in acinar cells. Recently, affinity precipitation assays for detecting cellular GTP bound members of the Rho family have been developed (25.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 26.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This method takes advantage of the fact that the effector proteins interact only with GTP-bound G-protein and that binding of G-protein to the effector protein inhibits the GTPase activity of the G-protein. In the present study, we developed an affinity-precipitation assay to monitor the active state of endogenous Rab3D in pancreatic acinar cells based on the property of the Rab3 effector Rim to interact only with GTP bound Rab3 (29.Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A high percentage (∼80%) of endogenous Rab3D was found to be in GTP-bound conformation. In acini infected with adenoviruses expressing either two of the dominant negative Rab3D mutants, N135I and T36N, the GTP-bound endogenous Rab3D was reduced to only 30% of that of control acini. Furthermore, Western blot together with immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the dominant negative Rab3D mutants dramatically reduced the active state, but not the total amount, of endogenous Rab3D on the zymogen granules. Materials—The plasmid encoding GST (glutathione S-transferase)-RIM (Rab3-interacting molecule) (amino acids 1–399) fusion protein was obtained from Dr. Ronald W. Holz (University of Michigan). Anti-Rab3D antisera was a gift from Dr. Mark McNiven (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and Percoll were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; Rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody 3F10 from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN); and collagenase (CLSPA grade) from Worthington Biochemicals (Freehold, NJ). All other reagents were from Sigma. Isolation, Short Term Culture, and Adenoviral Infection of Pancreatic Acini—As previously described (24.Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), pancreatic acini were isolated from male ICR mice by collagenase digestion. Isolated acini from 2–3 pancreas were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and divided into 4 or 5 150-mm Petri dishes each containing 30 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and antibiotics, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The HA-tagged wild-type and mutant mouse Rab3D adenoviral constructs were made using AdEASY system as described previously (24.Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV also encodes EGFP driven by a separate CMV promoter. An adenovirus expressing bacterial β-galactosidase and EGFP, each under the control of a separate CMV promoter was used as the control virus. In the adenoviral infection experiments, either control β-galactosidase or various HA-tagged Rab3D adenoviruses (106 pfu/ml) were added, to the culture medium at the beginning of the incubation. Under this condition, over 95% of acini were infected as indicated by their EGFP expression. Preparation of Zymogen Granules—A previously described method for purifying zymogen granules from rat pancreas was adopted (30.Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, isolated mouse pancreatic acini were homogenized in 3 ml ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm Pipes, 200 μm CaCl2, 200 μm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA (pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.02% w/v soybean trypsin inhibitor. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g and 4 °C to generate postnuclear supernatant fractions (PNS). The PNS were then centrifuged for 10 min 4 °C at 1,000 × g to generate a crude particulate fraction enriched in secretory granules. The supernatant was removed, and the particulate fraction was resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer, and an equal volume of Percoll was added. The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge using a TLA 100.4 rotor. The dense white zymogen granule band near the bottom of the tube was collected and washed once with homogenization buffer. The purity of the preparation was confirmed by measuring the relative specific activity of amylase in each fraction as previously described (30.Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Amylase activity showed a 5–6-fold enrichment over the homogenate. GST Fusion Protein Expression—GST-Rim1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 cells following induction at 37 °C for 2 h with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Bacterial pellets were lysed by means of a French Press in buffer containing 20% sucrose, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm Na2S2O5,2mm MgCl2,2mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100. GST-Rim was purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and stored at –20 °C in storage buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2,5mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50% glycerol. Affinity Precipitation of Cellular GTP-bound Rab3D—Isolated pancreatic acini were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). In most experiments, 1 ml (0.5 mg/ml) of acinar lysate was incubated with 10 μg of GST-Rim attached to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times, and the remaining proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and run on SDS-PAGE. Bound Rab3D proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Rab3D and anti-HA antibodies and visualized with ECL reagent and recorded on film. Two Rab3D bands were revealed in each lane: the top corresponding to overexpressed HA-tagged Rab3D and the bottom to endogenous Rab3D. In vitro GDP or GTPγS protein loading was used for negative and positive controls (26.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 29.Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 50 μl of 0.2 m EDTA and 2 μl of 100 mm GTPγS or 10 μl of 100 mm GDP were added to 1 ml of acinar lysate (0.5 mg/ml protein concentration), and the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 60 μl of 1 m MgCl2 and placing the samples on ice. Densitometric analysis of appropriately exposed film was performed and quantified using BioRad Multi-Analyst software. The amount of GST-Rim bound Rab3D was compared among different groups of samples and expressed as percentage of that of the control group. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Purified zymogen granules prepared from β-galactosidase (control) and Rab3D T36N adenovirus-infected acini were resuspended in a small volume of PBS and transferred onto microscope slides (Fisher Superfrost plus). The granules were allowed to bind to slides for 10 min at room temperature in humid box, and then the PBS solution was replaced with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation, samples were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with rabbit anti-Rab3D antibody diluted 1:200 or rat anti-HA antibody diluted 1:100 in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, and blocking with 2% normal goat serum in PBS, samples were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200 in 2% normal goat serum in PBS. Slides were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and digitized images were processed using Photoshop 6.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). For quantification of immunofluorescence, digital images from three microscopic fields for each viral construct were chosen at random from each of three independent experiments and analyzed using Metamorph 6.0.4 software (Universal Imaging, Inc., Malvern, PA). After background and any saturated pixels were excluded, the mean pixel intensities from the separate fields of each condition were averaged. Results were expressed as percent of control (β-galactosidase) mean pixel intensity for the three experiments. Subcellular Fractionation and Triton X-114 Phase Separation—Isolated pancreatic acini were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2% glycerol supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was sonicated briefly and a PNS prepared by centrifugation for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. High speed supernatants and membrane pellets, designated as cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) were obtained by centrifugation of the PNS at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge using a TLA 45 rotor. The membrane pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again at 20,000 × g to remove insoluble proteins. To examine Rab3D isoprenylation, a Triton X-114 partitioning method was used as described previously (22.Valentijn J.A. Sengupta D. Gumkowski F.D. Tang L.H. Konieczko E.M. Jamieson J.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Wagner A.C. Wishart M.J. Mulders S.M. Blevins P.M. Andrews P.C. Lowe A.W. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9099-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated acini were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-114, 5 mm EDTA, and supplemented with the proteinase inhibitors and sonicated. The acinar lysate was then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min and the resulting turbid solution was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at room temperature. The upper clear aqueous phase was separated from the bottom turbid detergent phase. The two phases were then both brought to a 1-ml volume with 1% Triton X-114. Both phases were kept on ice until the solutions became clear. The above process was repeated two more times to wash away contaminants. GST-RIM Interaction with GTP-bound Rab3D in Acinar Lysate Can Be Used to Assess the GTP Binding Status of Endogenous Rab3D in Vivo—To determine how the guanine nucleotide state of Rab3D influenced its interaction with Rim, different amounts (250,500 μg) of acinar lysate were treated to load all small G-proteins with GDP or GTPγS as negative or positive controls, respectively, and then incubated with GST-Rim-(1–399) in a “pulldown” protocol. Similar to prior studies with Rab3A (29.Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), GST-Rim pulled down Rab3D when liganded with GTP but not with GDP (Fig. 1). This demonstrated that GST-RIM associated exclusively with the GTP-bound Rab3D and that the pull-down assay was able to detect the GTP-bound endogenous Rab3D. Moreover, the pull-down signals were proportional to the amount of total lysate. On the basis of these results, we compared the pull-down signal from the same amount of acinar lysate with or without GTPγS loading. Assuming that GTPγS activated all endogenous Rab3D and the signal can be used as 100%, we estimated that about 80% of the endogenous Rab3D was in active, GTP-bound conformation (Fig. 1). In four experiments, quantitative densitometry showed 78.9 ± 4.5% to be GTP-liganded (Table I). In separate subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 2A), we found that about 80% of total Rab3D was in the membrane fraction. The similarity of the percentage of GTP-bound and that of membrane-bound Rab3D led us to hypothesize that membrane-bound Rab3D was all GTP-bound while cytosolic Rab3D was GDP-bound. This hypothesis was tested by performing pull-down assays of Rab3D on the membrane and cytosolic fraction separately (Fig. 2, B and C). About 90% of membrane associated Rab3D was found to be GTP-liganded while only 2% of soluble Rab3D was GTP-liganded (Table I).Table IThe amount of total and active Rab3D in different subcellular fractionsTotal Rab3DGTP-bound Rab3D%Cellular lysate10078.9 ± 4.5Cytosol18.8 ± 1.31.7 ± 1.7Membrane81.3 ± 1.390.2 ± 10.4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Pools of Rab3D in different GDP/GTP binding status were revealed by subcellular fractionation. To analyze the distribution of total Rab3D, high-speed supernatants and membrane pellets, designated as cytosolic (C) and membrane (M), were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Rab3D antibody (A). To analyze the GTP-binding status of cytosolic (B) or membrane (C) endogenous Rab3D, cytosolic or solubilized membrane fraction of acinar lysate was incubated with GST-RIM beads and pull-down assay was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In order to enhance the cytosolic pull-down signal, more protein and longer exposure time was used. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dominant Negative Rab3D Mutants Reduce GTP-bound Endogenous Rab3D in Acinar Cells—We have reported that the dominant negative Rab3D mutants, Rab3D N135I and T36N, preferentially inhibited acinar amylase secretion (24.Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To address the mechanism by which dominant negative Rab3D mutants act, we examined the effect of the overexpressed wild-type and mutant Rab3D on the active GTP-bound state of endogenous Rab3D by use of the GST-RIM pull-down assay. The representative Western blot results are shown in Fig. 3. Because of the higher molecular weight introduced by the HA tag, anti-Rab3D antibody revealed two bands in each lane: the top band is overexpressed HA-tagged Rab3D, which may also be visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody, and the bottom is Rab3D, which does not react with anti-HA. None of the overexpressed Rab3D constructs affected the total amount of endogenous Rab3D (Fig. 3A). When the amount of GTP-bound Rab3D was evaluated using the GST-Rim pull-down, expression of wild-type Rab3D and the Q81L mutant had no effect, but both dominant negative Rab3D mutants, T36N and N135I greatly reduced GTP bound endogenous Rab3D (Fig. 3B). Quantitative data showed that the reduction was 70.0 ± 3.5% and 72.7 ± 1.2% respectively (Fig. 3C). One unexpected difference between T36N and N135I was that N135I interacted with GST-Rim as indicated in the Western blot following pull-down (Fig. 3B). This pull-down of N135I was independent of the presence of GDP or GTPγS and appeared to result from guanine nucleotide-independent interaction of Rab3D N135I and Rim (data not shown). Dominant Negative Rab3D Mutants Did Not Affect Isoprenylation and Membrane Association of Endogenous Rab3D— Early studies (4.Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5.Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and our current results (Fig. 2) indicate that membrane association and GDP/GTP exchange of Rab proteins are closely coupled. We therefore tested whether or not the reduction of active Rab3D by dominant negative Rab3D mutants was due to the reduction of either isoprenylation or membrane association of endogenous Rab3D. The Triton X-114 partitioning method was used to address this issue since the isoprenylated Rab3D was expected to be in the detergent phase. As shown in Fig. 4A, in control acini, endogenous Rab3D was exclusively in the detergent phase consistent with a complete isoprenylation of Rab3D. In the acini expressing HA-tagged Rab3D constructs, neither the wild type nor the T36N mutant had an effect on the isoprenylation of endogenous Rab3D. However, a significant portion of overexpressed Rab3D from both wild-type and T36N were in the aqueous phase. Similar partitioning of Rab3D N135I mutant was also seen (data not shown). This could be due to a limited capacity for isoprenylation, or more likely the isoprenyl group was not as well protected in the cytosol as on the membrane. In either case, this result demonstrated that dominant negative Rab3D did not interfere with the isoprenylation of endogenous Rab3D. We then examine the effect of dominant negative Rab3D on the membrane association of endogenous Rab3D using a subcellular fractionation method. As shown in Fig. 4B, the amount of membrane associated endogenous Rab3D was the same in control and T36N virus infected acini. On the other hand, T36N itself was largely cytosolic, which is consistent with the basalateral cytosolic localization demonstrated in our previous immunocytochemistry studies (24.Chen X. Edwards J.A. Logsdon C.D. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18002-18009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains not only has hampered the current treatment of bacterial infections but also hindered the development of new therapeutic agents. Resistance mediated by multidrug efflux pumps as a major mechanism has been increasingly recognized. Available clinical data showed that 40–90% of some bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bear efflux mechanisms for the major classes of available antibiotics (1.Brenwald N.P. Gill M.J. Wise R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2032-2035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Limia A. Jimenez M.L. Delgado T. Sanchez I. Lopez S. Lopez B. Rev. Esp.

Dis. 1999; 29: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Many drug efflux pumps have broad substrate specificity and expel a wide range of completely unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs. The AcrA-AcrB-TolC efflux system of Escherichia coli is such an example and is largely responsible for the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to most lipophilic antibiotics, detergents, and dyes (6.Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 7.Nikaido H. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar). This system consists of a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) type efflux pump, AcrB, a periplasmic, membrane fusion protein (MFP), 1The abbreviations used are: MFPmembrane fusion proteinDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutininMTSLmethanethiosulfonate spin labelSDSLsite-directed spin labelingDSCdifferential scanning calorimetry. AcrA, and a multifunctional outer membrane channel, TolC. Such organization allows the bacterium expel a wide variety of noxious compounds from the cell directly into the medium, bypassing the periplasm (8.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Similar multicomponent efflux systems have been found in other Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3.Nikaido H. Clin. Infect.

Major progresses have been made for understanding the efflux mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria, which are highlighted by recent publications of the crystal structures of TolC and AcrB (9.Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 10.Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A.

Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The TolC trimer comprises of two barrel-like structures joined together, the outer membrane β-barrel and the periplasmic α-barrel. The long α-barrel (∼100 Å) is thought to traverse the periplasm and interact with AcrB or inner membrane (9.Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Consistently, the AcrB protein, also as a trimer, contains two structural domains, the transmembrane domain (50 Å in thickness) and a headpiece that protrudes about 70 Å in depth into the periplasm (10.Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). It is thought that AcrB and TolC may be directly docked with each other, forming a continuous pathway across the periplasm and the outer membrane. Substrates may gain access to the AcrB central cavity either from the cell interior through the transmembrane region, or from the periplasm through the vestibules of AcrB protein, which are then actively transported through the AcrB pore into the TolC tunnel (10.Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Indeed, AcrB structures with four structurally diverse substrates demonstrated that they bind to the large central cavity of AcrB (11.Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). An important question remains to be addressed is the role of AcrA in the efflux process. AcrA is essential for drug efflux, but how AcrA participates in this process is not fully understood. In its mature form, AcrA carries a diacylglycerol group and a palmitic acid chain linked to the N-terminal cysteine residue, which is believed to anchor the protein to the inner membrane. However, the lipid-deficient variant of AcrA carrying a His tag at the C-terminal is functional and has been used for biochemical studies (12.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The secondary structure predictions of AcrA suggest that AcrA and its MFP homologs contain two regions of high coiled-coil probability of approximately equal length, flanked by two lipoyl/biotin-binding motifs that are likely β-strands (13.Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although the high resolution structure is not available (14.Avila S. Misaghi S. Wilson K. Downing K.H. Zgurskaya H. Nikaido H. Nogales E. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), AcrA was found to be a highly asymmetric molecule with an elongated shape of about 200 Å in length (12.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments showed that AcrA forms a complex with AcrB (15.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4264-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and may interact with TolC. Therefore, AcrA could provide a seamless link between AcrB and TolC. Alternatively, it may simply bring the outer and inner membranes closer for substrate transfer. A better knowledge of the structure and function of AcrA is essential for understanding the efflux process. In this study, we used a sensitive biophysical method, the site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), for studying the structure and dynamics of AcrA. SDSL utilizes site-directed mutagenesis to replace the residue of interest in a protein with a cysteine, which is then modified with a sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide to introduce the paramagnetic side chain (Fig. 1). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic analysis of the spin label yields spectral characteristics that are dependent on the local environment, which in turn provide information on the structure and dynamics of the protein (16.Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 17.Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Using this method, we demonstrate that AcrA is a dynamic protein that undergoes conformational rearrangements triggered by changes of pH. Such conformational changes may be important for the action of AcrA during the drug efflux process. Bacterial Strains, Plasmid Construction, and Growth Media—All E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB broth. Antibiotics were added when required, to the following final concentrations: kanamycin, 34 μg/ml; ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 15 μg/ml. All plasmids were constructed by standard cloning techniques and propagated in the DH5α strain of E. coli. To construct pBP184, a 3557-bp HindIII-BamII fragment of pBP was ligated into a HindIII- and BamII-treated pACYC184 vector. Plasmid pBP184 expresses AcrB protein under the native acrAB promoter. The pUZ11 (12.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was used to construct all plasmids for the expression and purification of single cysteine containing AcrACys-6His. Plasmid pUZ11 encodes OmpA-AcrA-6His fusion protein, i.e. the signal sequence of OmpA protein was fused to the mature portion of AcrA (residues 26–394) lacking the AcrA signal peptide and the N-terminal cysteine modification site. The sixhistidine tag was at the C-terminal of AcrA. Unique cysteine residues were introduced into OmpA-AcrA-His6 using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Analysis of Function and Expression of AcrACys-6His Variants—The functional fitness of AcrACys-6His variants was evaluated by measuring minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of different antibiotics. For this purpose, AcrACys-6His variants were transformed into AG100A (ΔacrAB::kan) strain carrying pBP184 plasmid (18.Okusu H. Ma D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Then exponentially growing cultures (optical density at 600 nm of 1.0) were inoculated at a density of 104 cells per ml into LB medium in the presence of 2-fold-increasing concentrations of the drug under investigation. Cell growth was determined after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The levels of expression of AcrACys-6His were routinely monitored by Western immunoblotting analysis according to standard protocols using anti-AcrA antibody. E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, briefly sonicated, and solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. In the case of the non-reducing SDS-PAGE, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample buffer. Protein Expression and Purification—The E. coli DH5α or AG100A strains containing plasmids with single cysteine substitution were cultured overnight. The overnight culture (5–10 ml) was inoculated into 500 ml of fresh LB medium with appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C until OD600 nm reached 0.5–0.7. Expression of protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 1 mm. After 3–4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and subsequently disrupted by sonication. AcrA protein was purified from the cell lysates using His-Bind metal chelating resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a slight modification (i.e. the concentration of imidazole in the Wash Buffer was 50 mm). To remove imidazole, protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) overnight. Purified protein is stable for at least 4 weeks at 4 °C. For prolonged storage, 10% glycerol was added, and protein was stored at –20 °C. The resulting protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient 17,210 cm–1m–1 or the BCA protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). Spin Labeling and EPR Spectroscopy—Thio-reducing agent DTT (4 mm) was added to the purified protein (∼0.5–2 mg/ml) in the storage buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Samples were then dialyzed against the storage buffer overnight (2–3 buffer changes). Spin label MTSL, 1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolinyl-3-methyl-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Canada), was added at 10-fold molar excess with respect to the AcrA and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Excess free spin labels were removed by dialysis. For experiments at pH 5.0, another buffer, 25 mm MES, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.0, was used for dialysis. Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration and adjusted to 100–200 μm. For titration experiment, labeled AcrA in appropriate buffer was mixed with excess unlabeled AcrA (1:5 molar ratio) at protein concentration below 50 μm for overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then concentrated and adjusted to 100–200 μm before acquiring EPR spectra. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Elexsys E-500 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The conventional X-band spectra were obtained using 0.63 milliwatts microwave power and a field modulation of 100 kHz and 1.6 G modulation amplitude. Scan width was 100 G. EPR spectra were analyzed using the software Xport provided by the manufacturer (Bruker). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—DSC experiments were performed on a MicroCal VP-DSC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The protein concentration is at 1 mg/ml and the scan rate is 45 °C/hr. Data analysis was performed using Origin software provided by the manufacturer (MicroCal). Single Cysteine AcrA-6His Variants Are Functionally Active and Stable in Vivo—The native AcrA protein has a unique cysteine residue, Cys-25, which is the site for lipid modification (19.Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, genetic analysis suggested that neither lipid modification nor Cys-25 residue are essential for AcrA function (12.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have used the previously reported cysteine-less AcrAC25K variant with a hexa-histidine tag on the C terminus (AcrA-6His) as a background to construct 11 single cysteine AcrA (AcrACys-6His) mutants. Mutants were constructed by a PCR-based method and verified by sequencing. Previous sequence analysis predicted that AcrA has a highly hydrophilic central domain with a high propensity to form a trimeric coiled-coil and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain conserved among MFPs (13.Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the central α-helical region of AcrA is bracketed by sequences homologous to lipoyl/biotin-binding domain (13.Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We introduced unique cysteine residues in all these putative domains of AcrA (Fig. 2). All 11 mutants could be expressed in E. coli to the similar level of wild-type AcrA (data not shown). We did not detect any visible degradation products, which could indicate protein instability induced by Cys substitutions. At most positions, cysteine substitutions were well tolerated by the presumed AcrA-AcrB-TolC complex, since plasmids expressing various AcrACys-6His proteins restored multidrug-resistant phenotype of cells lacking the chromosomal copy of acrA gene (Table I). In two instances, cells carrying AcrACys295 and AcrA-Cys390 exhibited only partial resistance to novobiocin and puromycin, compared with the wild-type AcrA. However, these mutants fully complemented resistance to other antimicrobials including erythromycin and tetracycline, and detergent SDS (Table I). Although these data do not address if initial rates of drug efflux are affected, they suggest that the mutant proteins are not grossly destabilized.Table IMinimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of various antimicrobial agents for E. coli cells expressing various AcrA mutant proteinsE. coli cells expressingMICErythromycinNovobiocinSDSPuromycinTetracyclineμg/mlAcrA6432>5000320.625AcrA A30C6416>5000320.625AcrA A39C6432>5000320.625AcrA A62C6432>5000320.625AcrA A103C6432>5000320.625AcrA A146C6416>5000320.625AcrA A172C6416>5000320.625AcrA A204C6416>5000320.625AcrA A242C6416>5000320.625AcrA A295C648>5000320.625AcrA A339C6432>5000320.625AcrA A390C648>5000160.625No AcrA (pUC18)424040.313 Open table in a new tab Spin Labeling and Stability of Labeled AcrACys-6His Variants—To gain insights into the molecular conformation and dynamics of AcrA in solution, ten AcrACys-6His variants were expressed, and purified by the standard methods, and subjected to spin labeling by a nitroxide reagent MTSL. All sites reacted readily with MTSL under the experimental conditions (i.e. without prior unfolding by denaturants) and gave strong EPR signals, suggesting that they are not buried within the structure and are accessible to MTSL, which is comparable in size to a tryptophan. As mentioned above, most cysteine substitutions did not alter the function of AcrA (Table I). We also examined if the presence of spin label MTSL affects AcrA stability by monitoring its thermal unfolding with DSC. All spin-labeled mutants examined display a single cooperative endotherm centered at a transition temperature of 50 °C, as illustrated by the representatives in Fig. 3. The corresponding cysteine mutants (unlabeled) and the parental AcrA protein were also analyzed. The DSC data were analyzed according to a two-state unfolding model, and the derived thermodynamic parameters are summarized in Table II. It is notable that changes of Tm and ΔH in the presence of spin label fall within the range of values found for substitutions at these sites by cysteine residues with the exception of 62R1, which is slightly more destabilized by the presence of MTSL. These results agree with previous findings from many studies that show MTSL, being relatively small, represents a minimal perturbation of the backbone fold, thermal stability, or function of a protein (21.Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L.

The 10 spectra are distinctive in terms of mobility, a qualitative descriptor of the dynamic modes of R1 in the protein. Two measurable parameters, the inverse central line width (ΔHo–1) and the spectral breadth that is represented by the separation of magnetic field between the two outermost peaks, have frequently been employed to determine the mobility of spin label, which reflects both the rate and amplitude of motion (17.Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Such mobility is determined by the immediate environment of a R1 residue that reflects its surrounding protein topography. Correlations between side chain mobility and the details of protein structure and dynamics have been studied extensively in several proteins including T4 lysozyme (T4L) (21.Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), colicin E1 (22.Salwiäski L. Hubbell W.L.

Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In general, R1 residues are highly immobilized at buried sites, immobilized or have complex multicomponent spectra at tertiary contact sites, and have relatively high mobility at exposed sites or in loop regions. The side chain mobility of AcrA, measured as ΔHo–1, was summarized in Table III. The spectra of 30R1 and 390R1 are dominated by sharp and narrow lineshapes, reflecting a high degree of motion. This suggests that the extremes of N and C termini of AcrA are largely unstructured, making little or no static tertiary contacts with the remainder of the protein. This is consistent with the notion that AcrA is in an extended conformation in solution and the N and C termini do not physically interact with each other but instead are located on two opposite poles of the protein molecule (12.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, other R1 residues yield broadening spectra, which are characteristics of side chains within ordered structures or involving in tertiary interactions. The residues 103R1, 146R1, and 172R1 exhibit anisotropic motions that are typical of solvent-exposed, noninteracting, helix surface sites. The spectrum of 172R1 is complex, reflecting an anisotropic motion about an axis roughly parallel to the nitroxide 2pπ orbital. Nearly identical spectrum was described for residue 72R1 of T4L, which is located on the surface of a helix and experiences no interactions with nearby side chains (21.Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The cause for the constrained motion of 72R1 in T4L has been studied extensively and was recently shown to reflect the backbone motion (25.Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Consistent with the EPR spectra, residues 103R1, 146R1, and 172R1 are located at the predicted two α-helical regions with high probability of forming coiled-coil (Fig. 2).Table IIISide chain mobility of spin-labeled AcrA variantsAcrA variants(ΔHo)-1pH 7.0pH 5.0Gauss-130R10.67 ± 0.0030.67 ± 0.00339R10.42 ± 0.0040.38 ± 0.00362R10.42 ± 0.0030.29 ± 0.002103R10.48 ± 0.0020.40 ± 0.003146R10.31 ± 0.0020.25 ± 0.002172R10.37 ± 0.0030.32 ± 0.003204R10.40 ± 0.0020.41 ± 0.002242R10.26 ± 0.0030.24 ± 0.003339R10.30 ± 0.0030.29 ± 0.003390R10.67 ± 0.0030.67 ± 0.003 Open table in a new tab Residues 39R1, 62R1, and 204R1 have two spectral components, reflecting two resolved populations of different mobilities (α and β, Fig. 4). As described previously in many other systems, spin label attached to a single cysteine residues in protein often exhibits spectra composed of at least two motional components. Until recently, the structural basis remained unknown. The crystal structures of spin-labeled T4L proteins indicate that the multiple component spectra reflect bond rotational isomerization, which are modulated by interactions of the R1 side chain with neighbor side chains or backbone (26.Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, residues 39R1, 62R1, and 204R1 might be involved in tertiary contacts. Similarly, residues 242R1 and 339R1 may also have multiple dynamic components reflecting some degree of tertiary interactions (Fig. 4). Residues 62R1 and 204R1 are close to the predicted N- and C-lipoyl/biotin binding motifs, which are mostly β-strands (Fig. 2) (13.Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Residues 242R1 and 339R1 are close to the conserved C-terminal hydrophobic domain (20.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no secondary structures were predicted for regions of 39R1, 242R1, and 339R1, the EPR spectra indicate that these residues are located within ordered structures. In general, the EPR spectra are compatible with the predicted structure of AcrA based on sequence analyses. Conformational Rearrangements of AcrA Triggered by Changes of pH—The AcrAB-TolC system, like most bacterial efflux pumps, utilizes the proton motive force as the energy source for drug transport (6.Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). In E. coli cells, about half of the proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane comes from a proton gradient, with the cytoplasmic pH being higher than the external pH by about 1.7 pH unit (27.Nikaido H. Thanassi D.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution studies showed that AcrA greatly stimulates the transport activity of AcrB transporter by presumably promoting adhesion between two phospholipid bilayers (8.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, AcrA alone could mediate hemifusion of lipid bilayer of membrane vesicles without intermixing the vesicle contents when there is a pH gradient across the vesicle (pH of vesicle interior is 7.0 and external 5.0) (8.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Triggering of membrane fusion by lowering pH has been well established in the influenza viral membrane fusion protein, hemagglutinin (HA). HA is thought be in a metastable state at neutral pH and refolds into its lowest energy state by exposure to an acidic environment (28.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examine whether AcrA undergoes conformational transitions when the environment is acidified. Lowering the buffer pH from 7.0 to 5.0 caused changes of EPR spectra of residues 62R1, 103R1, 146R1, and 172R1, but little or no change of the others (i.e. 30R1, 39R1, 204R1, 242R1, 339R1, and 390R1, see Fig. 5A and Table III). Addition of MgCl2 (10 mm) did not cause further spectral changes (data not shown). The most pronounced spectral change induced by acidic pH was observed at residues 62R1 and 146R1. At pH 5.0, the spectrum of 62R1 became broadened and a strongly immobilized component appeared (see arrows in Fig. 5A), indicating that the local protein structure in the vicinity of 62R1 underwent a conformational change and consequently, residue 62R1 was in a more restricted environment. Residues 103R1 and 172R1 exhibited a similar conformational change, i.e. they became more restricted in mobility at pH 5.0. Comparing the EPR spectra of 146R1 at pH 7.0 and pH 5.0, the signal amplitude at pH 5.0 was decreased dramatically as the result of spectral broadening, and the baseline of the spectrum distorted, which are characteristics of spin-spin interaction that occurs when spin labels are at close proximity (<15 Å). Since all AcrA variants studied here are single labeled proteins, this result indicates that acidic pH induces oligomerization of AcrA, and that residue 146R1 is involved in intermolecular interaction. To further verify this, 146R1 mutant protein was titrated with unlabeled AcrA protein in five times excess and the spectra compared. Indeed, at pH 5.0, dilution of spin-labeled AcrA 146R1 mutant leads to spectral sharpening (Fig. 6), confirming that residue 146R1 is a tertiary contacting site among AcrA monomers. Interestingly, titration of 146R1 pro"

We demonstrate for the first time that the full-length hNTH1 positively cooperates in product formation as a function of enzyme concentration. The protein concentrations that caused cooperativity in turnover also exhibited dimerization, independent of DNA binding. Earlier we had found that the hNTH1 consists of two domains: a well conserved catalytic domain, and an inhibitory N-terminal tail. The N-terminal truncated proteins neither undergo dimerization, nor do they show cooperativity in turnover, indicating that the homodimerization of hNTH1 is specific and requires the N-terminal tail. Further kinetic analysis at transition states reveals that this homodimerization stimulates an 11-fold increase in the rate of release of the final product, an AP-site with a 3′-nick, and that it does not affect other intermediate reaction rates, including those of DNA <i>N-</i>glycosylase or AP lyase activities that are modulated by previously reported interacting proteins, YB-1, APE1, and XPG. Thus, the site of modulating action of the dimer on the hNTH1 reaction steps is unique. Moreover, the high intranuclear (2.3 μm) and cytosolic (0.65 μm) concentrations of hNTH1 determined here support the possibility of <i>in vivo</i> dimerization; indeed, <i>in vivo</i> protein cross-linking showed the presence of the dimer in the nucleus of HeLa cells. Therefore, it is likely that the dimerization of hNTH1 involving the N-terminal tail masks the inhibitory effect of this tail and plays a critical role in its catalytic turnover in the cell."

Ca2+ release is typically biphasic, with a fast and brief initial phase, followed by a much slower and prolonged one. In the presence of inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), including staurosporine and the specific inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31-8220, the fast phase continued until the ER became fully empty.

Staurosporine had no effect on InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells and did not modify either histamine-induced InsP3 production. These data suggest that histamine induces Ca2+ release and with a short lag activates PKC to down-regulate it. Consistently, Ca2+ oscillations induced by histamine were increased in amplitude and decreased in frequency in the presence of PKC inhibitors. We show also that mitochondrial [Ca2+] was much more sensitive to changes in ER-Ca2+ release induced by PKC modulation than cytosolic [Ca2+]. PKC inhibitors increased the histamine-induced mitochondrial [Ca2+] peak by 4-fold but increased the cytosolic [Ca2+] peak only by 20%. On the contrary, PKC activation inhibited the mitochondrial [Ca2+] peak by 90% and the cytosolic one by only 50%. Similarly, the combination of PKC inhibitors with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter activator SB202190 led to dramatic increases in mitochondrial [Ca2+] peaks, with little effect on cytosolic ones. This suggests that activation of ER-Ca2+ release by PKC inhibitors could be involved in apoptosis induced by staurosporine.

These channels become activated when agonists acting on specific plasma membrane receptors activate phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglicerol. InsP3 rapidly diffuses inside the cell and triggers opening of InsP3R, which releases the Ca2+ stored in the ER into the cytosol, generating a transient increase of the cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c). Simultaneously, part of the released Ca2+ is taken up by some mitochondria placed close to the ER, thus generating also a transient peak of mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M). The dynamics of both [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]M peaks play an important role to determine the response of the cell to each particular stimulus. The increase in [Ca2+]c controls the activation of many cytosolic Ca2+-dependent enzymes and plasma membrane channels and triggers phenomena such as neurosecretion or contraction (1.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria serves as a fast and transient Ca2+ buffer able to modulate the development of [Ca2+]c-dependent phenomena (2.Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J.

We have shown before that the kinetics of Ca2+ release in this case is biphasic, with a fast initial phase followed in a few seconds by a much slower one (23.Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show here evidence that PKC is responsible for the shift from the fast to the slow phases of Ca2+ release during histamine action. In addition, by studying in parallel the dynamics of [Ca2+] in cytosol, mitochondria, and ER under different conditions, we show that [Ca2+]M is much more sensitive to changes in Ca2+ release than [Ca2+]c. Together with the specific modulation of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter that we have reported recently (24.Montero M. Lobaton C.D. Moreno A. Alvarez J.

Constructs for cytosolic aequorin and ER-targeted mutated aequorin have been also described previously (24.Montero M. Lobaton C.D. Moreno A. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25.Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They were cloned into the pcDNA3.1. plasmid and used to transfect wild type HeLa cells. Transfections were carried out using Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany). [Ca2+]M, [Ca2+]c, and [Ca2+]ER Measurements with Aequorin—The HeLa cell clone MM5 was used for [Ca2+]m measurements. [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]ER measurements were carried out using HeLa cells transiently transfected with the corresponding plasmid. The cells were plated onto 13-mm round coverslips. For aequorin reconstitution, HeLa cells expressing cytosolic aequorin were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with 1 μm of wild type coelenterazine, and cells expressing mitochondrially targeted mutated aequorin were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with 1 μm of wild type coelenterazine, in standard medium (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). In some experiments (see Fig. 9), mitochondrially targeted mutated aequorin was reconstituted with coelenterazine n, to reduce its Ca2+ affinity and allow measurement of higher [Ca2+]M. The cells were then placed in the perfusion chamber of a purpose-built luminometer thermostatized at 37 °C. In the case of aequorin targeted to the ER, Ca2+ depletion of the ER was required prior to reconstitution (25.Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the cells were incubated for 10 min in medium containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0,5 mm EGTA, 10 μm 2,5-di-tert-buthyl-hydroquinone (an inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPase), 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Then after washing once, the cells were placed in the same medium in the presence of 1 μm coelenterazine n for 1–2 h. Before starting the experiment, the cells were placed in the perfusion chamber of the luminometer, thermostatized at 37 °C, and perfused with the same medium without 2,5-di-tert-buthyl-hydroquinone for at least 5 min. Then standard medium containing 1 mm CaCl2 was perfused to refill the ER with Ca2+, prior to the addition of the agonists. For experiments with permeabilized cells, the cells expressing ER-targeted mutated aequorin reconstituted with coelenterazine n were placed in the luminometer as above. Then standard medium containing 0.5 mm EGTA was perfused for 5 min, followed by a 1-min perfusion of intracellular medium (130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm K3PO4, 0,5 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm ADP, 2 mm succinate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7) containing 100 μm digitonin. Then intracellular medium without digitonin was perfused for 2 min, followed by intracellular medium containing a fixed 100 nm [Ca2+] prepared using an EGTA/Ca2+ mixture. Then, once the [Ca2+]ER level had reached a steady state, solutions containing different concentrations of InsP3 prepared in 100 nm [Ca2+] intracellular medium were perfused. Calibration of the luminescence data into [Ca2+] was made using an algorithm as previously described (24.Montero M. Lobaton C.D. Moreno A. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25.Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The statistical data are given as the means ± S.E. Single-cell [Ca2+]c Measurements—The cells were plated onto 13-mm round coverslips. HeLa cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at 30 °C. Then the coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope, and the cells were superfused with standard medium (see above). The temperature was kept at 37 °C. Dual wavelength measurements of fura-2 fluorescence were performed using the two-way wavelength illumination system DX-1000 (Solamere Technology Group). A 100 W Hg lamp was used as light source (Optiquip). Light was focused and collected through a Nikon Fluor 40/1.30 objective. The wavelength for dye excitation was alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence emission at 540 nm was collected with a SensiCam digital Camera (PCO CCD imaging). A binning 4 × 4 was applied to get ratio images of 320 × 256 pixels (12 bits/pixel) at 0.5 Hz. The illumination system and the camera were driven by Axon Imaging Workbench 4.0 (Axon Instruments) running in a Pentium computer. The ratio images were computed off-line from the background subtracted f340 and f380 images. Measurement of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate—HeLa cells were cultured to near confluence in a 75-ml culture flask, dissociated by treatment with a trypsin (0.05%) and EDTA (0.5 mm) solution (Invitrogen; 25300), pelleted by centrifugation (220 × g for 5 min), and resuspended in medium containing 30 mm LiCl (115 mm NaCl, 30 mm LiCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Then cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, with constant shaking, before the addition of histamine in the presence or in the absence of staurosporine (final volume, 250 μl). The stimulation was terminated at different times by the addition of 50 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 × g, and 200 μl of the supernatants were extracted with 400 μl of a mixture 3:1 of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane and trioctylamine. The aqueous layer was then removed and assayed for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate using a commercial radioreceptor assay (kit NEK064 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Materials—Wild type coelenterazine, coelenterazine n, and fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester were obtained from Molecular Probes. Staurosporine, H89, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate were from Sigma. GF109203X and SB202190 were from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Ro-31-8220 was from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). Other reagents were from Sigma or Merck. In HeLa cells, histamine triggers production of InsP3 and release of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol. By studying the behavior of [Ca2+]ER during histamine stimulation, we have shown before that the release of Ca2+ from the ER follows typical biphasic kinetics (23.Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Immediately after perfusion of the agonist, there is a drop of [Ca2+]ER of about 100 μm that occurs during the first 5–7 s (6.3 ± 0.4s, n = 8) of stimulation (Fig. 1A). Then this fast phase suddenly stops, and Ca2+ release continues at a much slower rate for as long as histamine is present. Fig. 1A shows that stimulation or inhibition of protein kinase C completely modified this kinetics. Inhibition of protein kinase C with staurosporine transformed the biphasic kinetics into a monophasic one, where the transition between fast and slow phases disappeared, and a fast and complete emptying of the ER was observed after histamine stimulation. On the contrary, stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate produced a large inhibition of Ca2+ release. These findings suggest that activation of protein kinase C by histamine stimulation is able to modulate Ca2+ release through InsP3 receptors. On the other hand, the effect of staurosporine resembles that of loading the cells with a Ca2+ chelator such as BAPTA. We have shown previously that loading the cells with BAPTA dramatically increased the rate of Ca2+ release induced by histamine, an effect that was attributed to the abolition of local high Ca2+ microdomains responsible for autoinhibition of the InsP3 receptor channels (23.Montero M. Barrero M.J. Alvarez J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B we compare the rate of Ca2+ release in control cells, in the presence of staurosporine, and in cells loaded with BAPTA either treated or not with the inhibitor. We can observe that Ca2+ release in cells loaded with BAPTA was much faster than that obtained in the presence of staurosporine. In addition, staurosporine did not increase the rate of Ca2+ release in BAPTA-loaded cells, although it made emptying of the ER more prolonged in the continuous presence of histamine. Therefore, the stimulating effects on Ca2+ release of both BAPTA and inhibition of PKC may at least in part rely on different mechanisms. The effects of staurosporine were not due to a direct modulation of InsP3 receptors by this inhibitor. Fig. 2 shows experiments performed in permeabilized cells to study Ca2+ release induced directly by InsP3. It can be observed that Ca2+ release induced by either submaximal or maximal InsP3 concentrations was not modified in the presence of staurosporine. The effects of staurosporine cannot be attributed either to an increase of InsP3 production induced by histamine. Fig. 3 shows that treatment with staurosporine did not modify histamine-induced InsP3 production. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the effects of staurosporine are due to inhibition of a protein kinase activated by histamine that modulates Ca2+ release through InsP3R. However, staurosporine is not an specific inhibitor of protein kinase C and may inhibit a broad spectrum of kinases, particularly protein kinases A, C, and G and myosin light chain kinase. We have then used some specific inhibitors of protein kinase C to test the involvement of this particular kinase. Fig. 4 shows that both GF109203X and Ro-31-8220, two potent and selective inhibitors of protein kinase C, produced the same effects as staurosporine. On the contrary, H89, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase A, produced little or no effect on histamine-induced Ca2+ release (data not shown, but see Fig. 8).Fig. 3Effect of staurosporine on histamine-induced InsP3 production. The cells were treated or not with 1 μm staurosporine for 5 min prior to stimulation with 100 μm histamine for 1, 2, or 5 min. Measurement of InsP3 was then carried out using a radioreceptor assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The numbers above the bars indicate the number of experiments of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Effect of the protein kinase C inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31-8220 on histamine-induced Ca2+ release. HeLa cells expressing ER-targeted mutated aequorin were reconstituted with coelenterazine n. Then, after refilling the ER with Ca2+, they were stimulated with 100 μm histamine either in control cells or in cells pretreated for 3 min with 1 μm GF109203X or 1 μm Ro-31-8220, as indicated. The experiments are representative of four similar ones of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Effect of GF109203X on carbachol-induced ER-Ca2+ release and [Ca2+]M increase. HeLa cells expressing aequorin targeted to the ER (upper panel) or to the mitochondria (lower panel) were reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then as indicated in the figures, the cells were stimulated with 500 μm carbachol (Cchol) or 100 μm histamine (His) either in controls or in cells treated for 3 min prior to stimulation and during stimulation with 1 μm GF109203X. The experiments are representative of three to four similar ones of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data shown above suggest that histamine stimulation of HeLa cells triggers first activation of phospholipase C with the subsequent production of InsP3 and diacylglicerol. Although InsP3 activates Ca2+ release, diacylglicerol activates protein kinase C that within few seconds phosphorylates the InsP3 receptor or a modulatory protein to down-regulate Ca2+ release. This mechanism could be involved in the modulation of Ca2+ oscillations induced by histamine, because it has been reported that PKC activation also oscillates during HeLa cell stimulation with histamine, and the oscillations occur in phase with those of Ca2+, albeit for a delay of few seconds (26.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). From our results we could predict that inhibition of PKC should increase Ca2+ release during each oscillation, leading to an increase in the amplitude of the oscillations. This should probably imply also a decrease in frequency, because the ER would require more time to refill and start a new oscillation. Both predictions were found to be correct. Fig. 5 shows several single-cell records of HeLa cells undergoing Ca2+ oscillations in the presence of histamine. The addition of GF109203X modified the oscillation pattern as predicted, and the effect could be reversed and seen again after a second addition of the inhibitor. We have now studied in the rest of this work how the modulation of Ca2+ release by PKC affects the cytosolic [Ca2+] peak and the transference of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Fig. 6 shows the effects of two different agonists, histamine and carbachol, on [Ca2+]ER, [Ca2+]c, and [Ca2+]M in HeLa cells. Histamine induces [Ca2+] release from the ER with the kinetics mentioned above, generating a fast [Ca2+]c peak in which the peak was reached within 5–7 s (6.4 ± 0.3s, n = 11), the same as the fast phase of Ca2+ release. Similarly, a fast [Ca2+] increase in mitochondria developed, reaching the peak within 8–11 s (9.6 ± 0.3s, n = 14). After this initial phase, [Ca2+]c decreased to reach a stable plateau while histamine was present, and [Ca2+]M returned to resting levels within about 1 min, even in the presence of histamine. In the case of carbachol, Ca2+ release from the ER had a very different kinetics. There was very little or no fast phase. Instead, carbachol induced a continuous and slower Ca2+ release from the ER, probably because of a smaller production of InsP3 (27.Arias-Montaño J.A. Berger V. Young J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistently, the kinetics of both the cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] peaks induced by carbachol were slower than those induced by histamine, although the height of the peaks were similar. The peak of carbachol-induced [Ca2+]c increase was reached within 9.1 ± 0.2 s (n = 17), and the return of [Ca2+]c to resting levels was also slower. Regarding [Ca2+]M, the rate of increase was significantly slower (the peak was reached within 15.6 ± 0.4 s (n = 14)), and the [Ca2+]M peak was much wider. Interestingly, the different kinetics of Ca2+ release induced by both agonists appear more evident when observing the [Ca2+]M transients than by looking at the [Ca2+]c peaks. Mitochondria appear more sensitive to changes in ER-Ca2+ release than cytosol. This point became still more clear when the effects of stimulation and inhibition of PKC were tested on the kinetics of the [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]M peaks. Fig. 7 shows that the height of the [Ca2+]c peak increased by about 20% in the presence of GF109203X (from 0.89 ± 0.04 μm (n = 11) to 1.07 ± 0.04 μm (n = 9)), and the peak became slightly wider. In contrast, the presence of GF109203X increased the histamine-induced [Ca2+]M peak by 4-fold (from 27.0 ± 1.2 μm (n = 14) to 111 ± 10 μm (n = 8)). On the contrary, treatment with 100 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate decreased the [Ca2+]c peak to about 50% of the control (from 0.89 ± 0.04 μm (n = 11) to 0.45 ± 0.02 μm (n = 8)), whereas the [Ca2+]M peak nearly disappeared (decreased almost 90%, from 27.0 ± 1.2 μm (n = 14) to 3.1 ± 0.6 μm (n = 10)).Fig. 7Effect of GF109203X and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate on histamine-induced [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]M peaks. HeLa cells expressing aequorin targeted to the cytosol (upper panel) or to the mitochondria (lower panel) were reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then as indicated in the figures, the cells were stimulated with 100 μm histamine (His) either in controls (left traces), after 3 min of preincubation with 1 μm GF109203X (middle traces), or after 3 min of preincubation with 100 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, right traces). The experiments are representative of eight to 14 similar ones of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 8 shows that GF109203X had only a slightly significant effect on Ca2+ release induced by carbachol, perhaps because of a smaller activation of protein kinase C induced by this agonist. Despite this, the [Ca2+]M peak induced by carbachol was increased 68 ± 19% (n = 4) with respect to the controls in the presence of GF109203X. Although small compared with the stimulation of the histamine-induced [Ca2+]M peak, the sensitivity of mitochondria to detect small changes in ER-Ca2+ release remains remarkable even in this case. The figure also shows the effects of histamine stimulation in the same cell batch to allow direct comparison of the effects of the PKC inhibitor on the [Ca2+]M peaks induced by both agonists. We have taken advantage of this higher sensitivity of [Ca2+]M peaks to changes in agonist-induced Ca2+ release to study the dose-response curve of the effect of the PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31-8220. Fig. 9 shows that GF109203X was the most effective compound, having a EC50 for the increase in the histamine-induced [Ca2+]M peak of ∼100 nm. Ro-31-8220 was 5-fold less effective, with an EC50 of ∼0.5 μm. We include also data for H89, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase A, which had little effect on t"

Yeast strains containing a deletion of the small, nonessential Rpb9 subunit of RNAPII exhibit an upstream shift in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends, whereas mutation of the large subunit of yeast TFIIF (Tfg1) can suppress downstream shifts that are conferred by mutations in TFIIB. In this study, we report an approach for the production of functional recombinant yeast holo-TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2 complex) and use of the recombinant protein in both reconstituted transcription assays and gel mobility shifts in order to investigate the biochemical alterations associated with the ΔRpb9 polymerase. The results demonstrated that upstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends could be conferred by the ΔRpb9 RNAPII in transcription reactions reconstituted with highly purified yeast general transcription factors and, importantly, that these shifts are associated with an impaired interaction between the ΔRpb9 polymerase and TFIIF. Potential mechanisms by which an altered interaction between the ΔRpb9 RNAPII and TFIIF confers an upstream shift in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends are discussed.

Accurate and efficient transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding (class II) genes involves the concerted action of RNAPII and a host of accessory proteins. A subset of these proteins are known as the general transcription factors, which includes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (reviewed in Ref. 1.Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The general transcription factors and additional accessory factors are being intensively studied with the objective of determining their respective functions during the different stages of RNAPII transcription, which include 1) formation of a preinitiation complex (PIC) on the promoter; 2) melting of the promoter DNA; 3) transcription initiation; 4) clearance of RNAPII from the promoter; 5) elongation of the nascent transcript; and 6) transcription termination.

Transcription of class II genes is governed by both regulatory DNA sequence elements and core promoter elements. Regulatory elements contain binding sites for protein factors that modulate the overall activity of the promoter and can be located within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the mRNA start sites or at much greater distances either upstream or down-stream of the start sites. Core promoter elements serve to direct the location of PIC assembly and comprise a TATA element and/or an initiator element. TATA elements, containing the consensus sequence TATA(A/T)A(A/T), are located upstream of the mRNA start sites and are specific binding sites for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID (2.Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3.Parker C.S. Topol J. Cell. 1984; 36: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Initiator elements, containing the consensus motif PyPyAN(T/A)PyPy, were identified in class II promoters from higher eukaryotic cells and encompass the transcription start site (4.Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 19: 19Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, transcription initiation usually occurs at a discrete site located ∼25–30 base pairs downstream of the TATA element. In marked contrast, the positions of mRNA 5′-ends in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae frequently map to multiple sites ranging from 45 to 120 base pairs or greater downstream of the TATA element (reviewed in Refs. 5.Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 425-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 6.Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 49: 295-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The ability of S. cerevisiae RNAPII to generate transcripts with 5′-ends mapping far downstream of a TATA element reflects an interesting and fundamental difference in the initiation mechanism relative to that in mammalian cells. Although the mechanistic basis for this difference remains unknown, it is clear from both genetic and biochemical studies that TFIIB and RNAPII play critical roles in determining the positions of mRNA 5′-ends in S. cerevisiae. Genetic studies have identified mutations in both TFIIB and the largest subunit of RNAPII (Rpb1) that confer downstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends (7.Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S.

In contrast, deletion of the small nonessential Rpb9 subunit of RNAPII or mutation disrupting a C-terminal zinc-ribbon in Rpb9 confers an upstream shift in the position of mRNA 5′-ends (12.Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, biochemical studies have shown that the pairwise exchange of S. cerevisiae TFIIB and RNAPII with their homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in an in vitro reconstituted system is sufficient to convert the transcription initiation pattern to that of S. pombe (14.Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition to the roles played by TFIIB and RNAPII, the possibility that TFIIF may also play a role in determining the positions of yeast mRNA 5′-ends was suggested by the identification of a mutation in the large subunit of S. cerevisiae TFIIF (Tfg1) as a suppressor of a TFIIB mutation conferring downstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends (15.Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Native S. cerevisiae TFIIF comprises three protein subunits designated Tfg1, Tfg2, and Tfg3. Tfg1 and Tfg2 are homologous to the human TFIIF RAP74 and RAP30 subunits, respectively, and are essential for yeast cell viability (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Tfg3 subunit, also known as yeast TAF14, has no known counterpart in mammalian TFIIF, and yeast strains containing deletions of Tfg3 are viable. To date, biochemical analyses of yeast TFIIF have been hampered by the inability to produce recombinant yeast TFIIF due to toxicity of the Tfg1 subunit in Escherichia coli (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe an approach for the production of functional recombinant yeast holo-TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2 complex) and report on a comparison of the activities of the recombinant protein in vitro with those of TFIIF purified from S. cerevisiae extracts (Factor g, Tfg1-Tfg2-Tfg3 complex). Importantly, use of the recombinant TFIIF in reconstituted transcription assays and in gel mobility shift assays revealed that the alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends conferred by yeast RNAPII lacking the Rpb9 subunit both in vitro and in vivo are associated with an impaired interaction between the ΔRpb9 mutant polymerase and TFIIF. We discuss two models for the mechanism by which an altered interaction between the ΔRpb9 RNA-PII and TFIIF confers an upstream shift in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends in S. cerevisiae.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) and contains the β-lactamase gene substituted for the tetracycline resistance marker and the coding regions for the yeast TFIIF Tfg1 and Tfg2 subunits (Tfg1p: hexahistidine tag at the C terminus, Myc epitope tag at the N terminus; Tfg2p: hexahistidine tag at the N terminus) under the control of T7 promoters in adjacent expression cassettes (see Fig. 1A; complete lineage available upon request). Plasmid p316/A has been described previously (9.Faitar S.L. Brodie S.A. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4427-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and contains the yeast ADH1 promoter (positions –500 to +12, where +1 is the initiating ATG) fused to the HIS3 coding region (positions +1 to +900) in vector pRS316. Plasmid pCR-HIS4 contains the yeast HIS4 gene (positions –145 to +744) in vector pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen). Production and Purification of Recombinant Yeast Holo-TFIIF— Overnight cultures of E. coli strain BLR (Novagen) harboring pRK/Tfg1,2 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml carbenicillin and then diluted to an initial A600 of 0.1 in 500 ml of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml carbenicillin, 0.2% maltose, 10 mm MgSO4. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0, and expression of the recombinant Tfg1 and Tfg2 proteins was induced with the addition of 20 ml of bacteriophage CE6 (carrying T7 RNA polymerase; Novagen) in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml carbenicillin, 0.2% maltose, 10 mm MgSO4 at a titer of 1.0 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. The culture was incubated at 37 °C without shaking for 15 min and grown with shaking at 37 °C for 3 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at –80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended with 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme, and the suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. Cells were lysed by the addition of 1 ml of 10% Triton X-100 (in lysis buffer), and MgCl2, RNase A, and DNase I were added to final concentrations of 10 mm, 100 μg/ml, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. The suspension was mixed by inversion, incubated on ice for 45 min with occasional mixing, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 5 mm imidazole and batch-loaded onto 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic resin (Qiagen) for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resin was subsequently packed into a column. The column was washed sequentially with 30 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, collecting 1-ml fractions. Peak fractions of Tfg1,2 protein were pooled (2–3 ml final), diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold TE500 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), and batch-loaded onto a 1-ml Myc antibody column with gentle mixing overnight at 4 °C (column prepared using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose and DEAE-purified 9E10 antibody from ascites fluid; Covance). The resin was packed into a column and washed sequentially with 8 ml of cold TE500 and 8 ml of cold TE500 containing 30% glycerol. Protein elution was initiated by the addition of 0.75 ml of 0.5 mg/ml Myc peptide (Roche Applied Science) in TE500 containing 15% glycerol and incubation for 20 min at 30 °C with occasional mixing. The eluant was collected, and the resin was washed twice by incubating with 1 ml of TE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) containing 20% glycerol for 10 min at 30 °C and collecting both wash fractions. Peak fractions of holo-TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2 complex) that were eluted from the antibody column from two preparations (500-ml cultures each) were pooled (about 5 ml total), dialyzed against 500 ml of Buffer F (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 250 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine) at 4 °C for 3 h and then concentrated to ∼0.5 ml using an Ultrafree-4-Biomax 5KNMWL spin column (Millipore). Typical yield was 300–600 μg of holo-TFIIF protein/liter of starting culture. Purification of Yeast TBP, TFIIB, RNAPII, TFIIE, and TFIIH— Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged yeast TBP was purified essentially as described previously (18.Lee M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1336-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and stored in Buffer D (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged yeast TFIIB was purified as described previously (19.Bangur C.S. Faitar S.L. Folster J.P. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23203-23209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and stored in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm zinc acetate). Recombinant yeast holo-TFIIE (His6Tfa1-Tfa2 complex) was purified through the DEAE column step as described previously (20.Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and stored in Buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). Yeast holo-TFIIH was purified from yeast strain YPH/TFB1 His6 through the Mono-Q HPLC column step as described previously (20.Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in Buffer H (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 600 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). Yeast RNA polymerase II was purified from strain BJ2168 and from a strain containing a deletion of the Rpb9 subunit (WY9) (12.Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (22.Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Cells were harvested and washed with 0.2 volumes of 5× Buffer A (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 5% Me2SO, 50 μm ZnCl2, protease inhibitors). After cell disruption, the supernatant was decanted from the glass beads, and the beads were washed with 1× Buffer A until the wash was clear. The supernatant and washes were pooled and adjusted to a final concentration of 150 mm KCl and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 45 min in a JLA-17 rotor at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and protein was precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 50% of saturation as described. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B′ (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm ZnCl2, protease inhibitors) to a conductivity corresponding to an ammonium sulfate concentration of 500 mm and passed over a DEAE-Sephacel column. Protein in the flow-through was again concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer B′ to a conductivity corresponding to an ammonium sulfate concentration of 500 mm. The solution was bound to monoclonal antibody 8WG16-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed, and protein was eluted as described. The eluant was dialyzed against Buffer P (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm ZnCl2) and concentrated using an Ultrafree-4-Biomax 5KNMWL spin column. Reconstituted Transcription Assays—Transcription reactions (30-μl final volume) contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5–8% glycerol, 80 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 40 units RNAsin (Promega Inc.), 30 mm creatine phosphate, 1.5 units/ml creatine kinase, 250 ng of plasmid template, 50 ng TBP, 150 ng of TFIIB, 300 ng of RNAPII, 250 ng of TFIIF, 30 ng of TFIIE, and 60 ng of TFIIH. Reaction components were initially mixed at 4 °C and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Transcription was then initiated by the addition of NTPs, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. When using the CYC1/G-less cassette template pG5CG–, reactions also contained 330 μm 3′-O-methyl GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and transcription was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 30× G-NTPs (12 mm ATP, 12 mm CTP, 45 μm UTP). G-less cassette reactions were terminated and treated with RNase T1, and the products were subjected to electrophoresis on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described previously (10.Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For reactions using templates containing the ADH1 promoter (p316/A) or HIS4 promoter (pCR-HIS4), transcription was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 12 mm NTPs, terminated after 20 min with the addition of 300 μl of stop buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 75 μg/ml carrier tRNA), and then treated with Proteinase K for 20 min at 37 °C (170 μg/ml final). The products were extracted twice with phenolchloroform and ethanol-precipitated, and the transcripts were analyzed by primer extension as described below. Primer Extension Mapping of mRNA 5′-Ends—Total in vivo RNA (30 μg) or the products of reconstituted in vitro transcription reactions were analyzed by primer extension as described previously (10.Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In vivo RNA was analyzed using either an ADH1-specific primer (5′-dGTATTCCAACTTACCGTGGGATTCG-3′, corresponding to positions +63 to +39, where +1 is the initiating ATG) or a HIS4-specific primer (5′-dCAGATCATCAATTAACGGTAG-3′, corresponding to positions +36 to +16, where +1 is the initiating ATG). The products of reconstituted in vitro transcription reactions with plasmid pCR-HIS4 as template were analyzed using the HIS4-specific primer; reactions with plasmid p316/A as template were analyzed using a HIS3-specific primer (5′-dGGTTTCATTTGTAATACGCTTTAC-3′, corresponding to positions +45 to +22, where +1 is the initiating ATG). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The TATA-containing DNA probe was a 45-base pair internally labeled fragment containing the Adenovirus early 1B TATA box (23.Kao C.C. Lieberman P.M. Schmidt M.C. Zhou Q. Pei R. Berk A.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 80 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 ng of poly(dG-dC), 20 fmol of labeled probe, and the amount of purified transcription factors as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction components were mixed at 4 °C, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Ten μl of the reaction products was then immediately loaded onto a native polyacrylamide gel (5% polyacrylamide, 30:1), and the gels were run at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine (pH 8.3) at 200 V for 2 h. Production and Characterization of Recombinant Yeast TFIIF—As noted earlier, biochemical studies of yeast TFIIF have been hampered by the inability to produce recombinant protein due to toxicity of the Tfg1 subunit in E. coli (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Previous attempts to produce recombinant Tfg1 revealed that the vast majority of successfully expressed Tfg1 protein underwent proteolytic cleavage in E. coli. 2L. M. Ziegler and A. S. Ponticelli, unpublished results. We speculated that proteolytic cleavage of Tfg1 and perhaps the associated toxicity of the Tfg1 plasmid might be reduced by co-expression of the yeast TFIIF Tfg2 subunit. Presented in Fig. 1A is an outline of the scheme used for the expression and purification of recombinant holo-TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2 complex). The main features of the approach included 1) the use of a low copy broad host range vector for construction of the plasmid with Tfg1 and Tfg2 expression under the control of adjacent T7 promoters; 2) the addition of a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of Tfg1, a Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of Tfg1, and a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus of Tfg2; 3) the propagation of the expression plasmid in a recombination-deficient E. coli strain lacking T7 RNA polymerase; 4) the induction of Tfg1 and Tfg2 expression by infection with bacteriophage λ carrying T7 RNA polymerase; and 5) the purification of the Tfg1-Tfg2 complex containing full-length Tfg1 protein by sequential chromatography on nickel-agarose and Myc antibody columns (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The combined features of this scheme resulted in decreased proteolytic cleavage of the Tfg1 subunit, decreased toxicity/instability of the expression plasmid, and recovery of the Tfg1 and Tfg2 recombinant proteins in apparently stoichiometric amounts at greater than 95% purity (Fig. 1B, data not shown). To assess the functionality of the recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex, the activity of the recombinant protein was compared with that of purified native yeast TFIIF (Factor g, Tfg1-Tfg2-Tfg3 complex) using both gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reconstituted transcription assays in vitro. The recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex exhibited a slightly higher activity than purified Factor g for both the formation of TBP-TFIIB-TFIIF-RNAPII-DNA complexes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (DBPolF; Fig. 2A) and for supporting transcription in the reconstituted assays (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex was apparently fully active for both the assembly of higher order transcription complexes and for supporting transcription in vitro. Yeast RNAPII Lacking the Rpb9 Subunit Confers Upstream Shifts in the Positions of mRNA 5′-Ends in Vivo and in Reconstituted Transcription Assays in Vitro—Previous studies demonstrated that yeast RNAPII lacking the Rpb9 subunit confers upstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends both in vivo and in transcription assays in vitro using nuclear extracts (12.Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To begin an investigation of the altered protein-protein interactions responsible for the shifts in mRNA 5′-ends conferred by the ΔRpb9 RNAPII, we tested whether upstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends are generated in vitro using a well defined reconstituted transcription system containing highly purified yeast general transcription factors. Transcription assays were performed using plasmid templates containing either the S. cerevisiae ADH1 or HIS4 promoters; purified recombinant factors (TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF); and wild-type RNAPII, the ΔRpb9 RNAPII, and TFIIH purified from yeast extracts (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Primer extension analyses of the transcription reaction products revealed that, compared with the reactions containing wild-type RNAPII, the reactions containing the ΔRpb9 RNAPII yielded diminished amounts of more downstream transcripts and/or enhanced levels of more upstream transcripts from both the ADH1 and HIS4 promoters (Fig. 3, A, lanes 2 and 3, and B, lanes 2 and 3). These results demonstrated that upstream shifts in mRNA 5′-ends conferred by the ΔRpb9 RNAPII were generated in the well defined reconstituted transcription system and suggested that the altered interaction(s) responsible for the shifts involve the ΔRpb9 RNAPII and one or more of the purified general transcription factors. Yeast RNAPII Lacking the Rpb9 Subunit Is Impaired for Interaction with TFIIF—To further investigate the altered protein-protein interactions involving the ΔRpb9 RNAPII, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were utilized to compare the relative activities of wild-type RNAPII and the ΔRpb9 RNAPII in the formation of stable intermediates of PICs. Initial control reactions containing only individual transcription factors demonstrated the ability of TBP, wild-type RNAPII, ΔRpb9 RNA-PII, and TFIIH to form stable complexes with the DNA probe, whereas no binding was detected with either TFIIF or TFIIE (Fig. 4A). In reactions containing combinations of the factors leading to PIC formation, the results demonstrated that the wild-type and ΔRpb9 polymerases were equally proficient for the formation of stable TBP-TFIIB-RNAPII-DNA (DBPol) complexes (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). In sharp contrast, reactions containing the ΔRpb9 RNAPII yielded dramatically reduced levels of the next higher order complex containing TFIIF (DB-PolF complexes) (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5), as well as the subsequent higher order complexes that also contain TFIIE and TFIIH (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–9). In light of the observed proficiency of the ΔRpb9 polymerase in the formation of DBPol complexes, the dramatically reduced activity of the ΔRpb9 polymerase in the formation of the next higher order complexes containing TFIIF (DBPolF) suggested an impairment in the interaction between the ΔRpb9 RNAPII and TFIIF. However, an alternative possibility is that the ΔRpb9 RNAPII is proficient for the formation of DBPol complexes, but the resulting complexes have an altered structure that impairs the subsequent association of TFIIF to TFIIB and/or RNAPII. To discriminate between these possibilities, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with the omission of TBP and TFIIB from the binding reactions in order to assess the direct association of TFIIF to either the wild-type or ΔRpb9 RNAPII. The results demonstrated that the wild-type and ΔRpb9 polymerases were equally active in the formation of DNA-RNAPII (Pol) complexes (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 4) but that the ΔRpb9 polymerase was dramatically impaired for the association of TFIIF (PolF complexes, Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 5). In this study, we have investigated the molecular basis underlying the alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends that are conferred both in vivo and in vitro by an S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II mutant lacking the Rpb9 subunit. To facilitate these studies, we developed an approach for the production of functional recombinant yeast holo-TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2 complex) and demonstrated that the recombinant protein was as active as native TFIIF (Tfg1-Tfg2-Tfg3 complex) purified from yeast extracts for both the formation of TBP-TFIIB-TFIIF-RNAPII-DNA complexes and for supporting transcription in reconstituted in vitro assays. Incorporation of purified ΔRpb9 RNAPII into the reconstituted transcription assays, which included RNAPII and TFIIH purified from yeast extracts and purified recombinant yeast factors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIE, demonstrated that alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends conferred by the ΔRpb9 polymerase could be generated in a well defined system of purified yeast general transcription factors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays utilizing the purified factors subsequently revealed that the alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends were associated with an impaired interaction between the ΔRpb9 polymerase and TFIIF. The purification of native S. cerevisiae TFIIF, also known as yeast Factor g, led to the identification of three co-purifying polypeptides that were designated Tfg1, Tfg2, and Tfg3 (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Henry N.L. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23388-23392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tfg3 polypeptide was found to be identical to yeast TAF14/ANC1, which is also a component of the TFIID complex and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (25.Burns L.G. Peterson C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26.Cairns B.R. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3308-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27.Welch M.D. Vinh D.B. Okamura H.H. Drubin D.G. Genetics. 1993; 135: 265-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since yeast strains containing deletions of Tfg3 are viable, further studies are needed in order to elucidate the potential roles of the Tfg3 polypeptide in the activities of the TFIID, TFIIF, and SWI/SNF complexes (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Tfg1 and Tfg2 polypeptides were found to be the S. cerevisiae homologs of the human TFIIF RAP74 and RAP30 subunits, respectively, and their presence is required for the maintenance of yeast cell viability (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with the Tfg2 polypeptide, attempts to produce recombinant Tfg1 protein were previously unsuccessful, apparently due to toxicity of the Tfg1 expression plasmid in E. coli (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To facilitate biochemical studies of yeast TFIIF, we developed an approach for the co-expression of the recombinant Tfg1 and Tfg2 polypeptides and purification of a Tfg1-Tfg2 complex. Biochemical assays comparing the activities of the recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex with those of native TFIIF purified from yeast extracts (Factor g, Tfg1-Tfg2-Tfg3 complex) demonstrated that the recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex was slightly more active than purified Factor g for both the formation of TBP-TFIIB-TFIIF-RNAPII-DNA (DBFPol) complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and for supporting transcription from the yeast CYC1 promoter in reconstituted reactions (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicated that the recombinant Tfg1-Tfg2 complex was apparently fully active for both higher order transcription complex assembly and for transcription in vitro, and they suggest that the presence of the Tfg3 polypeptide has no significant effect on the activity of the purified native TFIIF in the assays employed. Further studies will be required in order to determine whether the Tfg3 polypeptide affects the activity of yeast TFIIF in the transcription from other yeast promoters and/or from chromatin templates. As discussed earlier, previous work demonstrated that a yeast RNAPII mutant lacking the small nonessential Rpb9 subunit confers upstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends both in vivo and in transcription assays in vitro using nuclear extracts (12.Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we confirmed that yeast strains containing a deletion of Rpb9 manifest upstream shifts at the ADH1 and HIS4 promoters in vivo and demonstrated that alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends could also be conferred by the ΔRpb9 polymerase in vitro in a well defined reconstituted transcription system containing highly purified yeast general transcription factors (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the underlying biochemical basis for the alterations in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends conferred by the ΔRpb9 RNAPII involves an altered interaction involving the mutant polymerase and one or more of the purified general transcription factors in the reconstituted reactions. In this regard, it was recently reported that a GAL4-Rpb9 fusion protein, which contained the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to a truncated Rpb9 lacking the N-terminal 32 amino acids, interacted with the large subunit of yeast TFIIE (Tfa1) in a yeast two-hybrid assay (28.Van Mullem V. Wery M. Werner M. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10220-10225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although this result suggests that Rpb9 might physically interact with TFIIE, the detected interaction in the two-hybrid assay was reported to be very weak with a GAL4-Rpb9 fusion protein containing the entire Rpb9 coding sequence. In addition, the proficiency of RNAPII lacking the Rpb9 subunit in the assembly of stable higher order intermediate complexes leading to PIC formation was not directly tested. The use of highly purified general transcription factors and electrophoretic gel mobility assays in our work reported here revealed that the ΔRpb9 RNAPII is impaired for direct interaction with yeast TFIIF (Fig. 5B). Moreover, association of TFIIE with TBP-TFIIB-TFIIF-RNA-PII-DNA complexes containing the ΔRpb9 polymerase was detected in the mobility shift assays (Fig. 4B, lane 5 versus lane 7). Thus, we suggest that the primary biochemical alteration resulting from deletion of the Rpb9 subunit is an impaired TFIIF-RNAPII interaction. Our results do not exclude the possibility that an Rpb9-TFIIE interaction is manifest subsequent to PIC formation/transcription initiation and plays a role in the activity of RNAPII during transcript elongation. How might an altered interaction between the ΔRpb9 RNA-PII and TFIIF confer an upstream shift in the position of mRNA 5′-ends in S. cerevisiae? To address this issue, one must consider the potential mechanism of RNAPII transcription initiation in S. cerevisiae. As noted earlier, S. cerevisiae exhibits a unique transcription initiation pattern compared with other eukaryotes, with mRNA 5′-ends frequently mapping to multiple sites ranging from 45 to 120 base pairs or greater downstream of the TATA element (reviewed in Refs. 5.Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 425-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 6.Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 49: 295-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which this is achieved remains to be determined, it has been proposed that yeast RNAPII may be released from the preinitiation complex and scan the downstream sequence for preferred initiation sites (29.Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fact that TFIIF has been shown to directly interact with RNAPII to affect transient pausing and processivity strongly suggests that a TFIIF-RNAPII interaction plays a role in the DNA recognition/interaction properties of RNAPII (30.Tan S. Aso T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kephart D.D. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13536-13543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, within the context of a scanning polymerase model for S. cerevisiae transcription initiation, an impaired interaction between the ΔRpb9 RNAPII and TFIIF could result in an increased number of the mutant polymerases escaping the promoter without the accompaniment of TFIIF. In the absence of bound TFIIF, the ΔRpb9 polymerase could exhibit enhanced pausing/recognition of suboptimal start site sequences encountered early in the scanning process, resulting in the observed upstream shifts in the positions of mRNA 5′-ends. An alternative explanation for the ability of S. cerevisiae RNAPII to initiate transcription far downstream of a TATA element is that the architecture of yeast PICs is significantly different from that of higher eukaryotic PICs. Although the overall structure of S. cerevisiae PICs has yet to be reported, published work from numerous laboratories strongly supports a model for the architecture of mammalian PICs that involves the wrapping of ∼90 base pairs of promoter DNA around the PIC (32.Robert F.

Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The wrapping of promoter DNA around a mammalian PIC is reportedly induced by TFIIF and involves DNA sequences ranging from about 30 base pairs upstream to 55 base pairs downstream of the TATA element (32.Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since mammalian TFIIF functions as a heterotetramer of the RAP30 and RAP74 subunits and the yeast TFIIF Tfg1 and Tfg2 subunits are both significantly larger than their mammalian counterparts (16.Henry N.L. Campbell A.M. Feaver W.J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2868-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that yeast PICs have the potential to wrap significantly more promoter DNA than mammalian PICs in order to contact transcription start sites further downstream of the TATA element. Within the context of a DNA wrapping model for the mechanism of S. cerevisiae transcription initiation, an altered interaction between the ΔRpb9 polymerase and TFIIF could affect the extent and/or tightness of DNA wrapping that is induced by TFIIF, thereby resulting in a subpopulation of PICs that initiate transcription closer to the TATA element than normal. Continued biochemical analyses regarding both the architecture and postassembly activities of PICs containing wild-type or mutant RNAPII should provide additional insight into the mechanism by which the positions of mRNA 5′-ends are determined in S. cerevisiae.

This CENP-B dimer configuration may be suitable for capturing two distant CENP-B boxes during centromeric heterochromatin formation. The centromere, an essential chromosomal region required for the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, is embedded within heterochromatin in most eukaryotes (1Sullivan B. Karpen G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4196-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CENP-A and CENP-C do not seem to have any obvious sequence specificity in DNA binding. In contrast, CENP-B specifically binds a 17-base pair sequence (the CENP-B box), which appears in every other 171-base pair α-satellite repeat in human centromeres (12Masumoto H. Masukata H. Muro Y. Nozaki N. Okazaki T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and induces nucleosome positioning in the vicinity of the CENP-B box (13Yoda K. Ando S. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Okazaki T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CENP-B may function as a transacting factor, which induces the formation of the centromere-specific heterochromatin. Analyses with cultured human cells revealed that the existence of the CENP-B box within the α-satellite sequence is required for the formation of a functional centromere containing CENP-B in minichromosomes in vivo (14Ikeno M.

Biochemical and genetic studies also showed that CENP-A, CENP-B, and CENP-C cooperatively constitute functional centromeres in mammalian cells (16Howman E.V. Fowler K.J. Nelson A.J. Redward S.

This discrepancy about the CENP-B requirement for centromere formation may be explained by presuming the existence of functional homologue(s) of CENP-B. In fact, CENP-B-like proteins of unknown function have been identified in humans, such as the jerky-like protein (21Toth M. Grimsby J. Buzsaki G. Donovan G.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Liu W. Seto J. Sibille E. Toth M. Mol. Cell.

The functional redundancy of CENP-B homologues has also been found in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Three fission yeast proteins, Abp1, Cbh1, and Cbh2, are homologues of CENP-B (25Murakami Y. Huberman J.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the double disruptants of Abp1 and Cbh1 showed a synergistic reduction of centromere function in fission yeast (29Nakagawa H. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Allshire R.C. Nakayama J. Grewal S.I. Tanaka K. Murakami Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1766-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Baum M. Clarke L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Human CENP-B is a dimeric protein composed of 80-kDa subunits (31Earnshaw W.C. Machlin P.S. Bordwell B.J. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4979-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It contains DNA-binding domains and a dimerization domain at the N terminus and the C terminus, respectively (32Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic observations showed that CENP-B bundles the two distant CENP-B boxes by its dimer formation and DNA binding activities (13Yoda K. Ando S. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Okazaki T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The bundling activity suggests that, in the centromere, CENP-B may function in the higher ordered chromatin formation, in addition to the centromere-specific nucleosome assembly. To reveal the molecular mechanism of the CENP-B functions in centromeric chromatin formation, we determined previously the crystal structure of the CENP-B N-terminal DNA-binding domain complexed with the CENP-B box DNA (33Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of another CENP-B functional domain, the dimerization domain, at 1.65-Å resolution. The structure provides new insights into CENP-B dimerization that may play an essential role in the centromere-specific heterochromatin formation. Purification of the Dimerization Domain of CENP-B—A DNA fragment containing the CENP-B-(540-599) portion of the human CENP-B gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI site of the pET15b vector. Selenomethionine-labeled CENP-B-(540-599) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RP-X cells under the control of the T7 promoter as a His6-tagged protein. The E. coli strains carrying the CENP-B-(540-599) expression vector were grown at 30 °C, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 80 μm) was added at an OD600 of 0.4 to induce protein expression. After overnight cultivation at 18 °C, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 × g, and the lysate was mixed gently by the batch method with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h. The CENP-B-(540-599)-bound Ni-NTA-agarose beads were then packed into an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 30-column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm imidazole, at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml/min. The His6-tagged CENPB-(540-599) was eluted in a 20-column volume linear gradient from 5 to 300 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the His6 tag was uncoupled from CENP-B-(540-599) by a digestion with 10 units of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) per milligram of CENP-B-(540-599). Then, the fractions containing CENP-B-(540-599) were mixed with 5 ml of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h and then packed into an Econo column (Bio-Rad). The heparin-Sepharose beads with CENP-B-(540-599) were washed with 6-column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 50 mm NaCl, and CENP-B-(540-599) was eluted in a 12-column volume linear gradient from 50 to 800 mm NaCl in this buffer. The CENP-B-(540-599) protein was concentrated and further purified by HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization and Structure Determination—The purified CENP-B-(540-599) was concentrated up to 12 mg of protein per milliliter, and crystals were obtained by the hanging drop method after mixing an equal volume of 12 mg/ml CENP-B-(540-599) with a reservoir solution of 50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5) containing 0.5 m sodium citrate. The CENP-B-(540-599) crystals were soaked in a cryo-protectant solution of 50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5) containing 5% glycerol for a few minutes. Then, the crystals were transferred to 50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5) containing 10% glycerol for a few minutes and transferred again to 50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5) containing 20% glycerol. The crystals were flash-frozen in a stream of N2 gas (100 K). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell constants of a = 43.7 Å, b = 49.0 Å, and c = 100.7 Å, and contain two dimers per asymmetric unit. High resolution diffraction data were obtained using the synchrotron radiation source at the RIKEN beam line BL44B2 station (RIKEN Structural Biology Beamline II; Ref. 34Adachi S. Oguchi T. Tanida H.

The structure of CENP-B-(540-599) was initially solved to 1.8-Å resolution by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). General handling of the scaled data was carried out with programs from the CCP4 suite (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The magnitudes of the anomalous differences at the peak wavelength were normalized, and the density modification was performed with RESOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was sufficiently clear to build an initial model of the structure. The model was built with the program TURBO-FRODO (38Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Structural refinement was performed using ARPwARP (39Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamizin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), XPLOR version 3.851 (40Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.851 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar), and REFMAC. Solvent molecules were placed at the positions where spherical electron density peaks were found above 1.3 σ in the 2Fo - Fc map and above 3 σ in the Fo - Fc map and where the stereochemically reasonable hydrogen bonds were allowed. Structural evaluations of the final models using PROCHECK (41Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The His6 tag was uncoupled with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) from the CENP-B-(540-599) portion, which migrated slightly faster than the His6-tagged protein upon SDS-polyacrylamide (15-25%) gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A, lane 3).

Gel filtration analysis revealed that the molecular mass of the purified CENP-B-(540-599) is ∼16 kDa (Fig. 1B), which corresponds nearly to that of two molecules of CENP-B-(540-599) (14.5 kDa for two CENP-B-(540-599) molecules). Therefore, we concluded that the purified CENP-B-(540-599) formed homodimers in solution. Then, the CENP-B-(540-599) dimer was concentrated up to 12 mg of protein per milliliter, and the crystals were obtained by the hanging drop method. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell constants of a = 43.71 Å,b = 48.96 Å,c = 100.70 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°, and contain two dimers per asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was solved by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted sample (Table I). A diffraction data set was collected at 1.65-Å resolution at beamline BL44B2 in SPring-8, Harima, Japan. Protein Structure—In the crystal structure, CENP-B-(540-599) is composed of two α-helices (α1 and α2) (Fig. 2A), which are folded into an antiparallel configuration (Fig. 2B). The human CENP-B-(540-599) region is perfectly conserved among the mammalian CENP-Bs, except for the hamster CENP-B Trp-595 residue, indicating that the dimerization domain structures of mammalian CENP-Bs are identical (Fig. 2A). The α1 and α2 helices are amphipathic, and the two CENP-B-(540-599) monomers, which interact via their hydrophobic surfaces, form a dimer with a symmetrical, antiparallel, four-helix bundle structure (Fig. 2, B-D). The last 16 residues of each CENP-B-(540-599) C terminus, which is the natural C terminus of the full-length CENP-B, are disordered. Therefore, they are not required for dimer formation. This may reflect the flexible nature of the CENP-B C-terminal region, which is rich in glycine residues. Interestingly, the amino acid residues in the CENP-B region containing the amphipathic helices are significantly conserved in the human Tigger1 transposase (Fig. 2A), which also shares sequence similarity with CENP-B in the N-terminal DNA-binding and central transposase-like domains. Therefore, the Tigger1 transposase may be a CENP-B functional homologue, which can complement the CENP-B function in CENP-B-deficient mice. Furthermore, the amino acid residues in the structured region of CENP-B-(540-599) are also conserved in the S. pombe CENP-B homologues Abp1, Cbh1, and Cbh2 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the dimerization mechanisms of the human and fission yeast CENP-Bs are similar. The crystals used in the present study contain two dimers per asymmetric unit in which the CENP-B-(540-599) dimers directly interact with each other (Fig. 2E). The root mean square deviation value between these CENP-B-(540-599) dimers was 0.7 Å for the Cα atoms, indicating that these CENP-B-(540-599) dimers share almost identical structures. The Dimer Interface—As shown in Fig. 3A, the two CENPB-(540-599) monomers dimerize to form an antiparallel, four-helix bundle. This type of dimerization is also present in the bacterial ROP protein (root mean square deviation value of 2.6 Å for the Cα atoms) (Fig. 3B). The two α-helices of CENP-B-(540-599) are arranged in parallel. Similarly, the two α-helices of the ROP monomer are also parallel in the dimeric form. The topologies in the dimeric forms of CENP-B-(540-599) and ROP are the same; the N-terminal helices interact with those of the other monomer. Similar four-helix bundle structures were also found in the human telomere-binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 (42Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). However, these four helices are only parts of the large dimerization domains of TRF1 and TRF2 (Fig. 3E). Therefore, the dimerization domains of these telomere-binding proteins differ from that of CENP-B. The structural similarities between the CENP-B-(540-599) dimer and the dimerization interfaces of TRF1 (65-111 residues) and TRF2 (43-89 residues) were not significant (root mean square deviation values of 3.5 and 3.3 Å, respectively, for the Cα atoms), and the two helices of the TRF1 or TRF2 monomer within the interface are non-parallel (the angles between these helices are ∼15°) (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, these results indicate that the CENP-B-(540-599) dimer structure is unique. The dimerization interface of CENP-B-(540-599) is a large, buried surface area of 1,386 Å2 (∼34% of the monomer surface) (Fig. 4A), which is large enough to confirm the natural dimerization of CENP-B. On the other hand, the area buried in the dimer-dimer surface in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2D) is as small as 711 Å2, indicating that this interaction is non-physiological. In the functional dimerization interface, 23 residues of one monomer form van der Waals contacts with the other monomer (Fig. 4B). Specific hydrogen bonds were also found in the large hydrophobic interface between the monomers, indicating that the CENP-B-(540-599) dimer formation is structure-specific. The side chain OH group of Tyr-557 forms a hydrogen bond with the Thr-582 Oγ atom of the other monomer (Fig. 4C, top). The δ-NH group of His-570 forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-577 Oδ2 atom of the other monomer (Fig. 4C, bottom). These interactions are nearly symmetrical between the monomers because of their non-crystallographic symmetry. Centromeric Chromatin—CENP-B reportedly bundles two distant CENP-B boxes through its dimer formation and DNA-binding abilities (13Yoda K. Ando S. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Okazaki T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This DNA-bundling activity should be important for the centromeric chromatin formation. To reveal the functional significance of the CENP-B DNA-bundling activity, structural analyses of the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of CENP-B would be useful. We determined previously the crystal structure of the CENP-B N-terminal DNA-binding domain (CENP-B-(1-129)) in a complex form with the CENP-B box DNA (33Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of another CENP-B functional domain, the dimerization domain, which revealed that the CENP-B dimerization domains form a homodimer with a symmetrical, antiparallel, four-helix bundle structure. Many hydrophobic residues face the monomer-monomer interface and form van der Waals contacts between the monomers. In fact, no CENPB-(540-599) monomer was detected in solution by the gel filtration analysis. Therefore, the monomeric form of the CENP-B dimerization domain cannot exist in solution, because the hydrophobic surfaces, which correspond to about 34% of the monomer surface, are exposed to the solvent. In the crystal structure, the N-terminal loops of the CENPB-(540-599) dimer were located on opposite sides of the dimer. These N-terminal positions of the CENP-B-(540-599) dimer may be suitable for capturing two distant CENP-B boxes with its N-terminal DNA-binding domains, as shown in the model presented in Fig. 5. Because the CENP-B box sequence exists in every other α-satellite repeat (171 base pairs), CENP-B may accommodate a pair of centromeric nucleosomes that contain histones H2A, H2B, H4, and a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, between two CENP-B boxes tethered by the CENP-B dimer (Fig. 5).

Proteins of the Sac10b family are highly conserved among thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea, and homologous sequences have also been identified in eukaryal proteins from higher plants, protists, and vertebrates (1Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F.

The members of this family have been postulated to play a role in chromosomal organization in Archaea since the initial isolation of Sac10b from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius in the mid-1980s. Sac10b exists as a dimer of two 10-kDa subunits in solution and binds to DNA nonspecifically (4Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Bacterial Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1986Google Scholar, 5Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 405-413Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies have shown that Sac10b binds to DNA cooperatively and forms different protein-DNA complexes depending on protein/DNA ratios but does not induce DNA supercoiling or compact DNA (6Lurz R. Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Dobrinski B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Bell et al. (2Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) discovered that Alba (also named Sso10b, a member of Sac10b family) forms a specific complex with a Sir2 homolog in Sulfolobus solfataricus cell extracts. They found that Sir2 in the presence of NAD+ can regulate the DNA binding affinity of Alba by deacetylation of Lys16 of the protein. More recently, the crystal structure of Alba has been solved. Interestingly, the protein shares structural homology to the C-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli translation factor IF3 and the N-terminal DNA binding domain of DNase I. A model for the Alba-DNA interaction has been proposed (7Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Ssh10b, another member of the Sac10b family, was isolated from Sulfolobus shibatae (1Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protein is highly abundant and basic and binds double-stranded DNA without apparent sequence specificity. Gel retardation assays have shown that Ssh10b has two modes of DNA binding with distinctively different binding densities. In the low binding density mode, Ssh10b exhibits a binding size of ∼12 bp of DNA, whereas in the high binding density mode, the protein appears to bind shorter stretches of DNA. Interestingly, Ssh10b affects DNA topology in a temperature-dependent fashion; it is capable of significantly constraining DNA in negative supercoils at temperatures higher than 318 K, but this ability is drastically reduced at 298 K (1Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A previous NMR study revealed the co-existence of two forms of Ssh10b dimers at temperatures between 283 and 320 K, with one dominating at lower temperatures and the other at higher temperatures (8Tong Y. Cui Q. Feng Y. Huang L. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for the conformational heterogeneity of the Ssh10b dimer and the temperature dependence of the interaction of Ssh10b with DNA remained to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the heterogeneous conformations of Ssh10b and the structural factors influencing the interaction of Ssh10b with DNA by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. We found that the cis-trans isomerization of the Leu61-Pro62 peptide bond of Ssh10b is the primary determinant of the conformational heterogeneity of the Ssh10b dimer. We also found that the equilibrium between the cis- and trans-forms of Ssh10b is sensitive to temperature. Our data suggest that the effect of temperature on the capacity of the protein to constrain negative DNA supercoils is related to the temperature-dependent conversion between the two Ssh10b conformations. Expression and Purification of Ssh10b and Its Mutants—Ssh10b was produced from a synthetic gene with codon usage optimized for expression in E. coli. The gene was created from 12 overlapping oligonucleotides primers that were ligated and then cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of vector pBV220. The genes of Δ8 (deletion of the N-terminal eight residues), Δ8P18A (Pro18 replaced by Ala of the Δ8 mutant), and P62A (Pro62 replaced by Ala) mutants of Ssh10b were obtained by primer-directed mutagenesis. Each gene was cloned into expression vector pET11c, and the products were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The transformed cultures were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB broth containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin until A600 = 0.8-1.0, and expression was induced for 2 h by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The harvested cells were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C and then the supernatant was heated for 20 min at 80 °C to precipitate the E. coli proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a Resource-S column. Bound proteins were eluted with a 50-ml KCl gradient (0 to 0.75 m). Fractions containing Ssh10b proteins were pooled, dialyzed against distilled de-ionized water, and finally lyophilized. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE to be more than 95% and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight to be free of nucleic acid contaminants. NMR Sample Preparation—15N or 13C singly labeled and 15N/13C doubly labeled Ssh10b proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) grown in M9 minimal medium using 15NH4Cl and/or 13C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. All protein samples for NMR measurements were dissolved in 500 μl of 90% H2O/10% D2O containing 20 mm deuterated acetate buffer, pH 4.8, 50 μl of NaN3, 1 μm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid and 20 mm KCl to a final protein concentration of about 1 mm, unless otherwise indicated. The sample for determination of the dimer interface of Ssh10b was 15N/13C asymmetrically labeled. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and an actively shielded three-axis gradient unit. The experimental temperature was set to 310 K except for the temperature-dependent experiments. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the internal standard 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid at 0 ppm. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were calculated indirectly using the corresponding consensus Ξ ratios (9Markley J.L.

Although the assignment of the T-form Ssh10b has already been published (8Tong Y. Cui Q. Feng Y. Huang L. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), assignment of the remaining resolved resonances of the C-form Ssh10b was achieved by further exploring existing spectra: 3D 1The abbreviations used are: 3Dthree-dimensional2Dtwo-dimensionalEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayNOEnuclear Overhauser effectdsDNAdouble-stranded DNA.1H-13C-15N HNCA, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HNCO experiments for backbone assignments and HBHA(CBCA)NH, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, and CC(CO)NH, as well as 3D 1H-13C HCCH-TOCSY experiments for side chain assignments. Most of the backbone assignments of [P62A]Ssh10b was obtained by comparison with Ssh10b; the remaining ambiguities were resolved with an HNCA experiment. A 3D NOESY-1H,13C-HMQC experiment was carried out to distinguish the cis and trans conformations of the X-prolyl bond of Ssh10b. Conformational exchange of Ssh10b was monitored using a series of 2D 1H-15N correlation experiments for simultaneous measurements of 15N longitudinal decay and chemical exchange rates at exchange delays of 12, 52, 152, 302, 452, 552, 652, 902, 1102, 1302, and 1602 ms (10Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ssh10b was measured at temperatures ranging from 283 to 330 K at increments of 3.5 K. To determine residues involved in the dimer interface, a 2D version of the four-dimensional 1H,13C-HMQC-1H,1H-NOESY-1H,15N-HSQC experiment (11Muhandiram D.R. Xu G.Y. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 463-470Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was carried out on the 15N/13C asymmetrically labeled Ssh10b sample, and 15N was allowed to evolve in the indirect dimension. The mixing time of the experiment was 150 ms. 2D intensity modulated HSQC (12Permi P. Kilpelainen I. Annila A. Heikkinen S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used to measure the 3JNHα coupling constants on 15N singly labeled proteins. The delay for 3J coupling evolution was set to 30 ms. 2D 1H-15N HSQC experiments were also used for exploring the binding behavior of Ssh10b with synthesized 16-bp double-strand DNA fragments (5′-GGCAGACGCGTCTGCC). three-dimensional two-dimensional electrophoretic mobility shift assay nuclear Overhauser effect double-stranded DNA. All NMR data were processed and analyzed using Felix 98 (Accelrys Inc.). The data points in each indirect dimension were usually doubled by linear prediction and zero-filled. A 90 to 60° shifted square sine bell apodization was used for all dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A 108-bp double-stranded DNA fragment (5′-CGACGTTGTA AAACGACGGC CAGTGCCAAG CTTGGCTGCA GGTCGACGGA TCCCCCCAAT GCTTCGTTTC GTATCACACA CCCCAAAGCC TTCTGCTTTG AATGCTGCC) was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled fragment was incubated with Ssh10b or [P62A]Ssh10b for 15 min at either 293 or 320 K. The reaction mixture of 20 μl contained 0.5 to 1 ng of DNA fragment, 0.01 to 2.5 μm Ssh10b or [P62a]Ssh10b, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6. Protein-DNA complexes were loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.1× Tris-Borate-EDTA (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: B.23Google Scholar) and run at a constant voltage. The temperature of the samples was maintained at either 293 or 320 K using a circulating water bath. Following electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to x-ray film. Nick Closure Assay—The single-nick plasmid pUC18 was prepared as described previously (14Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The nicked plasmid (1 μg) was incubated with Ssh10b or [P62A]Ssh10b at various mass ratios for 5 min at temperatures of 298 or 330 K. The ligating reactions were then performed as described previously (15Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2560-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase (3 Weiss units) and Pfu DNA ligase (4 Weiss units) were used for the reactions carried out at 298 and 330 K, respectively. After the ligation reaction, the samples were analyzed by 1.4% agarose electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris-Phosphate-EDTA (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: B.23Google Scholar). Co-existence of Two Ssh10b Homodimers with Different Conformations—As shown in the previous study, two sets of cross-peaks (for simplicity denoted as “doublets” hereafter) are observed for most residues of Ssh10b in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1A) (8Tong Y. Cui Q. Feng Y. Huang L. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The signal intensities of the resonance doublets are not equal, with one signal stronger than the other in all doublets. Although the results of chemical cross-linking (1Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the related crystal structure (7Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggest that Ssh10b is a dimer, the resonance doublets with unequal signal intensities (Fig. 1A) cannot be attributed to an asymmetric arrangement of the two monomeric units of the Ssh10b molecule under the sample conditions used in the NMR experiments, as in this case the intensities of the two resonance signals in the doublet should be equal. The chemical shift differences between the higher (δH) and lower (δL) intensity resonance signals in the doublets in Fig. 1A were calculated as the weighted differences between the 15N (ΔδN = δN,H - δN,L) and 1HN (ΔδHN = δHN,H - δHN,L) values, according to Δδ = (ΔδHN2 + 0.17ΔδN2)1/2 (Fig. 2) (16Ogura K. Nagata K. Horiuchi M. Ebisui E. Hasuda T. Yuzawa S. Nishida M. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although both monomer and dimer crystal forms of Alba have been obtained (7Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the Δδ values make it clear that the Ssh10b molecule does not exist as a mixture of dimeric and monomeric forms in solution. If this were the case, then the resonance doublets should be observed only for residues located at the dimer interface. The cross-peaks shown in Fig. 3 correspond to the residues at the Ssh10b dimer interface, detected by X-nucleus edited NOESY. When mapped to the sequence, the data indicate that helix α2, a portion near the C-terminal of strand β3, and the N-terminal part of strand β4 are involved in the dimeric surface (Fig. 4A). However, Δδ values (Fig. 2) reveal that the residues of the N-terminal part of strand β4 give only “singlet” signals, whereas residues in helix α1 and strands β1 and β2, which are distant from the interface, generate doublet signals (Fig. 4B). The line widths for each pair of doublets are the same. In addition, the ratios of the signal intensities of the doublets are independent of the concentrations (0.05-1.5 mm) of Ssh10b as revealed by NMR experiments (data not shown). These therefore also exclude the possibility of an oligomerization equilibrium. Because Ssh10b is dimeric as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown), it was considered whether two forms of Ssh10b dimer might co-exist in solution. The form with higher signal intensity in doublets was assigned as the T-form and the other with lower signal intensity as the C-form. No “multiplets” other than doublets were observed for most residues of Ssh10b (Fig. 1A), consistent with both the T-form and the C-form as homodimers, with the monomeric subunits arranged symmetrically in each dimer.Fig. 2Differences of chemical shifts (Δδ) and J-coupling constants (Δ3JNHα) of the resonance doublets at 310 K and the changes in the 1HN chemical shifts versus residue number of Ssh10b. Values of ΔΔδT-C were obtained from experiments with the sample of Ssh10b at different temperatures. Values of ΔδT(DNA)318 and ΔδC(DNA)318 were obtained from the experiments with a sample of Ssh10b in complex with DNA at 318 K.

The J-coupling constants of Ssh10b were measured by 2D intensity modulated HSQC (12Permi P. Kilpelainen I. Annila A. Heikkinen S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The differences between the 3JNHα value for the T-form and for the C-form (Δ3JNHα) at each residue position is shown in Fig. 2. Residues with an absolute Δ3JNHα value greater than 1 Hz are found in segments spanning the whole molecule: the N-terminal region, the loop linking strand β1 and helix α1, helices α1 and α2, and the C-terminal of strand β4. This suggested that the main-chain conformations are different in the two forms of the Ssh10b dimer. Cis and Trans Conformations of Ssh10—Fig. 5 shows portions of a 1H-15N heteronuclear chemical exchange spectrum at an exchange delay of 1.3 s (10Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Two categories of doublets, classified by the exchange features, were observed for Ssh10b. Residues Thr5, Thr7, and Ser9 gave exchange cross-peaks (Fig. 5A) when the exchange delays were set in the range of 0.1 to 1.6s. However, the remaining doublets shown in Fig. 1A did not give any exchange cross-peaks at the same exchange delays but gave a result like that shown in Fig. 5B for residue Lys97. Thr5-Pro6-Thr7-Pro8-Ser9 is an unstructured N-terminal segment of Ssh10b as determined by the chemical shift index (8Tong Y. Cui Q. Feng Y. Huang L. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The appearances of the exchange cross-peaks of Thr5, Thr7, and Ser9 are clearly because of the cis-trans isomerization of the X-prolyl bonds in this segment. Thr7 is between Pro6 and Pro8 and therefore showed two minor peaks in Fig. 1A and four exchange cross-peaks in Fig. 5A. The intensity ratios of the major auto-peaks to the minor ones were about 11:1 at 310 K, a value much higher than that for the remaining doublets in Fig. 1A. Therefore, the remaining doublets were not caused by the cis-trans isomerization of Thr5-Pro6 or Thr7-Pro8 peptide bonds. This was confirmed by the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [Δ8]Ssh10b (spectrum not shown), in which all resonance doublets remained the same as those in Fig. 1A, except for the absence of the cross-peaks for residues Gly4, Thr5, Thr7, Ser9, Met10, and Val11, because the N-terminal eight residues are truncated in [Δ8]Ssh10b molecule. Ssh10b contains four prolines at positions 6, 8, 18, and 62 in the sequence. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [Δ8P18A]Ssh10b was almost the same as that of [Δ8]Ssh10b except for the appearance of a new cross-peak for Ala18 (data not shown). Thus, replacement of the proline by alanine at position 18 did not influence the conformational heterogeneity of the Ssh10b dimer. Pro62 is located in the loop linking helix α2 and strand β3 (8Tong Y. Cui Q. Feng Y. Huang L. Wang J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The P62A mutant Ssh10b ([P62A]Ssh10b) was confirmed to be a dimer in solution by diffusion measurements using the BPP-LED pulse sequence (18Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199-203Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) designed for determining the molecule size (data not shown). The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [P62A]Ssh10b is shown in Fig. 1B. Only a single set of cross-peaks was observed for all residues except the residues Gly4, Thr5, Thr7, Ser9, and Asn10 of [P62A]Ssh10b. Substitution of Pro62 by Ala62 eliminated the cis-trans isomerization, so that the mutant Ssh10b dimer was found in a single conformational state. Overlay of Fig. 1, B and A shows that the cross-peaks of [P62A]Ssh10b can be mapped to the cross-peaks of the T-form of Ssh10b. This indicates that the T-form of the Ssh10b homodimer adopts the same conformation as that of the [P62A]Ssh10b homodimer. Fig. 6A shows 1H-1H slices at the 13Cα frequencies of Leu61 and Pro-62 extracted from the 3D NOESY-1H,13C-HMQC (lower strip) and the 3D HCCH-TOCSY (upper strip) spectra for the T-form Ssh10b dimer, whereas Fig. 6B shows those for the C-form Ssh10b dimer. Two inter-residue NOE cross-peaks between 1Hα of Leu61 and 1Hδ1 and 1Hδ2 of Pro62 could be observed in the 3D NOESY-HMQC strip for the T-form Ssh10b dimer (Fig. 6A). The appearance of these two NOEs characterizes the trans conformation of the Leu61-Pro62 peptide bond in the T-form Ssh10b dimer. In the strips corresponding to the C-form Ssh10b dimer (Fig. 6B), only one NOE cross-peak between the 1Hα resonances of Leu61 and Pro62 was observed. This NOE thus provides conclusive evidence that the Leu61-Pro62 peptide bond in the C-form homodimer of Ssh10b is in a cis conformation. The above experimental results show that the global conformational heterogeneity of Ssh10b is the result of the cis-trans transformation of the Leu61-Pro62 peptide bond of the Ssh10b molecule. As expected given the predominately trans conformation of all amino acids other than proline, [P62A]Ssh10b appeared as a homodimer with the same conformation as that of the T-form homodimer of the Ssh10b molecule. 1HNResonances for the T-form and C-form Ssh10b Dimer at Different Temperatures—To study the temperature-dependent features of Ssh10b, 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at different temperatures for a sample in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 containing 20 mm KCl (spectra not shown). The population ratios of the C-form to the T-form of Ssh10b were obtained by measuring the intensities of the corresponding cross-peaks for both conformations over the temperature range 283 to 330 K (Fig. 7). The ratio of C-form to T-form was around 0.26 at 318 K and greater than 0.6 below 298 K. Clearly, the T-form of the Ssh10b dimer is dominant, although the population of the C-form increases on decreasing the temperature. The 1HN chemical shifts of all resolved cross-peaks in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured at different temperatures for the T-form and the C-form Ssh10b dimers. The differences between the 1HN chemical shifts at 298 K (δ298) and at 318 K (δ318) for the T-form (ΔδT = δT298 - δT318) and the C-form (ΔδC = δC298 - δC318) of a Ssh10b sample containing a high concentration of salt (200 mm KCl), and ΔδT = δT300 - δT320 and ΔδC = δC300 - δC320 of a Ssh10b sample containing a low concentration of salt (20 mm KCl), were obtained (data not shown). On increasing the temperature, the 1HN chemical shifts of the majority of the cross-peaks were shifted upfield (+Δδ) for both the T-form and the C-form Ssh10b dimers. However, this was not the case for residues Ala25, Leu48, Val53, Arg57, and Leu61 of the C-form of Ssh10b in the sample containing 20 mm KCl and for residues Asn58 and Asp63 of the C-form of Ssh10b in the sample containing 200 mm KCl, which all showed downfield shifts (-Δδ) on increasing the temperature. The extent of upfield movements of the 1HN chemical shifts (+Δδ) varied for the residues in the Ssh10b dimer that generated resonance doublets. The differences between the changes in the 1HN chemical shifts of the resonances for the T-form and for the C-form of Ssh10b (ΔΔδT-C = ΔδT - ΔδC), obtained from the data of the Ssh10b sample containing 200 mm KCl at temperature of 298 and 318 K, are shown in Fig. 2 and also mapped onto 3D structure (Fig. 4C). For residues Tyr22, Val23, Ala25, Ala26, and Leu27, located in helix α1, and residues Lys48, Asp51, Val53, Glu54, Arg57, and Asn58, located in helix α2, the ΔΔδT-C values are larger than +0.01 ppm. Residues Val34, located in the turn between helix α1 and strand β2, and Asp63, in the loop linking helix α2 and strand β3, also showed +ΔΔδT-C (>0.01 ppm). However, negative ΔΔδT-C with absolute values larger than 0.01 ppm were observed for residues Ser35 and Ile37 at the N terminus of strand β2, residues Lys64, Glu66, Gly73, Ser74, and Gln75 in strand β3, and residues Ile92, Ile94, Arg95, Lys96, and Lys97 at the C terminus of strand β4 (Fig. 2). Thus, the upfield shifts of the 1HN resonances of the residues in helices α1 and α2 of the T-form were larger than those of the C-form on increasing the temperature. However, for residues involved in formation of the β2-β4-β3 antiparallel β-sheet, the upfield shifts of the 1HN resonances of the T-form were smaller than those of the C-form when the temperature was increased. This provides further evidence for conformational differences, in particular different strength of hydrogen bonding, in the two forms of the Ssh10b dimers. NMR Spectral Features of the dsDNA-Ssh10b Complex at Different Temperatures—The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ssh10b and the dsDNA-Ssh10b complex in sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 200 mm KCl were recorded at temperatures of 318 and 298 K for a Ssh10b:DNA ratio of 1:3 (spectra not shown). The 1HN chemical shifts of all resolved cross-peaks in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ssh10b (δ) and of Ssh10b in complex with DNA (δ(DNA)) were measured. The differences of Δδ(DNA) from δ of the cross-peaks (Δδ(DNA) = δ(DNA) - δ) were obtained for both the T-form (ΔδT(DNA)) and the C-form (ΔδC(DNA)) Ssh10b molecules at 318 K (ΔδT(DNA)318 = δT(DNA)318 - δT318, ΔδC(DNA)318 = δC(DNA)318 - δC318) and at 298 K (ΔδT(DNA)298 = δT(DNA)298 - δT298, ΔδC(DNA)298 = δC(DNA)298 - δC298). The Δδ(DNA) values represent the changes in the 1HN chemical shifts of Ssh10b on binding to dsDNA. The histograms showing the chemical shift changes of the 1HN resonances for both the T-form and C-form Ssh10b dimers upon addition of dsDNA at a temperature of 318 K (ΔδT(DNA)318 and ΔδC(DNA)318) are shown in F"

NAD+-dependent DNA ligases are essentially restricted to eubacteria, thus constituting an attractive target in the development of novel antibiotics. Although such a project might involve the systematic testing of a vast number of chemical compounds, it can essentially gain from the preliminary deciphering of the conformational stability and structural perturbations associated with the formation of the catalytically active adenylated enzyme. We have, therefore, investigated the adenylation-induced conformational changes in the mesophilic Escherichia coli and thermophilic Thermus scotoductus NAD+-DNA ligases, and the resistance of these enzymes to thermal and chemical (guanidine hydrochloride) denaturation. Our results clearly demonstrate that anchoring of the cofactor induces a conformational rearrangement within the active site of both mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes accompanied by their partial compaction. Furthermore, the adenylation of enzymes increases their resistance to thermal and chemical denaturation, establishing a thermodynamic link between cofactor binding and conformational stability enhancement. Finally, guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases is shown to be a complex process that involves accumulation of at least two equilibrium intermediates, the molten globule and its precursor.

Finally, guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases is shown to be a complex process that involves accumulation of at least two equilibrium intermediates, the molten globule and its precursor. DNA ligases form a large family of evolutionarily related proteins that play important roles in a wide range of DNA transactions, including chromosomal DNA replication, DNA repair, and DNA recombination in all three kingdoms of life (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Cofactor requirements divide the ligases into two subfamilies, the NAD+-dependent DNA ligases and the ATP-dependent DNA ligases. Regardless of their energy source, they catalyze the sealing of 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini at nicks in duplex DNA by means of three distinct catalytic events (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The first step involves activation of the ligase through the formation of a covalent adenylated intermediate by transfer of the adenyl group of NAD+ or ATP to the ϵ-NH2 of a conserved lysine residue in the DNA ligase. In the second step the AMP moiety is transferred from the DNA ligase to the 5′-phosphate group at the single-strand break site, creating a new pyrophosphate bond. Finally, the phosphodiester bond formation is achieved upon an attack of the 3′-OH group of the DNA on the activated 5′-group with the concomitant release of AMP (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). At least one NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (referred to as LigA) is found in every bacterial species (2.Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The bacterial LigA enzymes are of fairly uniform size (∼70 kDa) and display extensive amino acid sequence conservation throughout the entire protein (3.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4.Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The atomic structures of the LigA enzymes from Bacillus stearothermophilus (N-terminal domain) (5.Singleton M.R. Hakansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Thermus filiformis (3.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have been determined by x-ray crystallography. The catalytic core of the bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase consists of adenylation (also named nucleotidyltransferase) and oligomer binding-fold domains (domain 1 and 2, respectively) and corresponds to the catalytic domain described for eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA ligases. The core is flanked by a short N-terminal domain (Ia) and three C-terminal domains, a tetracysteine domain that binds a single zinc atom (subdomain 3a), a helix-hairpin-helix domain (subdomain 3b), and a BRCT domain (named after the C terminus of the breast cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA1) (domain 4). ATP-dependent ligases are essentially found in bacteriophages, Archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes. Compared with NAD+ ligases they are more diverse in size but share a common ligase domain (formed by domains 1 and 2) referred to as the “catalytic core.” This domain contains six conserved sequence motifs, I, III, IIIa, IV, V-VI, that define a family of related nucleotidyltransferases including mRNA-capping enzymes as well as RNA and tRNA ligases (6.Hakansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Some ATP ligases are flanked by additional domains that are likely to be implicated in the enzyme specialization, targeting the various ATP DNA ligases to different pathways in DNA repair and replication (for review see Refs. 7.Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 8.Martin I.V. MacNeill S.A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3001-3005Crossref Google Scholar). NAD+ and ATP DNA ligases have minimal sequence identity. However, the tertiary structures of the catalytic cores (made up of adenylation and oligomer binding-fold domains) are quite well conserved (4.Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5.Singleton M.R. Hakansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7.Timson D.J. Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and NAD+-dependent DNA ligases exhibit some homology with motifs I-VI that are conserved in ATP-dependent DNA ligases (4.Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as observed for the ATP-dependent isozymes, motifs I-V are located within the catalytic core of the NAD+ ligases, indicating that the active site has been conserved between both types of enzymes (4.Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The conservation and similarity of these structural features strongly suggest that the two types of ligases have evolved from a common ancestor and are likely to have a similar basic reaction mechanism. The divergence may have largely arisen from the need to accommodate different nucleotide cofactors (9.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of eubacterial DNA ligases and their cofactor specificity have led to the assumption that these enzymes may be a potential target for new bactericidal drugs (5.Singleton M.R. Hakansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Such inhibitors would act by blocking the reaction of the enzyme with NAD+, leading to an inactive enzyme and, thus, growth arrest of the eubacterium. The drug binding site would ideally be unique to, and conserved among NAD+-DNA ligases but absent from ATP-dependent ligases and other essential NAD+-requiring enzymes. To date some effective inhibitors of NAD+-dependent DNA ligase have been isolated (10.Ciarrocchi G. MacPhee D.G. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2766-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T. Warnecke-Eberz U. Ziegelbauer K. Habich D. Labischinski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39435-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The development of an efficient bactericidal drug can essentially gain from the understanding of the conformational changes accompanying the catalysis of NAD+ ligases and from the deciphering of the structural components of NAD+ ligases interacting specifically with NAD+. Comprehension of these mechanisms would allow the identification of the enzyme region(s) that are targeted by drugs. In this view, major advances have been brought out by the resolution of the structure of the NAD+ ligase from T. filiformis DNA ligase (3.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this work it has been suggested that adenylation acts as a conformational switch, leading to the closure of the enzyme and the adoption of an active toroidal conformation able to bind DNA. Such a conformational change is likely to prevent the formation of non-productive ligase-DNA complexes in the cell. Additional information has also been drawn from the investigation of the role of Escherichia coli domain Ia (12.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9695-9700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This domain, unique to NAD+-dependent ligases, is essential for the reaction with NAD+. To gain further advances in the comprehension of the structural changes occurring upon adenylation, we have investigated the unfolding pathways of deadenylated and adenylated DNA ligase from the mesophile E. coli and compared them with those obtained for the thermophile Thermus scotoductus.

Biol. 1999; 285: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by adding excess β-NMN or β-NAD+, respectively. The ratio [NMN/NAD+]/[ligase] was ∼80. Deadenylated/adenylated mixtures were then incubated at 25 °C (Eclig) and 65 °C (Tslig) for 30 min and then cooled rapidly on ice. Under such conditions, efficiency of the deadenylation/adenylation reactions was more than 95%. When required, protein solutions were dialyzed against the appropriate buffer before experiments. DSC—DSC measurements were performed using a MicroCal MCSDSC instrument at a scan rate of 60 K h–1 and under 2 atm of nitrogen pressure. Samples (∼4 mg/ml) were dialyzed overnight against 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.6. To decrease aggregation that distorts the calorimetric traces and impairs deconvolution processes, a non-detergent sulfobetaine (3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propane sulfonate) was added before DSC experiment (26.Goldberg M.E. Expert-Bezancon N. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Fold. Des. 1995; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 0.5 m and 0.75 m for Eclig and Tslig, respectively. Thermograms were analyzed according to a non-two-state model in which Tm, ΔHcal, and ΔHeff of individual transitions are fitted independently using the MicroCal Origin software (version 2.9). All scans were found to be irreversible under the experimental conditions used for these studies. GdmCl-induced Unfolding Transitions—Eclig and Tslig deadenylated/adenylated samples were incubated overnight at 25 °C in the presence of various concentrations of GdmCl. Unfolding curves were determined by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence emission or far UV circular dichroism at 25 °C. The pH was checked to ensure a constant value throughout the whole transition, and the denaturant concentration was determined from refractive index measurements (27.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) using a R5000 hand refractometer from Atago. Fluorescence Measurements—Both intrinsic and ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation and emission slit widths were 2 and 4 nm, respectively, and the scan speed was 350 nm min–1. Cuvettes with a 1-cm path length were used. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed using a protein concentration of 25 μg/ml (∼0.33 μm) in 20 mm phosphate sodium, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, in the presence of various GdmCl concentrations, with excitation at 280 nm and emission spectra recorded from 300 to 440 nm. With all samples fluorescence spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence of the solution (buffer + denaturant). Two fluorescence parameters have been considered in this work, the fluorescence intensity at single excitation and emission wavelengths (fluorescence intensity (FI)) and the average emission wavelength (AEW) (28.Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The latter reflects changes in the shape of the spectrum as well as in position. Because it is an integral measurement, it has less error than measurements at a single wavelength (i.e. λmax). ANS fluorescence measurements were performed with the samples used for intrinsic fluorescence measurements, with excitation at 390 nm and emission spectra recorded from 420 to 600 nm. ANS fluorescence spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence of ANS. The ratio [ANS]/[ligase] was ∼250. Deconvolution of ANS curves was performed using the LabCalc software. Phase diagrams describing GdmCl-induced changes of fluorescence intensities were constructed as previously reported (29.Burstein E.A. Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence: Origin and Applications. 7.

Sci. 2003; 92: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The essence of this method, which is extremely sensitive for the detection of intermediate states, is to build up the diagram of Iλ1versus Iλ2, where Iλ1 and Iλ2 are the spectral intensity values measured at wavelengths λ1 and λ2 under different experimental conditions for a protein undergoing structural transformations. The relationship between Iλ1 and Iλ2 is described by the equation I(λ1) = a + bI(λ2). The calculations allowing the determination of such equation as well as the composition of a and b can be found elsewhere (32.Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Fink A.L. Uversky V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34.Uversky V.N. Garriques L.N. Millett I.S. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Doniach S. Fink A.L. J.

As a rule, λ1 and λ2 are arbitrary wavelengths of the spectrum, but in practice such diagrams are more informative if λ1 and λ2 are on different slopes of the spectrum. If the wavelengths are both from one slope or near the maximum some transitions may remain undetected. Stern-Volmer Quenching—The conformational state of enzymes was further characterized by acrylamide-induced fluorescence quenching. Samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and the protein concentrations were adjusted to provide an optical density at the excitation wavelength less than 0.1. Aliquots of a 1.2 m acrylamide stock solution were consecutively added to 1 ml of protein solution to increase acrylamide concentration by ∼5 mm steps. Experiments were performed using excitation at 295 nm with fluorescence emission set at 330 nm for Eclig and 333 nm for Tslig (excitation and emission slit widths were 1 and 4, respectively), and the fluorescence intensities were recorded at 30 °C for 30 s. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The data were corrected for the dilution effects and for the absorptive screening caused by acrylamide (ϵ295 nm = 0.25 m–1 cm–1 for acrylamide). Quenching data were plotted as the ratio of fluorescence in the absence of quencher (F0) to the intensity in the presence of quencher (F) against quencher concentration. The resulting data were fit to dynamic parameters according to the Stern-Volmer equation F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant and [Q] the quencher concentration (35.Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a CD6 Jobin Yvon spectropolarimeter under constant nitrogen flow. Spectra were recorded in the far UV region with a 0.1-cm path length cell at protein concentrations of ∼0.25 mg/ml. The buffer used was 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, in the presence of the desired GdmCl concentrations. Spectra were acquired at a scan speed of 20 nm min–1, with a 2-nm bandwidth and a 1-s integration time. Spectra were averaged over five scans and corrected for the contribution of the solvent. Raw data were expressed in terms of the mean residue ellipticity [θ] using the known mature adenylated Eclig (molecular weight = 74,020 Da) and Tslig (molecular weight = 76,855 Da) sequences for calculation of the mean residue weight. Unfolding of adenylated ligases as a function of GdmCl concentrations were recorded at 222 nm using a 2-nm bandwidth. At all denaturant concentrations at least 30 data points were acquired over 1 min (2-s integration time) and averaged. The resulting values were corrected for the contribution of the solvent. An estimate of the helical content (fH)ofNAD+-DNA ligases has been determined according to the relation [θ]222 = –30,300fH – 2340 (36.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Hydrodynamic dimensions (Stokes radius, RS) of adenylated NAD+ ligases in different conformational states were measured by gel filtration. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on the Superdex 200 H/R 10/30 prepacked fast protein liquid chromatography column calibrated according to Uversky (37.Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Protein solutions (∼0.25 mg/ml) containing the required concentrations of GdmCl were loaded onto the column equilibrated with the same buffer. The elution was carried out isocratically at a flow rate of 1.0–0.5 ml/min and monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. All measurements were made at 25 °C. Molecular Stokes radii (RS) were estimated from elution volume Vel measured according to the experimental equation RS = (1000/Vel – 42.44)/0.9114. The accuracy of determination of RS by this equation is about 5%. Recently it has been reported (38.Uversky V.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that the propensity of a protein to form an equilibrium intermediate(s), I, may be determined by the bulk content of hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues. Indeed, determination of the mean hydrophobicity <H> and the mean net charge <R> in proteins allow the discrimination between unfolding of proteins occurring according to a two-state (N ↔ U) or non-two-state (N ↔ I(x) ↔ U) pathway. The mean hydrophobicity <H> is defined as the sum of the normalized hydrophobicities of all residues divided by the number of residues in the polypeptide. The mean net charge <R> is defined as the net charge at pH 7.0 divided by the total number of residues. Proteins unfolding according to a N ↔ U scheme are specifically localized within a unique region of the charge-hydrophobicity space, with <H> = 0.422 ± 0.017 and <R> = 0.051 ± 0.032, whereas proteins unfolding according to a N ↔ I(x) ↔ U scheme are restricted within a unique region of the charge-hydrophobicity space, with <H> = 0.446 ± 0.023 and <R> = 0.027 ± 0.022 (38.Uversky V.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NAD+-dependent DNA ligases from E. coli (Eclig) and T. scotoductus (Tslig) are characterized by <H> of 0.483 and 0.450 and <R> of 0.030 and 0.007, respectively, thus predicting unfolding through one or a few intermediates. Acrylamide Quenching of Fluorescence—To characterize the conformational changes induced by adenylation, the flexibility of deadenylated and adenylated NAD+-DNA ligases has been probed by dynamic fluorescence quenching using acrylamide as a quencher. Because of its polar nature, this molecule quenches the fluorescence of surface-exposed and partially buried Trp residues. Fig. 1 shows the Stern-Volmer quenching plots for deadenylated and adenylated Eclig (Fig. 1A) and Tslig (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the Ksv of native deadenylated and adenylated NAD+ ligases clearly indicates a greater solvent accessibility of Trp residues in deadenylated enzymes that adopt an “open” conformation compared with their adenylated conformers (3.02 ± 0.03 versus 2.53 ± 0.04 m–1 for the deadenylated and adenylated Eclig and 7.11 ± 0.11 versus 5.66 ± 0.05 m–1 for the deadenylated and adenylated Tslig). This provides direct evidence for the induction of an open-closure mechanism of these enzymes upon adenylation and reinforces conclusions derived from purely structural studies (3.Lee J.Y. Chang C.

Thermal Denaturation of Deadenylated and Adenylated NAD+-DNA Ligases—Fig. 2 shows thermal denaturation curves of deadenylated and adenylated NAD+-DNA ligases monitored by DSC. Compared with Eclig, the unfolding pattern of Tslig is more complex because it is composed of two distinct absorption peaks. This phenomenon is likely to reflect temperature adaptation and has been attributed to a decrease of unfolding cooperativity in the thermophilic enzyme (14.Georlette D. Damien B. Blaise V. Depiereux E. Uversky V. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37015-37023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Deadenylated and adenylated Eclig and Tslig denature according to a non-two-state process since deconvolution of the excess heat capacity (Cp) functions reveals that these enzymes possess domains of distinct stability (Table I). In addition, the deviation from a two-state model is also confirmed by the fact that the ΔHcal/ΔHeff ratio exceeds unity (not shown). Fig. 2 and Table I also point out that cofactor binding increases the resistance of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases to thermal denaturation. This is manifested by the increased Tmax (by 8 and 6 °C for Eclig and Tslig, respectively) and calorimetric enthalpy ΔHcal (by 167 and 80 kJ mol–1 for Eclig and Tslig, respectively). Altogether these results clearly establish a conformational change upon adenylation as well as a thermodynamic link between cofactor binding and stability enhancement.Table IThermodynamic parameters of heat-induced unfolding of NAD+-DNA ligasesEnzymeTmaxaTmax corresponds to the temperature at the top of the peak.nbn refers to the number of calorimetric d"

In thermotolerant cells, protein synthesis is still rapidly inhibited by heat stress, but protein synthesis recovers faster than in naive heat-shocked cells, a phenomenon known as translational thermotolerance. Here we investigate the effect of overexpressing a single heat shock protein on cap-dependent and cap-independent initiation of translation during recovery from a heat shock. When overexpressing αB-crystallin or Hsp27, cap-dependent initiation of translation was protected but no effect was seen on cap-independent initiation of translation. When Hsp70 was overexpressed however, both cap-dependent and -independent translation were protected. This finding indicates a difference in the mechanism of protection mediated by small or large heat shock proteins. Phosphorylation of αB-crystallin and Hsp27 is known to significantly decrease their chaperone activity; therefore, we tested phosphorylation mutants of these proteins in this system. αB-crystallin needs to be in its non-phosphorylated state to give protection, whereas phosphorylated Hsp27 is more potent in protection than the unphosphorylatable form. This indicates that chaperone activity is not a prerequisite for protection of translation by small heat shock proteins after heat shock. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of kinases, among which is double-stranded RNA-activated kinase, the protective effect of overexpressing αB-crystallin is abolished. The synthesis of the endogenous Hsps induced by the heat shock to test for thermotolerance is also blocked by 2-aminopurine. Most likely the protective effect of αB-crystallin requires synthesis of the endogenous heat shock proteins. Translational thermotolerance would then be a co-operative effect of different heat shock proteins. Heat shock results in inhibition of general protein synthesis.

For example, during a heat shock, general macromolecular synthesis and processing is inhibited, and the set of transcription units that encode the heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hspheat shock proteinsHspsmall heat shock proteinseIF2αeukaryotic initiation factor 2αSGstress granulesRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPKRdouble-stranded RNA-activated kinaseIRESinternal ribosome entry siteFGFfibroblast growth factor. is activated (1.Laszlo A.

Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the Hsps is required for optimal survival of heat (or other) stress. The Hsps are a complex group of proteins, ranging in size between 90 and 20 kDa. The small heat shock proteins (sHsps) belong to a family of proteins distinguished by sharing a common protein domain, the so-called α-crystallin domain (for review, see Ref. 3.de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). In man, there are 10 different sHsps (4.Kappé G. Franck E. Verschuure P. Boelens W.C. Leunissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar); of these, Hsp27 and αB-crystallin are traditional heat shock proteins in the sense that their synthesis is induced by a heat shock (5.Kato K. Ito H. Inaguma Y. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 28: 129-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All sHsps, including the stress-inducible sHsps, are constitutively expressed in different tissues; αB-crystallin, for example, is abundant in lens, heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (5.Kato K. Ito H. Inaguma Y. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 28: 129-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv.

Biol. 2002; 28: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The best known property of Hsp27 and of αB-crystallin is their in vitro chaperone activity: they keep their substrates in solution but cannot refold them (for review, see Refs. 6.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar and 8.Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In vivo, they might act as a reservoir of unfolded proteins for the large Hsps, which are ATP-dependent refoldases. The sHsps are also thought to stabilize the cytoskeleton during stress (9.Quinlan R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 28: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); in addition, they interact with some components of the apoptotic pathway, thereby protecting the cell from apoptosis (10.Arrigo A.P.

Serine 59 is phosphorylated when cells are stressed, and serines 19 and 45 are found phosphorylated when cells are going into mitosis (11.Hoover H.E. Thuerauf D.J. Martindale J.J. Glembotski C.C. J.

Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Hsp27 has two (rodents) or three (man) phosphorylation sites. At normal temperature, Hsp27 is mainly unphosphorylated: after different kinds of stress, including heat shock, Hsp27 is extensively phosphorylated (5.Kato K. Ito H. Inaguma Y. Prog. Mol. Subcell.

Cells having a full complement of Hsps because of an earlier stress are more resistant to subsequent heat stress, a phenomenon known as thermotolerance.

Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32.Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), but other factors must be affected as well because the inactivation of eIF2B in rat hepatoma cells did not correlate directly with the level of phosphorylation of eIF2α (33.Scheper G.C. Mulder J. Kleijn M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. van Wijk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26850-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cap-binding complex must also be affected because cap-independent initiation of translation is more stress-resistant than is cap-dependent initiation of translation (34.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Sarnow P. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19198-19205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35.Kim Y.K. Jang S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Deficiency in eIF4E strongly inhibits general translation in HeLa cells, but translation of Hsp mRNAs and cap-independent mRNAs still takes place (36.Joshi-Barve S. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that resembles the pattern of translation in cells recovering from heat stress and which suggests that eIF4E is down-regulated during a heat shock. Stalled translation initiation complexes containing almost all components of the 48S preinitiation complex but not the 60S ribosomal subunit accumulate in the cytoplasm as stress granules (SG). Hsp27 has been detected in SGs as well (37.Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), possibly in complex with eIF4G (38.Cuesta R. Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1460-1470PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly in SGs is a highly dynamic process, and untranslated mRNAs are thought to be sorted and processed there for either reinitiation, degradation, or packaging into nonpolysomal messenger ribonucleo-protein complexes (39.Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). This indicates that during and after stress, SGs are important checkpoints for initiation of translation. Thus far, translational tolerance has only been assayed at the level of the overall rate of protein synthesis, and no distinction has been made between cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation. We show here that overexpression of either αB-crystallin or Hsp27 protects cap-dependent but not cap-independent translation initiation, whereas overexpression of Hsp70 affects both. Further, we show that the phosphorylation state of αB-crystallin or Hsp27 affects its ability to confer translational tolerance. Finally, we show that 2-aminopurine, a kinase inhibitor that inhibits eIF2α kinases such as double-stranded RNA-activated kinase (PKR) (40.Jarrous N. Osman F. Kaempfer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2814-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41.Ben-Asouli Y. Banai Y. Pel-Or Y. Shir A. Kaempfer R. Cell. 2002; 108: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), blocks the establishment of translational tolerance by overexpression of an sHsp. Cell Culture—C2 cells (mouse myoblast cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Applied Science) and supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) to prevent differentiation of these cells. T-REx cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with tetracycline repressor protein; Invitrogen) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) with glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and blasticydin (Invitrogen). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis of Heat-shocked Cells—For heat shock assays, 6-well plates were seeded with ∼2.5 × 105 cells/well for C2 cells and ∼6.5 × 105 cells/well for T-REx cells. The next day, cells were submitted to a heat shock by submerging plates in a 45 °C water bath. C2 cells were heat shocked for 30 min; T-REx cells were heat shocked for 60 min at 45 °C. Cells were harvested at various times during recovery at 37 °C by scraping in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% glycerol, 6% SDS, and 120 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8). Protein concentrations were measured by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol for 96-well plates. After addition of SDS sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, and bromphenol blue), 40 μg of the sample was loaded on gel, separated, and Western blotted. Blots were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, and 5% dried low-fat milk) and incubated with primary antibodies in appropriate dilutions in blocking buffer (anti-αB-crystallin mouse monoclonal 1:500, anti-Hsp25 rabbit polyclonal 1:5000, anti-Hsp70 1:1000; Stressgen) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes in blocking buffer, the blot was incubated with the secondary antibody with a conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for 1 h. The blots were washed again in blocking buffer, rinsed once with AP buffer (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and stained with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in AP buffer, dried, and analyzed with Molecular Analyst version 1.4.1 software (Bio-Rad) after scanning with a Bio-Rad GS700 imaging densitometer. Pulse Labeling—C2 cells were cultured in DMEM with penicillin, streptomycin, and 20% fetal calf serum to 80% confluence in 25-cm2 flasks. Cells were starved for 2 h in DMEM without methionine with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were heat shocked for 30 min at 45 °C and assayed for the level of protein synthesis at different time points during recovery. At these time points, medium was replaced by 2 ml of DMEM without methionine with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuging for 2 min at 5000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. After 10 min at 95 °C and 15 min in a sonicator bath, 25 μl of the sample were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel. To enhance the 35S signal, the gel was incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min after fixing with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid and destaining in 7.5% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid. After drying, the gel was autoradiographed overnight, and results were analyzed with Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad) after scanning with a Bio-Rad GS700 imaging densitometer. Transfections—C2 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). Approximately 6.5 × 104 cells were plated in DMEM with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA per well using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE plus reagent. As a transfection control, 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected, and the other 0.9 μg of DNA was divided over the various constructs, pHsp-Cap-Luc or pHsp-IRES-Luc and expression vectors for αB-crystallin, Hsp27, Hsp70, βB2-crystallin, or the empty vectors as control in a 1:1 ratio (except where indicated otherwise). 48 h after transfection, cells were heat shocked for 30 min at 45 °C (unless mentioned otherwise) and assayed for reporter gene activity during recovery at 37 °C. Approximately 2.5 × 105 T-REx cells were plated in minimum Eagle's medium with glutamax, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in 6-well plates and transfected after 24 h with 1 μg of DNA using 3 μl of Fugene reagent (Roche Applied Science) per well. As a control for the transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of the pGL3 control vector (Promega) was co-transfected. The pcDNA4TO LacZ (Invitrogen) and αB-crystallin, Hsp27, or empty expression vectors were used in a 1:1 ratio. 48 h after transfection, cells were heat shocked for 1 h at 45 °C. Where indicated, cells were pre-heat shocked for 30 min at 45 °C 6 h earlier. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 3 h, starting 3.5 h before the heat shock to induce the pcDNA4TO LacZ construct. After 3 h of induction, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh DMEM with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested during recovery at 37 °C and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. Transfections were done in triplicate and repeated at least twice with different batches of DNA. Unless otherwise indicated, results of representative experiments are shown. RT-PCR—Transfected cells were scraped in 0.5 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) per well. After transfer into a tube, 100 μl of chloroform was added and the mixture was vortexed for 15 s. After 15 min on ice and centrifuging for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, 200 μl of the upper phase was precipitated with an equal amount of isopropanol. At this step, material from three wells was pooled. Samples were left at –20 °C for at least 3 h. After centrifuging for 30 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, the pellet was washed twice with cold 70% ethanol and then air-dried for 5 min. The pellet was dissolved in 45 μl of H2O and stored at –20 °C. The RNA was treated with 7.5 units of RNase-free DNase per μg of RNA for 15 min at 37 °C, and DNase was then inactivated for 10 min at 70 °C. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the 1st-strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μg of RNA and random primers in a total volume of 20 μl. Primers used for the PCR were luciferase mRNA primers (at position +1330, TGGATGGCTACATTCTGGAGAC, and at position +1720, CCTTCTTGGCCTTTATGAGGATC) and, as a transfection control, β-galactosidase mRNA primers (at position +155, TGGCGTTACCCAACTTAATC, and at position +630, TCAGACGGCAAACGACTGT). The PCR was performed in a total of 25 μl, using 5 μl of cDNA, a mixture of luciferase and β-galactosidase mRNA primers, cDNA PCR buffer, dNTPs, and Advantage HF polymerase (Advantage-HF PCR kit, BD Biosciences). A parallel reaction was performed on 0.25 μg of the DNase-treated RNA to test for DNA contamination. The DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 60 s, primers were annealed at 66 °C for 30 s, and then elongation was performed at 68 °C for 90 s. PCR samples were taken after 20, 25, and 30 cycles and separated on 5% acrylamide gels in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Results were quantitated using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad) after scanning on a Bio-Rad Geldoc 1000 system. Samples shown did not contain DNA contamination. Treatment with 2-Aminopurine—For the pre-heat shock, cells were transfected with pcDNA4TO LacZ and pGL3 control vector in a 2:1 ratio with a total of 1 μg of DNA per well. 48 h after transfection, cells were pre-heat shocked for 30 min at 45 °C. The LacZ construct was induced as described in the transfection section of “Experimental Procedures.” 2-Aminopurine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm after washing away the doxycycline. 2-Aminopurine was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline/acetic acid (17.5 m; 200:1) to a 100 mm stock and adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. As a negative control, phosphate-buffered saline/acetic acid (200:1 adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) was added to non-treated cells. Cells were harvested after 6-h incubation at 37 °C. For the αB-crystallin-transfected cells, 2-aminopurine was added 30 min before heat shock. Cells were harvested after 6 h of recovery with 2-aminopurine at 37 °C. Cells were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity and Western blotted for Hsp expression. Reporter Assays—After transfection in 6-well plates, heat shock and recovery, cells were harvested by scraping or vigorously shaking in 200 μl of reporter lysis mix (25 mm Bicine, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20, and 0.05% Tween-80) per well. For the β-galactosidase assay, 1:100 galacton (Tropix) was added to a 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.1, with 5 mm MgCl2; 200 μl of this mixture was added to 20 μl of the cell lysate. After 30-min incubation at room temperature, 300 μl of light emission accelerator (Tropix) was added. For the luciferase assay, 100 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega) was added to 20 μl of the cell lysate immediately before measurement. Measurements were performed on a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer for 10 s. In C2 cells, luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiencies using the β-galactosidase values. In T-REx cells, β-galactosidase values were corrected for transfection efficiencies using the luciferase values of non-heat-shocked cells transfected in parallel. Constructs—The two reporter constructs (Fig. 1) were made in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). For the pHsp-Cap-Luc, the Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70 promoter was excised from the pBN247 construct (42.Torok I. Karch F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3105-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using HindIII blunt/SalI and cloned in front of the luciferase gene using SmaI and XhoI sites from the vector. For the pHsp-IRES-Luc construct, the rat FGF-2 IRES (532 bp) was excised from pRObFGF503 (43.Shimasaki S. Emoto N. Koba A. Mercado M. Shibata F. Cooksey K. Baird A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) using HindIII/NcoI and inserted between the Hsp70 promoter and the luciferase reporter gene. Rat αB-crystallin cDNA was cloned NcoI-XhoI/SalI into β-actin vector (44.Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The human αB-crystallin coding sequence (kindly provided by P. Muchowski, University of Washington, Seattle) and phosphorylation mutants, made by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), were cloned into the pIRESneo vector (Clontech). The constructs pSV Ha Hsp27 wt and phosphorylation mutants S15A, S90A, S15A/S90A, and S15E/S90E were a kind gift from J. Landry (15.Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 clone was constructed by PCR on mRNA isolated from heat-shocked HeLa cells. The primers used were at position +1 (CAAGCTAACGGCTAGCCTGAGGAGC) and at position +2390 (AAGGCCCCTAATCTACCTCCTCAATGGTGGG) of the Hsp70 mRNA. PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega) and, after sequencing, the Hsp70 coding sequence was cloned into the β-actin vector using SphI blunt/SalI for the insert and NcoI blunt/SalI for the vector. The rat βB2-crystallin expression construct was described previously (45.van den IJssel P.R. Overkamp P. Knauf U. Gaestel M. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin Protects Cap-dependent but Not Cap-independent Translation—Overall translation in C2 cells (mouse myoblasts) was severely inhibited after a 30-min heat shock at 45 °C and did not recover within 7 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2). Accumulation of the endogenous small heat shock proteins Hsp27 and αB-crystallin was first detectable after 3 h; the level of Hsp27 reached a steady state after about 4.5 h, while the level of αB-crystallin continued to increase up to 7.5 h (Fig. 2). Hence, even though general protein synthesis was inhibited, special mRNAs, such as those encoding heat shock proteins, were still translated under these conditions. To determine whether prior expression of a small heat shock protein provides a measure of translational thermotolerance under these conditions, C2 cells were transfected with an expression construct for αB-crystallin together with constructs designed to report translation efficiency after heat shock (Fig. 1). Two different constructs were used. In one, pHsp-Cap-Luc, the luciferase coding region was placed under control of the Hsp70 promoter without altering the 5′ non-coding region of the pGL3 basic vector; in the second, pHsp-IRES-Luc, the 5′ non-coding region of the FGF-2 mRNA was inserted between the Hsp70 promoter and the luciferase coding region. Both reporter gene constructs are driven by the Hsp70 promoter, and the reporter mRNA should thus accumulate only after a heat shock; to decrease background resulting from possible promoter leakage prior to the heat shock, luciferase was used as the reporter. This enzyme is heat labile and inactivated by heat shock. The only difference between the mRNAs encoded by these two reporter constructs is in the 5′ non-coding region. The pHsp-Cap-Luc mRNA has a short, non-structured 5′ non-coding region and is predicted to be initiated via the default mechanism for translation initiation, namely, cap-dependent translation initiation. The pHsp-IRES-Luc mRNA contains the FGF-2 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) known to be used during stress (46.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and should be initiated by means of a cap-independent mechanism. In support of this proposed difference in the mechanism of translation initiation, we foun"

Silver-stained protein spots corresponding to the antigen were excised from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-reflectron time of flight and nano-electrospray ionization-ion trap/mass spectrometry. Data base search identified the HB antigen as the barrier-to-autointegration factor, a cellular protein implicated in the cellular cycle that blocks autointegration and promotes intermolecular integration of retrovirus such as the Moloney murine leukemia and the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus. The physicochemical characteristics described for these proteins, their ability to bind double-stranded DNA but not single-stranded DNA, and their nuclear localization confirm that HB and barrier-to-autointegration factor are the same protein.

The presence of autoantibodies against nuclear structures is a characteristic feature of many autoimmune diseases. Although these autoantibodies have been correlated with disease activity, why they are produced and what role they play in pathologic processes remain unknown. Identification of autoantigens recognized by antinuclear antibodies is important for diagnosis and prognosis as well as for understanding the molecular and functional factors implicated in autoimmune diseases (1.Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). There are many DNA-binding proteins among the nuclear structures recognized by autoantibodies (2.Hardin J.A. Thomas J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3.Bustin M. Reisch J. Einck L. Klippel J.H.

These proteins constitute a special kind of autoantigens as they can be found free or bound to DNA. The response in autoimmune processes is thought to be directed to DNA-protein complexes, and this hypothesis is important to understand the molecular etiopathology of autoimmune diseases. DNA-binding proteins could suffer conformational changes because of their interaction with DNA. Autoantibodies directed against the epitopes affected by these conformational changes could allow us to discriminate whether the autoimmune response is directed against the DNA-protein complex or directed against the free protein (2.Hardin J.A. Thomas J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8.Losman M.J. Fasy T.M. Novick K.E. Monestier M. J.

Immunol. 1996; 33: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this analysis is complicated by the presence of epitopes whose conformation is not affected by DNA binding. We have described previously the HB autoantigen, a DNA-binding protein recognized by autoantibodies only when bound to DNA, as a paradigm of an autoimmune response restricted to the protein-DNA complex (11.Juarez C.

The specificity of this response has been maintained for several years without any spreading to epitopes present in the free protein. In this paper, using a proteomic approach, we identified the HB autoantigen as the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). 1The abbreviations used are: BAFbarrier-to-autointegration factorSLEsystemic lupus erythematosusRArheumatoid arthritisNHSnormal human seraDTTdithiothreitolWBWestern blotPBSphosphate-buffered salineMSmass spectrometryMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationreTOFreflectron time-of-flightnESI-ITnano-electrospray ionization-ion trapMS/MStandem mass spectrometryPICpreintegration complexBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: BAFbarrier-to-autointegration factorSLEsystemic lupus erythematosusRArheumatoid arthritisNHSnormal human seraDTTdithiothreitolWBWestern blotPBSphosphate-buffered salineMSmass spectrometryMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationreTOFreflectron time-of-flightnESI-ITnano-electrospray ionization-ion trapMS/MStandem mass spectrometryPICpreintegration complexBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. barrier-to-autointegration factor systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis normal human sera dithiothreitol Western blot phosphate-buffered saline mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight nano-electrospray ionization-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry preintegration complex 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. barrier-to-autointegration factor systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis normal human sera dithiothreitol Western blot phosphate-buffered saline mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight nano-electrospray ionization-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry preintegration complex 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Sera—Four human sera with antibodies to HB antigen were used in this study. These sera were selected after nylon-DNA Western blot screening of 80 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 100 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sera that contained antinuclear antibodies. 50 normal human sera (NHS) were also used as controls. Preparation of Liver Nuclear Extract—Nuclei from livers of two 6-month-old mice were obtained as described previously (12.Walker D.H. Staiti A. Mansueto S. Tringali G. Acta Trop. 1986; 43: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear fraction was washed 3 times with 250 mm sorbitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated with 6 ml of Lysis Solution (8 m urea, 4% Triton X-100, 40 mm Tris, 5 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The mixture was sonicated 3 times with a Braun 2000 sonicator for 45 s each time at 60 watts and then centrifuged at 7,800 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant (Nuclear Sample) was stored frozen at -80 °C. One-dimensional Electrophoresis—Nuclear sample in LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) was warmed at 70 °C for 10 min and applied to a pre-cast BisTris 12% gel (Invitrogen). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Nuclear sample was processed using “Two-dimensional Clean Up Kit” (APBiotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described by the manufacturer. One hundred μl/strip of Nuclear Sample were mixed with 125 μl/strip of Rehydration Buffer (8 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% bromphenol blue, 3-10 IPG Buffer, 6 mm DTT) and applied overnight to 3-10NL IPG Strips (APBiotech). Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 3500 V and 2 mA for 9 h in a Multiphor II device (APBiotech). Strips were incubated with LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing 20 mm DTT for 15 min. The equilibrated strips were loaded in a pre-cast 12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and run as described in one-dimensional electrophoresis. A MS-modified silver staining method was used as described in the literature (13.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). Western Blot—Gels were washed for 1 h with 25 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine and then transferred using Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) overnight at 80 mA to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), previously incubated for 5 h with DNA (1 absorbance unit at 260 nm). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Sera from patients or NHS were diluted 1:100 in PBS, 3% non-fat dry milk containing 0.5 m NaCl, rabbit anti-human Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) 1:300 in the same buffer. HRP Chloro Developing Reagent (Bio-Rad) was used to locate the antigen. Immunofluorescence—Commercially available Hep2 cells (INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego) were used to visualize the immunofluorescence pattern of the selected sera. Cells were first incubated with sera diluted 1:100 in PBS, washed, and incubated with fluorescence-labeled anti-human Ig (Dako). Mass Spectrometry—Protein spot was excised with a scalpel. Prior to in-gel digestion, proteins were reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. Enzymatic digestion was performed with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) following conventional procedures as described (14.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 15.Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Wilm M. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Digested samples were evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol/water (1:2 v/v), 1% acetic acid, and directly analyzed by MALDI-reTOF MS. Samples submitted to nESI-IT MS/MS analysis were de-salted using C18 ZipTips as indicated by the manufacturer. The MALDI-reTOF MS analysis of the samples was performed using a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The instrument was run in reflectron mode with an average resolution of 12,000 full-width half-maximum at m/z 1500. A 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic solution was used as MALDI matrix. Spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture (angiotensin II, substance P, bombesin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone). Samples and calibration mixtures were spotted in alternate lines of a 10 × 20 sample positions MALDI plate. Each sample was externally calibrated with the standard in the corresponding top left position in the plate. When the ions corresponding to known trypsin autolytic peptides (m/z 842.5100 and 2111.1046) were detected, a second automatic internal calibration of the spectra was performed using these ions as reference. Nanospray MS/MS experiments were performed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray interface (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The spray voltage applied was 0.85 kV, and the capillary temperature was 120 °C. For MS/MS experiments, the isolation window was 3 mass units wide, and the relative collision energy was 20-45%, depending on the charge of the precursor ion. Data Base Search—The Protein Prospector software version 4.0.1 (University of California San Francisco, Mass Spectrometry Facility) was used to identify proteins from the peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide fragment-ion data obtained from MALDI-reTOF MS and nESI-IT MS/MS analyses, respectively. Swiss-Prot (European Bioinformatics Institute, Heidelberg, Germany) and GenBank™ (National Center for Biotechnology Information) data bases were used for the search. Screening of Anti-HB Autoantibodies by One-dimensional Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Antinuclear positive sera from 100 patients with RA, 80 patients with SLE, and 50 NHS were analyzed by WB to detect the presence of antibodies against the HB autoantigen. Fig. 1 shows the 4 sera in which we found the anti-HB specificity. One corresponds to a patient with RA as described previously (11.Juarez C. Vila J.L. Agusti M. Gelpi C. Amengual M.J. Cardona S. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the other three sera correspond to patients with SLE. All sera recognized a 10-kDa protein only in the strips previously incubated with DNA. Reactivity of one of the SLE sera (Fig. 1, strip 5), which shows the lower binding for the 10-kDa band in one-dimensional experiments, was further confirmed by two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments (data not shown). Immunofluorescence Pattern of HB Serum—The immunofluorescence pattern of HB serum is shown in Fig. 2. Serum recognizes a nuclear antigen that gives a weak homogeneous pattern with a strong peripheral staining. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Liver nuclear extracts were fractionated by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two gels were run in parallel; one was silver-stained, and the other was transferred to a DNA-Nylon membrane and antigen detected using the HB serum. Fig. 3 shows that patient's serum recognized one protein (Fig. 3B) that could be clearly assigned to one of the silver-stained spots (Fig. 3A). This spot was excised and processed for mass spectrometry analysis. Protein Identification—No matches were obtained from the MALDI-reTOF spectrum, probably because the number of generated peptides from such a small protein was not high enough to produce a clear match. However, the mass signals detected by MALDI-reTOF MS could be used for the blind selection of nESI precursor ions submitted to MS/MS fragmentation as shown in Fig. 4 for the doubly charged positive ion at m/z 675.4. This peptide could be partially sequenced to give the VVLGQFLVLK peptide tag. This tag was identified with the AYVVLGQFLVLK tryptic peptide of the BAF protein by data base search. Two other peptide signals were fragmented both leading to the identification of the same BAF protein (Fig. 5). The three identified peptides account for 48.3% of the mouse BAF sequence annotated in the Swiss Protein Database.Fig. 5A, sequence, molecular weight, and position in the mouse BAF sequence of peptides detected by MALDI-reTOF and identified by nESIITMS/MS. aa, amino acids. B, peptides belonging to BAF and identified by MS/MS are underlined in the full protein sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Theoretical molecular mass and isoelectric points of BAF (10 kDa; pI 5.8) are coincident with those calculated from the two-dimensional electrophoresis gel (Fig. 3). In the present study the HB autoantigen was identified as the protein BAF by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis and nESI-IT MS/MS. The similarity in the characteristics described previously for the HB antigen (11.Juarez C. Vila J.L. Agusti M. Gelpi C. Amengual M.J. Cardona S. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and the BAF protein further support this conclusion. Both proteins (a) are able to bind double strand DNA, without specific sequence requirements (16.Umland T.C. Wei S.Q. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9130-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17.Zheng R. Ghirlando R. Lee M.S. Mizuuchi K. Krause M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8997-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but not single strand DNA or RNA (18.Harris D. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39671-39677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); (b) have a perinuclear, nuclear, and chromosomal localization (19.Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (c) undergo conformational changes after DNA binding (20.Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); and (d) are dimers in solution (21.Cai M. Huang Y. Zheng R. Wei S.Q. Ghirlando R. Lee M.S. Craigie R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The autoantibody specificity has been found in another three sera from lupus erythematosus patients. Combination of one-dimensional electrophoresis and WB on DNA-Nylon paper was chosen as the screening technique. The homogeneous nuclear and perinuclear staining observed with the HB serum by immunofluorescence is not specific for the HB antigen; moreover, other antinuclear specificities present in other sera encumber the identification of the HB staining. Two of the SLE sera with HB specificity had also Ro/La and ribonucleoprotein specificities, respectively. The third sera also presented other additional specificities that could not be identified. The reactivity of serum from patient in strip 5 (Fig. 1), showing the lowest reactivity against BAF protein, was further confirmed in several independent one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments (data not shown). Recognition strength depends on autoantibody level and affinity for the spectrum of epitopes that each serum is able to recognize. We do not yet know whether the antibodies in this serum bind epitopes also recognized by the other sera but with a lower level or affinity, or whether they are directed against other epitopes, which are not well recognized in the experimental conditions used. The four sera recognized BAF bound to DNA, whereas none of the RA sera or the 80 SLE sera tested recognized the 10-kDa band on the strip without DNA. Therefore, when an autoimmune response occurs against BAF, this is directed against the complex DNA-BAF and not against free BAF. This event could also occur in the case of other DNA-binding proteins recognized by autoantibodies. In fact, autoantibodies against conformational epitopes present exclusively in proteins bound to DNA have also been described by other authors (8.Losman M.J. Fasy T.M. Novick K.E. Monestier M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1561-1569PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Rekvig O.P. Hannestad K. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1720-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10.Monestier M. Novick K.E. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in these cases, polyclonal autoimmune responses are also directed against epitopes present both in free and bound protein; therefore, the absolute restriction of response to DNA-protein complex could not be demonstrated. In the present case, the restriction of the response to DNA complex is clearly demonstrated, making this autoantigen unique for these studies. The reason for this could be because of the small size of this antigen (89 amino acids) and the induction of conformational changes after interaction with DNA. The crystal structure of the BAF dimer has been solved (16.Umland T.C. Wei S.Q. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9130-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). but the structure of the BAF-DNA complex has not. Nevertheless, evidence for conformational changes in BAF have been described (20.Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conformational changes have also been reported for other DNA-binding proteins (22.Tan S. Richmond T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 367-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23.Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and for the DNA-binding domain of some transcription factors (24.Patel L. Abate C. Curran T. Nature. 1990; 347: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25.Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Because of the small size of BAF, conformational changes induced by DNA binding would probably affect almost the whole protein, in a similar way to the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors described above. Although we cannot formally discard the possibility that autoantibodies recognize changes in DNA conformation induced by BAF or epitopes constituted by protein and DNA residues, we favor the hypothesis that autoantibodies recognize the protein in the BAF-DNA complex. This is because DNase treatments of already formed immunocomplexes do not disturb the interaction BAF-antibody in immunoprecipitation studies (data not shown). BAF interacts with various components of the inner nuclear membrane, including lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin (19.Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J.

It also plays a key role in integration of retroviral cDNA for its ability in binding to large nucleoprotein complexes, named preintegration complexes (PICs), derived from cores of infecting virions (16.Umland T.C. Wei S.Q. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9130-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18.Harris D. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39671-39677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28.Lin C.W. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5030-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29.Suzuki Y. Craigie R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12376-12380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30.Chen H. Engelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15270-15274Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Retroviruses have repeatedly been suggested as possible agents that trigger animal and human autoimmune diseases by their ability to alter cell responses or to break tolerance to some autoantigens. Tolerance to self-proteins can be broken by molecular mimicry (31.Levin M.C. Lee S.M. Kalume F. Morcos Y. Dohan Jr., F.C. Hasty K.A. Callaway J.C. Zunt J. Desiderio D. Stuart J.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but also by generating novel structures such as PICs, where host proteins like BAF are complexed with viral proteins and cDNA. Therefore, the immune response will be initially directed against viral proteins in PICs and spread to BAF present in these particles. The same process could occur with Ku-80, another PICs component (28.Lin C.W. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5030-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that is recognized by autoantibodies in myositis patients. Because of the significant changes that seem to be induced in the BAF-DNA complex, studies are ongoing in our laboratory to analyze whether sera from patients are able to discriminate the BAF-DNA complex in PICs from the BAF-host DNA complex. If autoantibodies were able to perform this discrimination, they would be a powerful tool not only to trace structures responsible for breaking the tolerance to the BAF-DNA complex but also to give important clues for designing therapeutic drugs able to block the integration of human immunodeficiency virus type and other retrovirus in host DNA without interfering with their cellular functions.

https://openalex.org/W2044649813,"A highly conserved amino acid sequence 442GDASE446 in the ATP binding pocket of rat Na/K-ATPase was mutated, and the resulting proteins, G442A, G442P, D443A, S445A, and E446A, were expressed in HeLa cells to investigate the effect of individual ligands on Na/K-ATPase. The apparent Km for the high and low affinity ATP effects was estimated by ATP concentration dependence for the formation of the Na-dependent phosphoenzyme (Kmh) and Na/K-ATPase activity (Kml). The apparent Km for p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) for K-dependent-pNPPase (KmP) and its inhibition by ATP (Ki,0.5) and the apparent Km for Mg2+, Na+, K+, and vanadate in Na/K-ATPase were also estimated. For all the mutants, the value for ATP was ∼2–10-fold larger than that of the wild type. While the turnover number for Na/K-ATPase activity were unaffected or reduced by 20∼50% in mutants G442(A/P) and D443A. Although both affinities for ATP effects were reduced as a result of the mutations, the ratio, KmlKmh, for each mutant was 1.3∼3.7, indicating that these mutations had a greater impact on the low affinity ATP effect than on the high affinity effect. Each KmP value with the turnover number suggests that these mutations favor the binding of pNPP over that of ATP. These data and others indicate that the sequence 442GDASE446 in the ATP binding pocket is an important motif that it is involved in both the high and low affinity ATP effects rather than in free Mg2+, Na+, and K+ effects.

In the case of P-type ATPase, at least two different ATP binding sites are present, namely, the E1 and E2 sites. The E1 form has a high affinity ATP binding site (Km is sub-μm) in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ and is a precursor of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P). The E2 form has a low-affinity ATP binding site (Km is sub-mm), causing a high Vmax and plays a regulatory role in accelerating the partial reactions (1.Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev.

Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) but the role of this residue in ATP binding has not been clarified. No GEATE sequence is present in the corresponding region of mammalian Na/K-ATPase and H/K-ATPase (Fig. 1A) but the sequence, GxAyE, is present, where x and y denote, respectively, Glu and Thr in Ca-ATPase (GEATE) and Asp and Ser in both Na/K- and H/K-ATPase. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Ala is replaced with Pro and Asp is replaced with Asn. In fungal Blastoclodiella emersonii, Ser is replaced with Thr. These facts suggest that the amino acid residues in the GDASE sequence are an important motif for the interaction between enzyme and an ATP molecule or in the formation of the ATP binding pocket with residues such as Phe-475, Lys-480, Lys-501, and Arg-544 in Na/K- and H/K-ATPase. To investigate this point further, five mutants carrying a single amino acid substitution in the GDASE motif were constructed. The high or low affinity ATP effect on ATP-dependent EP formation in the presence of Mg2+ + Na+ (Kmh), or ATP-dependent Na/K-ATPase activity in the presence of Mg2+ + Na+ + K+ (Kml) and the ATP-induced inhibition of K-dependent pNPPase in the presence of Mg2+ + K+ (Ki,0.5) with an apparent affinity for pNPP (KmP), were measured, after the expression of these enzymes in HeLa cells. Apparent affinity for free Mg2+, Na+, K+, and vanadate were also estimated and compared with the changes in ATP effects. In all mutants, the single amino acid substitution induced larger affinity decreases to different extents in high and low affinities for ATP (Kmh and Kml) compared with the changes for other ligands. These results and others indicate that the GDASE motif and residues such as Phe-475, Lys-480, Lys-501, and Arg-544 are involved in the formation of the ATP binding pocket, and that each participates differently with respect to the high and low affinity ATP effects rather than affecting the binding affinities of other ligands. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids pGEM-NaK and pCDL-NaK containing the entire coding region of rat Na/K-ATPase α1 cDNA have been described previously (26.Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the megaprimer PCR method (27.Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffn H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar) in conjunction with the following sense oligonucleotide primers: for G442A/P, 5′-GCA GTA GCG NCA GAT GCT TCC-3′; for S445A, 5′-GGA GAT GCT GCC GAG TCG-3′; for E446A, 5′-GCT TCC GCG TCG GCG CTC-3′ and antisense primer for D443A, 5′-GGA AGC AGC TCC CGC TAC TGC-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment, including the region encoding amino acid residues 414–515 (between AatII and BamHI sites), was subcloned back into the wild-type rat Na/K-ATPase α1-subunit cDNA in the pGEM vector. The mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing (28.Sanger F Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The entire coding region of the mutated rat α1 cDNA was transferred to the expression vector pCDL as described previously (26.Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa Cells Expressing Rat β-Subunit with Rat Na/K-ATPase α1-Subunit—HeLa cells expressing the rat β-subunit (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were cultured in a 35 mm-dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA containing a wild-type or mutant Na/K-ATPase α1-subunit cDNA with the GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems), and subjected to selection in 10 μm ouabain. Ouabain-resistant cells were then expanded into stable cell lines. Preparation of SDS-purified Membrane Vesicles—Crude plasma membranes were prepared from HeLa cells (26.Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or pig kidney microsomes essentially as described previously (29.Hayashi Y. Kimimura M. Homareda H. Matsui H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 482: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crude plasma membranes at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated with 0.15 mg/ml of SDS in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto stepwise sucrose density gradients consisting of 10 and 40% sucrose layers, and centrifuged at 350,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The fractions at the 10:40% interface were collected and pooled. The pooled sample was diluted with 3 volumes of the sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 350,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in the sucrose buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the protein concentration was measured using bovine serum albumin as a standard as described in Ref. 30.Bradford M Anal. Bochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar. Sodium-dependent EP Formation from ATP—SDS-treated membrane vesicles (4 μg) were incubated at 0 °C for 10 s in 40 μl of 16 mm NaCl, 0.43 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.2), and 5 nm to 5 μm of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of an ice-cold solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 10 mm inorganic phosphate. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with an ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution by centrifugation. The resulting precipitates were washed with ice-cold water by centrifugation. The precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer containing a trace amount of a bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at pH 6.0 (31.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gels, the amount of 32P incorporated into the Na/K-ATPase α-subunit was detected and quantitated by means of a BAS 2000 system (Fuji). Oligomycin was not included during the phosphorylation experiments, because it did not result in an increase in the amount of EP. In order to correct for losses due to the hydrolysis of EP during the above procedure, the SDS-treated Na/K-ATPase preparation from pig kidney (4 μg) was incubated under the same conditions as described above. The final precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer in the absence of bromphenol blue, and half of an aliquot was used to estimate the amount of EP formed by liquid scintillation counting and the other aliquot (0.75 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a BAS 2000 system. The data were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares regression (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software Inc.) using the Michaelis-Menten equation: EP (pmol/mg) = EPmax [ATP]/(Kmh + [ATP]) in which EPmax is the maximum amount of EP formed and Kmh is the concentration of ATP required for the half-maximal formation of EP. Na/K-ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of SDS-treated membrane vesicles from HeLa cells was measured in duplicate at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction medium containing 0.5∼2 μg of enzyme protein, 62.5 μm to 5 mm of ATP, 40 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 in the presence of 5 μm or 5 mm ouabain. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 12% SDS. Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically by measurement of the inorganic phosphate with ammonium molybdate complexes (32.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Rat Na/K-ATPase activity was determined as the difference between the activity in the presence of 5 μm and the activity in the presence of 5 mm ouabain: the former and the latter were, respectively, 90–80% and 30–20% of the activity in the absence of ouabain. The difference in the activity was divided by the amount of EPmax, estimated as described above, and expressed as s–1. All determinations were performed in duplicate. The data were analyzed in essentially the same manner as described above, where EP and EPmax were, respectively, replaced with ATPase activity (s–1) and Vmax (maximum turnover number). To investigate the dependence of Na/K-ATPase activity on Mg2+, ATP hydrolysis was measured in the medium containing 40 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 3.3 μm∼8.93 mm MgCl2 and 0.2∼4 mm ATP. The concentrations of free Mg2+ and MgATP complex in the medium were calculated using the stability constants described in Ref. 33.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar. To investigate the effect of Na+ and K+ on Na/K-ATPase activity, 40 mm Na+ and 16 mm K+ was replaced with 0–40 mm Na+ and 0–16 mm K+, respectively. The effect of vanadate was measured after the addition of 0–25 μm sodium vanadate. Potassium-dependent pNPPase Activity—pNPPase activity of the SDS-treated membrane vesicles was measured in duplicate in the presence or absence of 16 mm KCl at 37 °C for 30 min containing 1∼2 μg of enzyme protein, 0.5 mm to 10 mm of pNPP, 6 mm MgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA and 20 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.2). The K-pNPPase activity was calculated as the difference between the activities with and without KCl. The K-pNPPase activity was also measured in the presence of 5 mmpNPP and 62.5 μm∼5mm of ATP to estimate the Ki,0.5 for ATP by nonlinear least-squares regression. Construction of Mutants of Na/K-ATPase Carrying a Single Amino Acid Substitution in the GDASE Motif—Homology modeling of Na/K-ATPase based on the three-dimensional structure of Ca-ATPase (14.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) was carried out with the SWISS-MODEL software program (www.expasy.ch/spabv/) (Fig. 1, B and C). Asp-443, Ser-445, and Glu-446 contain oxygen atoms in the side chain and these residues could be located at a similar position to that of Ca-ATPase in the model. The 442GDASE is conserved in the P2C-type ATPase family (Fig. 1A). The oxygen atom and/or negative charge in these amino acid side chains may be important in the binding of ATP or the formation of the ATP binding pocket. To investigate this point, mutants carrying a single amino acid substitution of these residues (G442A/P, D443A, S445A, and E446A) were constructed. Each of the mutant Na/K-ATPase molecules was expressed in HeLa cells expressing a rat Na/K-ATPase β-subunit as described in a previous study (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All the resulting HeLa cell lines were viable in the presence of 10 μm ouabain. These results suggest that these mutant enzymes had the ability to transport Na+ and K+ during ATP hydrolysis and thus support cell growth. Effect of Each Mutation on the Apparent High Affinity ATP Effect Registered by Mg2+, Na+, and ATP-dependent EP Formation—To estimate the apparent affinity for the high affinity ATP effect, the ATP-dependent EP formation of a SDS-treated enzyme preparation under steady state conditions was measured in the presence of 0.43 mm Mg2+, 16 mm NaCl, and 0.005–5 μm of ATP (Fig. 2). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, which gave values for the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme (EPmax) and the half-maximal concentration of ATP (Kmh) of 0.02 μm in the wild type, as reported previously (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The values of Kmh in the G442A, G442P, D443A, S445A, and E446A increased to 3.0-, 3.2-, 3.6-, 1.8-, and 5.1-fold, respectively (Table I, a).Table IComparison of the relative affinity and activity of mutants with those of the wild type enzymeWild typeRelative valuesG442AG442PD443AS445AE446AaKmh (21 nm)3.03.23.61.85.1bKml (0.6 mm)4.04.25.76.510cKi, 0.5 (0.37 mm)4.93.17.03.28.5dKmP (2.5 mm)0.80.70.40.80.7eVmax/EPmax (235 s-1)0.70.50.81.01.0fVmaxP/EPmax (107 s-1)0.81.10.91.11.0gK0.5V (1.3 mm)0.50.50.60.60.4hnV (0.61)1.21.10.91.41.3iKmMg (26 μm)0.91.51.30.80.6jK0.5Na (0.8 mm, EP formation)1.31.51.41.42.0knNa (0.9, EP formation)1.11.01.11.00.9lK0.5Na (4.1 mm, Na/K-ATPase)1.22.51.71.42.1mnNa (1.43, Na/K-ATPase)1.01.11.00.90.9nK0.5K (0.53 mm, Na/K-ATPase)0.80.51.30.90.8onK (1.39, Na/K-ATPase)1.01.01.00.80.9pK0.5K (1.5 mm, K-pNPPase)0.90.90.90.90.8qnK (1.8, K-pNPPase)1.31.31.21.11.2 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the apparent decrease in the affinity for ATP reflects a change in the apparent dissociation constant for ATP from EP or an increase in the rate constant for EP breakdown, the rate of EP formation and breakdown were followed manually. The enzyme in the presence of 0.43 mm MgCl2 and 16 mm NaCl was phosphorylated by the addition of 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP and the reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The time course of the phosphorylation of the wild type and E446A showed that the phosphorylation was complete within 1 s. Thus, the t½ would be <0.5 s, indicating a rate constant for EP formation of >1.4 s–1 (= ln(2/0.5)). To follow the rate of EP breakdown, the enzyme was phosphorylated for 10 s, and the amount of EP remaining at 10 s after the addition of 10 mm CDTA was determined. The amounts of EP remaining was 50–65% of the EP formed in the presence of 2 μm ATP for all mutants, and the amount for the wild type was 48 ± 8% (average ± S.D., n = 4). If the breakdown of EP follows first order kinetics, the rate constant for EP breakdown (ln 2/t½) would be 0.05 ∼ 0.06 s–1. These data suggest that the rate constant of EP formation in the presence of 2 μm ATP was at least 20-fold larger than that for its breakdown. Effect of Substitution on the Apparent Low Affinity ATP Effect, as Evidenced by Na/K-ATPase Activity and ATP-induced Inhibition of K-pNPPase Activity—To estimate the apparent affinity for the low affinity ATP effect, Na/K-ATPase activities of the rat wild type and mutants were measured with increasing ATP concentrations up to 5 mm in the presence of 40 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and either 5 μm or 5 mm ouabain as already reported (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The difference between these activities was assumed to be the Na/K-ATPase activity (v) of the expressed enzyme and the turnover number was estimated by dividing v by EPmax, as obtained in the previous section. These data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, which gave the values for the half-maximal concentration of ATP (Kml) and the maximum turnover (Vmax/EPmax, s–1) as shown in Fig. 3. The Kml of the wild type was ∼0.6 mm (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The value of G442A, G442P, D443A, S445A, and E446A increased to 4∼10-fold (Table I, b). The value of Vmax/EPmax of the wild type was nearly the same as that of S445A and E446A while that of D443A, G442A, and G442P reduced, respectively, to 80, 70, and 50% (Table I, e). It is also possible to estimate the low affinity ATP effect by measuring the ATP-induced inhibition (Ki,0.5) of K-pNPPase in the absence of Na+ (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34.Taniguchi K. Suzuku K. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10159-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as shown (Fig. 4). The Ki,0.5 of the wild type gave a mean value 0.37 mm, and the values for each mutant increased by 3∼9-fold (Table I, c). Effect of the Substitution on the Apparent Affinity for Vanadate Registered by Na/K-ATPase Activity—Previous data suggested that the maximum amount of active site of pig kidney Na/K-ATPase was 1 mol/mol of α-chain (13.Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37.Yokoyama T. Kaya S. Abe K. Taniguchi K. Kato T. Yazawa M. Hayashi Y. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31792-31796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in which 0.5 mol of the active site is phosphorylated followed by high affinity ATP binding and the other 0.5 mol bound ATP with a lower affinity (37.Yokoyama T.

The data in Figs. 2 and 3 show that the mutations induced larger affinity decreases in the low affinity effect than in the high affinity effect (see also Table II, a). Given these findings, it would be of interest to investigate whether the mutation affects the sensitivity of Na/K-ATPase to vanadate, an analogue of Pi that binds to the E2 form of Na/K-ATPase (35.Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36.Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Fig. 5A shows the effect of vanadate on the Na/K-ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 1–5mm ATP, which was fitted using the Hill equation. The value of nV and K0.5V, respectively, decreased and increased with increasing concentrations of ATP to 0.61 and 1.33 μm in the presence of 5 mm ATP. The value of nV increased to around 0.8 in S445A and E446A and the K0.5V of all mutant enzymes decreased to around half of that of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 5 mm ATP (Fig. 5B and Table I, g and h). These apparent changes in the mutant enzymes may be due to the reduced affinity for ATP effects (Figs. 2 and 3), because both of these values were e"

In this study, we showed that although intravenous administration in mice with either Ran cDNA using an identical adenovirus (Ad) vector resulted in no significant difference in vector tissue distribution, intraperitoneal administration resulted in effective vector transduction into peritoneal macrophages, coupled with a striking difference in vector tissue distribution in 2 h or less. We further demonstrated the presence of prepackaged RNA in virions of Ad vectors, in cells actively producing Ad virus particles, and in cells very shortly after Ad infection. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the presence of prepackaged RNA and estimated the copy number to be one per viral genome. The prepackaged viral mRNA could be used for translation into proteins, as shown by experiments in which the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D was used. Hence, translation of Ran proteins from prepackaged viral mRNA immediately after virus uncoating in the cytoplasm is one mechanism that would account for an early difference in Ad-vector tissue distribution after efficient gene transfer into macrophages.

Adenoviruses (Ad) 1The abbreviations used are: AdadenovirusAPCantigen-presenting cellHAhemagglutininRTreverse transcriptionGFPgreen fluorescent protein. are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses with a linear genome of 30–40 kb. There are about 50 serotypes of Adenoviridae, and Ad2 and Ad5 within group C viruses are the most common types used in gene therapy applications (1.Cullen B.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 697-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2.St George J.A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this context, recombinant replication-deficient Ad vectors have distinct advantages including the ability to package large therapeutic genes of interest, ease of handling, high titer production, and broad cell tropism. The major disadvantage has been the ability of Ad vectors to trigger immune toxicities characterized by both innate and adaptive immunity in the host (1.Cullen B.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 697-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2.St George J.A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4.Jooss K.

Innate immunity involves neutrophils and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as tissue macrophages and dendritic cells. When activated, they produce a number of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, which then lead to the production of a whole host of soluble factors, including complement, antimicrobial agents, and other cytokines. Professional APCs have an active phagocytic activity and are efficient in capturing foreign microbes and processing antigens. This is triggered by their initial interaction with pathogens (in this case, Ad antigens) via pathogen-associated molecular patterns. After activation of phagocytosis and antigen processing, the antigen-loaded APCs begin to express major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and will then migrate to draining lymph nodes, directed by chemokines. Adaptive immunity involves activation of T cells, which requires two signals (4.Jooss K. Chirmule N. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The first signal begins when antigen-loaded APCs encounter T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. This results in further enhanced interactions between T cells and the activated APCs, via co-stimulatory molecules, which in turn lead to the delivery of a second signal. Activation of cell-mediated immunity via these T cells results in the elimination of Ad virus and virus-transduced cells in the host. Various improvements have been made regarding engineering of Ad vectors for gene therapy. These efforts successfully minimized host adaptive immune response to the vectors and have improved the efficacy of gene transfer and duration of therapeutic gene expression. Host innate immune response to Ad vectors, however, remains a significant concern. The difficulty lies upon the fact that host innate immune response is induced shortly after adsorption and entry of the recombinant Ad virus; the response is therefore directed toward viral capsid proteins and is independent of Ad vector engineering technology. Adsorption of Ad is rapid and can occur in less than 1 min (6.Zsengeller Z. Otake K. Hossain S.A. Berclaz P.Y. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9655-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This is achieved via binding of Ad fiber knob protein to a high-affinity Coxsackie virus-Adenovirus receptor on target cells. After this high-affinity binding, viral internalization begins with a low-affinity interaction between an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif on the Ad penton base capsid protein and αV integrins on APCs, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis (1.Cullen B.R.

Despite Ad viral transgene expression, thought to begin 2 h after virus internalization (described above), infected macrophages become activated and produce mRNAs of proinflammatory cytokines as early as 30 min after infection (6.Zsengeller Z.

This rapid innate immune response from infected host cells has been commonly observed (5.Muruve D.A. Barnes M.J. Stillman I.E. Libermann T.A. Hum.

It is a major barrier in adenoviral gene therapy even though important technological advances in vectors development have been successful in eliminating toxicity caused by adaptive immunity directed against Ad vectors or vector-transduced cells. We have previously shown that Ran GTPase is involved in host innate immune responses. Adenoviral transfer and expression of RanC/d allele leads to down-modulation of proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo and protection against septic shock in mice (17.Wong P.M.C.

In this report, we present data to demonstrate a difference in tissue distribution between RanC/d- and RanT/n-transduced cells in 2 h or less after infection. These data suggest that a difference in biological functions is already present very early on after viral infection between the two vector-transduced cells, as our previous publications suggested. We further showed that prepackaged mRNA are present in virions of Ad vectors, in Ad-virus producing cells, and in cells immediately transduced with Ad vectors. Release of prepackaged Ad mRNAs into cytoplasm, followed by translation of mRNA of viral transgenes after endosome disruption, would explain the rapid biological functions of Ad transgene even without transcriptional activation of viral transgenes. Animals and Adenovirus Vectors—We purchased CD-1 outbred mice from Charles River Laboratories, and C3H/HeOuJ, C3H/HeJ, and Balb/c inbred mice from Jackson Laboratories. Typically, we used mice that were 5–8 weeks old after a ≥2-week acclimatization. All adenovirus stocks were prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (17.Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Yuan Q. Fan P. Sultzer B.M. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11543-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18.Wong P.M.C. Yuan Q. Chen H. Sultzer B.N. Chung S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33129-33138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The stocks were purified by CsCl banding twice, dialyzed, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C until use. Mice were inoculated either intraperitoneally or intravenously with 5.0 × 1010 plaque-forming units/mouse of either Ad-Ran C/d or Ad-Ran T/n virus. At 2 h after infection, the animals were sacrificed; peritoneal cells, livers, lungs, hearts, spleens, peripheral blood, and kidneys were harvested from each animal. Tissue DNA was extracted using DNAzol reagents (Invitrogen) and PCR analysis was conducted using primers homologous to Ran (see PCR section below). PCR or RT-PCR—PCR or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used for the detection of viral vectors or their messages, respectively, in both animal tissues and cell lines. The following is a summary of the reaction conditions used: for adenovirus carrying the green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP), the PCR was conducted using primers homologous to regions on the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene that would result in a 265-bp product. The sequence for the sense primer, EGFP1, is 5′-ACGACGGCAACTACAAGACC-3′ and the antisense primer, EGFP2, is 5′-TCTATATCATGGCCGACAAGC-3′. The PCR reaction conditions for 30 cycles were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; annealing at 60 °C for 30 s; and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. For Ad-Ran C/d or Ad-Ran T/n, the PCR was conducted using primers homologous to regions on the 1.1-kb Ran C/d or Ran T/n insert that includes a 39-bp HA tagging sequence resulting in a 158-bp viral band distinguishable from the 119-bp endogenous Ran band. The sequence for the sense primer was 5′-TTGTTGCCAT GCCTGCTCTTG-3′, and that for the antisense primer was 5′-GGTCATCATCCTCATCTGGGA-3′. The PCR reaction was carried out as above. The PCR products were then analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, yielding two products: the first, a 119-bp band, represented the endogenous Ran; the second product, a 158-bp band, represented the exogenous or viral Ran. For RT-PCR, approximately 2.5 × 1012 Ad-GFP virus particles were lysed in 500 μl of buffer containing 0.001 m EDTA, 0.01 m Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, and 0.1% SDS at 57 °C for 10 min with shaking (21.Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenol/chloroform extraction, pH 4.5, was conducted on the particle lysate followed by ethanol precipitation. The sample was then re-suspended in 200 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. Two 20-μl aliquots of the sample were removed and digested with DNase (Roche) at a concentration of 4 units/μl at 37 °C for 90 min in a final volume of 40 μl. Reverse transcription was then conducted on 20 μl of the sample, as described by the manufacturer, using SuperScript II reversed transcription kit (Invitrogen). PCR was conducted as described above, and two fifths of the PCR product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. In Vivo Infection of Human 5637 Cells—Human 5637 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated in a 24-well tissue culture plate at 2.5 × 105 cells/well and incubated at 37°C overnight. The cells were then infected with Ad-GFP with an m.o.i. of 5 × 105. Infected cells were harvested at various time points (5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min) by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0; this was followed by a very brief acid wash (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 3.0), and total RNA were extracted. The RNA was then treated with DNase (Promega) at 37°C for 90 min to remove DNA. RT-PCR was then conducted as described above. In Vivo Labeling of Viral RNA—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were allowed to grow to 80% confluence in a 175-cm2 flask (Corning) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The flasks were then infected with 2 ml of diluted Ad-GFP virus (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum) at an m.o.i. of 200 for 1 h at 37°C with gentle shaking. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal calf serum) was then added to a final volume of 10 ml, and the flasks were allowed to incubate at 37°C. At 6, 12, 18, 24, and 45 h after infection, [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the 175-cm2 flasks at a concentration of 20 μCi/ml and allowed to incubate for 6 h at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by three rounds of freezing/thawing cycles. Next, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and then purified by banding the virus 2× in a CsCl gradient (0.5 g/ml). The purified virus was then desalted using a Centricom filter column (Millipore) and then treated with RNase (5 units/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min. A 10-μl fraction of the particle suspension was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and then counted using a scintillation counter. Actinomycin D Treatment—293 cells were seeded 2 days before infection in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. On the day of infection, one dish was trypsinized for cell counts. Cells were mock-infected or infected with Ad-LacZ virus at an m.o.i. of 103 in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma). The amount of actinomycin D used was shown to effectively suppress cellular transcription under similar infection protocol (22.Bresnahan W.B. Shenk T. Science. 2000; 288: 2373-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Infection was carried out in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum per 100-mm dish for 3 or 6 h with continuous shaking to achieve most efficient infection (21.Mittereder N. March K.L. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of infection, cells were washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the dish and lysed immediately in a small volume of reporter lysis buffer (β-galactosidase enzyme assay system; Promega) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity following the manfacturer's protocol. Standard curve was generated using included β-galactosidase standard, and activity in unknown samples was analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). One unit is defined as the amount of β-galactosidase activity able to hydrolyze 1 μmo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to o-nitrophenol and galactose in 1 min at pH 7.5 at 37 °C. Quantitation of Prepackaged Viral RNA by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 2.5 × 1012 plaque-forming units (Ad-RanT/n-HA). Lysate was collected after lysis of virions in Tris-EDTA buffer (0.001 m EDTA and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% SDS, at 55 °C for 10 min with shaking, phenol/chloroform, pH 4.5, was extracted twice, and EtOH was precipitated. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of RNase-free water. To eliminate genomic or viral DNA contamination, half of the RNA sample was treated with 500 units of RNase-free DNase (Roche) for 90 min at 37 °C to determine the extent of DNA contamination in each RNA sample, whereas the other half was left untreated. To prepare cDNA, 10 μl from each RNA sample were used in RT reaction with Ran-specific reverse primer (Fig. 5A) in a final volume of 20 μl. After 10-fold dilutions of each cDNA product, 10-μl RT products were used for real-time PCR, using an Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and TaqMan probes (Fig. 3A) were designed with Primer Expression Software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) and purchased from Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems, respectively. Real-time PCR was conducted with triplicates, each in a 25-μl TaqMan Universal PCR master Mix (Applied Biosystems), together with 200 nm primers and 200 nm probe. After denaturing at 94 °C for 5 min, the reaction was run for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 20 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s, except at the last cycle, where final extension was set at 72 °C for 10 min. As a negative control, another RNA sample was directly and simultaneously subjected for PCR reaction. Serial 10-fold dilutions of known amount of plasmid DNA (pCD-RanT/n-HA) were used as positive control to generate the standard curve. Tissue Distribution of Viral DNA Affected by the Route of Inoculation—We showed previously that expression of RanC/d in macrophages in vitro resulted in reduced production of tumor necrosis factor-α and that intraperitoneal inoculation of our Ad vector carrying RanC/d protected mice from septic shock (17.Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Yuan Q. Fan P. Sultzer B.M. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11543-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20.Yuan Q. Zhao F. Chung S.W. Fan P.

Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because the peritoneal cavity contains mainly resident macrophages, we sought to determine whether intraperitoneal administration would lead to effective down-modulation of host innate immune response. We therefore compared the result of different routes of inoculation. For each mouse, we inoculated either Ad-RanT/n or Ad-RanC/d at a dose of 5 × 1010 plaque-forming units, administered intravenously or intraperitoneally. We analyzed DNA extracted from various organs of each mouse using a competitive quantitative PCR analysis in which the intensity of the amplified endogenous Ran DNA in each sample was compared with that of the amplified viral Ran DNA in the same sample (18.Wong P.M.C. Yuan Q. Chen H. Sultzer B.N. Chung S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33129-33138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By this design, equal intensity between the amplified endogenous Ran DNA fragment (Fig. 1, lower band, 119 bp) and the viral Ran DNA fragment (Fig. 1, upper band, 158 bp due to insertion of a 39-bp HA epitope fragment) would suggest that the average copy number of viral DNA per cell is one copy per haploid genome if the cells analyzed were all transduced with Ad vector. Similarly, higher intensity of viral Ran DNA compared with endogenous Ran DNA in a particular sample would suggest that the copy number of Ad viral DNA copy number is more than one copy per haploid genome. For intravenous administration, both Ad vectors resulted in similar amounts of amplifiable viral Ran DNA from multiple organ samples (i.e. bone marrows, livers, peripheral blood, and spleens), with highest intensity in livers and spleens (not shown). Whereas the signals in livers and spleens were consistently intense, those in peritoneal macrophages were poor. These data are similar to observations from human clinical trials in which Ad vectors were administered intravenously and multiple and nonspecific organs were transduced by a number of genetic vectors with similar observations (5.Muruve D.A. Barnes M.J. Stillman I.E. Libermann T.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 965-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6.Zsengeller Z. Otake K. Hossain S.A. Berclaz P.Y. Trapnell B.C. J.

Metzger M.E. Donahue R.E. Morgan R.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 3968-3975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, intraperitoneal administration of adenovirus vectors yielded very interesting results. A predominant viral band in peritoneal macrophages was obvious for both vectors (Fig. 1). Transduction of peritoneal cells seemed to be highly efficient, because the amplified endogenous Ran fragment was either weak or absent, whereas the amplified viral Ran DNA was very intense. Giemsa-Wright staining of cytoprep smears indicated that 80–90% of the peritoneal cells are monocytes/macrophages. In addition, the intensity of the amplified viral Ran DNA in other organ samples seemed very different between RanT/n and RanC/d. Intense viral bands were observed in livers and spleens of RanT/n-injected mice, whereas a faint band was seen in livers but not spleens of RanC/d-infected mice. The differences observed between different routes of Ad vector administration and the effective vector transduction of peritoneal macrophages and different tissue distribution of the two vectors via the intraperitoneal route strongly suggest that the differential band-intensity between T/n-mice and C/d-mice after intraperitoneal inoculation is related to differences in biological functions. Such biological differences have been extensively documented in our recent studies (17.Wong P.M.C. Kang A. Chen H. Yuan Q. Fan P. Sultzer B.M. Kan Y.W. Chung S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11543-11548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18.Wong P.M.C. Yuan Q. Chen H. Sultzer B.N. Chung S.W. J. Biol.

Chung S.W. Fan P. Sultzer B.M. Kan Y.W. Wong P.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Presence of Viral mRNA of the Transgene Prepackaged in Adenovirus Virions—The early and rapid biological changes between Ad-RanT/n and Ad-RanC/d administration prompted us to investigate the nature of adenoviral transgene expression. The time from adenoviral infection to expression of viral gene is believed to be at least 2 hours after viral adsorption and infection (28.Glenn G.M. Ricciardi R.P. Virus Res. 1988; 9: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This view could not explain completely the obvious difference we observed in the presence of vector tissue distribution between T/n- and C/d-mice. Alternative mechanisms might exist, and we contemplated the possibility that prepackaged adenoviral mRNA of RanT/n- and RanC/d-mice may be present in virions of recombinant adenovirus vectors, so that soon after viral gene transduction and uncoating, the pre-existing messenger RNA allows for immediate translation into Ran proteins. To investigate this possibility, we took five different approaches to address this issue. First, we purified the Ad-GFP virus particles. After lysis of the purified virions and DNase treatment of the extracted RNA samples, we performed RT-PCR using GFP-specific primers. A 265-bp band was visible only after reverse transcription (+RT) but not without (-RT), which was predicted if viral GFP mRNA were present in the virions (Fig. 2A). The second approach we took was to metabolically label adenovirus-producing cells, the human embryonic kidney 293 cells, with [32P]UTP at various time points after infection with Ad-GFP. Virions from these virus-producing 293 cells were purified by CsCl banding (twice), RNase-(Roche) treated to remove any cellular RNA associated with virions, and lysed; the amount of radioactivity present in viral lysates was determined using a scintillation counter. The [32P]UTP counts were much higher in viral lysates of infected cells compared with those of uninfected cells, especially between the 10- and 20-h time points after virus infection (Fig. 2B). In our third approach, we also sought to determine whether mRNAs of transgenes were present in infectious virions. Human 5637 cells were infected with Ad-GFP. At various time points after infection, we performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from these cells. Results in Fig. 2C indicate the presence of mRNA of the transgene as early as ≤5 min after infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of prepackaged mRNA of the transgene in virions of adenovirus particles; these prepackaged viral mRNAs may be used for translation soon after viral entry. The fourth approach was to quantify prepackaged RNA in virions of recombinant adenovirus vectors by using real-time PCR to detect the exact copy number of mRNA in Ad virions (Fig. 3). Real-time PCR is highly sensitive, and its standard curve provides an excellent linear correlation between CT values and copy numbers. Our results confirm the presence of prepackaged RNA and that the copy number is estimated to be no more than one copy per viral genome. Few copy numbers were also detected from the RNA sample without RT as negative control, most probably because of incomplete DNase treatment. RanT/n RNA copy number corresponds to 10% of the number of virions used for RNA isolation. Given the presence of empty or incomplete Ad viral particles in sample preparation and significant losses in RNA recovery during extraction, it would be reasonable to interpret that a detection of 10% of the amounts of Ad prepackaged RNA may reflect a true value of one copy of prepackaged RNA per genome in each adenoviral particle. The last approach we took was to infect 293 cells with an adenovirus vector expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene Ad-LacZ in the presence or absence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. We chose to work on Ad-LacZ based on convenience, because there is a commercial bioassay kit for detecting β-galactosidase. Three hours after infection and actinomycin-D treatment, β-galactosidase activity was measured. As expected, no such activity was present in mock-infected cultures (Fig. 4). On the other hand, a significant amount of β-galactosidase activity could be detected in actinomycin-D-treated cultures that were infected with Ad-LacZ, strongly suggesting the presence of pre-existing Ad-LacZ mRNA after infection. Further experiments choosing a time point as early as 30 min after Actinomycin-D treatment yielded similar results (data not shown). Transtracheal instillation of adenovirus vectors leads to a rapid uptake of virus particles by murine alveolar macrophages, and elevation of mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines could be detected as early as 30 min after inoculation in alveolar macrophages but not airway epithelial cells (6.Zsengeller Z. Otake K. Hossain S.A. Berclaz P.Y. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9655-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hence, uptake of adenovirus particles by appropriate target cells (i.e. macrophages) stimulates a rapid host cell response. This could not explain completely, however, the early difference in tissue distribution we observed in this study, in that Ad-RanT/n and Ad-RanC/d are identical adenovirus particles, with only a single base difference in Ran cDNA between the two viral genomes. This early difference in tissue distribution of the vector must be biological because it was not observed with intravenous vector administration, and intraperitoneal inoculation effectively transduced tissue macrophages (Fig. 1). Furthermore, in work reported elsewhere, 2S. W. Chung, J. L. Song, X. Y. Huang, and P. M. C. Wong, submitted for publication. we showed that this route of inoculation introduced the RanC/d transgene effectively into the correct target cells (i.e. macrophages), which resulted in reduced organ inflammation, enhanced protection against septic shock, and decreased serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. The time from adenoviral infection to expression of viral gene is believed to be at least 2 h after viral adsorption and infection (28.Glenn G.M. Ricciardi R.P. Virus Res. 1988; 9: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the binding of adenovirus particles is achieved via a two-step process (1.Cullen B.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 697-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3.Whittaker G. Kann M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 627-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The first is the high affinity association between viral fibers of adenovirus and the Coxsackie virus-Adenovirus receptor of the host cells; the second is the binding of viral penton base protein to a co-receptor of the αV integrin family. Absorption of viral particles can occur in less than 1 min (6.Zsengeller Z. Otake K. Hossain S.A. Berclaz P.Y. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9655-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Adenovirion disassembly or uncoating is a step-wise process beginning at the cell surface, where the binding of penton base proteins with integrin receptors induces the release of fiber proteins from the Coxsackie virus-Adenovirus receptor. After internalization of virus particles into endosomes via clathrin-coated pits, the drop in pH leads to rupture of endosome membrane and thereby the entry of partially uncoated virions into the cytoplasm (9.Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P. Helenius A. Cell. 1993; 75: 477-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). By this mechanism, it is unlikely that such early biological differences could be observed between T/n- and C/d-mice. The presence of prepackaged adenoviral mRNA in the cytoplasm of transduced cells therefore presents an additional mechanism that can explain the rapid protein synthesis from mRNA of the viral Ran transgenes and hence their different biological consequence. Our finding of the prepackaged mRNA of adenovirus, which is a DNA virus, also offers an interesting parallel with a very recent report in which four mRNA species of the human cytomegalovirus from the immediate early region were found in herpesvirus, which is another DNA virus (22.Bresnahan W.B. Shenk T. Science. 2000; 288: 2373-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, these prepackaged mRNAs are thought to be responsible for the initial translation into proteins in the absence of newly made viral gene products. Prepackaged mRNA in virions of Ad-RanT/n and Ad-RanC/d certainly would help explain the rapid biological difference in the same type of cells transduced with the two vectors with identical genome other than a single nucleotide difference. This must mean that the single base difference is key to this rapid change; a mechanism for such a difference has been proposed in our recent publications (18.Wong P.M.C. Yuan Q. Chen H. Sultzer B.N. Chung S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33129-33138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19.Wong P.M.C. Chung S.W. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 468-474PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, our most recent RNA in situ hybridization results confirm the existence of such mechanism. 3K. K. Operman, S. W. Chung, and P. M. C.Wong, manuscript in preparation.

Whereas reactivation of equilibrium-unfolded mAAT is sigmoidal, reactivation of the short term unfolded protein displays a double exponential behavior consistent with the presence of fast and slow refolding species. The amplitude of the fast phase decreases with increasing unfolding times (k ≈ 0.75 min–1 at 20 °C) and becomes undetectable at equilibrium unfolding. According to hydrogen exchange and stopped-flow intrinsic fluorescence data, unfolding of mAAT appears to be complete in less than 10 s, but hydrolysis of the Schiff base linking the coenzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) to the polypeptide is much slower (k ≈ 0.08 min–1). This implies the existence in short term unfolded samples of unfolded species with PLP still attached. However, since the disappearance of the fast refolding phase is about 10-fold faster than the release of PLP, the fast refolding phase does not correspond to folding of the coenzyme-containing molecules. The fast refolding phase disappears more rapidly in the pyridoxamine and apoenzyme forms of mAAT, both of which lack covalently attached cofactor. Thus, bound PLP increases the kinetic stability of the fast refolding unfolding intermediates. Conversion between fast and slow folding forms also takes place in an early folding intermediate. The presence of cyclophilin has no effect on the reactivation of either equilibrium or short term unfolded mAAT. These results suggest that proline isomerization may not be the only factor determining the slow refolding of this cofactor-dependent protein.

The presence of cyclophilin has no effect on the reactivation of either equilibrium or short term unfolded mAAT. These results suggest that proline isomerization may not be the only factor determining the slow refolding of this cofactor-dependent protein. The folding and unfolding of proteins are complex processes affected by a number of features such as size, chain topology, and oligomeric state and ultimately by the amino acid sequence, which encodes each unique three-dimensional structure (1.Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of the protein folding problem arises from in vitro refolding studies of small monomeric proteins (2.Mathews C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 653-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mass of the majority of proteins found in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells is larger than 25 kDa (3.Kiehn E.D. Holland J.J. Nature. 1970; 226: 544-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most of these larger polypeptides fold into several structural domains, and in the case of oligomeric proteins several subunits associate through noncovalent interactions. Folding and unfolding of many large proteins with several folding domains and/or multiple subunits often show multiphasic kinetics with fast and slow folding phases, suggesting the presence of either multiple paths or intermediate states in the process (4.Dobson C.M. Šali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 868-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Slow folding phases are often associated with proline isomerization (5.Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 6.Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14637-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but in some cases the rate-limiting step involves, at least to some extent, the reorganization of misfolded species or metastable kinetic folding intermediates (7.Dalessio P.M. Ropson I.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 860-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8.Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Evans P.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 9.Matagne A. Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The significance of these kinetic intermediates is still a matter of discussion. They are considered to represent either productive intermediates that facilitate folding or kinetic traps that decrease the rate of folding (10.Baldwin R.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 11.Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both types of intermediates are likely to occur in protein folding, depending on the particular protein or the folding conditions. In addition, many proteins in the cell require the binding of cofactors in their native state to become biologically active. The folding of these proteins must therefore include the binding of cofactor, and analysis of this group of proteins is essential to obtain a better understanding of protein folding in vivo. However, the roles of cofactors in directing the folding pathway and their effect on the kinetics of protein unfolding are not well understood. Most cofactors stabilize the structure of the native protein, often by decreasing its unfolding rate (12.Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13.Robinson C.R. Lin Y. Thomson J.A. Sturtevant J.M. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16141-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14.Leckner J. Bonander N. Wittung-Stafshede P. Malmstrom B.G. Karlsson B.G. Biochim. Biophys.

In some proteins, the cofactor remains associated with the polypeptide after unfolding. This has been observed with organic cofactors such as FMN (16.Apiyo D. Wittung-Stafshede P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or heme (13.Robinson C.R. Lin Y. Thomson J.A. Sturtevant J.M. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16141-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17.Wittung-Stafshede P. Lee J.C. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6587-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as metal ions (18.Pozdnyakova I. Guidry J. Wittung-Stafshede P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 6: 182-188Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of at least some cofactors may take place before the protein folds in the cell. These cofactors may stabilize local native-like structure in unfolded proteins and thereby facilitate the search for the native state by acting as nucleation sites (16.Apiyo D. Wittung-Stafshede P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, this is not always the case. For instance, misligation of the heme group in unfolded cytochrome c is thought to cause the appearance of slow folding partially folded states (19.Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 20.Pierce M.M. Nall B.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In other proteins such as Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI, the metal cofactor binds to the active site after the enzyme reaches its native state, and therefore the overall folding pathway of this enzyme is not perturbed by the presence of metal ions (12.Goedken E.R. Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1914-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAAT) 1The abbreviations used are: mAATmitochondrial aspartate aminotransferaseAATaspartate aminotransferaseESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryGdnDClguanidine deuterochlorideGdnHClguanidine hydrochloridePLPpyridoxal 5′-phosphatePMPpyridoxamine 5′-phosphateANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. is a member of the large family of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that catalyze many reactions in the metabolism of amino acids. This family includes at least five different folds (21.Schneider G. Kack H. Lindqvist Y. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R1-R6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (300) Google Scholar), with mAAT belonging to the subgroup or fold type I of aminotransferases (22.Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). mAAT is a homodimer with 401 amino acid residues per subunit, which contains one molecule of PLP bound through an aldimine bond to the ϵ-amine of Lys258 at each of the two identical active sites. The single polypeptide chain comprising each subunit folds into three distinct regions: an N-terminal extended arm that interacts with the neighboring subunit, a small domain that changes conformation during catalysis, and a large domain that contains most of the residues involved in cofactor binding (23.McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Picot D. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The active sites lie at the interface between the small and large domains. Since each active site is composed of residues from both subunits, only dimeric mAAT shows catalytic activity. mAAT is an α/β protein, with each of the two domains containing a central sheet of β-strands surrounded by α-helices (23.McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Picot D. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Among the invariant residues of subgroup I of aminotransferases, two prolines, Pro138 and Pro195 are in the cis configuration in all of the known AAT structures. mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase electrospray ionization mass spectrometry guanidine deuterochloride guanidine hydrochloride pyridoxal 5′-phosphate pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. Members of the PLP-dependent family of enzymes are very suitable systems to study the folding of cofactor-containing oligomeric proteins. Different enzyme forms containing coenzyme attached either covalently or noncovalently, as well as coenzyme-free apoenzyme, can be easily prepared in order to study and compare their folding properties. The effect of PLP on folding varies among the different PLP-dependent enzymes analyzed. The isolated β2 subunit of E. coli tryptophan synthetase requires coenzyme to reactivate in vitro (24.Groha C. Bartholmes P. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the refolding of E. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase can proceed in the absence of coenzyme (25.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Binding of PLP imparts considerable structural stability to most PLP-dependent enzymes (see Ref. 26.Bettati S. Benci S. Campanini B. Raboni S. Chirico G. Beretta S. Schnackerz K.D. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40244-40251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and references therein). Based on reactivation and fluorescence data, a kinetic model including two consecutive first order rate-limiting steps was proposed to explain the refolding in vitro of mAAT following unfolding in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or low pH solvents (27.Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These steps follow the rapid collapse of the unfolded chain into a molten globule-like intermediate. It has been proposed that isomerization of the two cis-prolines in AAT is responsible for the two slow phases observed during in vitro refolding of chicken mAAT (29.Widmann M. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18619-18622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or E. coli AAT (30.Leistler B. Herold M. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the folding properties of P138A and P195A mutants of E. coli AAT indicated that although proline isomerization may play some role, other conformational rearrangements must rule the folding of this protein (31.Birolo L. Malashkevich V.N. Capitani G. De Luca F. Moretta A. Jansonius J.N. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32.Birolo L. Dal Piaz F. Pucci P. Marino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17428-17437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here we extend these studies to the analysis of the relationship between the presence of coenzyme and the properties of the unfolding/refolding reaction of mAAT. The coenzyme PLP is completely released from the active site upon unfolding (33.Wu T Oses-Prieto J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but its covalent link with the polypeptide persists long after the protein appears to be fully unfolded according to activity, fluorescence, CD and amide hydrogen exchange data. The presence of coenzyme does not perturb the kinetics or pathway of refolding. However, double jump experiments indicate that covalently attached PLP slows down the interconversion between fast and slow folding populations of unfolded states. Although we cannot discard the involvement of proline isomerization on the slow refolding steps of this protein, our results are consistent with additional structural rearrangements occurring both in the unfolded state and in populations of folding intermediates along the folding pathway. Materials and Protein Purification—Aspartic acid, α-ketoglutarate, cysteine sulfinic acid, GdnHCl, guanidine deuterochloride (GdnDCl), PLP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), and NaBH4 were purchased from Sigma. D2O and DCl were from Aldrich. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The precursor form of rat liver mAAT was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (34.Altieri F. Mattingly J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T.H. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the mature form (mAAT), the precursor was incubated with trypsin (protease/precursor ratio 1:100 by weight) to remove the presequence peptide (34.Altieri F. Mattingly J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T.H. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mature protein differs from the naturally occurring mAAT by having an additional alanine residue at its N-terminal end. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficientE1cm0.1&percnt;=1.40. The enzyme activity was measured at 25 °C using aspartate and α-ketoglutarate as substrates in a coupled assay with malate dehydrogenase as described previously (35.Martinez-Carrion M. Turano C. Chiancone E. Bossa F. Giartosio A. Riva F. Fasella P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2397-2409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the mAAT preparation was about 250 μmol·min–1·mg–1. The purified protein was stored in 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (refolding buffer), containing 0.02% sodium azide. The homogeneity of the preparation and the molecular size of the protein were verified both by SDS-PAGE, according to Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207460) Google Scholar), and by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The PMP form of the enzyme was prepared by incubating PLP-mAAT with a 20-fold molar excess of cysteine sulfinate in refolding buffer followed by extensive dialysis against refolding buffer (37.Jenkins W.T. D'Ari L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 22: 376-382Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conversion of PLP to PMP was confirmed by monitoring the absorption spectra, which showed a shift in the position of the coenzyme peak from 356 to 334 nm. The apoenzyme was prepared by extensive dialysis of PMP-mAAT against 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.7, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.02% NaN3, followed by dialysis against 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3. The apoenzyme preparation was over 95% free of PLP and recovered 90% of the original activity upon reconstitution of the holoenzyme by incubation with 100 μm PLP. Reduction of the internal Schiff base between PLP and Lys258 was carried out by incubation with 5 mm NaBH4 (38.Cheng S. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6597-6602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete reduction of the Schiff base was confirmed by monitoring the expected shift in the absorption maximum of the bound coenzyme from 356 to 334 nm. Unfolding and Refolding Reactions—GdnHCl unfolding and refolding of mAAT were performed following published procedures (27.Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For unfolding, aliquots of mAAT were incubated with 6 m GdnHCl, 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. The final protein concentration was 2.4 mg/ml. After incubation for different times as indicated in the corresponding figures, refolding was initiated by dilution of the unfolded protein at 10 °C in 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (refolding buffer) to a final protein concentration of 30–40 μg/ml. The dead time of the manual mixing was 15–20 s. When necessary, the refolding buffer was supplemented with 10 μm PLP or PMP. When monitoring reactivation of the apoenzyme, the time aliquots were preincubated for 20 s with 20 μm PLP before assaying. The enzymatic activity was monitored for only 30 s to minimize reactivation during the determination. Reactivation data are expressed as percentage relative to the final activity recovered after incubation for 4 h, which was about 40% of the total protein added to the reaction. Refolding Monitored by Intrinsic Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were performed in an SLM 8000 C Aminco spectrofluorometer set on photon counting mode. The recovery of native fluorescence during refolding was followed by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence at 338 nm following excitation at 280 nm after diluting the unfolded protein into refolding buffer at 10 °C and rapidly transferring the sample to the spectrofluorometer cell. The refolding reactions were maintained at 10 °C with constant stirring. Usually, 4-nm slits were used for both excitation and emission. The fluorescence kinetic traces were corrected by subtracting a base line obtained by diluting native protein in refolding buffer containing 0.1 m GdnHCl. When recording fluorescence spectra, the data were corrected for the Raman peak of the solvent. Stopped-flow Fluorescence—The changes in fluorescence upon un-folding or refolding were monitored using an SFM-4 (Bio-Logic/Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) stopped-flow analyzer with a high density mixer (model HDS) to minimize mixing artifacts when using GdnHCl and a 9-μl FC-08 fluorescence cuvette (0.8-mm light path). Excitation was at 280 nm, and emission was monitored above 309 nm using a cut-off filter. The unfolding transition was initiated by a 20-fold dilution of 0.6 mg/ml mAAT in buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with 6.3 m GdnHCl to give final concentrations of 30 μg/ml protein (or about 0.66 μm monomer) and 6 m of GdnHCl. To monitor refolding, samples of unfolded protein incubated for 1 h in 3 m GdnHCl containing 10 mm dithiothreitol were diluted 20-fold with refolding buffer to give a final protein concentration of 30 μg/ml and 0.15 m residual GdnHCl. We used protein unfolded in 3 m GdnHCl instead of 6 m GdnHCl to reduce the mixing artifacts that appear in the dilution of buffers containing high concentrations of GdnHCl. We were also limited by the maximum dilution factor (1:20) we could achieve using a two-step dilution and solvent delivery rates below the maximum recommended by the manufacturer. According to deuterium exchange/ESI-MS, CD, and stopped-flow fluorescence analysis, mAAT incubated in 3 m GdnHCl for 1 h was fully unfolded. The dead time of the instrument was determined to be about 1 ms. The temperature was regulated at either 20 °C (unfolding) or 10 °C (refolding) using a thermostated water bath. Control experiments performed mixing N-acetyl-tryptophanamide with buffer, native protein with buffer, or buffer with GdnHCl confirmed the absence of mixing artifacts beyond the first 10–15 ms following mixing. Typically, 8–10 kinetic traces were averaged. Deuterium Exchange and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Following equilibration in deuterated refolding buffer (40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pD 6.7) for 17 h, aliquots of native mAAT (0.5 mg/ml) were unfolded in 6 m GdnDCl, 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pD 6.7, at 20 °C. At different times after mixing with GdnDCl, aliquots of the unfolding reactions (3.2 μl) were mixed with 40 μl of ice-cold 200 mm (NH4)3PO4, pH 2.35. Samples were then desalted on a C18 reverse phase chromatography column (Zorbax C18SB Wide Pore Guard Column; Micro-Tech Scientific; 1 cm × 0.32 mm), which was connected online to a valve to direct the flow to either the waste or the mass spectrometer. After washing the column with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow of 200 μl/min, the flow was diverted to the mass spectrometer, and the protein was eluted using a 0–54% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The time lag between injection of the sample and the peak of the ionic current in the detector was 4 min. The reverse phase column, solvent delivery line, and injection valve were immersed in an ice-water bath to minimize H/D back exchange during injection of the sample into the mass spectrometer. All ESI-MS data were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer. The LCQ settings were previously optimized for detection of mAAT in high flow conditions (ion spray voltage 4.5 kV, capillary temperature 200 °C, capillary voltage 10 V). Ions with an m/z ratio below 800 were excluded from the ion trap, and m/z data in the range 800–2000 were collected. The relative abundance versus mass spectra was reconstructed from multiple charge states of mAAT (+23 to +55) using the BIOMASS deconvolution algorithm provided in the Xcalibur™ (Finnigan) software, and molecular weights of untreated (protiated) and deuterated protein were then calculated from the molecular mass of the peaks. Because the chromatographic step was performed in protic solvents, rapidly exchanging deuterium in mAAT was replaced with protium, leaving deuterium only in the peptide amide linkages, so the deuterium levels estimated are a direct measure of the deuteration at amide groups (39.Englander J.J. Rogero J.R. Englander S.W. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 40.Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 41.Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 42.Chen J. Walter S. Horwich A.L. Smith D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—The rate constants of the reactivation process were determined by fitting the activity data to either an irreversible two-consecutive first-order reaction mechanism as described previously (27.Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or to a double exponential process (A = A1(1 – e–k′t) + A2 (1 – e–k″t)). In this analysis, irreversibility only means that under conditions favoring refolding of the unfolded protein, the rate constants for the reverse reactions are much lower than those for the forward reactions. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in SigmaPlot 6.0 for Windows (Jandel Corp.). The stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic traces were analyzed using either the BioKine software provided with the stopped-flow instrument or SigmaPlot. The quality of the fit was judged by visual analysis of plots of the residuals (deviation of the fitted function from the experimental values). Details on the determination of the rate constants are included in the figure legends. The relative amplitudes of the fast and slow refolding populations in samples unfolded for short periods of time were estimated by simulation of the kinetic traces using the PC version of the kinetic simulation program KINSIM (43.Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Reactivation Kinetics of PLP-mAAT after Different Times of Unfolding—It has been reported that the rate of refolding of chicken cAAT and mAAT decreased by a factor of 4 and 25, respectively, when the proteins were denatured in 6 m GdnHCl for 40 s instead of for 40 min (29.Widmann M. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18619-18622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as indicating that proline isomerization is the rate-limiting step in the slow refolding of these enzymes unfolded for long periods of time. The rate of reactivation of the PLP (holoenzyme) form of rat liver mAAT (PLP-mAAT) also increases after short term unfolding in 6 m GdnHCl, but the dependence of the reactivation rate on the duration of unfolding is much less pronounced. The observed rate constants estimated by fitting the kinetic data to a single exponential function show that mAAT unfolded for 40 s at 20 °C refolds only about 2-fold faster than when unfolded for 40 min at the same temperature (Fig. 1). More importantly, the reactivation curves for the short and long term unfolded protein are qualitatively very different. The reactivation of mAAT unfolded for 40 min shows the characteristic sigmoidal behavior with an initial lag of about 4 min (at 10 °C) previously described for the enzyme unfolded at low pH (28.Artigues A.

A kinetic model including two consecutive first order rate-limiting steps was proposed to explain the refolding in vitro of guanidine- or acid-unfolded mAAT (27.Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 1A for the refolding at 10 °C of 40-min unfolded mAAT can be fit by such a sequential model with rate constants of 0.30 and 0.025 min–1, essentially identical to those reported earlier (27.Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, when mAAT was incubated only briefly (40 or 10 s) in 6 m GdnHCl, no lag was observed, but the reaction still showed complex reactivation kinetics. Reactivation was best fit to a double exponential function consistent with the presence of fast and slow refolding species in the unfolded sample (Fig. 1A). For instance, after a short 10-s unfolding incubation at 20 °C, about 37% of the protein reactivated with a rate constant of 0.58 min–1. The remaining 63% of the activity was recovered very slowly, with a rate constant of 0.02 min–1, almost identical to the rate constant of the slower rate-limiting step of long term unfolded protein. This result was at first surprising. After such a short incubation, the unfolded protein is expected to be homogeneous with regard to backbone configuration, and therefore a monophasic reactivation reaction should be o"
