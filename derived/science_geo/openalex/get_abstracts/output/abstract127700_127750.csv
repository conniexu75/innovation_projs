https://openalex.org/W1972946535,"A new member of the aquaporin (AQP) family has been identified from rat testis. This gene, referred as aquaporin 7 (AQP7), encodes a 269-amino acid protein that contained the conserved NPA motifs of MIP family proteins. AQP7 has the amino acid sequence homology with other aquaporins (∼30%), and it is highest with AQP3 (48%), suggesting that both AQP3 and AQP7 belong to a subfamily in the MIP family. Injection of AQP7-cRNA into Xenopus oocytes expressed a 26-kDa protein detected by immunoblotting. The expression of AQP7 in oocytes stimulated the osmotic water permeability by 10-fold which was not inhibited by 0.3 mm mercury chloride. The Arrhenius activation energy for the stimulated water permeability was low (2.1 kcal/mol). AQP7 also facilitated glycerol and urea transport by 5- and 9-fold, respectively. The activation energy for glycerol was also low (5.3 kcal/mol after the correction of the endogenous glycerol permeability of oocytes). Northern blot analysis revealed a 1.5-kilobase pair transcript expressed abundantly in testis. In situ hybridization of testis revealed the expression of AQP7 at late spermatids in seminiferous tubules. The immunohistochemistry of testis localized the AQP7 expression at late spermatids and at maturing sperms. AQP7 may play an important role in sperm function.

Recent studies have identified several water channels (aquaporins) that belong to the MIP family (reviewed in Ref. 1King L.S. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 619-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The MIP family proteins are widely expressed in almost all organisms. InEscherichia coli, there are two MIP family proteins; one is a glycerol facilitator (GlpF) 1The abbreviations used are: GlpF, glycerol facilitator; AQP, aquaporin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). (2Weissenborn D.L. Wittekindt N. Larson T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6122-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is a water channel (AQP Z) (3Calamita G. Bishai W.R. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29063-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has four MIP family proteins in its genome. Plants have many MIP family proteins. For example, there are more than 12 MIP family proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana (4Park J.H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In mammals, more than eight members have been reported; most of them transport water and those have been named “aquaporins.” Seven members of aquaporins have been reported in rat and human (1King L.S. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 619-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). AQP0 (originally named MIP26) is present exclusively at lens epithelium. AQP1 is present in many tissues including red blood cells, kidney, eye, lung, choroid plexus, bile duct, and vascular endothelium. AQP2 is solely present at the apical membrane of kidney collecting duct cells. AQP3 and AQP4 are colocalized at the basolateral membranes in some tissues such as kidney, colon, and trachea. AQP3 is present in urinary bladder, skin, and sclera of eye, and AQP4 is present in stomach, skeletal muscle, spinal chord, brain, and retina. AQP5 is present at the apical membranes of exocrine tissues. AQP6 (originally named WCH3 or hKID) is present only in kidney (5Ma T. Yang B. Kuo W.-L. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1996; 35: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Aquaporins are usually found in the selected tissues where water movements are abundant and/or physiologically important (6Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, a high water permeability of human and ram sperm has been reported (7Curry M.R. Miller J.D. Watson P.F. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is also reported that the high water permeability of human sperm is mercury-resistant and not mediated by AQP1 (8Liu C. Gao D. Preston G.M. McGann L.E. Benson C.T. Cristser E.S. Critser J.K. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this high water permeability is unknown. The sperm water channel may be veterinary important for the cryopreservation of sperms. Here we report the cloning and the functional expression of a new aquaporin (AQP7) from rat testis. One microgram of rat testis total RNA was reverse-transcribed and used for PCR with 5 μmset of degenerative primers as previously reported (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar): sense strand, 5′-CCGAATTCYTNAAYCCNGCNGTNAC-3′, and antisense strand, 5′-CCGGATCCAARTCNCKNGCNGGRTT-3′ (the abbreviation recommended by the IUPAC-IUB). The primers were derived from the consensus amino acid sequences of the MIP family (4Park J.H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (Leu-Asn-Pro-Ala-Val-Thr and Asn-Pro-Ala-Arg-Asp-Phe, respectively). The PCR was conducted in the following profile: 94 °C for 1 min, 46 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles. The PCR products were cut withEcoRI and BamHI on both ends, ligated intoEcoRI- and BamHI-cut pSPORT (Life Technologies, Inc.), and sequenced. An oligo(dT)-primed rat testis cDNA library in λZAP (Stratagene) was screened under a stringent condition (6 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide at 42 °C) with a PCR clone labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (random priming; Amersham Corp.). A positive clone (AQP7) was isolated andin vitro excised as described in the Stratagene protocol and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase version 2; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). EcoRI fragment (1.3 kb) of AQP7 cDNA (containing open reading frame and the untranslated sequences) was blunt-end-ligated into theBglII site of a pSP64T-derived BlueScript vector containing 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of β-globin gene ofXenopus (pXBG-ev1; a generous gift from Dr. Peter Agre). Capped cRNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase after a digestion with BamHI to linearize the plasmids. The defoliculatedXenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water or of AQP7 cRNA and incubated at 18 °C for 48 h in modified Barth's buffer. Two polyclonal anti-AQP7 antibodies were raised in rabbits against a synthesized N-terminal peptide (MAGSVLENIQSVLQK) and a C-terminal peptide (GLIHAGIPPQGS), respectively. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers of each antiserum were 13,200 for N-terminal antibody and 15,200 for C-terminal antibody. The oocytes membranes were isolated as described previously (10Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was resuspended in a loading buffer containing 3% SDS, 65 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After being heated at 70 °C for 10 min, the solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Membrane proteins from 3 oocytes were applied in each lane. The proteins were transferred to Immobioln-P filter (Millipore) using a semi-dry system. The filters were incubated for 1 h with the above polyclonal antibodies (100-fold dilution). The filters were further incubated for 1 h with125I-protein A solution, followed by autoradiography. Water permeability was measured as described previously (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In brief, oocytes were transferred from 200 to 70 mOsm of modified Barth's buffer at 25 °C, and oocyte swelling was monitored by video microscopy. The coefficient of osmotic water permeability (P f, μm/s) was calculated from the initial slope of oocyte swelling as previously reported (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The Arrhenius activation energy was calculated by measuring P f at 5 and 25 °C. The oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution either with [14C]glycerol (specific activity, 5.88 GBq/mmol; Amersham Corp.) or [14C]urea (specific activity, 2.02 GBq/mmol; Amersham Corp.) at room temperature for 2–10 min. The oocytes were then rapidly washed four times with ice-cold Barth's solution. The individual oocytes were lysed in 200 μl of 10% SDS solution overnight for liquid scintillation counting. The Arrhenius activation energy for glycerol was calculated by measuring P gly at 10, 20, and 30 °C. A rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized under high stringency condition with a 1.3-kb AQP7 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Each lanes has 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat tissues. The filter was washed under high stringency conditions. Cryosections (10 μm) were cut from rat testis from 12-week-old Harlan Sprague Dawley strain rats, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride, 0.1 mtriethanolamine HCl (pH 8.0) for 10 min. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were made with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase from 0.5-kb cDNA C-terminal fragment of AQP7 by DIG RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instruction. DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was used for the detection of AQP7 RNA in the tissues. In brief, sections were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (0.5 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C. After the blocking buffer treatment, sections were incubated in anti-DIG-AP conjugate for 5 h at room temperature. Following the incubation in detection buffer and subsequent color-substrate solution, sections were immersed in quenching buffer, and photographed. The testis from Wistar rats (9-month-old) was fixed with Bouin's fixative. The testis was embedded in paraffin. The sections of 8 μm were stained with a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of AQP7 in 1:3000 dilution after blocking with 5% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, the sections were treated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma). Following the diaminobenzidine reaction and the counter staining with hematoxylin, the sections were mounted with Permafluor (Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA). We used the two highly conserved NPA boxes of MIP family proteins for designing a set of degenerative oligonucleotide PCR primers. Searches for new aquaporins from rat testis cDNA using these primers led to the identification of a new clone. We screened a rat testis cDNA λZap library with this PCR clone as a probe. We isolated 16 partially overlapping clones. A cDNA clone of 1.3 kb, AQP7 (Fig. 1 A), was chosen for further study. The translation initiation site was assigned to the first ATG triplet that is downstream of nonsense codons found in-frame and similar to a good Kozak initiation of the translation site (ACCATGG). cDNA consists of a 5′-untranslated region of 260 base pairs and 3′-untranslated region of 199 base pairs followed by a poly(A) tail. An open reading frame encodes a protein of 269 amino acids with a relative molecular mass calculated as 28,876 kDa. Hydropathy analysis predicts six transmembrane regions with N terminus and C terminus localized in the cytosol similar to other MIP family members (Fig. 1 B). The C terminus, however, is exceptionally short with little hydrophilic residues. The human AQP7 also had an identical stop site. 2K. Ishibashi, unpublished observations. The 3′ noncoding sequence contains a consensus polyadenylation signal (double underlined) with poly(A) tail. No potential N-linked glycosylation site (NX(S/T)) nor the consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site is present in the predicted amino acid sequence of AQP7. The cytoplasmic second loop contains a potential phosphorylation site by protein kinase C (residue Thr-174). Searching the protein data base revealed highest amino acid sequence identity with AQP3 (48%) and lesser identity with other MIP family proteins including E. coli GlpF (38%), AQP Z (36%), AQP1 (33%), AQP2 (36%), AQP4 (30%), AQP5 (35%), and AQP-γTIP (34%). For comparison, AQP3 and GlpF were aligned with AQP7 in Fig. 1 C. Two highly conserved areas (NPA boxes) are evident as previously indicated. However, the second NPA box of AQP7 is not NPA, but it is NPS. Such a modified NPA box is only found in yeast FPS1 in which its first NPA box is NPS (reviewed in Ref. 4Park J.H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The second NPA box of human AQP7 was also NPS.2 The previous phylogenic comparison between AQP3 and 8 MIP family proteins revealed that AQP3 is most related to GlpF and developed in a different branch from other water channels (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). AQP7 belongs to this branch. We analyzed AQP7 protein expressed in the Xenopus oocyte by injection of rat AQP7 cRNA. The immunoblot of oocytes membranes revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa (arrows) detected by both C-terminal and N-terminal antibodies (Fig.2). The size is slightly smaller than that expected by calculated molecular mass (29 kDa). The glycosylation band seemed to be absent, which is consistent with the absence of consensus glycosylation site in AQP7.Figure 2Western blot analysis of oocyte membrane proteins probed with polyclonal antibodies against AQP7. Oocytes were injected with water (cRNA(−)) or 5 ng of cRNA of AQP7 (cRNA(+)). Membranes prepared from three oocytes were loaded in each lane. The blots were probed with anti-AQP7 antiserum against the C-terminal peptide (A) or against the N-terminal peptide (B). The specific bands for AQP7 cRNA injection were indicated by arrows. The positions of the molecular markers (kDa) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the function of AQP7 when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The osmotic water permeability coefficient (P f ) of AQP7-cRNA (5 ng)-injected oocytes was 10 times higher thanP f of water-injected oocytes at 25 °C (Fig.3 A) (186 ± 15 μm/s;n = 12 versus 17 ± 2 μm/s;n = 12, mean ± S.E.). The induction was comparable to the levels observed in other aquaporins. The previous study on human sperm water permeability revealed that 50 μm mercury chloride did not affect its water permeability (8Liu C. Gao D. Preston G.M. McGann L.E. Benson C.T. Cristser E.S. Critser J.K. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The toxicity of mercury chloride to sperm precluded further study with higher concentration of mercury chloride. In this study of the heterologous expression system, we examined the effect of much higher concentrations of mercury chloride. 0.3 mmHgCl2 did not affect the increase of P f (Fig. 3 A) (179 ± 15 μm/s; n = 12). To examine the temperature dependence of P f, P f values at 5 and 25 °C were measured (n = 12 each). The determined activation energy from the Arrhenius equation of P f was 2.1 kcal/mol, a value in the range expected for a water channel. As AQP3 transport glycerol (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we examined the glycerol and urea uptake in AQP7-expressing oocytes. Oocytes were incubated in the presence of 165 μm[14C]glycerol, and intracellular radioactivity was measured after 2 min. AQP7 cRNA (20 ng) injection stimulated glycerol uptake by 5-fold (Fig. 3 B) (1020 ± 76 cpm;n = 8 versus 202 ± 23;n = 4) (the calculated P gly was 18.9 × 10−6 cm/s), which was comparable with the previous reports of glycerol uptake by AQP3 (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Urea uptake was also stimulated with AQP7 expression (Fig. 3 C). The incubation in 22.6 μm [14C]urea for 5 min resulted in the increase of urea uptake through AQP7 by 9-fold (824 ± 238 cpm; n = 5 versus 93 ± 4; n = 6) and for 10 min by 16-fold (1717 ± 107 cpm; n = 4 versus 107 ± 5;n = 9) (the calculated P urea was 12.0 × 10−6 cm/s). The degree of stimulation of urea uptake by AQP7 is much higher than that of AQP3 (9Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 11Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Tate S.S. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The activation energy for glycerol permeability was calculated by measuringP gly at different temperatures. However, the result was complicated by the endogenous glycerol permeability of oocytes. AQP7-dependent P gly was obtained by subtracting P gly of control oocytes from P gly of oocytes expressing AQP7 at each temperature (Fig. 3 D). The activation energy for AQP7-dependent P gly was calculated to be 5.3 kcal/mol. As both activation energies for water and glycerol are low, water and glycerol permeate AQP7 by channel mechanism and may share the same pathway. Northern blot analysis revealed that AQP7 mRNA (1.5 kb) was expressed most abundantly in testis (Fig. 4). The size of the bands of heart and kidney (2.4 and 1.35 kb) seemed to be different from that of testis. Much weaker bands were detected in skeletal muscle and brain. The molecular identity of these bands remains to be clarified. In situ hybridization of testis showed that the positive staining was observed only when antisense probe was used (Fig. 5 A). Signals were localized at the inner surface of seminiferous tubules and not detected in interstitial tissues including Leydig cells. In seminiferous tubules, the positive cells are probably the cells of late stages of spermatogenesis, i.e. late spermatids (Fig.5 C). Immunohistochemistry of testis also revealed the expression of AQP7 at the late stages of spermatogenesis, from late to maturing spermatids (Fig. 6 A). The high expression was observed at the plasma membrane of late spermatids.Figure 5The detection of AQP7 mRNA by in situ hybridization in rat testis.

The nuclei were stained by hematoxylin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have cloned a new water channel (AQP7) from rat testis. AQP7 has the sequence and functional similarity to AQP3. Thus, AQP3 and AQP7 comprise a new subfamily in aquaporins. On the other hand, AQP0, -1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 have amino acid homology with each other on the order of 40–50% and comprise the other subfamily. The latter group seems to be more selective in the permeation of water, and the former group seems to be less selective and also permeable to glycerol. However, the nature and the precise localization of water and/or glycerol pore(s) within each group are not yet determined. The discovery of another member of the AQP3 group will facilitate the comparison of sequence-related functional differences between two groups. The water permeability of aquaporins is inhibited by mercury chloride except for AQP4 (14Shi L.B. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and plant aquaporin RD28 (15Daniels P.M.T. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1994; 106: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mercury-sensitive Cys is located just in front of the second NPA box in AQP1, AQP2, AQP5, and AQP6 indicating that this is a functionally important region of the protein (10Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AQP4 and RD28 do not have such Cys in their amino acid sequences. AQP7 is also insensitive to mercury chloride and does not have such Cys near the second NPA box. Although there are three Cys (Cys-86, -169, -195) in deduced amino acid sequence of AQP7, they may not be localized near the AQP7 aqueous pore. The previous studies on water permeability of sperms of human, ram, fowl, and bull showed their high water permeability with low activation energy, which is insensitive to mercury chloride (7Curry M.R. Miller J.D. Watson P.F. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Liu C. Gao D. Preston G.M. McGann L.E. Benson C.T. Cristser E.S. Critser J.K. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Watson P.F. Kunze E. Cramer P. Hammerstedt R.H. J. Androl. 1992; 13: 131-138PubMed Google Scholar). The character of the sperm water channel agrees well with that of AQP7, and the immunohistochemical study revealed that AQP7 is present at sperms. The physiological role of such a high water permeability in sperm is not clear at present. In E. coli, its glycerol transporter (GlpF) is localized in the operon with glycerol kinase (2Weissenborn D.L. Wittekindt N. Larson T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6122-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the functional coupling between GlpF and glycerol kinase has been shown (17Voegele R.T. Sweet G.D. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, testis has a unique glycerol kinase encoded by a different gene from the systemic one (18Stargent C. Young C. Marsh S. Ferguson-Smith M. Affara N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is possible that testis-specific glycerol kinase and AQP7 are functionally coupled and that the major function of AQP7 is glycerol transport rather than water transport. As glycerol has been used as an almost universally effective cryoprotectant for sperm, the glycerol permeability of sperm may be important as a determinant of optimal cooling rate. Whether the activity of AQP7 is critical for sperm cryopreservation remains to be clarified. We thank Kouji Takahashi, Hiroyuki Ooshima, Masanobu Kawasaki, and Kiyohide Fushimi for helpful discussions."

We have expressed and purified the cytosolic domains of three postulated import receptors, Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70. Each receptor domain is able to bind mitochondrial preproteins but with different specificity. Tom20 binds both preproteins with N-terminal presequences and preproteins with internal targeting signals; the binding is enhanced by the addition of salt. Tom22 selectively recognizes presequence-carrying preproteins in a salt-sensitive manner. Tom70 preferentially binds preproteins with internal targeting information. A chemically synthesized presequence peptide competes with preproteins for binding to Tom20 and Tom22 but not to Tom70. We conclude that each of the three import receptors binds preproteins independently and by a different mechanism. Both Tom20 and Tom22 function as presequence receptors.

They are targeted to receptors on the mitochondrial surface and are subsequently translocated across the outer mitochondrial membrane by a general import pore (1Kübrich M. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N.

The import receptors and the general import pore assemble into a dynamic high molecular weight complex, termed the preprotein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (Tom) (6Pfanner N.

Nine Tom proteins have been identified to date. Five of them expose major portions on the cytosolic side of the outer membrane: Tom20-Tom22 and Tom70-Tom37 were suggested to function as heterodimeric import receptors for distinct classes of preproteins (see below) (7Bolliger L.

The other four Tom proteins are associated with the general import pore: Tom40 is thought to represent the pore-forming component (13Vestweber D. Brunner J. Baker A. Schatz G.

Protein import studies with isolated mitochondria indicated that Tom20-Tom22 functions as receptor for the typical mitochondrial preproteins that carry N-terminal cleavable targeting sequences, termed presequences, which form positively charged amphipathic α-helices (9Hönlinger A.

Tom70-Tom37 was reported to be required for import of noncleavable preproteins, carrying (poorly characterized) targeting information in the mature protein but also for cleavable preproteins (8Gratzer S.

Little is known about the function and specificity of individual receptor proteins. Only the cytosolic domain of Tom70 has been purified so far and used for analyzing binding of preproteins. Schlossmann et al. (27Schlossmann J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11893-11901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the cytosolic domain of Tom70 was able to bind noncleavable preproteins but also to some cleavable ones. Schleiff et al. (28Schleiff E. Shore G.C. Goping I.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) expressed Tom20 as part of a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase and reported the binding of various preproteins to the fusion protein but also a high degree of nonspecific binding to the beads used. For this report, we expressed and purified the cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 and directly compared the ability of the three receptors to bind preproteins. We observed that each receptor domain could recognize and bind mitochondrial preproteins independently and with a different specificity. Only with Tom20 and Tom22, a synthetic presequence peptide competed for the binding of preproteins. Our studies indicate that each of the receptors binds mitochondrial preproteins by a different mechanism and show that two distinct presequence receptors function on the mitochondrial surface. (His)10-tagged cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22 and Tom70 were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA as template. To amplify yTOM20cd-His10 (N-terminal His10 tag), the primers 5′-TATCATATGGACTATCAAAGAAGAAATAGCCGCCAATTC-3′ and 5′-TATGGATCCTCAGTCATCGATATCGTTAGCTTCAGC-3′ were used. To amplify TOM70cd-His10 (N-terminal His10tag), the primers 5′-GTCGACATATGCGAGGAAAAAAGAACACGATC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTCGAGTTACATTAAACCCTGTTCGCG-3′ were used. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI andBamHI or XhoI and cloned into pET19b. To amplify yTOM22cd-His10 (C-terminal His10tag), the primers 5′-TATCCATGGTCGAATTAACTGAAATTA-3′ and 5′-TATGGATCCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGGTGGTTTCCGGATTTTGTGAAAGC-3′ were used. After digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product with NcoI and BamHI, it was cloned into pET19b. The correct sequences of the clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the plasmids pET19b-yTom20cd-His10, pET19b-yTom22cd-His10, or pET19b-yTom70cd-His10. The cells were grown overnight in LBA medium (0.5% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 1% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 100 mg/l ampicillin) at 35 °C. 10-ml cultures were diluted 200-fold into LBA medium and grown up to anA 600 of 0.7 in a 2-liter fermenter at pH 7.0. Then isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 2 mm. The culture was incubated for a further 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mm MOPS/KOH, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PiC, phosphate carrier; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. pH 7.2) and aliquoted. After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, the bacterial pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonified in a Branson sonifier at 50% duty and setting 5 with a microtip by 3 × 10 pulses of 1 s at 0 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g and 2 °C. The supernatant was applied on 1-ml Mobicol columns (Mobitec) that had been loaded with 800 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose resin slurry (Qiagen) and equilibrated with binding buffer. After an immediate spin in a microcentrifuge, the columns were washed five times with 500 μl of washing buffer (80 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9). The protein-loaded resin was resuspended in washing buffer and aliquoted. One aliquot was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assay the purity and the amount of protein bound to the Ni-NTA-agarose. The identity of the purified proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with the corresponding antibodies. The protein-loaded Ni-NTA resin (final amount of 50 pmol of each Tom protein/100-μl assay) was equilibrated with assay buffer (20 mm imidazole, 0–200 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) BSA) by mixing, centrifugation, and discarding the supernatant (three times). The resuspended resin was divided into equal volumes and transferred into 1-ml Mobicol columns that were closed at the bottom side. A mixture of 35S-labeled preproteins in assay buffer (maximum 7% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate) was added, and the resin was resuspended by vortexing. Where indicated, the synthetic presequence peptide CoxIV(1–23) or the control peptide SynB2, which were blocked N-terminally by acetylation and C-terminally by amidation, were included (to avoid peptide dimers, the cysteine at position 19 of CoxIV(1–23) was replaced by a serine). The total volume of the reaction was 100 μl. The columns were incubated under mixing at 30 °C for 40 min in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, setting 11). After centrifugation, the resin was washed three times with the corresponding assay buffer without BSA. Finally all bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9) and precipitated by adding 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After 20 min of incubation at 0 °C, the proteins were sedimented by centrifugation (40,000 ×g) and washed with acetone. The protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and digital autoradiography (phosphor storage imaging technology; Molecular Dynamics). The following procedures were carried out as described previously: synthesis of preproteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and labeling with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (29Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar, 30Alconada A. Gärtner F. Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Pfanner N.

For expression of the cytosolic domains of S. cerevisiae Tom20, Tom22 and Tom70, the predicted single membrane anchor sequence of each protein was replaced by a His10 tag. Tom20 and Tom70 carry the membrane anchor at the N terminus and expose the C terminus on the cytosolic side (Fig.1 A) (19Schneider H. Söllner T. Dietmeier K. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Trülzsch B.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3191-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); therefore the His10 tag was placed at the N terminus of the cytosolic domains. Tom22 exposes the N terminus on the cytosolic side and contains a membrane anchor in the middle and a C-terminal segment on the intermembrane space side (32Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I.J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domain of Tom22 was thus tagged with a C-terminal His10 tag. By use of the plasmid pET19 and induction by isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactopyranoside, the cytosolic domains were expressed in E. coli cells to ∼1–5% of total cellular protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4). The cytosolic domains were purified from the soluble fraction of theE. coli cells by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The proteins were more than 95% pure (Fig. 1 C).Figure 2Differential binding of mitochondrial preproteins to purified receptor domains. Equimolar amounts of the recombinant His-tagged cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 were bound to Ni-NTA columns. For the control, the lysate of theE. coli host strain was subjected to a mock treatment including incubation with Ni-NTA. Then an incubation with35S-labeled preproteins in assay buffer (with 100 mm KCl) was performed at 30 °C for 40 min as described under “Materials and Methods.” After removal of excess BSA from the columns, the bound protein complexes were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Standard (STD) was 5% of labeled preprotein mix that was added to the Ni-NTA columns. Quantification was done by digital autoradiography. The total amount of each preprotein added was set to 100%, respectively.

The control sample contained Ni-NTA resin that was subjected to a mock treatment with lysates from noninduced E. coli cells (Fig. 2, lane 4). The following preproteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine: a fusion protein between the presequence of Fo-ATPase subunit 9 and entire dihydrofolate reductase (Su9-DHFR) (33Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); as control, the DHFR (a cytosolic enzyme) alone; a fusion protein containing the presequence plus 87 N-terminal amino acid residues of mature cytochromeb 2 and the DHFR (b2Δ-DHFR; a 19-residue hydrophobic sorting segment of the 80-residue presequence was deleted) (34Koll H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1992; 68: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); the authentic precursor of cytochromec 1 that includes an N-terminal presequence with a hydrophobic sorting signal and a membrane anchor segment in the mature protein part; the phosphate carrier (PiC) that is synthesized without a presequence but contains internal targeting and membrane anchor sequences. The labeled preproteins were incubated with the resin-bound cytosolic domains at 30 °C under continuous mixing. After washing, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and digital autoradiography (Fig. 2). Each of the cytosolic domains interacted with a distinct subset of the proteins added. Tom20cd bound all four mitochondrial preproteins (Fig. 2, lane 1). Tom22cd bound preferentially b2Δ-DHFR and cytochromec 1 and bound only very weakly Su9-DHFR (Fig. 2,lane 2), whereas binding of PiC was in the background range (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). Tom70cd bound cytochrome c 1 and PiC but not the DHFR fusion proteins (Fig. 2, lane 3). DHFR alone did not bind to any of the three cytosolic domains (Fig. 2). To minimize unspecific binding of preproteins to the resin-bound cytosolic domains, we included a 300-fold molar excess of BSA (over the purified cytosolic domains) in the binding assays; however, the omission of BSA did not affect the efficiency and selectivity of preprotein binding (not shown). We conclude that the cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 selectively bind distinct subsets of mitochondrial preproteins. The cytosolic domain of Tom22 contains a large number of negatively charged amino acid residues and was suggested to interact with the positively charged amphipathic presequences (7Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Moczko M. Gärtner F. Mallet L. Bussereau F. Eckerskorn C.

Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We thus wondered why Su9-DHFR bound to Tom22cd only with such a low efficiency. The binding assays reported in Fig. 2 were performed in the presence of 100 mm KCl that could interfere with a possible ionic interaction between the charged residues of presequences and Tom22. At low salt, the binding of Su9-DHFR to Tom22cdwas indeed strongly enhanced (Fig. 3). Also the binding of b2Δ-DHFR to Tom22cd was increased at low salt, whereas that of cytochromec 1 was largely salt-insensitive, and PiC did not bind to Tom22cd at any salt concentration tested (Fig. 3). Tom20 contains a segment with negatively charged residues and was similarly suggested to bind preproteins by ionic interactions (7Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,21Moczko M.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We asked if lowering of the salt concentration enhanced preprotein binding to Tom20cd. Surprisingly, the binding of Su9-DHFR and b2Δ-DHFR as well as that of cytochromec 1 and PiC to Tom20cdwere inhibited at low salt (Fig. 4,lane 1). An increase in the concentration of KCl to 200 mm even enhanced binding of all four preproteins to Tom20cd (Fig. 4, lane 3), whereas DHFR did not bind at any salt concentration tested (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). The binding of preproteins to Tom20cd and Tom22cd therefore reveals an opposite dependence on the salt concentration (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3 versus 4–6). Binding of cytochrome c 1 and PiC to Tom70cd, however, were only slightly influenced by a variation of the KCl concentration from 0–200 mm (Fig.4, lanes 7–9). Moreover, Su9-DHFR and b2Δ-DHFR did not bind to Tom70cd at any salt concentration. We conclude that binding of preproteins to Tom20cd is stimulated by salt, whereas the binding of preproteins to Tom22cd is inhibited by salt. Binding of preproteins to Tom70cd is salt-insensitive. Only Tom20cd is able to bind significant amounts of all four mitochondrial preproteins tested. To further determine the specificity of preprotein binding to the cytosolic domains, we used two chemically synthesized peptides (Fig.5 A). The 23 N-terminal residues of the 25-residue presequence of subunit IV of cytochromec oxidase (CoxIV) function as a mitochondrial import signal; they can form an amphipathic α-helix with a positively charged side and a hydrophobic side (36Allison D.S.

The peptide SynB2 contains the same number of positively charged residues but lacks the hydrophobic site and does not function as mitochondrial import signal (36Allison D.S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding of preproteins to Tom22cd was performed in the presence of different concentrations of the presequence peptide or the control peptide. The presequence peptide strongly inhibited the binding of Su9-DHFR and b2Δ-DHFR (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–7). Half-maximal inhibition of preprotein binding occurred at ∼6 μm peptide in the case of Su9-DHFR and at ∼10 μm peptide in the case of b2Δ-DHFR (Fig.5 C). In concentrations up to 20 μm, the peptide SynB2 revealed only a slight inhibitory effect on binding of these two preproteins to Tom22cd (Fig. 5, B,lanes 8 and 9, and C); at 30 μm, it caused a partial inhibition of binding (Fig. 5,B, lane 10, and C). The inhibitory effect of the presequence peptide on binding of cytochromec 1 to Tom22cd was not as strong as that on the binding of the two DHFR fusion proteins but still significantly distinct from that of the peptide SynB2 (Fig. 5,B and C). Binding of the preproteins cytochrome c 1 and PiC to Tom70cd was inhibited neither by the presequence peptide (Fig. 6, Aand B) nor by the peptide SynB2 (not shown), independently of the salt concentration in the assay. With Tom20cd the presequence peptide competed with the binding of all three presequence-containing preproteins, b2Δ-DHFR, cytochrome c 1, and Su9-DHFR (Fig. 7 A) in contrast to the control peptide SynB2 (Fig. 7 B). The half-maximal inhibition of binding was obtained at a concentration of the presequence peptide of ∼4 μm in the case of Su9-DHFR (Fig. 7 A, lanes 13–27, and C) and ∼10 μm in the case of b2Δ-DHFR (Fig.7 C). In the case of cytochrome c 1, inhibition was weaker (Fig. 7, A and C). Binding of the noncleavable preprotein PiC to Tom20cd, however, was not competed for by the presequence peptide (Fig. 7,A and C). We conclude that a chemically synthesized presequence peptide competes with the binding of cleavable preproteins to Tom20cd and Tom22cd. Binding of preproteins to Tom70cd is not affected by the presequence peptide. We report that the purified cytosolic domains of yeast Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 selectively bind distinct subsets of mitochondrial preproteins. The overall pattern of preprotein binding to the recombinant domains agrees well with the preprotein specificities that have been predicted for these Tom proteins by studying their function with mitochondria or outer membrane vesicles (summarized in Refs. 1Kübrich M.

Sci. 1995; 20: 98-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Together with the lack of binding of a nonmitochondrial protein and the competition by a synthetic presequence peptide, this underscores the validity of the in vitro binding assays presented here. The analysis in the purified system provides several new insights in the mechanism of action of mitochondrial import receptors. First, each cytosolic domain alone can specifically bind preproteins without a requirement for other Tom proteins. Second, the characteristics of binding of the same preprotein are different for each of the cytosolic domains, suggesting different functional mechanisms for the three import receptors. Although it has been expected that Tom70, which preferentially binds preproteins with internal targeting information (23Söllner T. Pfaller R. Griffiths G. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

Both were suggested to bind positively charged presequences in a salt-sensitive (ionic) manner (7Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) proposed that Tom20 and Tom22 do not constitute independent binding sites for preproteins but function as a single heterodimeric receptor. The findings reported here suggest the following characteristics of mitochondrial import receptors. (i) Tom22: Binding to Tom22cd requires the presence of a cleavable presequence. Binding of a preprotein, which consists only of an amphipathic mitochondrial presequence and a cytosolic passenger protein, is highly sensitive to the addition of salt and is strongly competed for by a synthetic presequence peptide. This suggests that binding occurs solely via the presequence and that the positively charged surface of the presequence interacts with the highly negatively charged Tom22cd (32Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I.J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in a ionic manner. (ii) Tom20: Cleavable and noncleavable preproteins bind to yeast Tom20cd, indicating a broad substrate specificity for this import receptor in agreement with the binding properties of a fusion protein between glutathioneS-transferase and human Tom20 (28Schleiff E. Shore G.C. Goping I.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The binding of preproteins to yeast Tom20cd is stimulated by the addition of salt, leading to the unexpected conclusion that preprotein recognition by Tom20cd is not mediated by ionic forces but probably by a hydrophobic type of interaction. Tom20cdprobably interacts with the hydrophobic surface of the amphipathic presequences. Interestingly, a higher concentration of a control peptide, which contains the same number of positive charges as the presequence peptide but lacks the hydrophobic character partially inhibits preprotein binding to Tom22cd but not to Tom20cd. The opposite influence of salt supports the view that Tom22cd and Tom20cd recognize distinct surfaces of a presequence. It has been shown that synthetic presequences form amphipathic α-helices at amphiphilic surfaces such as detergent micelles or lipid bilayers but not in water (37Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 38Roise D. Theiler F. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Allison D.S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Tamm L.K. Bartoldus I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of presequences with the binding site/cleft of a receptor may induce the formation of an α-helical structure. Because a synthetic presequence peptide competes with the binding of cleavable preproteins but not with that of a noncleavable one to Tom20cd, it is likely that Tom20 employs distinct mechanisms for recognition of presequences and internal targeting sequences. (iii) Tom70: Binding of preproteins to Tom70cdis largely insensitive to the presence or the absence of salt and is not competed for by the presequence peptide, clearly distinguishing the binding properties from that of Tom22cd and Tom20cd. Tom70cd apparently does not recognize mitochondrial presequences but targeting information contained in the mature part of preproteins. The cleavable preprotein cytochrome c 1 behaves differently than other cleavable preproteins because it does not only bind to Tom20cd and Tom22cd but also to Tom70cd. This broad receptor dependence of cytochromec 1 is in agreement with import studies of this preprotein into mitochondria (26Hines V. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hönlinger A. Keil P. Nelson R.J. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Biol. Chem. 1995; 376: 515-519Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding to Tom20cd and Tom22cd is only partially competed for by the synthetic presequence peptide, and the binding to Tom22cd is only slightly inhibited by increasing the salt concentration. This suggests that cytochrome c 1may not only carry targeting information within the amphipathic part of the presequence but also in additional protein parts. Although further work is needed to identify putative internal targeting signals of cytochrome c 1, previous studies on the import of chimeric preproteins into mitochondria indeed suggested that some cleavable preproteins carry targeting information not only in the presequence but also within the mature protein (42Bedwell D.M. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4038-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Pfanner N. Müller H.K. Harmey M.A. Neupert W.

The binding characteristics observed with different preproteins raise the speculation that Tom20cd as well as Tom22cdmay contain more than a single binding site for preproteins each. (i) The major binding site of Tom22cd is obviously that for the positively charged surface of presequences. In addition, internal targeting information of a preprotein can stabilize the binding (cytochrome c 1) but is not sufficient to promote binding by itself (PiC). A putative second binding site on Tom22cd would thus not function independently but would play an auxiliary role. (ii) Tom20cd may contain two binding sites, one for the hydrophobic surface of presequences and one for internal targeting information, each of which is apparently competent for recognition of preproteins. (iii) Tom70cdcontains a binding site for internal targeting information that is not influenced by presequences. Irrespective of these speculations, it is evident that each of the three import receptors Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 can bind mitochondrial preproteins independently of other Tom proteins. In particular, this demonstrates that two presequence receptors operate at the mitochondrial outer membrane. The concentration of presequence peptide needed for half-maximal competition of binding (4–10 μm) suggests a relatively low affinity for the import receptors. The presence of two presequence receptors that recognize distinct properties of the same presequence should thus strongly enhance the specificity and fidelity of preprotein recognition at the mitochondrial surface.

The clonotypic α subunit (TCRα) is a type I membrane protein containing a short (∼5-amino acid) cytoplasmic domain and a 223-residue extracellular domain that has four potential sites forN-glycosylation. Mature TCRα on the surface of the antigen-specific T-cell hybridoma line 2B4 migrates as a broad 42–44-kDa band (2Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Chen C. Antusch D. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D.

However, when expressed in the absence of other TCR subunits, TCRα is synthesized as a 38-kDa core-glycosylated precursor that is sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H and is rapidly degraded with a half-time of ∼50 min (5Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This degradation process is not affected by inhibitors of autophagy, lysosomal proteolysis, or ER-Golgi traffic. Moreover, TCRα chains in these cells are localized to the “ER region” by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (5Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Together, these studies have led to the conclusion that TCRα degradation occurs at a site “within or closely associated with the ER” (5Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, efforts to identify ER-specific proteases that participate in TCRα degradation have been unsuccessful. Several recent reports have suggested a role for the proteasome in the ER degradation of some membrane or lumenal proteins (reviewed in Refs.7Bonifacino J.S.

For example, misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) molecules that fail to exit the ER are rapidly degraded by a process that requires covalent modification with ubiquitin and is blocked by lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor (9Ward C.L.

How these proteins, which are sequestered within the ER lumen, are recognized and delivered to the cytoplasmic proteasome complex is unknown. In this paper we have examined the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the ER degradation of newly synthesized TCRα chains. Our data suggest a model in which TCRα chains are first translocated into the ER, cleaved by signal peptidase, and N-glycosylated with core high mannose glycans. These chains are subsequently exported back to the cytoplasmic face of the ER, where they are deglycosylated and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Moreover, our data suggest that ubiquitination of TCRα is not required for this process. HEK293 cells were grown and transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (14Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments,N-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (ALLN, calpain inhibitor I, Calbiochem) or lactacystin (a kind gift from S. Omura, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo) at indicated concentrations was added to the fresh media. The cDNA corresponding to 2B4 TCRα (15Saito T. Weiss A. Miller J. Norcross M.A. Germain R.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) in pCDM8 was a kind gift from J. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health). The 11 lysine residues in TCRα were mutated to arginine by 8 sequential rounds of polymerase chain reaction-based “megaprimer” mutagenesis (16Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant construct (KαR) was verified by sequence analysis, which revealed the presence of an additional mutation of Phe154 to Tyr. Functional comparison with a KαR lacking this additional mutation showed that this conservative change does not influence either the kinetics of degradation or its sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TCRα were processed for immunoblot analysis as described previously (9Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved in 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with the appropriate antibody, and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (14Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were pulse-labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (>1,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Immunoprecipitation was performed using A2B4 (17Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6972-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and/or H28-710 (18Becker M.L. Near R. Mudgett-Hunter M. Margolies M.N. Kubo R.T. Kaye J. Hedrick S.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 911-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The samples were fractionated in 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by fluorography. For steady state labeling, cells were incubated with 125 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys in 90% Met/Cys-free and 10% complete media for 14 h. PNGase F (New England Biolabs) digestion was carried out on TCRα immunoprecipitated by H28-710 and bound to GammaBind Plus Sepharose according to the manufacturer's directions. HEK293 cells were treated with 50 μg/ml ALLN for 12 h prior to homogenization in buffer H (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Total cell membranes from the resulting post-nuclear supernatant were then sedimented in a TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer H containing 10 μm CaCl2. Samples were treated with Proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 0 °C. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mm. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Radiolabeled TCRα was synthesized in a coupled transcription and translation reaction using a T7-TnT kit (Promega) and 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]Met (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). Canine pancreatic microsomes were prepared according to Walter and Blobel (19Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). TCRα translated in the presence or absence of microsomes in 50-μl reactions were immunoprecipitated with mAb H28-710 and 50 μl of GammaBind Sepharose beads. To determine if proteasomes play a role in the degradation of incompletely assembled TCRα, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the steady state levels of TCRα in HEK cells transfected with cDNA encoding the 2B4α clonotype. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 A) reveals that these cells contain a predominant immunoreactive species with a mobility of 38 kDa, corresponding to the size of core-glycosylated TCRα, as previously observed in transfected fibroblasts (5Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A minor band with ∼2-kDa faster mobility, probably corresponding to a partially glycosylated form of the protein (see below), was also detected occasionally. In the absence of proteasome inhibitors, the 38-kDa species was completely soluble in nonionic detergent. However, overnight treatment with the proteasome inhibitors ALLN or lactacystin increased the steady-state level of the 38-kDa band in the detergent-soluble fraction and also led to its appearance in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Strikingly, these proteasome inhibitors also induced the accumulation of a novel, detergent-insoluble 28-kDa band. Because the mobility of this band corresponds to the predicted mobility of core, unglycosylated TCRα, we examined the effects of PNGase on the TCRα species which accumulated in proteasome-inhibited cells.Figure 1Proteasome inhibitors induce the accumulation of a 28-kDa signal-cleaved, deglycosylated form of TCRα. A, effect of proteasome inhibitors on steady-state levels of TCRα. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TCRα were incubated overnight without treatment (lanes 1 and 2), with 50 μg/ml ALLN (lanes 3 and 4), or with 50 μm lactacystin (lanes 5 and 6). Cells were lysed in nonionic detergents and fractionated by centrifugation into soluble (S) and insoluble pellet (P) fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TCRα mAb A2B4. The arrowhead and arrowindicate the positions of core-glycosylated (38-kDa) and unglycosylated (28-kDa) forms of TCRα, respectively. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left in kDa. Asterisk indicates the position of a partially glycosylated form of TCRα. B, characterization of 28-kDa TCRα. Cells transiently transfected with TCRα (lanes 3–6) or mock-transfected control cells (lanes 1 and 2) were labeled to steady state with [35S]Met/Cys in the presence of ALLN (20 μg/ml). Cells were lysed with nonionic detergents and separated into soluble (S, lanes 1, 3, and 5) and insoluble (P, lanes 2, 4, and6) fractions. TCRα was immunoprecipitated with mAb H28-710. Equivalent amounts of the immunoprecipitate were treated with PNGase F (lanes 3 and 4) or left untreated (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). TCRα forms were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. The positions of core-glycosylated TCRα (TCRα(+CHO)) and unglycosylated TCRα (TCRα(−CHO)), with or without signal sequences (SS), are indicated. Products of cell-free transcription/translation with (lanes 7 and 8) or without (lane 9) TCRα cDNA in the presence (lanes 8 and 9) or absence (lane 7) of canine pancreas microsomes (RM) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TCRα was immunoprecipitated from detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions of transfected HEK cells that had been metabolically labeled to steady state with [35S]Met/Cys in the presence of ALLN (Fig. 1 B). In this 15% acrylamide gel the 28-kDa species was resolved into a doublet of closely spaced bands, both of which were resistant to PNGase treatment, and thus, not glycosylated. The upper band of this doublet comigrates with TCRα translated in a cell-free protein synthesis extract in the absence of microsomes, indicating that it has an intact signal sequence. Together, these results suggest that translocation of TCRα is not completely efficient and that HEK and possibly other cells possess a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway that normally masks inefficiency in the process of ER translocation. The lower band of the 28-kDa doublet comigrates with the limit product of PNGase-deglycosylated 38-kDa TCRα, corresponding to the signal-cleaved form of TCRα. 2Under these experimental conditions, PNGase digestion was incomplete, resulting in a ladder of partially glycosylated TCRα forms. However, the smallest of these bands represents the completely deglycosylated form of the protein. This suggests that some TCRα chains either fail to become glycosylated following translocation and signal peptide cleavage in the ER or that a fraction of glycosylated, signal-cleaved TCRα chains are deglycosylatedin vivo. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the fate of newly synthesized TCRα (Fig.2). Following a 10-min pulse with [35S]Met/Cys, TCRα migrated primarily as a detergent-soluble 38-kDa core-glycosylated protein that was rapidly degraded with a half-time of 65 min (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, core-glycosylated TCRα in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors ALLN (Fig. 2 B) or lactacystin (Fig.2 C) was markedly stabilized. Both proteasome inhibitors induced the formation of bands corresponding to partially glycosylated TCRα intermediates and a 28-kDa species which accumulated over time in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Together, these data suggest that degradation of newly synthesized TCRα by the proteasome is preceded by progressive deglycosylation of the core-glycosylated protein. We used cell fractionation and protease protection to test the possibility that TCRα degradation by proteasomes is associated with its dislocation from the ER to the cytoplasm. Cells were lysed by mechanical disruption,and the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. A small amount (<5%) of TCRα (both the 38-kDa and the 28-kDa forms) was recovered in the supernatant, even after a second round of 100,000 × g centrifugation, suggesting that some TCRα had been released to the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). However, the majority of TCRα chains sedimented with the microsomal pellet fraction, suggesting that they are associated with ER membranes or are present as high molecular weight aggregates. To determine the orientation of these TCRα chains with respect to the ER membrane, the microsomal pellet fraction was subjected to digestion with proteinase K (Fig.3). The endogenous lumenal proteins BiP and GRP94 were resistant to digestion by proteinase K in the absence, but not the presence, of detergent. By contrast, the ∼10-kDa cytoplasmic tail of calnexin was readily cleaved by the protease indicating that this fraction contained ER vesicles that were sealed and of uniform membrane orientation. Core-glycosylated TCRα in the 100,000 × g pellet was completely protected from protease digestion, confirming that it had been correctly translocated. Strikingly, both bands of the 28-kDa unglycosylated doublet were highly susceptible to proteinase K digestion, indicating that they must be present on the exterior, i.e. cytoplasmic side of the vesicles. These data strongly suggest that reverse translocation of TCRα from the ER accompanies its degradation by the proteasome. Substrates destined for degradation by the 26 S proteasome are commonly “tagged” by the covalent attachment of multiubiquitin chains (20Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Inhibition of proteasome function in vitro or in vivo usually induces the accumulation of a significant fraction of highly ubiquitinated proteins, including ER degradation substrates like CFTR (9Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). As TCRα is a small protein, attachment of even a single ubiquitin moiety (∼7 kDa) would result in a readily detectable decrease in gel mobility. In the present study, no such mobility shift was observed in proteasome-inhibited cells (Figs. 1and 2). However, ubiquitinated TCRα could have been missed if the ubiquitin linkages were labile to cleavage by cellular isopeptidases. To directly test whether TCRα ubiquitination is required for its degradation by the proteasome, we constructed a TCRα mutant (KαR) in which all 11 lysine residues were substituted by arginine. Attachment of ubiquitin to substrates occurs via an isopeptide linkage between a lysine ε-amino group on the substrate and the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin (21Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with KαR were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 10 min, and the KαR protein was immunoprecipitated from both the detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions with anti-TCRα antibody (Fig.4 A). Like wild-type TCRα, KαR was core-glycosylated and rapidly degraded. Remarkably, this degradation was efficiently inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, giving rise to the appearance of partially and completely deglycosylated forms in both detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions. KαR degradation was similarly inhibited by 5 μmclasto-lactacystin β-lactone, the active form of lactacystin (22Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These data suggest that either ubiquitination of TCRα is not required for its degradation by the proteasome or ubiquitin moieties can be attached to TCRα at alternate non-lysine residue(s). Future studies will be required to distinguish between these two possibilities. Selective proteolysis is the final step in the elaborate network of proofreading and editing processes that have evolved to protect eukaryotic cells against the potentially deleterious consequences of errors that can accrue between genes and proteins. These include alterations in primary sequence due to mutation or to transcriptional and translational errors, as well as the effects of inappropriate spatial and temporal expression. Selective degradation is also required to eliminate unassembled or misassembled subunits of hetero-oligomeric plasma membrane complexes such as the heptameric TCR (4Chen C. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells contain two major proteolytic systems: proteasomes, which are present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and lysosomes. In contrast to the lysosome-mediated disposal of mature or partially assembled TCR oligomers, the rapid, nonlysosomal degradation of unassembled TCRα subunits had suggested the existence of a unique degradation system associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (23Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have demonstrated that some misfolded proteins in the ER can be degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes following their reverse translocation from the ER (7Bonifacino J.S. Nature. 1996; 384: 405-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The data in this paper demonstrate that unassembled TCRα subunits that have been biosynthetically translocated into the ER and core-glycosylated are exported or “dislocated” into the cytoplasm, where they are deglycosylated and degraded by the proteasome. TCRα was synthesized in HEK cells as a 38-kDa core-glycosylated precursor that was rapidly degraded. Our data show that lactacystin and ALLN stabilize this core-glycosylated form of TCRα, implicating the proteasome in its degradation. Although the effect of ALLN in stabilizing TCRα has been previously reported (24Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neither its activity against the proteasome nor its ability to induce the accumulation of dislocated and deglycosylated forms were recognized at that time. Our data show that either acute or chronic treatment of TCRα-transfected cells with proteasome inhibitors cause the core-glycosylated 38-kDa TCRα chains to progressively shift to an ∼28-kDa form that also lacks both N-linked oligosaccharides and an N-terminal signal peptide. As signal peptidase has its active site at the lumenal face of the ER, these data establish that some TCRα chains must have been at least partially translocated across the ER membrane. The susceptibility of the 28-kDa species to extravesicular protease indicates that it is not protected by the ER membrane and, hence, is cytoplasmic. Our data indicate that the majority of dislocated TCRα sediments at relatively low speed and is insoluble in nonionic detergent. This change in detergent solubility is probably the result of the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. TCRα contains an unconventional transmembrane domain that is interrupted by four polar or potentially charged amino acids. In the absence of oligomeric partners that could shield these side chains from the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, these polar residues have a dominant destabilizing influence over the rest of the molecule (6Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 247: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, therefore, that nascent TCRα chains are able to effectively partition from the hydrophilic environment of the translocon into the lipid bilayer. At the same time the remaining 16 hydrophobic residues that constitute the TCRα transmembrane domain are unlikely to be able to effectively partition into the cytosol and may facilitate aggregation of the undegraded dislocated chains. It is possible that the inability of this heterodox transmembrane to effectively partition into the lipid bilayer may facilitate its dislocation without ever fully dissociating from the translocon. The data presented in this paper suggest that ubiquitination of TCRα chains is not required for their degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Although the attachment of high molecular weight ubiquitin polymers has been demonstrated to increase the susceptibility of substrate for degradation by 26 S proteasome, modification by ubiquitin is neither a necessary (27Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for degradation. The requirement for ubiquitination of membrane and secretory proteins degraded by the proteasome is also variable. For example, inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of α1-antitrypsin (10Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) or MHC class I heavy chain (13Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

By contrast, there is evidence supporting a requirement for substrate ubiquitination in the degradation of other membrane and secretory proteins including connexin 43 (31Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and CFTR in mammalian cells (9Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) and Sec61p (32Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and carboxypeptidase Y (11Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) in yeast. In the absence of ubiquitination, what signals are used to target ER degradation substrates to the proteasome? In cytomegalovirus-infected cells, two gene products appear to possess the capacity to induce the dislocation of MHC class I heavy chains from the ER and accompany them to the proteasome. We speculate that in non-virus-infected cells such targeting could be accomplished by direct coupling of proteasomes to the dislocation apparatus. Possibly, the presence of a misfolded protein in association with the dislocation apparatus could provide a signal that would recruit the docking of proteasome. Such a signal could be transmitted via a transmembrane chaperone like calnexin, as has been suggested recently (10Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For this model to be true, dislocation of substrate would be predicted to depend on proteasome activity. In our studies <30% TCRα was dislocated (as measured by the appearance of deglycosylated chains) after 3 h in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, even though >75% TCRα would have been degraded during the same interval in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. Although preliminary, these data suggest that dislocation of TCRα from the ER may be coupled to the activity of the proteasome. Taken together, the data presented above support the conclusion that TCRα chains are dislocated from the ER for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Thus, TCRα joins a growing number of membrane and secretory proteins which appear to be disposed of by a process involving dislocation from the ER and subsequent degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Since TCRα has served as a prototype that has largely defined the process of ER degradation, we propose that the cytosolic degradation pathway may be the major pathway for degradation of misfolded or unassembled proteins in the ER. We are indebted to Juan Bonifacino for providing us with the 2B4 cDNA and the 2B4 mAb used in these studies. We also thank John Moorhead for generously providing us with the mAb anti-α H28-710.

Here we isolated and sequenced cDNA encoding human IUF1 and exploited it to identify the signal transduction pathway by which glucose triggers its activation. In human islets, or in the mouse β-cell line MIN6, high glucose induced the binding of IUF1 to DNA, an effect mimicked by serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors, indicating that DNA binding was induced by a phosphorylation mechanism. The glucose-stimulated binding of IUF1 to DNA and IUF1-dependent gene transcription were both prevented by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2, also termed p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, reactivating kinase, CSBP, and Mxi2) but not by several other protein kinase inhibitors. Consistent with this finding, high glucose activated mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase-2) (a downstream target of SAPK2) in MIN6 cells, an effect that was also blocked by SB 203580.

The glucose-stimulated activation of IUF1 DNA binding and MAPKAP kinase-2 (but not the arsenite-induced activation of these proteins) was prevented by wortmannin and LY 294002 at concentrations similar to those that inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase. Our results indicate that high glucose (a cellular stress) activates SAPK2 by a novel mechanism in which a wortmannin/LY 294002-sensitive component plays an essential role.

The β-cells of the pancreas respond to increases in blood glucose by secreting insulin, which then restores homeostatic equilibrium by stimulating the uptake of glucose into peripheral tissues (principally skeletal muscle). However, the insulin lost via secretion must be replenished by resynthesis. In the short term, this is achieved by the glucose-stimulated translation of pre-existing insulin mRNA molecules, but in the longer term, it depends on the stimulation of insulin gene transcription.

In the rat insulin I gene, a glucose response element has been mapped to a location between −193 and −247 upstream of the transcriptional start site (1German M.S. Moss L.G. Rutter W.J. J. Biol.

Moreover, the binding of IUF1 to the A3 site is triggered by exposure of rat islets of Langerhans to high glucose (4Macfarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K.

The loss of DNA binding at low glucose is prevented by incubation of the islets with nonspecific phosphatase inhibitors (fluoride, molybdate, and glycerophosphate), suggesting that glucose-induced DNA binding might involve the phosphorylation of IUF1. However, the effects of high glucose are not mimicked by cyclic AMP-elevating agents or tumor-promoting phorbol esters, suggesting that neither cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase nor protein kinase C mediates the glucose-induced activation of IUF1 (4Macfarlane W.M.

Total RNA was isolated from human islets of Langerhans following lysis in 4 mguanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.25 m sodium citrate, 5% (w/v) sodium sarcosyl, 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The lysed cells were extracted sequentially with water-saturated phenol and isopropyl alcohol and the resultant RNA precipitated with ethanol. Following centrifugation, the RNA pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA), pH 8.0, and reprecipitated with 0.1 volumes of 7 m ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. Final pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. For cDNA synthesis, the RNA sample was heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and the transcription reaction was performed at 37 °C for 60 min containing the following: 1 × reverse transcriptase reaction buffer (Promega, Southampton, UK), 20 units RNasin (Promega), 40 pmol of driving primer IPF3, 0.25 mm dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 25 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of human islet RNA, and 50 units of avian myloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on a Hybaid II Thermocycler, using 5 units of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 5 pmol of primers IPF1 and IPF3, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.125 mm MgCl2, and 1 μl of cDNA template prepared as described above. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the TA-Cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced by standard dideoxy sequencing methodology (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) using M13 primers. IUF1 was produced in E. coli using the Qiagen histidine tag expression system. The IUF1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI/XhoI fragment into the pQE expression vector. Following transformation into JM109, a 10-ml overnight culture was added to 1 liter of L-broth and grown to an A 595 of 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for a further 3–5 h. The bacterial cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 ml of solution A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 200 mm NaCl, 300 mm sodium phosphate, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7). Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 8 ml of a 50% slurry of nickel-chelated nitrolotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin equilibrated in solution A. After stirring for 45 min, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The resin was then resuspended in 10 ml of solution A, packed into a 10 × 1-cm column, and washed with 100 ml of solution B (300 mm sodium phosphate, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.0) containing 8 m urea. The resin-bound protein was renatured at ambient temperature by passing 200 ml (at 1.5 ml/min) of a decreasing 6–0.5 m urea gradient in buffer B at pH 7.0 through the column. The resin-bound IUF1 was then eluted using a 50-ml gradient of imidazole (100–500 mm). Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing recombinant IUF1 were pooled and dialyzed against 200 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 200 mmimidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5. Anti-IUF1 antibodies were raised in sheep against an octameric multiple antigenic peptide of the IUF1 sequence DKKRSSGTTSGGGGGEEPE (amino acids 205–224), synthesized by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, UK). 1 μg of linearized plasmid was transcribed in vitro for 2 h at 37 °C under reaction conditions of 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, CTP, and UTP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.01 mm (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 1 × T7 transcription buffer (Pharmacia), 0.2 units/μl RNA Guard (Pharmacia), and 60 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Pharmacia). Transcripts were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and quantified spectrophotometrically. In vitrotranslation was performed by incubation of 0.1 μg of RNA at 30 °C for 60 min with the following: 17.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.2 units/μl RNA Guard, and 500 μm amino acid mix (Promega). Human islets were isolated from pancreata obtained, with the appropriate consent, from brain-dead heart-beating donors. The organs were perfusedin situ with hyperosmolar citrate solution at 4 °C and processed by intraductal distension with collagenase (3 mg/ml) and the automated digestion procedure (14Ricordi C. Lacy P.E. Scharp D.W. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 140-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human islets were separated on the COBE 2991 cell separator using a Ficoll/diatrizoic acid-based continuous density gradient (15London N.J.M. Robertson C.S.M. Chadwick D.R. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Bell P.R.F. Clin. Transplant. 1994; 8: 421-459PubMed Google Scholar). The purified islets were placed in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, UK) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and supplemented with 400 IU/ml sodium penicillin G and 200 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of O2, CO2 (95:5) for several days prior to use. Selected islets were separated into batches of 120–150 in Hanks' buffered saline (0.12 m NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) except where specified otherwise. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the method of Schreiber et al. (16Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar). Islets were centrifuged for 10 s in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 400 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Islets were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min before adding 25 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The islets were then vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The pellet, which was enriched in nuclei, was resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Nuclear extracts were then centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted into small volumes, and stored at −70 °C. EMSAs were performed as described elsewhere (9Boam D.S.W. Clark A.R. Docherty K J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8285-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (0.5 μg of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled probe for 20 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. For competition experiments, extracts were preincubated for 20 min with 1 μl of a specific anti-IUF1 antibody or with 1 μl of nonimmune serum prior to the addition of probe. The control construct pGL-LUC is based on the plasmid pGL2 (Promega), with the thymidine kinase promoter from the herpes simplex virus cloned 5′ to the firefly luciferase gene. In the construct pGL-LUC200, a −50 to −250 base pairHincII-PvuII fragment from the human insulin gene promoter was blunt-ended and cloned into the SmaI site of the control construct. DNA was prepared using the Qiagen endotoxin-free Maxiprep method and quantitated spectrophotometrically. MIN6 cells (17Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M.

MIN6 cells were used between passages 26 and 30 for all experiments. Where required, SB 203580, LY294002, wortmannin, or PD 098059 were added 30 min prior to stimulation of the cells with glucose or sodium arsenite, using the concentrations of inhibitors and agonists given in the figure legends. MIN6 cells were lysed as described for PC12 and A431 cells (7Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) except that 2 μm microcystin was also present in the lysis buffer. Cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was incubated with 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads conjugated to an anti-MAPKAP-K2 antibody (2 μg) raised against residues 356–371 of human MAPKAP-K2 (18Gould G.W. Cuenda A. Thomson F.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C on a shaker, the pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with lysis buffer and then assayed for MAPKAP-K2 activity using 30 μm of the peptide KKLNRTLSVA (19Stokoe D. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 842-849Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was the amount that catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of substrate in 1 min. Min6 cells at about 80% confluence in six-well plates were transfected by mixing 4 μg of DNA and 54 μl of a 1 nm lipid suspension containing a 2:1 mixture of dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, (Sigma) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide, (Fluka) in 1 ml of serum-free Optimem (Life Technologies). The lipid DNA complexes were allowed to form for 20 min at room temperature before being added to the washed cells. Following 5 h of incubation, 1 ml of complete medium containing 30% heat-inactivated myoclone fetal calf serum was added to the cells. After 12 h, the medium-DNA complexes were replaced by complete medium, and the cells were left for a further 24 h. Treatment of all cells started with a 5-h preincubation in DMEM containing 0.5 mm glucose. Where required, 20 μm SB 203580, 50 μm LY294002, 50 nm wortmannin, or 50 μm PD 098059 were added 30 min prior to stimulation of the cells for 5 h in 16 mm glucose or 1 mm sodium arsenite. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then removed from the surface of the wells, and a cell pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 30 s. The cell pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol solution and lysed by freeze/thawing three times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. 30 μl of cell extract was added to 350 μl of buffer (15 mm MgSO4, 30 mmglycylglycine, 2 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.8) containing 0.45 mm coenzyme A and 2.56 mm Triton X-100. To this, 150 μl of 30 mm glycylglycine containing 0.5 mm luciferin (Sigma) was injected, and the luminescence was read at 560 nm using a Berthold Luma LB9501 luminometer. The protein content of the cell extracts was measured according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared from MIN6 cells exposed to low (0.5 mm) glucose. His-tagged IUF1 (10 μg) was then incubated in 0.1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (Amersham), MIN6 extract (0.5 μg), and 10 units of SAPK2 (7Rouse J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 or 60 min, 10 μl of Ni-NTA resin was added, and the suspension was rotated end-over-end for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s, the supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was washed twice in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) before elution of the proteins by 30-min rotation of the samples in binding buffer containing 250 mmimidazole, pH 7. 10 μl of the eluted material was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's paired t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are expressed as means ± S.D. We cloned cDNA encoding human IUF1. Its amino acid sequence (Fig.2 A) revealed a 283-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 31.4 kDa, which contains an antennapedia-like homeodomain flanked by two proline-rich sequences (Fig. 2 B). Human IUF1 is 95% identical to mouse IPF1 (13Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), 96% identical to rat STF1/IDX1 (23Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri S.L. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 1145-1156Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and 100% identical to the published partial sequence of X1Hbox8 from Xenopus laevis (25Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The IUF1 cDNA expressed in reticulocyte lysates bound to a DNA sequence from the A3 region (oligonucleotide B). Competition for binding was observed with oligonucleotide Bm1, which contains a mutation within the A3 sequence that does not affect IUF1 DNA-binding, but not with oligonucleotide Bm2, which contains a mutation in the A3 sequence that abolishes IUF1 binding (10Boam D.W.S. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, an anti-IUF1 antibody that was able to compete for formation of complexes in nuclear extracts competed for binding of the expressed protein to oligonucleotide B (Fig. 2 C). These experiments establish that the cDNA does indeed encode IUF1. The ability of IUF1 to bind to DNA in human islets of Langerhans was studied initially after incubation for 3 h in low (3 mm) or high (20 mm) glucose. In 3 mm glucose, the binding activity was approximately 5% of that seen in 20 mm glucose (Fig. 2 D). This effect was specific for IUF1 because glucose had no effect on the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors IEF1 and USF (Fig.2 D), which bind to the E1 and E2 sites in the human insulin gene promoter (Fig. 1). The loss of IUF1 DNA binding after transferring the islets from high (20 mm) glucose to low (3 mm) glucose was reversible, because reexposure to 20 mm glucose resulted in a complete recovery of IUF1 DNA binding activity (data not shown). Moreover, the loss of IUF1 DNA binding at 3 mm glucose was prevented by calyculin A (Fig. 2 E) or okadaic acid (data not shown), which are potent inhibitors of the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. These observations indicate that the glucose-induced activation of IUF1 involves a protein phosphorylation event. A high concentration of blood glucose might be considered to represent a stressful stimulus, and we therefore wondered whether one of the SAPK cascades might be involved in mediating the activation of IUF1 by high glucose. Three SAPKs have been identified, which are homologues of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), termed here SAPK1 (also known as SAPK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase), SAPK2 (see Introduction), and SAPK3 (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 6 or p38γ) (reviewed in Refs. 6Cohen, P. (1997) Trends Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar and 26Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SAPK2 is potently and specifically inhibited by the drug SB 203580, which does not inhibit SAPK1, SAPK3, MAPKs, or many other protein kinases that have been tested (6Cohen, P. (1997) Trends Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar, 26Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). We found that the binding of IUF1 to DNA induced by high glucose was prevented by SB 203580 (Fig.3, A and D). In contrast, several other protein kinase inhibitors had no effect including 50 μm PD 098059 (which prevents the activation of MAP kinase kinase-1), 2 μm KN62 (which inhibits calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2), and 100 nm rapamycin (which prevents the activation of p70 S6 kinase) (data not shown).

The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor has been identified as the Met-tyrosine kinase. Upon stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor, the Met β subunit becomes highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, one of which, tyrosine 1356 within the carboxyl terminus, is crucial for dissociation, motility, and branching tubule formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. Tyrosine 1356 forms a multisubstrate binding site for the Grb2 and Shc adaptor proteins, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, and a phosphatase, SHP2. To investigate additional signaling molecules that are activated by the Met receptor, we have identified hepatocyte growth factor-induced phosphoproteins in tubular epithelial cells. We have established that proteins of 100–130 kDa are highly phosphorylated following stimulation of epithelial cells and that one of these is the Grb2-associated binding protein Gab1, a possible insulin receptor substrate-1-like signal transducer. We show that Gab1 is the major substrate for the Met kinase in vitro and in vivo. Association of Gab1 with Met requires a functional Grb2 binding site involving tyrosine 1356 and to a lesser extent tyrosine 1349. Met receptor mutants that fail to induce branching tubulogenesis are impaired in their ability to interact with Gab1, suggesting that Gab1 may play a role in these processes.

Cells expressing a Met receptor mutant that fails to associate with the Grb2 adaptor protein (N1358H), yet retains the ability to interact with other substrates, scatter in response to HGF but fail to form branching tubules, suggesting that Grb2-dependent signaling pathways may be involved in the morphogenic activities of HGF (27Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).To investigate the signaling molecules that are activated by the Met receptor, we have identified HGF-induced phosphoproteins in MDCK cells. We have established that proteins of 100–130 kDa are highly phosphorylated following HGF stimulation of MDCK cells and that one of these is the Grb2-associated binding protein Gab1, a possible insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-like signal transducer. We show that Gab1 is the major substrate for the Met kinase and that efficient association of Gab1 requires a functional Grb2 binding site involving Tyr-1356 in the Met carboxyl terminus. Met receptor mutants that fail to induce branching morphogenesis are impaired in their ability to interact with Gab1 suggesting that Gab1 may play a role in these processes.DISCUSSIONHGF is a multifunctional factor that stimulates growth, scatter, and branching tubulogenesis of epithelial cells in culture. These responses are mediated through the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. To identify novel signaling pathways that are activated by HGF, we examined the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins following stimulation of epithelial MDCK cells with HGF. We have established that proteins of 100–130 kDa are highly phosphorylated following stimulation of epithelial cells and that one of these is the Grb2-associated binding protein, Gab1.Gab1 shows the greatest sequence similarity with IRS-1, a major substrate of the insulin receptor (38Sun X.J.

IRS-1 and related members IRS-2 (39Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F.

Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) constitute a new family of multisubstrate docking proteins. These proteins have in common with Gab1 an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that may play a role in subcellular localization or substrate recognition (42Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), in addition to multiple tyrosine residues that may act to recruit SH2 or PTB domain-containing substrates. Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells with insulin or EGF (36Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus Gab1 may be a target for several protein-tyrosine kinases and in a manner similar to IRS-1, function as a multisubstrate docking protein. However, unlike IRS-1, Gab1 does not contain an SH2 or PTB binding domain, and the mechanism by which Gab1 interacts with the EGF or insulin receptor-tyrosine kinases is unknown.In an attempt to identify substrates from epithelial MDCK cells that associated with and were phosphorylated by the Met receptor, we have used an in vitro association assay (34Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp Ulf R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we showed that two proteins of 100 and 130 kDa are the predominant substrates from epithelial MDCK cells (Fig. 1, A andB) that associated with and are phosphorylated by the Met receptor kinase (Fig. 2 A). The association of the p100/130 proteins with the Met receptor required Met kinase activity (Fig.2 A) and was primarily dependent on phosphorylation of tyrosine 1356 and to a lesser extent tyrosine 1349 (Fig.4 A). This is consistent with previous data showing that tyrosine 1356 in the carboxyl terminus of the Met receptor acts as a multisubstrate binding site and is critical for the association of Grb2, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, and SHP2 and together with tyrosine 1349 is required for phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein (23Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 26Fixman E.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Significantly, a mutant Met protein (N1358H) that abolishes only Grb2 binding, yet retains the ability to associate with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, SHP2, and Shc (27Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed a similar large reduction in association/phosphorylation of the p100/130 proteins to 10% that of the wild type level (Fig. 4, A and D). This suggested that the majority of the p100/130 proteins associated with Met either indirectly through the Grb2 adaptor protein or required an asparagine residue two amino acids downstream from Tyr-1356. Consistent with the former, the p100/130 proteins from serum-starved MDCK cells, associated with a GST-Grb2 fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, permitting the SH2 domain of Grb2 to couple this complex to Tyr-1356 in the Met receptor (Fig.5 A).Recently, Gab1 was identified as a novel Grb2-associated protein. We show that Gab1 immunoreactive proteins of 95 and 115 kDa from serum-starved MDCK cells or of 110 kDa from serum-starved HeLa cells associated with an activated Met kinase in vitro (Fig.6 A). In a manner similar to the p100/130 proteins, the Gab1 proteins in MDCK cells required Tyr-1349 in addition to a functional Grb2 binding site downstream from Tyr-1356 for efficient association with the Met receptor (compare Figs. 4 A and 6 C). Moreover, phosphorylation of Gab1 in the in vitro kinase assay produced a shift in mobility of Gab1, from proteins of 95 and 115 kDa in MDCK cells, to a diffuse 100–130-kDa species, and of the 110-kDa protein in HeLa cells to a 120-kDa species, demonstrating that Gab1 is a direct substrate for the Met kinase (Fig. 6 A). Significantly, when an MDCK cell lysate is depleted of Gab1, with anti-Gab1 sera, no p100/130 proteins were detected in the in vitro association kinase assay, demonstrating that the p100/130 proteins from MDCK cells are Gab1 (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with Gab1 being a downstream target in the Met signaling pathway, Gab1 was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following stimulation of MDCK cells with HGF (Fig. 7 A) and coimmunoprecipitates with the Met receptor in vivo (Fig. 7 B).We show here that the Grb2 adaptor protein couples Gab1 with the Met receptor and in the absence of Grb2 or a Grb2 binding site, little Gab1 can associate with Met (Figs. 4 A, 5 A,6 C, 7 B, and 8). However, only upon loss of Grb2 binding in conjunction with a Y1349F mutation did Gab1 fail to associate with Met (Figs. 4 A, 6 C, and7 B). Thus in addition to a functional Grb2 binding site downstream from Tyr-1356, full association of Gab1 with the Met receptor required Tyr-1349. While this paper was in preparation an interaction between Gab1 and Met was detected using the yeast two-hybrid system (37Weidner K.M. Dicesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gab1 bound Met directly. This interaction was dependent predominantly on Tyr-1349 and to a lesser extent on Tyr-1356 and was localized to a domain in Gab1 involving amino acids 450–532 (37Weidner K.M. Dicesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a Gab1 fusion protein binds wild-type Met but not mutant proteins by Far Western analysis (Fig. 6 D), suggesting that the direct association of Gab1 with Met may prefer both Tyr-1349 and Tyr-1356 in Met. Since direct binding of Gab1 with Tyr-1349 or Tyr-1356 is detected in the yeast two-hybrid system and Gab1 associates with the Met Y1356F and N1358H mutants that fail to bind Grb2 (Figs. 6 C and7 B), a direct interaction between Gab1 and Met can also occur in vivo in the absence of Grb2 (Fig.8 D). However, although a direct interaction predominates in the yeast two-hybrid system, only 10% of Gab1 present in a cell lysate is recruited to Tyr-1349 in vitro (Figs. 4 A and 6 C) or in vivo (Fig. 7 B) demonstrating that the majority of Gab1 is recruited to Tyr-1356 in an activated Met receptor via Grb2 (Figs.4 A, 6 C, 7 B, and 8 C).We have previously shown that Met receptor mutants that fail to induce branching morphogenesis fail to interact with Grb2 yet still activate Ras-dependent pathways, presumably mediated through a Shc-Grb2-SOS complex (27Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, Grb2-dependent pathways that are distinct from Ras are implicated in the formation of branching tubules in response to HGF. Interestingly, overexpression of Gab1 in MDCK cells promotes the formation of branching tubules in matrix culture in the absence of HGF, demonstrating that Gab1 is a Met-dependent substrate that contributes to morphogenesis (37Weidner K.M. Dicesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of a fusion protein containing the Met binding domain of Gab1 blocked HGF-induced cell dissociation (37Weidner K.M. Dicesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Since this fusion protein also contained the proline-rich domains of Gab1 predicted to associate with Grb2 (36Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), this domain would be predicted to compete with cellular proteins for binding to the Grb2 SH3 domain and act as a dominant negative domain for Grb2-dependent signaling. These data are therefore still consistent with the requirement for a functional Grb2 binding site in the Met receptor for branching morphogenesis (27Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since a Y1349F mutant Met protein still retained the ability to induce branching tubules when expressed in MDCK cells (19Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Riethmacher D. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this suggests that the Grb2-mediated association of Gab1 with Met detected here may be of greater physiological significance for branching morphogenesis.Gab1 is a multisubstrate docking protein that, following stimulation of cells with EGF, associates with PI 3-kinase, SHP2, and phospholipase Cγ and thus may act to amplify or coordinate signals downstream from receptor-tyrosine kinases (36Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity is required for dissociation, motility, and branching morphogenesis of epithelial cells in matrix culture following stimulation with HGF (43Derman M.P. Cuha M.J. Barros E.J. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar, 44Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and thus may be a critical Gab1-regulated pathway required for branching morphogenesis. Although Gab1 is a substrate for the EGF receptor (36Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), EGF does not stimulate branching morphogenesis in MDCK cells which have abundant EGF receptors (45Haugel-DeMouzon S. Csermly P. Zoppini G. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 150: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, it is critical to evaluate which Met-regulated Gab1-mediated signals are required for branching morphogenesis of epithelial cells and if these are modulated in distinct spacial or temporal manners downstream from receptor-tyrosine kinases resulting in different biological responses.

https://openalex.org/W1988753461,"Previous work from this laboratory has shown that insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Mastick, C. C., Brady, M. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 129, 1523–1531). This phosphorylation is specific for insulin and involves the activation of a tyrosine kinase downstream of the insulin receptor. We report here that tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin is detected only in fully differentiated adipocytes, not in fibroblasts (preadipocytes), despite the fact that both cell types express caveolin-1 and active insulin receptor. Caveolin copurifies with caveolin tyrosine kinase activity in both preadipocytes and adipocytes. Accumulating evidence indicates that this kinase is the Src family kinase Fyn. Fyn is expressed in the preadipocytes and the adipocytes and is colocalized with caveolin in low density Triton-insoluble complexes in both cell types. In adipocytes, overexpression of wild type Fyn leads to increased basal phosphorylation of caveolin and hyperphosphorylation of caveolin in response to insulin. In vitro kinase assays suggest that Fyn may be activated in response to insulin through the binding of a tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate protein. Previous work suggested that this protein may be c-Cbl (Ribon, V., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997) Biochem. J. 324, 839–846). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Cbl binds to Fyn in an insulin-dependent manner, and Cbl phosphorylation is adipocyte-specific. Here we show that phosphorylated Cbl is translocated into caveolin-enriched Triton-insoluble complexes after insulin stimulation. This may lead to the cell type-specific, compartmentalized activation of Fyn and the specific phosphorylation of proteins in the caveolae in response to insulin in adipocytes.

Like receptors for many growth factors, the insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that undergoes activation upon insulin binding, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific set of substrate proteins (1Kahn C.R.

Like other growth factors, insulin acts as a mitogen in many cell types and therefore shares a number of signaling pathways with these growth factors (3Saltiel A.R. Am. J.

However, in adipocytes insulin increases glucose uptake and metabolism 10 to hundreds of fold, whereas growth factors such as PDGF 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; TIP, Triton-insoluble pellets; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; PI 3′-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; TIP, Triton-insoluble pellets; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; PI 3′-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. and EGF are without effect on these processes (4Robinson L.J.

This indicates that key regulators of metabolic pathways exist in adipocytes that respond uniquely to insulin signaling. Despite intensive investigation, the basis for this specificity remains largely unknown.One proposed mechanism for specificity in signal transduction involves the spatial compartmentalization of signaling proteins (8Mastick, C. C., Brady, M. J., Printen, J. A., Ribon, V., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar).

Caveolins have also been reported to have intrinsic GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activities for G-protein α-subunits (27Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M.

Despite these reports, the exact role and composition of these caveolin-containing structures remain controversial (29–31; reviewed in Ref. 8Mastick, C. C., Brady, M. J., Printen, J. A., Ribon, V., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997) Mol. Cell.

James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Caveolins-1 and -2 are highly expressed in adipocytes (33Glenney J.R.

Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that caveolin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role for caveolae in insulin action, phosphorylation of caveolin is specific for insulin and does not occur in response to other growth factors such as PDGF or EGF, suggesting that caveolae may be involved in an insulin-specific signaling pathway.Here we show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin in response to insulin is specific for the differentiated adipocyte phenotype. Although preadipocytes express active insulin receptors, caveolin-1, and the caveolin-kinase Fyn, caveolin is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in these cells. The data indicate that a key molecule(s) in the signaling pathway leading from the activated insulin receptor to caveolin phosphorylation is regulated by adipocyte differentiation.DISCUSSIONThe ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and storage of glucose as glycogen and lipid is significantly increased after adipocyte differentiation.2 Differentiation leads to an increase in the expression of the enzymes involved in the storage of glucose as lipid and glycogen. However, the increase in the responsiveness of these pathways to insulin cannot be fully accounted for by the combined increases in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and the increased levels of expression of these enzymes after differentiation. 3A. R. Saltiel, M. J. Brady, D. Lazar, and C. C. Mastick, unpublished observations. This indicates that the metabolic signaling pathways stimulated by insulin may be up-regulated by differentiation as well.Many of the signaling pathways stimulated by insulin are shared by other growth factors, such as EGF and PDGF. However, insulin stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes, whereas EGF and PDGF have little effect on these processes. Interestingly, caveolin-1 is specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin. Despite the presence of receptors for other growth factors such as PDGF or EGF on adipocytes, caveolin phosphorylation does not occur in response to these other ligands (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin is also differentiation-dependent in 3T3-L1 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite comparable levels of expression of active insulin receptors and caveolin in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, stimulation of the insulin receptor is uncoupled from the phosphorylation of caveolin in the preadipocytes. This suggests that caveolin is not a direct substrate of the insulin receptor and that other proteins are required for this phosphorylation.We have previously shown (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) that caveolin copurifies with a caveolin-tyrosine kinase in low density Triton-insoluble complexes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes from both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. Although there was no detectable insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these complexes, the Src family kinase Fyn was highly enriched in the caveolar fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fyn copurifies with caveolin in low density Triton-insoluble complexes from both preadipocytes and adipocytes (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, overexpression of wild type Fyn caused an increase in basal caveolin phosphorylation, as well as hyperphosphorylation of caveolin after insulin stimulation in the adipocytes (Figs. 5 and 6). However, there was no effect of Fyn overexpression on caveolin phosphorylation in the preadipocytes.Preadipocytes and adipocytes both express significant levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin, and the caveolin kinase Fyn. However, only in the adipocytes does activation of the insulin receptor lead to the phosphorylation of caveolin. The data imply the presence of a mediator required for the segregated activation of Fyn in caveolae, the activity of which is critically dependent on adipocyte differentiation. There was no change in the association or tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn in the caveolin-enriched fractions in response insulin in either adipocytes or preadipocytes (Fig. 7), indicating that direct modifications of Fyn phosphorylation are not involved in the activation of this kinase in response to insulin. The in vitro kinase assays suggest that the mediator for Fyn activation in adipocytes is an insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which activates Fyn through binding to the SH2 and SH3 domains of the kinase. While the identity of this specific insulin-receptor substrate protein has not been definitively shown, evidence suggests that this molecule may be c-Cbl.The unique conditions under which caveolin phosphorylation is observed suggest that the insulin receptor substrate responsible for the activation of caveolar Fyn would have several unique properties as follows: 1) phosphorylation showing specificity for insulin in adipocytes; 2) association with Fyn (through an SH2 domain interaction) in response to tyrosine phosphorylation; 3) translocation of the phosphorylated protein into caveolae in response to insulin; and 4) phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in the preadipocytes. Although the well characterized insulin receptor substrates IRS-1/-2 and Shc emerged as potential candidates (54Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 55Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), none fulfilled all of these requirements. In contrast, the proto-oncogene product c-Cbl shares many properties with this presumed substrate protein. Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Cbl in adipocytes, and this phosphorylation shows specificity for insulin in this cell type (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As has been observed in lymphocytes, Cbl constitutively binds to Fyn in unstimulated adipocytes through an SH3 domain-mediated interaction, and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl increases this association. The tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl in adipocytes binds specifically to fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Fyn but not other insulin-stimulated proteins such as SHP-2 or PI 3′-kinase. Cbl is translocated into caveolin-enriched Triton-insoluble complexes after insulin stimulation, and the Cbl in these complexes is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 8). Most interestingly, unlike the other known substrates of the insulin receptor such as IRS-1/-2 and Shc, Cbl phosphorylation is specific for the differentiated adipocyte phenotype (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The basis for the cell type specificity of Cbl phosphorylation is currently unknown. Cbl is expressed at comparable levels in both the preadipocytes and adipocytes. Unlike IRS-1/-2 and Shc, however, Cbl does not directly interact with the insulin receptor (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl may require a specific adapter protein (56Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which allows for the interaction of Cbl with the insulin receptor (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and that it is the regulation of the expression of this protein that accounts for the coordinate regulation of the phosphorylations of Cbl and caveolin in response to insulin in adipocytes. Although the model linking phosphorylation of Cbl to the phosphorylation of caveolin through the activation of Fyn is compelling, the exact relationship between these three proteins is likely to be complex (56Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, Cbl is likely to undergo processive phosphorylation after the activation of Fyn (42Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 57Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the insulin-dependent association of Cbl and Fyn in caveolae leads to the intriguing possibility that the Fyn/Cbl pathway may have a unique function in adipocytes (phosphorylation of caveolin) due to the localization of these proteins to specialized domains of the plasma membrane, the caveolae.The fact that caveolin expression and phosphorylation are regulated during adipocyte differentiation suggests an important role for caveolae in the differentiated adipocyte phenotype. An understanding of this role will lead to further insights into the general function of caveolae in cells and may lead to insights into the mechanisms of insulin-specific signal transduction. Like receptors for many growth factors, the insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that undergoes activation upon insulin binding, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific set of substrate proteins (1Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other growth factors, insulin acts as a mitogen in many cell types and therefore shares a number of signaling pathways with these growth factors (3Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). However, in adipocytes insulin increases glucose uptake and metabolism 10 to hundreds of fold, whereas growth factors such as PDGF 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; TIP, Triton-insoluble pellets; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; PI 3′-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; TIP, Triton-insoluble pellets; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; PI 3′-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. and EGF are without effect on these processes (4Robinson L.J.

This indicates that key regulators of metabolic pathways exist in adipocytes that respond uniquely to insulin signaling. Despite intensive investigation, the basis for this specificity remains largely unknown. One proposed mechanism for specificity in signal transduction involves the spatial compartmentalization of signaling proteins (8Mastick, C. C., Brady, M. J., Printen, J. A., Ribon, V., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). The specialized regions of the plasma membrane termed caveolae have been implicated in the segregation of signal initiation events (9Travis J.

Caveolae are small invaginations of the plasma membrane with unique protein and lipid compositions (9Travis J.

These structures have a characteristic striated coat, which is made up largely of the caveolins (10Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The basis for the cell type specificity of Cbl phosphorylation is currently unknown. Cbl is expressed at comparable levels in both the preadipocytes and adipocytes. Unlike IRS-1/-2 and Shc, however, Cbl does not directly interact with the insulin receptor (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl may require a specific adapter protein (56Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which allows for the interaction of Cbl with the insulin receptor (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and that it is the regulation of the expression of this protein that accounts for the coordinate regulation of the phosphorylations of Cbl and caveolin in response to insulin in adipocytes. Although the model linking phosphorylation of Cbl to the phosphorylation of caveolin through the activation of Fyn is compelling, the exact relationship between these three proteins is likely to be complex (56Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, Cbl is likely to undergo processive phosphorylation after the activation of Fyn (42Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 57Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the insulin-dependent association of Cbl and Fyn in caveolae leads to the intriguing possibility that the Fyn/Cbl pathway may have a unique function in adipocytes (phosphorylation of caveolin) due to the localization of these proteins to specialized domains of the plasma membrane, the caveolae.The fact that caveolin expression and phosphorylation are regulated during adipocyte differentiation suggests an important role for caveolae in the differentiated adipocyte phenotype. An understanding of this role will lead to further insights into the general function of caveolae in cells and may lead to insights into the mechanisms of insulin-specific signal transduction. The ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and storage of glucose as glycogen and lipid is significantly increased after adipocyte differentiation.2 Differentiation leads to an increase in the expression of the enzymes involved in the storage of glucose as lipid and glycogen. However, the increase in the responsiveness of these pathways to insulin cannot be fully accounted for by the combined increases in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and the increased levels of expression of these enzymes after differentiation. 3A. R. Saltiel, M. J. Brady, D. Lazar, and C. C. Mastick, unpublished observations. This indicates that the metabolic signaling pathways stimulated by insulin may be up-regulated by differentiation as well. Many of the signaling pathways stimulated by insulin are shared by other growth factors, such as EGF and PDGF. However, insulin stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes, whereas EGF and PDGF have little effect on these processes. Interestingly, caveolin-1 is specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin. Despite the presence of receptors for other growth factors such as PDGF or EGF on adipocytes, caveolin phosphorylation does not occur in response to these other ligands (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin is also differentiation-dependent in 3T3-L1 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite comparable levels of expression of active insulin receptors and caveolin in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, stimulation of the insulin receptor is uncoupled from the phosphorylation of caveolin in the preadipocytes. This suggests that caveolin is not a direct substrate of the insulin receptor and that other proteins are required for this phosphorylation. We have previously shown (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) that caveolin copurifies with a caveolin-tyrosine kinase in low density Triton-insoluble complexes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes from both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. Although there was no detectable insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these complexes, the Src family kinase Fyn was highly enriched in the caveolar fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (36Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fyn copurifies with caveolin in low density Triton-insoluble complexes from both preadipocytes and adipocytes (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, overexpression of wild type Fyn caused an increase in basal caveolin phosphorylation, as well as hyperphosphorylation of caveolin after insulin stimulation in the adipocytes (Figs. 5 and 6). However, there was no effect of Fyn overexpression on caveolin phosphorylation in the preadipocytes. Preadipocytes and adipocytes both express significant levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin, and the caveolin kinase Fyn. However, only in the adipocytes does activation of the insulin receptor lead to the phosphorylation of caveolin. The data imply the presence of a mediator required for the segregated activation of Fyn in caveolae, the activity of which is critically dependent on adipocyte differentiation. There was no change in the association or tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn in the caveolin-enriched fractions in response insulin in either adipocytes or preadipocytes (Fig. 7), indicating that direct modifications of Fyn phosphorylation are not involved in the activation of this kinase in response to insulin. The in vitro kinase assays suggest that the mediator for Fyn activation in adipocytes is an insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which activates Fyn through binding to the SH2 and SH3 domains of the kinase. While the identity of this specific insulin-receptor substrate protein has not been definitively shown, evidence suggests that this molecule may be c-Cbl. The unique conditions under which caveolin phosphorylation is observed suggest that the insulin receptor substrate responsible for the activation of caveolar Fyn would have several unique properties as follows: 1) phosphorylation showing specificity for insulin in adipocytes; 2) association with Fyn (through an SH2 domain interaction) in response to tyrosine phosphorylation; 3) translocation of the phosphorylated protein into caveolae in response to insulin; and 4) phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in the preadipocytes. Although the well characterized insulin receptor substrates IRS-1/-2 and Shc emerged as potential candidates (54Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 55Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), none fulfilled all of these requirements. In contrast, the proto-oncogene product c-Cbl shares many properties with this presumed substrate protein. Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Cbl in adipocytes, and this phosphorylation shows specificity for insulin in this cell type (53Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As has been observed in lymphocytes, Cbl constitutively binds to Fyn in unstimulated adipocytes through an SH3 domain-mediated interaction, and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl increases this association. The tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl in adipocytes binds specifically to fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Fyn but not other insulin-stimulated proteins such as SHP-2 or PI 3′-kinase. Cbl is translocated into caveolin-enriched Triton-insoluble complexes after insulin stimulation, and the Cbl in these complexes is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 8). Most interestingly, unlike the other known substrates of the insulin receptor such as IRS-1/-2 and Shc, Cbl phosphorylation is specific for the differentiated adipocyte phenotype (53Ribon V.

Further screening with individual sera from 20 cockroach-allergic patients and 4 non-allergic controls by plaque immunoassay revealed that the protein encoded by cDNA clone bg16 bound IgE Ab from 70% of the patients, but not from control sera. This protein was designatedB. germanica allergen, 5 or Bla g 5, in keeping with the current allergen nomenclature (22King T.P. Hoffman D. Lowenstein H. Marsh D.G. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Thomas W. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1994; 105: 224-233Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Double stranded sequencing of clone bg16 was carried out by dideoxynucleotide chain termination with a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The sequence was compared with the National Biomedical Research Foundation, Swiss-Prot, and GenBank data bases using FASTA, and the results revealed that the protein encoded by cDNA clone bg16 shared sequence homology with the GST. Sequence alignments were performed using the GCG program. B. germanica GST was purified from cockroach whole body extract by chromatography over glutathione-Sepharose. A B. germanicawhole body extract containing 289 mg of protein/ml was prepared from 12 g of cockroach, as described previously (24Pollart S.M. Vailes L.V. Mullins D.E. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Sutherland W.M. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 511-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The extract (1.3 ml) was passed over a 0.5-ml glutathione-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ), and B. germanica GST was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. After dialysis, further purification was carried out using a Superdex 75 HR10/20 size-exclusion column (Pharmacia). To assess purity, B. germanica GST was analyzed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE, using a PhastSystem (Pharmacia). The amino acid sequence of 35 NH2-terminal residues (spanning residues 1–38) was determined by Edman degradation. Recombinant B. germanica GST was expressed as a non-fusion protein using the pET21a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). A 973-base pair DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for B. germanica GST was generated by polymerase chain reaction. Ten nucleotides were added at the 5′-end, encoding the initiation Met and the first three NH2-terminal amino acid residues (Ala-Pro-Ser) lacking in the original cDNA. Primers for polymerase chain reaction were designed as follows: ′- GGAATTCCATATGGCACCGTCTTATAAACTGACATAC-3′ (sense), containing an NdeI restriction site, and 5′-CTGTTGATTTTAGGAAGTCAT-3′ (antisense), downstream from a HindIII site in the 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 922–927). The 973-base pair polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was ligated intoNdeI-HindIII digested pET-21(a) vector. Expression of the 23-kDa B. germanica GST was induced inE. coli strain BL21(DE3) with 1 mmisopropyl-1thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, and recombinant protein was purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose (yield typically 3–4 mg/liter of culture). Recombinant B. germanica GST was analyzed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the five NH2-terminal residues was confirmed by Edman degradation. IgE Ab to natural and recombinant B. germanica GST were compared using an antigen-binding RIA (25Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 587-592PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 and 20 μg of natural and recombinant B. germanica GST were labeled with 0.5 mCi of 125I, using the chloramine T technique (specific activity, 35 and 23 μCi/μg), respectively. Serum samples diluted 1:2 and 1:10 were incubated with either125I-labeled allergen (∼100,000 cpm added) for 4 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of sheep anti-human IgE (The Binding Site, San Diego, CA), using IgE myeloma serum (patient P. S.) diluted 1:200 as a carrier. Precipitates were counted in a γ-counter following washing with BBS. Quantitation of both assays was carried out using a control curve, constructed with serum from patient I. H., assigned to contain 1,000 units/ml IgE Ab. A direct binding ELISA was also developed for measuring IgE Ab to recombinant B. germanica GST. Antigen was coated to a microtiter plate (0.5 μg/well) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS-Tween and serum samples diluted 1:2 and 1:10 in horse serum were added for 1–2 h, after blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgE and the ABTS substrate system (26Smith A.M. Chapman M.D. Mol.

Four non-allergic control subjects were also studied. The enzymatic activity of B. germanica GST was assessed using the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) substrate and compared with the activity of rat liver glutathione S-transferase (Sigma). The absorbance was monitored at 340 nm and activity was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 9.6 mm−1(27Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol.

The 1,140-base pair sequence contains a 600-base pair open reading frame, encoding a 200-residue polypeptide. A stop codon (TAA) was found at position 603. NH2-terminal sequencing of the natural protein revealed that the sequence encoding the initiation methionine and the first three amino-terminal residues (Ala-Pro-Ser) were lacking from the original cDNA clone (Fig.2).

These enzymes catalyze the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of reduced glutathione to organic compounds, and their active site contains two binding sites, one for glutathione (G-site) and one substrate binding (H-site). Five different gene families encode GST, including four classes of cytosolic enzymes referred to as alpha, mu, pi, and theta, and a class of microsomal enzymes. The highest degree of homology was found with the GST-2 subfamily of insect GST from Anopheles gambiae(51.5%), Musca domestica (housefly) (47.8%), Drosophila melanogaster (46.8%), and Manduca sexta(tobacco hornworm) (42.9%) (28Franciosa H.

Significant homology was also found with other GST including human, rat, and mite GST (Fig.3). In particular, 18 of the 26 invariable residues identified in mammalian GST by x-ray crystallography were present in B. germanica GST, including Tyr-8, Gln-63, and Asp-97, which are involved in glutathione binding at the G-site of the molecule (17Wilce M.C.J.

Natural B. germanica GST was purified from whole body cockroach extract by glutathione affinity chromatography and size exclusion. The protein gave a single homogeneous band on silver-stained SDS-PAGE, with a molecular mass of 23 kDa (Fig.4 A). NH2-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated that the natural and deduced amino acid sequences were identical except for one amino acid substitution, Phe to Cys, at position 9 (Fig. 2). This substitution occurs in a hydrophobic region of the molecule next to one of the glutathione binding residues (Tyr-8). The mosquito and tobacco hornworm sequences also have Phe at position 9. The amino acid change from Cys (TGT) to Phe is a conservative substitution. The results imply that there are other isoform(s) of B. germanica GST with the Phe substitution at position 9. The yields of natural allergen from cockroach extracts were very low (0.002% of the protein in the cockroach extract). RecombinantB. germanica GST was produced as a non-fusion protein inE. coli, using the pET21a vector system, and purified from bacterial lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography. The pure protein migrated as a single 23-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 B). Following size exclusion chromatography, recombinantB. germanica GST eluted as a single peak with an estimated molecular mass of 46 kDa, suggesting that the recombinant protein may form a homodimer. The enzymatic activity of recombinant B. germanica GST was evaluated using the CDNB substrate. The CDNB conjugation activity of recombinant cockroach-GST was 0.05 μm/min/mg (mean of two experiments), which was very low, compared with the rat liver GST control (13.65 μm/min/mg, 273 times higher). Results of antigen binding RIA, using125I-labeled natural or recombinant B. germanicaGST, demonstrated that both proteins had excellent IgE Ab reactivityin vitro. IgE Ab binding to natural and recombinant B. germanica GST was found in 27/40 (67.5%) and 29/40 (72.5%) of patients' sera, respectively. There was a good correlation between IgE Ab binding to natural and recombinant GST (r = 0.67,p < 0.05, Fig.5 A), and between the RIA and ELISA for measuring IgE Ab (r = 0.79, p< 0.001, Fig. 5 B). Most patients who had IgE Ab to B. germanica GST also had IgG Ab to this allergen, as assessed by RIA. Only 3/40 patients had IgE Ab with no IgG Ab, and conversely only 1/40 had IgG Ab with no detectable IgE antibody. There was no significant correlation between levels of specific IgE and IgG antibodies (r = 0.41, p = 0.09, data not shown). Quantitative intradermal skin testing was used to evaluate the reactivity of recombinant B. germanica GSTin vivo. Five of the seven cockroach-allergic asthmatic patients who underwent skin testing showed a positive reaction (>8 × 8-mm wheel diameter) 15 min following the injection of 0.03 ml of B. germanica GST, at concentrations of 10−4-10−1μg/ml (TableI). All patients with IgE Ab to B. germanica GST also had IgE Ab to whole cockroach extract, and there was a good correlation between the levels of serum IgE Ab toB. germanica GST and the concentration of allergen giving a positive skin test reaction. Three non-allergic control subjects gave negative skin tests using B. germanica GST at a concentration of 1 μg/ml.Table ISkin tests and serum IgE antibodies to recombinant B. germanica allergen Bla g 5PatientSkin test to B. germanica 1-aWheal diameter on prick test or dilution of extract inducing an 8 × 8-mm wheal on intradermal test.Bla g 5Cockroach RASTSkin testSerum IgEunits/mlμg/mlcpm bound 1-bMeasured by antigen-binding RIA.J.

Open table in a new tab We have reported the identification, purification, molecular cloning, and sequencing of a glutathione S-transferase from the cockroach Blattella germanica. Although it was previously known that cockroach extracts contained GST activity (36Clark A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 1987; 86: 73-82Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), this is the first time that cockroach-GST has been purified and the structure of the molecule has been defined. Three pieces of evidence characterize the B. germanica protein as an important allergen and GST. First, the high prevalence of IgE Ab binding and potent biologic activity of the allergen in vivo(positive immediate skin tests to as little as 3 pg injected allergen). Second, the sequence homology to other GST, particularly those of insect origin (up to 51% sequence identity); and finally, the ability to bind glutathione, allowing purification of both natural and recombinant cockroach-GST. Sequence analysis has shown that insect GST can be classified into two distinct groups, GST-1 and GST-2 (28Franciosa H. Bergé J.B. Insect Biochem. Mol.

The GST-1 enzymes have higher identity to cytosolic mammalian theta and alpha GST classes, whereas GST-2 are more similar to the pi and mu classes, and are antigenically distinct from GST-1. Based on the degree of sequence homology, B. germanica GST has been assigned to the GST-2 subfamily. An intriguing aspect of our results was that, contrary to other insect GST, the B. germanica GST showed low activity against the CDNB substrate. This could imply that B. germanica GST has higher affinity against substrates other than CDNB, or may have unusual substrate specificity. B. germanica may also produce other GST isoenzymes with higher CDNB activity than the Bla g 5 allergen. Insect GST are thought to play an important physiologic role in the detoxification of foods and other substances ingested by cockroach. Up-regulation of GST production in insects is associated with resistance to insecticides (particularly organophosphorates) (38Fournier D. Bride J.M. Poirie M. Bergé J.-B. Plapp Jr., F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1840-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43Hayaoka T. Dauterman W.C. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 17: 113-119Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 44Ottea J.A.

Our findings that B. germanica GST is a potent allergen suggest that attempts to control cockroach populations in the homes of allergic patients could, paradoxically, lead to increased GST expression and environmental allergen exposure. Infestation of housing with cockroach can be difficult to control and often requires prolonged treatments with insecticides. The effect of these treatments on cockroach allergen levels are not known. The implication of our results is that insecticide treatments could increase exposure to the GST allergen which in turn could lead to increased risk of allergic symptoms. This hypothesis could be investigated by monitoring B. germanica GST levels in the environment. It has been reported that a house dust mite (D. pteronyssinus) allergen, Der p 8, which reacts with IgE Ab in sera from ∼40% mite allergic patients, is a GST (20O'Neill G.M. Donovan G.R. Baldo B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition,S. mansoni GST, a promising candidate for a vaccine against schistosomiasis, induces IgE and IgA Ab, which are thought to be beneficial in reducing parasitic infection (21Capron M.

IgE Ab responses to schistosomes may protect against human infection and vaccination with S. mansoni GST has been associated with reduced egg production and resistance to infection (in animal models). The degree of sequence homology of D. pteronyssinus GST andS. mansoni GST with B. germanica GST is low (27 and 26.2%, respectively). However, the three-dimensional structures of the alpha, mu, and pi mammalian GST classes (sharing only ∼30% sequence identity) have been recently determined by x-ray crystallography and these proteins have similar folding topology (17Wilce M.C.J.

Diagnosis of cockroach allergy is carried out by immediate skin testing or serologic assays for IgE Ab, using extracts of ground cockroach bodies that are not standardized. Production of highly purified recombinant allergens will enable these reagents to be used for diagnostic purposes. A mixture of recombinant cockroach allergens will be required, based on the fact that multiple allergens cause IgE Ab responses. There is a high prevalence of IgE Ab to Bla g 2 (60%), Bla g 4 (40–60%), and Bla g 5 (GST, 70%) among cockroach-allergic patients (12Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Mann B.J. Shannon J. Fox J.W. Vedvick T.S.

Each of these allergens is an important cause of sensitization to cockroach and preliminary comparisons show that thein vivo purified allergens give positive skin test reactions at 10−3-10−5 μg/ml (49Chapman M.D. Smith A.M. Vailes L.D. Arruda L.K. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 102-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Serologic analyses of ∼40 sera suggest that measuring IgE Ab to Bla g 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, and Bla g 5 will demonstrate sensitization in 95% of B. germanica allergic patients. 2L. K. Arruda, unpublished data. Bla g 2 and Bla g 4 are not expressed in P. americana and recent results showed that P. americana extracts did not inhibit IgE Ab binding to Bla g 5 in RIA (12Arruda L.K.

Thus if P. americanaproduces a GST allergen, it is a different isoform or GST class toB. germanica GST. We have recently cloned the cross-reactive Bla g 1 homologue from P. americana (Per a 1) and this allergen, in addition to Per a 3, could be used for diagnosis of sensitization to Periplaneta species (14Wu C.H.

Over the last few years, the primary structure of most major allergens has been determined and there do no appear to be particular structural features in these molecules that selectively induce IgE Ab responses (50Stewart G.A.

However, this enzyme appears to be a unique GST, with no significant sequence homology to other members of the GST family. The possibility that cockroach-GST may potentiate IgE Ab responses in the airways through its enzymatic activity could be investigated using site-directed mutagenesis to modify cockroach-GST at conserved residues involved in binding glutathione. In summary, we have reported the identification and cloning of a majorB. germanica allergen Bla g 5, which is a member of the GST superfamily. Recombinant cockroach GST has been produced inE. coli, with comparable immunologic activity to the natural protein. Results of these studies will lead to better approaches to control environmental exposure to this ubiquitous insect, including the development of GST inhibitors. In addition, cockroach-GST will provide a model for studying both the cellular and IgE Ab responses to GST and for establishing the role of these proteins in the development of asthma and other allergic diseases. We thank Dr. Gordon Rule for assistance with the GST enzymatic assay and Dr. Judy Mollett for helpful discussions. We are also grateful to Drs. Larry Gelber, Susan Squillace, Robert Call, and Peter Heymann for kindly providing sera from cockroach-allergic patients."

Furthermore, this small protein has been implicated as an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that it may play multiple regulatory roles within the cell. Covalent cross-linking of both dynein and myosin V using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene revealed that this light chain exists as a dimer in situ. This observation was confirmed using two additional amine-selective cross-linking reagents (dimethyl pimelimidate and disuccinimidyl suberate). When expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein, the presence of the light chain caused the recombinant molecule to dimerize. Analysis of fusions containing truncated light chains identified the predicted amphiphilic helix (residues 14–32) as sufficient to cause dimerization; cross-linking required a second helical segment (residues 33–46). Together the data presented suggest that two light chains interact to form a parallel dimeric structure.

Likewise, this polypeptide is associated with at least two distinct components of the Chlamydomonasflagellar axoneme. There are 8–10 copies of this protein within the outer dynein arm (8Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. 1982; 2: 525-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); this fraction is absent in axonemes derived from mutants that lack this structure (9Luck D.J.L. Piperno G. Warner F.D. Satir P. Gibbons I.R. Cell Movement, Vol. 1. The Dynein ATPases. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 49-60Google Scholar), and it may be extracted from wild-type axonemes with 0.6 m NaCl. The second flagellar fraction, which accounts for ∼50% of the total axonemalM r 8,000 LC, 1The abbreviations used are: LC, light chain; HC, heavy chain; IC, intermediate chain; DFDNB, 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; DMP, dimethyl pimelimidate; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; MBP, maltose-binding protein; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase. is tightly integrated into the axonemal superstructure, is present in outer armless mutants, and is not released by salt treatment. 2S. E. Benashski, A. Harrison, and S. M. King, unpublished observations. Recent biochemical analysis of the unconventional actin-based motor myosin V from chick brain identified four distinct LCs as stoichiometric components of that complex (10Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E.

Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar). One LC of 10 kDa is apparently identical to the M r 8,000 dynein LC and is present at a stoichiometry of two LCs per myosin V particle (11Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Suter D.M. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar). Thus both actin- and microtubule-based molecular motors share a common subunit. This observation has raised the possibility that theM r 8,000 LC is involved in targeting or regulatory events common to these distinct motor enzymes (11Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Suter D.M. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar). Considering the multiple pools of this highly conserved LC that are present in whole brain extracts and in flagellar axonemes, it is possible that this protein is employed by a wide variety of cellular systems in a manner analogous to calmodulin. This latter hypothesis has recently received a boost from the observation that theM r 8,000 LC interacts with the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in a yeast two-hybrid system (12Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the LC in transfected cells caused down-regulation of nNOS activity; in vitro this occurred through a LC-mediated conversion of the active nNOS dimer to a monomeric inactive form. Considering the variety and importance of the systems in which theM r 8,000 LC has been implicated and the differences in stoichiometry observed between flagellar outer arm dynein and cytoplasmic dynein/myosin V, it has become of some interest to determine the solution behavior and intermolecular associations of this molecule as they may well provide important clues as to potential function(s). In this report, we demonstrate that theM r 8,000 LC is a homodimeric protein within both dynein and myosin V, and the data presented define both the interaction domain and orientation of the dimer. The results narrow considerably the possible roles for this molecule in dynein/myosin V function and suggest a mechanism by which this protein might interact with nNOS to dissociate that enzyme complex and thus affect enzymatic activity. The in-frame fusion of theM r 8,000 LC (U19490) with maltose-binding protein in the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was described in King and Patel-King (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For this study, various smaller portions of the molecule lacking discrete predicted secondary structural elements were obtained using the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned across the XmnI and XbaI sites of pMal-c2. All constructs were sequenced prior to protein production. The LC coding sequence also was subcloned into the pET-16b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) across the NdeI and BamHI sites. This resulted in the C-terminal fusion of the LC to a His10 tag that is separated from the LC by a factor Xa cleavage site. Flagella were obtained fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii strain 1132D(−) and demembranated with Nonidet P-40 as described previously (13King S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Outer arm dynein was extracted with 0.6 m NaCl and purified by sedimentation in a 5–20% sucrose density gradient (15King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Purified rat brain cytoplasmic dynein and chicken brain myosin V were the generous gifts of Drs. Kevin Pfister (University of Virginia Health Science Center) and Foued Espindola (Yale University), respectively. The recombinant LC expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein was purified by amylose affinity chromatography as described previously (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the LC was separated from the fusion partner by digestion with factor Xa, which cleaves immediately prior to the first Met residue within the LC. The His10-tagged LC was purified by affinity chromatography on a chelated Ni2+ column. The 1 m imidazole buffer used for elution of the protein from the column was removed by dialysis prior to use. Flagellar axonemes and sucrose gradient-purified outer arm dynein were prepared in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmEDTA, 25 mm KCl, and treated for 60 min with 0–50 mm 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB; Pierce). The cross-linking reagent was dissolved in methanol, and all samples (including controls) contained a final methanol concentration of 10% (v/v). Cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Pierce) was performed under identical conditions as for DFDNB, except that the solvent was dimethyl formamide. For reaction with dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP; Pierce), samples were exchanged into 100 mmtriethanolamine, pH 8.2. All reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 250 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8. Cross-linking of fusion proteins, cytoplasmic dynein, and myosin V was performed in a similar manner. Denatured proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 5–15% acrylamide gradient SDS-containing gels as described previously (15King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or were blotted to nitrocellulose in 10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mmNa2CO3, 0.01% SDS, 20% methanol. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with affinity-purified antibody R4058 that specifically reacts with the M r 8,000 LC (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Antibody reactivity was assessed following incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL; Amersham Corp.). The solution molecular weights of the fusion proteins were determined by native gel electrophoresis using the method of Hedrick and Smith (16Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in a series of gels of different acrylamide concentration and the retardation coefficients (K R ) derived from the negative slope of 100 (log(R F ·100)) versus gel percentage. Molecular mass standards used were jack bean urease (545,000-Da hexamer and 272,000-Da trimer), bovine serum albumin (132,000-Da dimer, 66,000-Da monomer), ovalbumin (45,000 Da), bovine carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), and α-lactalbumin (14,200 Da). A plot of logK R versus log M rfor these proteins yielded a standard curve from which the molecular weight of the unknowns could be determined directly. The concentration of the purified His10-tagged LC was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 1,280 and 5,690 liters·mol−1·cm−1 for Tyr and Trp residues, respectively (17Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the sample was recorded between 190 and 300 nm using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) was determined, and the approximate α helical content was calculated based on a value of [θ]222 = 30,000 degrees·cm2·dmol−1 for a completely helical molecule. To investigate the protein-protein associations in which theM r 8,000 LC is involved within dynein, we tested a series of cross-linking reagents for their ability to covalently attach the LC to other dynein/axonemal components. Cross-linked products were detected immunologically using a previously characterized highly specific polyclonal antibody (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Initially, the amine-reactive homobifunctional aryl halide DFDNB was found to yield discrete cross-linked products containing this LC (see Fig.1 a for a generalized reaction scheme). This reagent spans a distance of only 3 Å and thus can only cross-link residues that are in close proximity to each other. Treatment of Chlamydomonas axonemes with 0.1–50 mm DFDNB resulted in considerable intraaxonemal cross-linking as evidenced by the gradual disappearance of discrete protein bands and the appearance of very high molecular weight material that did not enter the gel (Fig. 1 b, upper panel). Immunological analysis of these samples with the R4058 antibody identified a single additional band ofM r ∼20,000 that contained theM r 8,000 LC (Fig. 1 b, lower panel). Two additional amine-selective cross-linking reagents that rely on different chemistries were then used to confirm this result (Fig. 2). Treatment of axonemes with both DMP and DSS resulted in formation of the M r∼20,000 product. Note that the yields obtained with these reagents, which can span approximately three times the distance of DFDNB, were significantly enhanced over that obtained with DFDNB. Presumably, this reflects either less severe orientation constraints or enhanced reactivity of the reagents. With DSS, and to a lesser extent with DMP, minor amounts of products migrating between theM r 8,000 and 20,000 bands were obtained. The origin of these minor bands remains uncertain, although they may well represent uncross-linked protein/reagent adducts of altered charge. To determine whether the M r ∼20,000 band represents the cross-linking of the M r 8,000 LC to another dynein component or to some other axonemal structure, cross-linking reactions were performed using sucrose gradient-purified outer arm dynein (Fig. 3). TheM r ∼20,000 band was again observed in DFDNB-, DMP-, and DSS-treated dynein samples, indicating that it indeed derives from an intradynein cross-linking event. The small apparentM r of this band made it very unlikely to contain other dynein LCs and suggested that the product derived from cross-linking between two of the 8–10 copies of theM r 8,000 LC that are present within the outer arm dynein. This hypothesis is further supported by the high yields of cross-linked product obtained with DMP and DSS; no other dynein component is present within the purified particle at a stoichiometry sufficient to account for the amount of product generated. With DMP, two electrophoretic variants of the dimeric product were clearly evident (Fig. 3, lower panel). Increasing the cross-linker concentration resulted in the conversion of the faster migrating species to a slower form. This observation supports the idea that protein/reagent adducts are being formed that exhibit altered electrophoretic mobility due to the loss of primary amines through reaction with the reagent. To further analyze the hypothesis that the M r8,000 protein exists as a dimer in situ, purified samples of cytoplasmic dynein and myosin V, both of which are known to contain two copies of the LC per particle (4King S.M.

Cheney R.E. King S.M. Suter D.M. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar) but which share no other common components, were treated with DFDNB. Reaction of cytoplasmic dynein with 1 mm DFDNB resulted in the complete conversion of the HC to a larger aggregate that did not enter the gel (Fig.4 a). In contrast, the amount of IC74 present was little affected. Immunological analysis of DFDNB-treated cytoplasmic dynein with the R4058 antibody again revealed a single additional band migrating at M r∼20,000 (Fig. 4 c, left panel). With myosin V, DFDNB cross-linking resulted in loss of the HC but not calmodulin (Fig.4 b), and in the generation of both theM r ∼20,000 band and a second band ofM r ∼23,000 (Fig. 4 c, right panel). The former band comigrated with theM r ∼20,000 band from cytoplasmic dynein; the origin of the latter is unclear. To determine whether the M r 8,000 LC can indeed dimerize, it was expressed in vitro as a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP). In this construction, the LC is separated from MBP by a short (∼16 residues) hydrophilic linker that terminates in a factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR). The native molecular weight of both MBP-LC and the MBP-linker moiety obtained following factor Xa digestion were determined using the method of Hedrick and Smith (16Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The calculated mass of the MBP-linker protein is 42,469 Da, and this molecule migrated in native gels with an apparent mass of 44,150 Da. Therefore, the native MBP-linker protein is monomeric. Addition of the 10.3-kDa LC to MBP yields a fusion protein with a calculated mass of 52,773 Da. This protein migrated with a native molecular mass of 94,400 Da, strongly suggesting that the fusion protein is dimeric in solution. Furthermore, treatment of the native MBP-LC fusion protein with 0.5 mmDFDNB resulted in significant intermolecular covalent cross-linking such that ∼50% of the fusion protein migrated atM r ∼100,000 following denaturation; MBP alone remained monomeric under the same conditions (not shown). These data indicate that the LC does indeed dimerize in vitro and that this interaction may be stabilized by treatment with DFDNB. Previous secondary structure analysis (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) identified two segments of the molecule that have a very high probability (>90%) of being α helical (residues 14–32 and 34–46); the former section is amphiphilic and therefore is a candidate to mediate protein-protein interactions (18Kaiser E.T. Kézdy F.J. Science. 1984; 223: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In addition, that analysis also identified a region (residues 80–88) near the C terminus that had a lower probability (∼50%) of being helical. Thus, the M r 8,000 LC was predicted to contain ∼30–45% α helix. To assess the α helical content of the M r 8,000 LC, the His10-tagged molecule was purified, and the CD spectrum between 190 and 300 nm was recorded (Fig.6). The spectrum clearly shows significant α helical content as evidenced by the negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm (see Brahms and Brahms (19Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) for reference spectra). From [θ]222 measurements the molecule is calculated to contain approximately 30% helix after adjustment for the contribution of the His10 tag to the random coil component. This analysis provides support for the previous prediction that the region encompassing residues 14–46 is indeed helical. To determine whether all or part of this helical region represents the dimerization interface and to assess which part(s) of the molecule were involved in the DFDNB-mediated cross-linking reaction, a series of truncated LCs were prepared as C-terminal fusions with MBP (Fig.7). These truncations were designed so as to remove discrete elements of predicted secondary structure (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The native molecular weight of each fusion protein was assessed as described above, and each protein also was treated with DFDNB to determine whether it was competent to undergo covalent cross-linking. The properties of the various fusion proteins are tabulated in TableI.Table IProperties of MBP fusion proteins containing truncated LCsMBP-LC constructLC residues presentCalculated molecular weight of fusion proteinNative molecular weight of fusion proteinDFDNB cross-linkOligomeric stateM rM rLC1 –9152,77394,400YesDimerLCΔ114 –9151,545n.k.1-aThe LCΔ1-LCΔ3 fusion proteins appeared to form high molecular weight structures under native conditions. n.k., not known.Yesn.k.LCΔ233 –9149,506n.k. 1-aThe LCΔ1-LCΔ3 fusion proteins appeared to form high molecular weight structures under native conditions. n.k., not known.Non.k.LCΔ346 –9147,955n.k. 1-aThe LCΔ1-LCΔ3 fusion proteins appeared to form high molecular weight structures under native conditions. n.k., not known.Non.k.LCΔ41 –4647,45090,150YesDimerLCΔ51 –3345,89987,100NoDimerLCΔ614 –4646,072 83,2001-bA second population of the LCΔ6 protein which migrated as a monomer was also evident in nondenaturing gels.YesDimerMBP-linker042,46944,150NoMonomer1-a The LCΔ1-LCΔ3 fusion proteins appeared to form high molecular weight structures under native conditions. n.k., not known.1-b A second population of the LCΔ6 protein which migrated as a monomer was also evident in nondenaturing gels. Open table in a new tab The LCΔ4 and LCΔ5 fusion proteins migrated with native molecular masses close to 90 kDa, indicating that both contain a functional dimerization domain. As these molecules share only the region from residues 1 to 33, the interaction domain must be located within this section. Only the LCΔ4 protein yielded a DFDNB-cross-linked product, suggesting that the second helical segment (residues 33–46) was required for this reaction to occur. To assess if dimerization was due solely to the amphiphilic helical domain or whether the N-terminal 13 residues also plays a role in LC-LC interactions, an additional fusion protein (LCΔ6) containing LC residues 14–46 was constructed. Approximately 50% of this protein migrated as a dimer in native gels (see Table I); the remainder appeared monomeric. Furthermore, this protein yielded a complex ofM r ∼100,000 when treated with DFDNB, indicating that cross-linking did not involve the N-terminal 13 residues; the dimerization helix (residues 14–32) itself does not contain any Lys or Arg residues and thus cannot be involved directly in the cross-linking reaction. These data demonstrate that the LCΔ6 protein contains both the dimerization and cross-linking sites and further indicate that the N terminus is not essential for either property. Native molecular weight estimates could not be obtained for constructs LCΔ1-LCΔ3. These proteins share the C-terminal domain (residues 46–91) and appeared to form large aggregates in solution. DFDNB cross-linking yielded significant product only for LCΔ1, presumably because this protein is the only one that has the potential to interact via the dimerization domain and thus bring together the cross-linking sites (residues 33–46) with the correct orientation. Combined, the properties of the truncated LC fusion proteins indicate that the amphiphilic helical region between residues 14 and 32 is sufficient to cause dimerization of the protein to which it is attached; this domain appears to be at least partly stabilized by the N-terminal residues 1–13. Furthermore, the data are completely consistent with the hypothesis that DFDNB cross-linking occurs solely between amines located in the second helical segment (residues 33 and 46). The M r 8,000 LC first identified within theChlamydomonas outer dynein arm (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is one of the most highly conserved proteins known (92% identity between the nematode and human proteins). This molecule is an integral stoichiometric component of both flagellar outer arm and brain cytoplasmic dyneins (4King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J.

Cell Motil. 1982; 2: 525-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and also of the actin-based motor, myosin V (11Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Suter D.M. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar). In addition, this small protein has been implicated in the regulation of nNOS activity (12Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and furthermore, is clearly present in several other biochemically distinct compartments where its associations are as yet unknown (4King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).2 In this report we have provided evidence to indicate that this polypeptide exists as a dimeric structure, both within dynein and myosin V, and also is of itself sufficient to cause dimerization of a recombinant fusion protein. As depicted in Fig. 8, there are five potential ways in which two LCs might interact to form a dimeric structure. Residues 14–33 are all that is required for formation of a dimeric protein. Thus, models that do not involve this region (possibilities c–e in Fig. 8) must be incorrect. For LCs interacting via the amphiphilic helix, there are two possible arrangements (a and b in Fig. 8) that derive from the parallel and antiparallel orientations of the LCs. In an attempt to differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined the DFDNB-mediated cross-linking of the MBP/LC fusion proteins. The data obtained indicate that the cross-linking site is located within the second helical segment between residues 33 and 46; this region contains four Lys residues (Lys33, Lys38, Lys45, and Lys46) that could provide the required primary amines. No other regions of the LC were consistently required for cross-linking, suggesting that the cross-link occurs between the same region within the two LCs. The amphiphilic dimerization helix (which is not cross-linked by DFDNB and has no Lys or Arg residues) contains ∼20 residues, which is equivalent to a length of ∼3 nm (an α helix has a rise of ∼1.5 Å per residue) (20Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, New York1991: 12-13Google Scholar), whereas the cross-linking reagent DFDNB can span a maximum distance of only ∼3 Å. Thus, it is unlikely that the LCs could become cross-linked by DFDNB if arranged in an antiparallel fashion as the cross-linking sites would be separated by a distance ∼10-fold greater than the size of the cross-linking reagent itself. Therefore, it is most likely that the M r 8,000 LC forms parallel dimers (see Fig. 8 b). As the other cross-linkers employed in this study (DMP and DSS) have linker lengths of 9.2 and 11.4 Å, respectively, the high yields obtained with these reagents also support a parallel arrangement for the LC dimer. Residues 14–32 of the LC are predicted to form an amphiphilic helix (3King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of this helix (not shown) reveals that one face contains a series of charged residues and is hydrophilic, whereas the other exposes a continuous stripe of hydrophobic side chains that proceed with a right-handed twist about the helix when viewed from the N to the C terminus. Docking simulations for a parallel dimer formed using this region predict that the helix must adopt a right-handed supercoil for LC-LC hydrophobic interactions within this region to account for dimerization. Both detergent-induced dissociation and cross-linking studies of Chlamydomonasouter arm dynein have suggested that the M r8,000 LC is located within the IC·LC complex and is therefore to be found at the base of the soluble dynein particle (21King S.M. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8401-8407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This prediction is supported by studies of dyneins from sea urchin and trout where the IC·LC complex may be isolated by low ionic strength dialyis and sucrose gradient centrifugation (23King S.M. Gatti J.-L. Moss A.G. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. 1990; 16: 266-278Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Tang W.-J.Y. Bell C.W. Sale W.S. Gibbons I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 508-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these systems, theM r 8,000 LC is separated from the HCs and migrates with the ICs at ∼7 S in sucrose gradients. Although the stoichiometry of these components has not been reported, it is clear from examination of published gels that the smallest LC 3The smallest LC within outer arm dynein from sperm of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is specifically recognized by an antibody (R4058) made against theChlamydomonas M r 8,000 LC (S. M. King and A. G. Moss, unpublished observations). is present at a significantly higher stoichiometry than the other LCs within the same particle (for examples, see Refs. 25Gatti J.-L. King S.M.

This is in clear contrast to the brain motors cytoplasmic dynein and myosin V, both of which contain 2 copies of the LC per motor particle (4King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S.

Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar). In cytoplasmic dynein, the LC is probably associated with the ICs at the base of the particle as it is in flagellar dynein, although there is as yet no direct evidence for this assertion. Proteolytic fractionation of myosin V (11Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Suter D.M. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 372aGoogle Scholar) has revealed that the twoM r 8,000 LCs associate with the C-terminal 80-kDa tail domain of that enzyme. Although theM r 8,000 protein is very highly conserved, sequence analysis reveals no overt similarities between the ICs of cytoplasmic and flagellar dynein and the myosin V tail domain. Thus, it remains unclear how the same LC dimer structure interacts with these disparate molecules. The parallel orientation of the two LCs within the dimer proposed here suggests several features. First, given the symmetric nature of the LC dimer, it likely binds between two common components, e.g. the two IC74 proteins in cytoplasmic dynein and the two HCs in myosin V. Second, the regions of the LC that interact with the other components of these motors are probably located within the C-terminal domain of the LC as essentially the entire N-terminal section of this small protein is required for efficient dimerization. The presence of 8–10 copies of the LC within Chlamydomonasouter arm dynein also raises intriguing possibilities. First, there may exist 4–5 dimer binding sites within the two distinct ICs (IC78 and IC69) of that dynein. However, the N-terminal domains of theChlamydomonas ICs show almost no relationship; functionally, this region of IC78 interacts with α-tubulin, whereas the analogous region of IC69 does not (27King S.M. Patel-King R.S. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of these ICs contain the related 5–6 copies of the WD (or Gβ)-repeat (28Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which are likely to be involved in the formation of a β-propeller-type structure (30Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Although it remains possible that the M r 8,000 LCs interact with individual blades of the β-propeller, the presence of a WD-repeat structure within IC74 of cytoplasmic dynein (29Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) does not allow this scenario to readily explain the observed difference in LC stoichiometry between the two dynein classes. An alternative possibility is that, within the flagellum, the LC dimers further associate to form higher order oligomers. This possibility is supported by our observation of several discrete multimeric forms of the MBP-LC protein following DFDNB cross-linking. In this scenario, the ICs of outer arm dynein would resemble those of cytoplasmic dynein in requiring only a single dimer-binding interface. This suggestion implies that additionalM r 8,000 LC binding site(s) exist within the axoneme. Indeed, such additional sites must be present, as ∼50% of the total M r 8,000 LC cannot be removed from theChlamydomonas axoneme under the standard extraction conditions that solubilize essentially all of the outer arm. Furthermore, similar amounts of the M r8,000 LC remain in axonemes obtained from mutants that completely lack (and never assembled) the outer arm itself. It will clearly be of considerable interest to identify the other axonemal component(s) with which this LC associates. A recent report (12Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) identified the M r 8,000 LC as interacting with nNOS in a yeast two-hybrid system and also in transfected mammalian cells. Further in vitro analysis revealed that the LC interacted with the nNOS dimer and caused that complex to dissociate into the inactive monomeric form. Thus, disruption of the nNOS complex by the LC led directly to inhibition of nNOS activity. This is potentially of great significance as NO levels are directly modulatedin vivo by the regulation of NOS activity at the site of synthesis. Secondary structure predictions (made using PHD) (32Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar) (not shown) for the region of nNOS (residues 163–245) which interacts with the LC (12Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) identified an amphiphilic segment that could contribute to dimerization of nNOS. This suggests that the M r8,000 LC may simply exert its effects on nNOS through binding of the amphiphilic dimerization helix of the LC to the similar domain within nNOS. This hypothesis predicts that the inactive form of nNOS consists of a single synthase protein with one copy of theM r 8,000 LC bound via LC residues 14–32. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that the highly conservedM r 8,000 LC found in dynein and myosin V exists as a parallel homodimeric structure. The data provide clues as to the role this molecule may play within these motor systems and suggest a potential mechanism to explain the down-regulation of nNOS activity by the LC. Further detailed structural/functional studies will undoubtedly lead to additional insight into the mechanism of action of this intriguing protein. We thank Drs. Kevin Pfister, Foued Espindola, and Anthony Moss for generously providing samples of cytoplasmic dynein, myosin V, and sea urchin dynein, respectively. We are also grateful to Drs.

Activation of a member of each family, namely the glucocorticoid receptor by glucocorticoids and Stat5 by prolactin, is required for the efficient induction of the expression of milk protein genes in the mammary epithelium.

Synergism depended on promoter regions containing intact binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor and Stat5. The carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains of Stat5a and Stat5b were not required for this synergism.

The stage-specific regulation of milk protein gene expression is controlled by the lactogenic hormones glucocorticoids and prolactin. Both hormones have been documented to synergistically induce the expression of these genes at the level of transcription initiation (1Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A mutation introduced into the Stat5-binding site has been shown to destroy the response of the promoter not only to prolactin but also to glucocorticoids (11Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Ball R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating that Stat5 is necessary for mediating the effects of prolactin and glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids do not significantly change the binding activity of MGF/Stat5 to lactogenic hormone response elements (12Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102PubMed Google Scholar), ruling out the possibility that they act synergistically with prolactin simply by enhancing the effect of prolactin on the activation of Stat5 DNA binding. In vitro binding studies with purified preparations of the glucocorticoid receptor revealed the presence of multiple GR-binding sites in the lactogenic response elements of the rat β-casein gene promoter (13Welte T. Philipp S. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Doppler W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the proximal mouse whey acidic protein gene promoter (13Welte T. Philipp S. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Doppler W. J. Steroid Biochem.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1328-1335PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, only sequence motifs resembling half-palindromic GR-binding sites were contained within the footprinted regions. Transactivation mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor usually requires the binding of dimeric receptor molecules to palindromic DNA-binding sites (15Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar, 16Truss M. Chalepakis G. Slater E.P. Mader S. Beato M. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas half-sites binding monomeric GR complexes have been reported to be insufficient by themselves to confer hormone responsiveness (17Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Tremblay S. Lavender P. Schmidt T.J. de Léan A. Nemer M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, monomeric GR molecules binding to receptor half-palindromic sites were proposed to gain competence as transcriptional activators by interacting with other transcription factors (18Slater E.P. Hesse H. Müller J.M. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether GR molecules binding to half-palindromic sites in the rat β-casein gene promoter can functionally interact with MGF/Stat5 in the activation of milk protein gene transcription. COS-7 cells were employed in transient co-transfection assays using wild-type and mutated β-casein gene promoter CAT constructs. These cells allow the reconstitution of prolactin-dependent signaling cascades by transfection of prolactin receptor and Stat5 expression vectors (19Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). They also can be used to study the synergy between Stat5 and GR in cotransfection experiments (20Stöcklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that GR half-palindromic sites serve to recruit GR molecules to the β-casein gene promoter and are instrumental for mediating the synergistic effect between glucocorticoids and prolactin. Experiments with stably transfected HC11 mammary epithelial cells, which do not overexpress Stat5 and GR molecules, lead to the same conclusion. Efficient transactivation by GR molecules was dependent on the activation and binding of Stat5 to its recognition site. Interestingly, transactivation was also possible with Stat5 molecules devoid of their carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain. β-Casein gene promoter constructs with mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor half-sites were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using the protocol of Deng and Nickoloff (21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The β-casein CAT promoter gene pβc(−344/−1)CAT was used as a template (22Doppler W. Höck W. Hofer P. Groner B. Ball R.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The selection primer for introducing the first mutation was 5′-CCCCGGGTACAGATCTCGAATTCGT-3′. It destroys the uniqueSacI and KpnI cutting sites, replacing them with a BglII site. For a second round of mutation, the primer 5′-GGATCGATCCTCGAGTACAGATCT-3′ was used. It destroys the uniqueSmaI site and creates a novel XhoI site. The primers used for introducing mutations into the GR sites (in parentheses) were: 5′-CCTTGTTTAAGCTTCCCCAGAATT-3′ (mGRc), 5′-TTTCTAATCAAGCTTACTTCTTGGA-3′ (mGRd), 5′TTGGAATTAACAGACTTTTGAA3′ (mGRe), and 5′-TTTCTAATCAAGCTTACTTCTTGGAATTAACAGACTTTTGAA-3′ (mGRd and mGRe). For mutations in the GR sites of footprints a and b the Quick Change™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol of Stratagene was used. The upper strands of the oligonucleotides employed were: 5′-GGCTGGGGAGAATTCTGATGACTGTTTACTAGGCTGGAG-3′ (mGRa); 5′-GGCTGGAGAGAATTCCAGTTATTTGACAATTTCCTTTCC-3′ (mGRa/b); 5′-CAATTTCCTTTCCTTGACGAATTCCTTCACCAGCTTCTG-3′ (mGRb). The construct with the mutation of the MGF/Stat5 site and the heterologous β-casein gene thymidine kinase (tk) promoter CAT constructs employed have been described (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The construct pMMTV-CAT was prepared by inserting a 1.3-kilobase pair PstI/BamHI fragment, spanning the region from −1187 to +102 of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat, into the 5′ polylinker of pBLCAT3 (24Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The constitutively active luciferase expression vector pAGLuE5, driven by the SV40 early promoter, was provided by Dr. T. Schlake. Stat5 expression vectors were constructed by insertion of Stat5a and Stat5b cDNA cloned from a mouse mammary gland λ ZAP library 2T. Welte, unpublished data. into pECE (25Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The carboxylterminally deleted forms of Stat5a and Stat5b were prepared by introducing a stop codon at amino acid 738 position of Stat5a and the corresponding position (amino acid 742) of Stat5b. The rat glucocorticoid expression vector PSTC GR 3–795 (26Severne Y. Wieland S. Schaffner W. Rusconi S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) contains the cDNA of the rat glucocorticoid receptor encoding amino acids 3–795. COS-7 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. HC11 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Prior to hormone treatment, HC11 cells were kept for 2 days in epidermal growth factor-free medium containing 2% fetal calf serum as described (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hormone inductions were performed with 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin (31 units/mg, Sigma) and 0.1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), as indicated. Experimental procedures were as described previously (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 Ci/mmol) and annealed to the complementary oligonucleotides as described (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol.

Electromobility shift assays were performed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE electrophoresis buffer. Binding reactions were as described (27Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C.B. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GR-DBD expressed in Escherichia coli was purified as described (28Dahlman K. Strömstedt P.-E. Rae C. Jörnvall H. Flock J.-I. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 804-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for binding reactions in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC). Transfections with the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, selection and propagation of stably transfected HC11 cells, and CAT assays were performed as described (27Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C.B. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells were made with cultures plated on 6-well dishes. The total amount of cotransfected DNA was 20 μg/6 wells. For preparing extracts to determine CAT and luciferase activity, COS-7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 5 min with 1 ml of buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and harvested by scraping them off the dish with a rubber policeman. The subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Two aliquots of 450 μl each of the resuspended cells were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration. One of the aliquots was used for determination of CAT activity (27Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C.B. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A luciferase assay was performed with the other aliquot as described (29Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). A regulatory region in the β-casein gene promoter required for the synergistic action of glucocorticoid hormones and prolactin was mapped in HC11 mammary epithelial cells (1Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It comprises the MGF/Stat5 site and a region located 5′ to this site. We have investigated the role of this 5′ region in mediating the synergy between glucocorticoids and prolactin in COS-7 cells. These cells were shown to be a suitable system to study the prolactin-dependent transactivation activity of Stat5 (19Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cotransfections were performed with expression plasmids for mouse Stat5a, mouse prolactin receptor, and a β-casein (−344/−1) promoter CAT reporter gene. Increasing amounts of a glucocorticoid receptor expression plasmid were included. The cotransfected cells were stimulated with dexamethasone or prolactin or a combination of both. In the absence of cotransfected glucocorticoid receptors (Fig. 1, first 4 columns) dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on transcription. The synergism between dexamethasone and prolactin increased in a concentration dependent fashion by cotransfection of GR expression vector (Fig. 1). Using 40–1000 ng of GR expression vector the synergistic effect approached the level observed in HC11 cells for the regulation of a stably transfected β-casein (−344/−1) gene promoter CAT construct (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further cotransfection studies were performed with 200 ng of GR expression vector. We next investigated whether the MGF/Stat5 site alone is sufficient to mediate the synergistic response in COS-7 cells. A 30-base pair region comprising the MGF/Stat5 site in the β-casein gene promoter or a region extending from −344 to −82 cloned in front of a thymidine kinase-CAT reporter gene were analyzed. The short fragment with the MGF/Stat5 site only conferred a transcriptional response upon prolactin stimulation to the thymidine kinase-CAT reporter (Fig.2). However, no synergism was observed with dexamethasone. By contrast, a marked increase in transcriptional activation was obtained upon stimulation with dexamethasone and prolactin, when the β-casein gene promoter fragment (−344/−82) was used. The synergistic transcriptional activation mediated by prolactin and dexamethasone is hence dependent on sequences 5′ to the MGF/Stat5 site in COS-7 cells as has been found previously in HC11 cells (23Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a previous study GR-binding sites were mapped in the rat β-casein gene promoter by in vitro footprint analysis using purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptor (13Welte T. Philipp S. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Doppler W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 47: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Five regions were identified to be protected from digestion by DNase I (Fig.3, footprints a-e). They contain sequence motifs related to half-sites of classical glucocorticoid response elements. The functionality of the putative half-site contained in footprint c to bind the GR was investigated by electromobility shift assays employing the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-DBD, Fig.4 A). The oligonucleotide GRc, spanning the footprinted region c of the β-casein gene promoter and a corresponding oligonucleotide harboring a mutation in the putative half-site (mGRc, mutation as shown in Fig. 3) were used as DNA probes. A classical palindromic GR-binding site (PRE) and a sequence devoid of described GR-binding sites (SIE) served as controls. Very weak binding was observed with the SIE (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2). With a palindromic GRE (PRE oligo) two retarded bands were detected (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). The two bands represent complexes containing receptor monomers or dimers. This is in accordance with previous reports (18Slater E.P. Hesse H. Müller J.M. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cairns W. Cairns C. Pongratz I. Poellinger L.

With the GRc probe, formation of a complex migrating at the position of receptor monomers was observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6). Binding activity of the mutated GRc probe was reduced to the low level observed with to the SIE probe (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1and 2 with 7 and 8). The experiment confirms the assumption that the integrity of the half-palindromic site in the GRc probe is required for the binding of the GR. In electromobility shift assays with a DNA probe comprising the half-sites in GRd and GRe (GRd+e), formation of complexes with two receptor molecules was observed at high concentrations of GR-DBD (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). Electromobility shift assays performed with oligonucleotides with targeted mutations in either Grd or GRe palindromic half-sites revealed that the integrity of the half-sites in GRd and GRe is important for the formation of these complexes (data not shown). In comparison to the PRE probe with the palindromic GR site (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–7), formation of complexes containing two receptor molecules required significantly higher concentration of the GR-DBD (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 1 and 2 to lanes 5 and6), indicating that the configuration of the two binding sites in GRd+e does not favor co-operative binding of GR molecules to the same extent as the classical palindromic site in PRE.Figure 3GR-binding sites in the lactogenic hormone response element of the rat β-casein gene promoter.

The mutations employed are shown in Fig. 3 on top of the sequence. Cotransfections with the mutated promoter constructs were performed in COS-7 cells as described above. The ability of dexamethasone to augment the response of prolactin was quantified by determining the ratio of the CAT activity in cells stimulated with dexamethasone and prolactin versusthe activity in cells treated with prolactin only (Fig.5 A). Mutations in GR half-sites a, b, c, and e led to a reduction of the ratio to 17 (mGRa), 29 (mGRa/b), 30 (mGRb), 34 (mGRc), and 42% (mGRe) of the wild-type β-casein CAT construct. The induction ratio was almost completely abolished in constructs harboring double mutations of GRc and GRe (Fig.5 A, mutations mGRc+e and mGRc+d+e), indicating a co-operation of these binding sites for mediating the synergism of GR with Stat5. The effect of a mutation in GRd was not statistically significant. This mutation also had no significant additional effect when combined with mutations of either GRc or GRe or both (Fig.5 A, mutations mGRd, mGRc+d, mGRd+e, andmGRc+d+e). As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5 B for COS-7 cells, the activation of transcription by prolactin alone was not altered by the triple GR mutation, indicating that the effect is selective on the action of glucocorticoids. Mutation of the MGF/Stat5 site, however, strongly interfered with the prolactin response. In this mutant the synergistic effect of dexamethasone was also reduced. The weak but significant induction observed is most probably explained by an incomplete inhibition of Stat5 binding by the mutation. The data presented document the functional importance of the GR half-sites in GRa, GRb, GRc, and GRe for GR action. Furthermore, they show the dependence of GR on co-operation with Stat5, which also has to bind to the promoter. To examine whether the findings obtained in Stat5 and GR overexpressing COS-7 cells are also relevant for the situation in mouse mammary epithelial cells expressing physiological levels of these two transcription factors, HC11 cells were stably transfected with the same mutated reporter constructs (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). The results obtained in HC11 cells supported the conclusions drawn from the experiments with the COS-7 cell system. The triple mutation affecting the three GR-binding sites c, d, and e strongly reduced the synergistic activation of the β-casein promoter by dexamethasone and prolactin. Destroying the Stat5-binding site also inhibited prolactin- and dexamethasone-induced transactivation. To determine whether the GR sites in GRc and GRe are sufficient for mediating the synergism with Stat5, constructs were prepared with 5′ deletions of the β-casein promoter placed in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and analyzed in COS-7 cotransfection experiments (Fig. 5 C). A (−176/−82)β-casein thymidine kinase promoter which harbors the GRc- and GRe-binding sites failed to confer the prolactin and dexamethasonedependent synergistic transactivation. The responsiveness to dexamethasone and prolactin was restored in the constructs which contain the regions GRa and GRb (Fig.5 C, pβc(−344/−82)thymidine kinase-CAT and pβc(−282/−82)thymidine kinase-CAT)). Thus, the distal β-casein gene promoter region with the GR-binding sites for GRa and GRb is necessary for mediating the synergism between GR and Stat5. As shown above (Fig. 5 A), the functionality of this region is dependent on the integrity of the proximal GR-binding sites in GRc and GRe, implying that the synergism depends on a co-operation of distal and proximal sites. The two highly related Stat5 molecules Stat5a and Stat5b are expressed in the mammary epithelium. We wanted to examine whether they behave similarly in synergizing with the GR. Cotransfection experiments in COS-7 cells were performed as above. As shown in Fig.6, no significant differences were observed in transactivation of the β-casein gene promoter upon induction with dexamethasone and prolactin. We also tested carboxyl-terminally deleted forms of Stat5a"

(1991) Cell 64, 789–800). We report that strains carrying mutations in the CDP-choline pathway, such ascki1, exhibit a choline excretion phenotype due to production of choline during normal turnover of phosphatidylcholine. Cells carrying cki1 in combination withsec14 ts, a temperature-sensitive allele in the gene encoding the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transporter, have a dramatically increased choline excretion phenotype when grown at the sec14 ts -restrictive temperature. We show that the increased choline excretion in sec14 ts cki1 cells is due to increased turnover of phosphatidylcholine via a mechanism consistent with phospholipase D-mediated turnover. We propose that the elevated rate of phosphatidylcholine turnover insec14 ts cki1 cells provides the metabolic condition that permits the secretory pathway to function when Sec14p is inactivated.As phosphatidylcholine turnover increases in sec14 ts cki1 cells shifted to the restrictive temperature, theINO1 gene (encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase) is also derepressed, leading to an inositol excretion phenotype (Opi−).

Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is one of two routes for synthesis of PC in eukaryotic cells, including yeast. The second route for synthesis of PC, originally described by Bremer and Greenberg (8Bremer J. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), involves methylation of PE. Yeast cells can utilize either the CDP-choline or the PE methylation pathway, or a combination of the two, for net PC synthesis (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Deletion of the genes in the CDP-choline pathway is not lethal in yeast and, indeed, appears to have little effect on growth (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed that the CDP-choline pathway in yeast functions largely for the utilization of exogenous choline. However, recent studies have suggested that the CDP-choline pathway contributes substantially to PC biosynthesis even in the absence of exogenous choline (10McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11McDonough V.M. Buxeda R.J. Bruno M.E.C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenous choline, the yeast cell synthesizes PC predominantly via methylation of PE. Conversely, yeast cells can survive the complete and simultaneous deletion of the genes encoding the two phospholipid methyltransferases that carry out the three-step conversion of PE to PC, provided choline is supplied in the growth medium (13Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletions of genes encoding enzymes in either of these two pathways result in subtly different phenotypes. For example, the deletion of either of the phospholipid methyltransferases does not suppress the sec14 growth phenotype (1Cleves A. McGee T. Whitters E. Champion K. Aitken J. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Cleves A. McGee T. Bankaitis V. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such mutants are, however, unable to repress the INO1 gene (encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase; see Fig.1) in response to exogenous inositol, unless PC biosynthesis is restored via the CDP-choline pathway (13Summers E.F.

And while the deletion of genes encoding enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway does not affect INO1 regulation in response to inositol (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), such mutants suppress the sec14phenotype (1Cleves A. McGee T. Whitters E. Champion K. Aitken J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The INO1 gene is the most highly regulated of a set of genes encoding enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis that are subject to complex coordinate control. All these genes contain a conserved promoter element, UASINO, that includes within it the canonical binding site, CANNTG, for transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix class (16Paltauf F.

In the present report, we show that inactivation of the sec14 ts gene product leads to acceleration of PC turnover, an event that is not in itself lethal, as long as the liberated choline cannot be reused in PC biosynthesis. At the same time, we document a relationship between PC turnover and regulation of the INO1 gene and, by extension, other co-regulated genes of phospholipid metabolism. Yeast strains were maintained on YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 3% glucose). Chemically defined synthetic medium was prepared as described previously (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A.

For temperature shift experiments, the strains were initially grown in repressing conditions (I+ medium) at 25 °C, the cultures were filtered, and the cells used to inoculate separate cultures to be grown at 25 °C or 37 °C in either repressing (I+) or derepressing conditions (I−). Samples were harvested at intervals and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. RNA probes were synthesized from plasmids previously described (22Hudak K.A. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A.

For phospholipid turnover experiments, cells were labeled as described above, harvested, washed twice in fresh media lacking labeled orthophosphate, and suspended atA 595 = 0.1 under the indicated culture conditions. Aliquots of these cultures were removed at indicated times, and phospholipids were analyzed. The rate of phospholipid synthesisin vivo was determined by pulse labeling the cells for 30 min with 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml as described by Kelley et al. (27Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by lipid extraction and separation by paper chromatography, as described above. The amount of [32P]phosphate incorporated into sphingolipids was determined by deacylating the extracted lipids and separating the sphingolipids by one-dimensional chromatography (28Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were grown overnight at the indicated temperatures in I−media containing 1 μCi/ml 1,2-[14C]choline at a concentration of 10 μm. Cultures were harvested during mid-logarithmic phase, washed twice in fresh non-radioactive media, and suspended at A 595 = 0.1 in I−C− media. At the indicated time points, aliquots of the cultures were removed, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was saved as the “media” fraction. The cell pellet was processed as described (25Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the extraction of lipids with one addition; following treatment of the cell pellet with trichloroacetic acid to permeabilize the cell membrane, the supernatant and subsequent pellet washes were combined and saved as the “intracellular water-soluble fraction of the cell.” This fraction contained the vast majority of the intracellular water-soluble counts, as evidenced by the fact that >90% of the counts found in the only other cellular fraction (the lipid fraction) were shown by chromatography to be PC. Cation exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 resin (50–100-mesh) was used to separate quantitatively the 1,2-[14C]choline in the aqueous media washes or the trichloroacetic acid extracts from other water-soluble 1,2-[14C]choline-containing metabolites (29Martin T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The aqueous samples (3–5 ml) were neutralized with 1.0 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, as necessary, and applied to a 1-ml Bio-Rex 70 column. The column was then washed with 5 ml of H2O, followed by 10 ml of 50 mm glycine, 500 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, to elute the choline retained by the resin. The fractions were counted to determine the percentages of various metabolites present. The overproduction ofinositol (Opi−) phenotype (Fig.2) is associated with misregulation of the INO1 gene (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

The Opi− and Opc− phenotypes of the strains used in this study are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and are summarized in TableII. As reported previously (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

However, all of the CDP-choline pathway mutants exhibited the Opc− phenotype to varying degrees. No Opi−phenotype was observed for the strain carrying thesec14 ts mutation (but no mutation in the CDP-choline pathway) at its permissive temperature, 25 °C, or at 30 °C (TableII). (This strain will be referred to from here on assec14 ts CKI1 (Table I) because most of the subsequent studies were done with the set of strains carrying combinations of the sec14 ts andcki1 mutation.) A slight Opc−phenotype was observed for the sec14 ts CKI1 strain, but only in I− media at 30 °C.Table IISummary of Opc − and Opi −A.

Strains were grown at the indicated temperatures in I− or I+ medium for the Opc−test and in I− medium for the Opi− test. At 30 °C, a temperature that is still permissive forsec14 ts, the double mutants containingsec14 ts in combination with each of the CDP-choline pathway lesions (i.e. sec14 ts cki1; sec14 ts cct1; sec14 ts cpt1) had an Opc− phenotype somewhat stronger than the phenotype exhibited by strains carrying only the CDP-choline pathway mutation in question (TableII). At 25 °C, none of these double mutant strains exhibited an Opi− phenotype. However, at 37 °C, the temperature at which the sec14 ts gene product is inactivated (5Bankaitis V. Aitkin J. Cleves A. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), all three double mutants exhibited Opi− phenotypes, as well as dramatically stronger Opc− phenotypes than those seen in these same strains at 30 °C or in strains carrying only the respective CDP-choline pathway lesions at any temperature (Fig. 2; Table II). In the absence of exogenous choline supplementation, yeast cells make PC primarily via methylation of PE (Fig. 1). The choline excretion phenotype of the CDP-choline pathway mutants (Fig. 3) suggests that choline is being produced in thede novo synthesis of PC via methylation of PE, followed by PC turnover (see metabolic pathway, Fig. 1). Equivalent turnover presumably occurs in the normal course of lipid metabolism in wild type strains, but the choline is rapidly reutilized via the CDP-choline pathway without escaping from the cell. The increase in choline excretion at the restrictive temperature in the double mutants, carrying the sec14 ts allele in combination with one of the CDP-choline pathway mutations, therefore, suggests that accelerated turnover of PC is occurring. To test this idea, we labeled the wild type, SEC14 cki1,sec14 ts CKI1, and sec14 ts cki1strains with [14C]choline in I−C− medium. [14C]Choline is incorporated into PC via the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 1), but strains carrying the cki1 mutation have very reduced capacity to incorporate [14C]choline into PC. We found that incorporation of [14C]choline into PC in SEC14 cki1 and sec14 ts cki1 strains was approximately 13% of the wild type level, comparable to previous reports forcki1 strains (9Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the chloroform-soluble label extract from all four strains labeled at 25 °C (i.e. wild type, sec14 ts CKI1, SEC14 cki1, and sec14 ts cki1) demonstrated that >90% of the label was associated with PC. To study PC turnover, [14C]choline-labeled cells were shifted to unlabeled medium and the fate of the label was charted. The pattern of label transfer between the lipid-soluble pool, the intracellular water-soluble pool, and the medium following the shift to unlabeled medium is shown for three strains (wild type, SEC14 cki1, and sec14 ts cki1) at 37 °C (Figs.4 and 5). All four strains were tested in this fashion at 25 °C as well (data not shown); only two patterns of turnover were observed. The “wild type” pattern was exhibited by both wild type andsec14 ts CKI1 at 25 °C and by wild type at 37 °C (Fig. 4 A). The “cki1” pattern was exhibited by both SEC14 cki1 and sec14 ts cki1 strains at 25 °C and by the SEC14 cki1 strain at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). In strains exhibiting the “wild type” pattern of choline metabolism (i.e. the wild type strain at both 25 °C and 37 °C andsec14 ts CKI1 only at the permissive temperature of 25 °C), the cells at the time of transfer to unlabeled medium had a significant amount (19–29%) of their cellular 14C label in a water-soluble intracellular pool (Fig. 4 A). The remaining cellular label was lipid-associated. A small amount of label (2–7%) was associated with extracellular free choline at the start of the experiment. During the first 3 h after the shift to unlabeled medium, the free choline from the medium was taken up, the water-soluble intracellular pool declined to a few percent, and the label appeared in the lipid-associated pool, which was shown to be greater than 90% PC. Very little label (10% or less of the total label) appeared in the medium throughout the 6-h chase (Figs.4 A and 5). In the case of wild type cells, the extracellular label that did appear was not in the form of free choline (Fig. 5). Most likely, it is glycerophosphocholine, known to be excreted by wild type yeast cells (32Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

The NMDA receptor subunits have large intracellular domains in the COOH-terminal region that may interact with signal-transducing proteins. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that calmodulin interacts with the COOH terminus of the NR1 subunit and inactivates the channels in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here we show that protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation on serine residues of NR1 decreases its affinity for calmodulin. This suggests that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 prevents calmodulin from binding to the NR1 subunit and thereby inhibits the inactivation of NMDA receptors by calmodulin. In addition, we show that stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α, which potentiates NMDA channels through PKC, decreases the ability of NR1 to bind to calmodulin. Thus, our data provide clues to understanding the basis of cross-talk between two types of receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors and the NR1 subunit, in NMDA channel potentiation.

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Glutamate receptors are divided into two types of receptors, ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors, based on their structural and functional properties.N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; PKC, protein kinase C; CaM, calmodulin; LTP, long-term potentiation; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; t-ACPD,trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; PKC, protein kinase C; CaM, calmodulin; LTP, long-term potentiation; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; t-ACPD,trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. receptors, which belong to the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are implicated in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, and excitotoxicity (1Choi D.W.

NMDA receptors consist of two distinct types of subunits, the principal subunit NR1 and modulatory subunits NR2A–2D (3Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S.

Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Both types of subunits have a large COOH-terminal intracellular domain (5Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), suggesting that the large cytoplasmic domain may directly interact with proteins that regulate NMDA receptor function. For example, recent studies have suggested that postsynaptic density protein PSD95 directly interacts with NMDA receptors, although the biological significance of the interaction has not been established. The intracellular domain of NR1 contains serine residues that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (8Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the NMDA receptor-mediated current is regulated by several protein kinases and phosphatases (9Wang L.Y. Orser B.A. Brautigan D.L. MacDonald J.F. Nature. 1994; 369: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 11Lieberman D.N. Mody I. Nature. 1994; 369: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous molecule that regulates the function of a large number of proteins including Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II, adenylate cyclase, and phosphodiesterases. CaM also modulates the sensitivity of ion channels such as the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and the retinal cyclic GMP-gated channel (12Chen T.Y. Yau K.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 13Hsu Y.T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, loading of CaM inhibitors at the postsynaptic neuron blocks the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic plasticity, and long-term depression, a long-lasting depression of synaptic plasticity, in the hippocampal CA1 region (14Malenka R.C. Kauer J.A. Perkel D.J. Mauk M.D. Kelly P.T. Nicoll R.A. Waxham M.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM is an important molecule for the induction of LTP and long-term depression. We and Ehlers et al. (17Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) independently show that CaM binds to NR1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that the binding inactivates NMDA channels. NMDA receptors show high permeability to Ca2+. However, the rise of the intracellular Ca2+ level causes a reversible inactivation of the NMDA channels (15Vyklicky L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 470: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Medina I. Filippova N. Charton G. Rongeole S. Ben-Ari Y. Khrestchatisky M. Bregestovski P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This feedback system regulates the amount of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptors. These data together suggest that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors is mediated by CaM binding to NR1, namely, Ca2+ entering through the NMDA receptors binds to and activates CaM, and activated CaM, in turn, binds to NR1, resulting in inactivation of the NMDA channels. The NMDA receptor-mediated current is potentiated during LTP (18Asztely F. Wigstrom H. Gustafsson B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Clark K.A. Collingridge G.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, dl-2-amino-4-phosphonovaleric acid, an antagonist of NMDA receptors, blocks the induction of LTP. Thus, induction of LTP should be accompanied by fine-tuning of the level of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA channels. Since Ca2+ influx results in inactivation of NMDA channels, there should be a mechanism by which the inactivation of the NMDA channels by Ca2+ influx is prevented so that potentiation of NMDA receptors results in the induction of LTP. Several studies suggest that induction of LTP requires concomitant activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and NMDA receptors (20Radpour S. Thomson A.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 138: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and thattrans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate (t-ACPD), an agonist of mGluRs, potentiates NMDA currents in the hippocampus (21Anikszlejn L. Bregestovski P. Ben-Ari Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 205: 327-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mGluR1 and mGluR5 leads to the activation of PKC. There are reports that phorbol ester, an activator of PKC, enhances the amplitude of NMDA currents in Xenopusoocytes (22Kelso S.R. Nelson T.E. Leonard J.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 449: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), hippocampus (21Anikszlejn L. Bregestovski P. Ben-Ari Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 205: 327-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and spinal dorsal horn neurons (23Gerber G. Kangrga I. Ryu P.D. Larew J.S. Randic M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3606-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that intracellular injection of the selective PKC inhibitory peptide prevents the induction of LTP (24Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Here we show that PKC-mediated phosphorylation on serine residues of NR1 decreases its CaM binding affinity. Moreover, we provide evidence that activation of mGluR1α decreases the affinity of NR1 for CaM. These results suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 through mGluR1α decreases NR1-CaM interaction and prevents inactivation of NMDA channels by Ca2+. The NR1 cDNA encoding residues between the fourth transmembrane domain and the COOH terminus (Glu834–Ser938) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with two primers: 5′-CCTCGAATTCATTGAGATCGCC-3′, incorporating theEcoRI site (underlined), and 5′-GGGCGGGTCGACTCAGCTCTCCC-3′, incorporating theSalI site (underlined). The amplified fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-SalI site of pBTM116. The resulting plasmid encodes a fusion protein of the LexA DNA-binding domain and the COOH-terminal domain of NR1. The yeast reporter strain L40 containing this plasmid was transformed with a mouse cDNA library in pVP16 by the lithium acetate method. The transformants were plated on medium lacking Trp, His, Ura, Leu, and Lys and containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Nitrocellulose filters were placed on the plates and assayed for β-galactosidase expression as described (25Vojtec A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the Sanger chain termination method, employing a BcaBEST sequencing kit (Takara). HEK 293T cells (simian virus 40 large T antigen-expressing human embryonic kidney cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mmglutamine. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. mGluR1α-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mmglutamine (26Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The NR1 expression plasmid (pNR1) contains NR1 cDNA from pN60 (3Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) at theEcoRI-NotI site of pME18S (27Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two mutagenic primers used were as follows. Primer 1 (5′-CTGGCCTCAAGCTTCCAGCAACAACAGTCCTCCAAA-3′, nucleotides 2659–2694) has a HindIII site (underlined) without changing the original amino acid sequence of NR1. Primer 2 (5′-ACTAGTCGCGAGAAAAAACCTC-3′) carries the same sequence as that of the multicloning site of pME18S, but contains anNruI site (underlined) instead of the originalXbaI site. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the method of Deng and Nickoloff (28Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) using the above two primers and pNR1 as a template. Introduction of the mutations in NR1 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293T cells in a 10-cm culture dish were transfected with 10 μg of NR1 expression plasmid by the standard calcium phosphate method. After 48 h, the cells were lysed with 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 1.0 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and 30 μl of CaM-agarose (Sigma) was added to the supernatants. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the CaM-agarose was washed with the same buffer. For immunoblotting, proteins in the CaM-agarose complex were resolved by 6.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane filter was treated with blocking reagents containing 5.0% bovine serum albumin and probed with an antibody to the COOH terminus of NR1 (Chemicon International, Inc.). HEK 293T cells were transfected with 20 μg of NR1 expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were treated with or without 100 nm TPA for 30 min. The cells were lysed with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-CaM antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with a DNA mixture containing NR1, NR2A, and a mutant (S65T) of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmids (0.1, 0.3, and 0.3 μg/cm2, respectively) (29Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). After 12 h, 50 μmdl-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid was added to the medium to prevent cell death caused by NMDA receptor activation. After 12–48 h of transfection, the expression of GFP was confirmed with an epifluorescence microscope, and cells expressing GFP were used for electrophysiological recordings. Fire-polished borosilicate glass pipettes (4–5 megohms) filled with an extracellular solution (110 mm Na2SO4, 5 mmCs2SO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, 1 μm pyruvic acid, and 1 mm tetrodotoxin (pH 7.25)) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm NMDA, and 3 μm glycine were used for single channel recording. Inside-out patches were excised from HEK 293T cells in the extracellular solution and moved into the flow of an intracellular solution (140 mm cesium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 μm CaCl2 (pH 7.25)). For analysis of the effect of CaM, the flow was changed to the intracellular solution containing 250 nm CaM (Sigma). Currents through the NMDA channels were measured by using the voltage-clamp technique at room temperature (22–25 °C). The single channel currents were amplified by a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA Electronics) and stored on a videocassette tape recorder through a PCM converter system (VR10B, Instrutech Corp.) digitized at 37 kHz. Data were reproduced and low-pass-filtered at 2 kHz by a filter with Bessel characteristics (48 db/octave) (Model 3625, NF Instruments), sampled at 10 kHz, and analyzed on a Macintosh computer by using Patch Analyst Pro software (Version 1.16, MT Corp.). Single channel amplitudes were determined by fitting gaussian curves to the amplitude histograms. The threshold used to judge the open state was set at half of the single channel current. The open probability was noted as NP o, whereN is the number of channels and P o is the open probability of a single channel. Continuous recordings (50–110 s) of each experiment (150–800 opening events in the absence of CaM and 200–950 opening events in the presence of CaM) were analyzed to obtain the open probability. Under the above condition, the absolute NP o values in the absence of CaM were in the range 0.006–0.030. CaM-peptide complexes were formed in buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 0.15 m NaCl) containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. The complexes were then resolved on nondenaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mm CaCl2 and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. To phosphorylate the peptide, 3000 pmol of peptides was incubated with 0.3 milliunits of PKC (Pierce) in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP) for 3 h at room temperature. The peptide that was incubated with PKC in the above solution without [γ-32P]ATP was used as a nonphosphorylated peptide. To identify proteins that interact with the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of NR1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid screening system (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar,31Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). To prepare a bait, we constructed a plasmid that expresses a fusion protein consisting of LexA and the COOH terminus (Glu834—Ser938) of NR1. The yeast reporter strain L40 containing the bait plasmid was transformed with a mouse cDNA library constructed in pVP16. By screening ∼106yeast transformants, we obtained 177 positive clones that activate expression of both the selection marker His and LacZ. Of these, 50 clones were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The inserts of 16 clones encode the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of CaM that corresponds to the amino acids between Lys77 and Lys148. Most CaM-binding proteins contain conserved amino acid sequences that can form the amphiphilic α-helix (32Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Inspection of the NR1 sequence revealed the presence of the amphiphilic structure within a cytoplasmic domain of NR1 between Lys875 and Thr900 (Fig.1 A). To examine whether this region is responsible for CaM binding, we constructed a mutant of NR1 (MNR1) with Gln892, Gln893, Gln894, and Gln895 instead of Lys892, Arg893, Arg894, and Arg895, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1 A). These mutations would disrupt the amphiphilic structure. The MNR1-CaM binding assay revealed that the amount of CaM binding to the mutant receptor was significantly decreased compared with the amount of CaM binding to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1 B). Thus, we concluded that this region (Lys875–Thr900) is indeed a major CaM-binding site on NR1. The small amounts of CaM binding to MNR1 observed may be due to the existence of other CaM-binding sites on the NR1 molecule. To investigate the Ca2+ dependence of the NR1-CaM interaction, we performed the binding assay between CaM and a synthetic peptide containing the CaM-binding site. We synthesized a peptide (DPKKKATFRAITSTLASSFKRRRSSKDT) corresponding to the sequence from Asp873 to Thr902 of NR1 that includes the CaM-binding site. CaM (300 pmol) was incubated with various amounts of the peptide in a solution with or without Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the CaM-peptide complex was found in the presence of Ca2+. However, the CaM-peptide complex was not detected in the absence of Ca2+(Fig. 1 C, EDTA). Therefore, we concluded that the NR1-CaM interaction is Ca2+-dependent. The four serine residues in the CaM-binding site on NR1 can be phosphorylated with PKC by TPA stimulation (Fig.2 A) (8Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PKC-induced phosphorylation of these serine residues alters their hydrophilicity and therefore might disrupt the amphiphilic structure of the CaM-binding site. Consequently, CaM would be unable to bind to phosphorylated NR1. To investigate this possibility, HEK 293T cells expressing NR1 were treated with 100 nm TPA. Using anti-phosphoserine antibodies, we detected the increment in serine phosphorylation of NR1 upon TPA treatment (data not shown) (8Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed, and the NR1-CaM binding assay was performed using CaM-agarose. As expected, TPA treatment decreased the ability of NR1 to bind CaM (Fig. 2 B). In addition, when CaM was immunoprecipitated with anti-CaM antibody from the lysate of the TPA-treated cells, the amount of coimmunoprecipitated NR1 was decreased as compared with that from untreated cells (Fig. 2 C). The residual NR1 coimmunoprecipitated may be due to CaM binding to another CaM-binding site on NR1 that does not contain serine residues for PKC phosphorylation. The results suggest that the affinity of NR1 for CaM binding is decreased by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1. To quantitate CaM binding to NR1 phosphorylated by PKC, we performed the binding assay between CaM and the NR1 peptide phosphorylated at the CaM-binding site. The peptide corresponding to the sequence from Asp873 to Thr902 of NR1 that includes the CaM-binding site was incubated with PKC to achieve its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the peptide was confirmed by radiolabeling (data not shown). CaM (300 pmol) was incubated with various amounts of peptide either nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated by PKC. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the CaM-nonphosphorylated peptide complex was seen at a peptide/CaM ratio of 1:10. However, the CaM-phosphorylated peptide complex could be seen at a peptide/CaM ratio of 1:1. The data suggest that the phosphorylated peptide had a significantly lower affinity for CaM than the nonphosphorylated peptide. Thus, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 decreased the affinity of NR1 for CaM. To investigate the functional regulation of NMDA channels by CaM, we measured the single channel activity from HEK 293T cells cotransfected with NR1, NR2A, and GFP expression plasmids. Fig.4 A shows a typical single channel current detected in inside-out patches excised from the HEK 293T cells expressing GFP. The slope conductance of the channel was 48 ± 3 picosiemens (n = 4), which corresponded closely to the single NMDA channel conductance (∼50 picosiemens) measured in adult rat dentate gyrus granule cells (11Lieberman D.N. Mody I. Nature. 1994; 369: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The current was detected in patches from GFP-expressing cells, whereas it was not detected in untransfected cells (n = 4). Under the condition in which a saturating concentration (3 μm) of glycine was applied in the pipette solution, the current did not show a substantial rundown for at least 5 min. We then tested the effect of CaM on the currents detected in the inside-out patches from GFP-expressing HEK 293T cells. As previously reported (17Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), application of 250 nm CaM in the intracellular solution containing 1 mm Ca2+reduced the probability of channel opening (NP o) to 49.4 ± 25.3% (mean ± S.D.) of the control values (n = 9) (Fig. 4, A and B). CaM did not significantly affect the single channel conductance in all patches measured: 3.23 ± 0.47 pA (n = 9) at −60 mV in the absence of CaM and 3.49 ± 0.42 pA (n = 8) at −60 mV following the addition of CaM. Therefore, CaM decreases the activity of NMDA channels by reducing the frequency of channel openings. The NMDA receptors have high permeability to Ca2+, and Ca2+ influx through the channels, in turn, inactivates the NMDA receptors (15Vyklicky L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 470: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Medina I. Filippova N. Charton G. Rongeole S. Ben-Ari Y. Khrestchatisky M. Bregestovski P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since CaM binds to NR1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (17Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), inactivation of the NMDA receptors by Ca2+ influx may be through the NR1-CaM interaction. NMDA receptor-mediated currents are potentiated during LTP (18Asztely F. Wigstrom H. Gustafsson B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Clark K.A. Collingridge G.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The potentiation of NMDA currents during LTP is opposed to inactivation of NMDA channels by Ca2+-dependent NR1-CaM interaction. Therefore, there should be a mechanism by which inactivation of the NMDA channels by Ca2+ influx is prevented during LTP. LTP is regulated by both mGluRs and NMDA receptors. In addition, stimulation of mGluRs by t-ACPD, an agonist of mGluRs, evokes a long-lasting enhancement of NMDA currents (34O'Connor J.J. Rowan M.J. Anwyl R. Nature. 1994; 367: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since stimulation of mGluR1α leads to activation of PKC, the activated PKC may be utilized to phosphorylate NR1, which prevents the interaction between NR1 and CaM. To investigate this, we examined the affinity of NR1 for CaM after stimulation of mGluR1α byt-ACPD. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mGluR1α were transfected with NR1 expression plasmids. The cells were then treated with or without 10 mm t-ACPD, and the NR1-CaM binding assay was performed using CaM-agarose. As expected, stimulation of mGluR1α decreased the affinity of NR1 for CaM (Fig.5). These results suggest that the decrease in the affinity of NR1 for CaM underlies the potentiation of NMDA channels. Phosphorylation of NR1 by PKC may be one of the mechanisms for NMDA receptor potentiation. We have shown that CaM inactivates the NMDA channels by binding to NR1 and that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 decreases the affinity of NR1 for CaM. Therefore, when the NMDA receptor is activated and permits Ca2+ influx, CaM binds to NR1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and inactivates NMDA channels. However, when serine residues of NR1 are concomitantly phosphorylated by PKC, CaM cannot bind to NR1 and thus is unable to inactivate the NMDA channels, and this may result in the potentiation of LTP. Previous reports also show that CaM binding to target proteins is regulated by phosphorylation. Neuromodulin is a molecule that is present in neurons in the spinal cord, retina, and brain (35Cimler B.M. Andreasen T.J. Andreasen K.I. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10784-10788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Andreasen T.J. Luetje C.W. Heideman W. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 22: 4615-4618Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Neuromodulin releases CaM in response to its phosphorylation by PKC: neuromodulin binds to and localizes CaM at specific sites within the cell in the resting state and releases CaM locally in response to its phosphorylation by PKC (37Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chapman E.R. Au D. Alexander K.A. Nicolson T.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to Ca2+, phosphorylation also regulates the interaction of CaM and CaM-binding proteins. To date, at least eight splice variants of NR1 have been identified (39Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V.L. Uhl G.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9359-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 40Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 41Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pechet G. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 943-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These variants are generated by three exons: an exon near the N terminus and two exons near the C terminus. These variants differ in their sensitivity to factors such as Mg2+, glycine, polyamines, and protein kinases/phosphatases. Our study shows that CaM plays a role in regulating NMDA channel activity through the interaction of CaM with the sequence (Lys875–Thr900) in the C1 cassette (Asp864–Thr900) in the COOH-terminal region of NR1. Among the NR1 splice variants, there are variants that do not contain this cassette, suggesting that these variants have a different sensitivity to CaM. Indeed, Ehlers et al. (17Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) reported that splice variants that lack the C1 exon cassette, e.g. NR1-c and NR1-e, are much less sensitive to CaM than the variants that have the C1 cassette. They also reported that CaM binds to two sites of NR1: the lower affinity region (Lys838–Gln863) as well as the higher affinity region (Lys875–Lys898). Consistently, our data demonstrate that the NR1 mutant (MNR1) incorporating Gln instead of Lys or Arg at positions 892, 893, 894, and 895 significantly reduces the affinity for CaM, but still can bind to CaM very weakly (Fig.1 B). This residual ability of MNR1 to bind CaM may be due to the other CaM-binding site (Lys838–Gln863) of NR1. Although the sensitivities to CaM are different among these variants at a low concentration of CaM, the effect of CaM on inactivation of the channels is not different at a high concentration of CaM (17Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A high concentration of Ca2+/CaM that inactivates all the splice variants might be the limit of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration that induces excitotoxicity. Thus, whereas the low affinity CaM-binding site (Lys838–Gln863) might contribute to the prevention of excitotoxicity, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the high affinity CaM-binding site (Lys875–Lys898) in the C1 exon cassette might be important primarily in determining the sensitivity of channels to CaM. The C1 exon cassette is also important in determining the subcellular distribution of NR1 (42Ehlers M.D. Tingley W. Huganir R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). NR1 splice variants containing the C1 exon are aggregated and located in discrete, highly concentrated regions associated with the plasma membrane. NR1 splice variants lacking this exon cassette are distributed throughout the cell. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation of serine residues within the exon disrupts the formation of the NR1 aggregation at the plasma membrane. The CaM-binding site (Lys875–Thr900) of NR1 has high homology to the CaM-binding site (effector domain) of the cytoskeletal organizing protein MARCKS (myristoylatedalanine-rich Ckinasesubstrate). The effector domain of MARCKS binds both CaM and actin and contains the major site of PKC phosphorylation. PKC phosphorylation inhibits CaM and actin binding, and CaM binding prevents PKC phosphorylation and actin binding. Our results show that CaM binds to the sequence in the region encoded by the C1 exon and that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the serine residues regulates the NR1-CaM interaction. Therefore, as with the MARCKS protein, PKC phosphorylation and CaM binding may also contribute to the subcellular distribution of NR1 by interacting with cytoskeletal proteins. We have shown that stimulation of mGluR1α, which can induce NMDA receptor potentiation, decreased the affinity of NR1 for CaM. Since stimulation of mGluR1 and mGluR5 activated PKC and since PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 decreased the affinity of NR1 for CaM (Figs. 2and 3), it is likely that phosphorylation of NR1 by activated PKC through mGluR1α results in inhibition of the NR1-CaM interaction. There are reports that stimulation of μ-opioid receptors or muscarinic receptors increases the NMDA currents through activation of PKC (21Anikszlejn L. Bregestovski P. Ben-Ari Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 205: 327-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 43Chen L. Huang L.Y.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 319-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of PKC through these G protein-coupled receptors may also contribute to phosphorylation of NR1 at sites within the CaM-binding region. Although activation of NMDA channels is necessary every time LTP is generated, activation of mGluRs is not: activation of mGluRs is necessary the first time LTP is generated, and thereafter, mGluRs are no longer necessary to generate further LTP (44Bortolotto Z.A. Bashir Z.I. Davies C.H. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, mGluRs may activate some sort of “molecular switch.” Once activated, the molecular switch stays on during induction of LTP. Our results suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NR1 may be a molecular switch activated by mGluRs. Once serine residues of NR1 are phosphorylated by PKC, CaM cannot inactivate the NMDA channels by binding to NR1 until those serine residues are dephosphorylated. In the NR1 phosphorylated state, NMDA receptors remain potentiated without additional activation of mGluRs. If this hypothesis is correct, phosphorylation of NR1 should increase during LTP. Recent reports indicated that phosphorylation of NR2B increases during LTP (45Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Levin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 46Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.P. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It would be worthwhile to examine whether the level of phosphorylation of NR1 increases during LTP. Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors affects synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. The extent of Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels is proposed to be responsible for the establishment of LTP and long-term depression: a large Ca2+influx through NMDA channels results in LTP, and a small Ca2+ influx results in long-term depression. Furthermore, excessive Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels causes neuronal death. Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDA channels and release from inactivation by NR1 phosphorylation would play important roles in these phenomena. We thank S.

https://openalex.org/W2069760623,"Protein H, a surface protein of<i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> interacting with the constant Fc region of IgG, is known to be released from the streptococcal surface by a cysteine proteinase produced by the bacteria. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever are conditions in which immune complexes and autoimmune mechanisms have been suggested to play pathogenetic roles. The present study demonstrates that addition of protein H to human serum produces complement activation with dose-dependent cleavage of C3. The activation was IgG-dependent and the result of complexes formed between IgG and protein H. These complexes were size heterogeneous with molecular masses of 400 kDa to 1.4 MDa. Using complement-depleted serum reconstituted with complement proteins, the activation by protein H was found to be dependent of the classical, but independent of the alternative pathway of complement. In contrast to results of experiments based on soluble protein H·IgG complexes, complement activation was inhibited by protein H when IgG was immobilized on a surface. The interaction between C1q and immunoglobulins represents the first step in the activation of the classical pathway, and protein H efficiently inhibited the binding of C1q to IgG immobilized on polyacrylamide beads. Protein H reduced C3 deposition on the IgG-coated beads and inhibited immune hemolysis of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. Finally, significantly less C3 was deposited on the surface of protein H-expressing wild-type streptococci than on the surface of isogenic mutant bacteria devoid of protein H. The results demonstrate that protein H·IgG complexes released from the streptococcal surface can produce complement breakdown at the sites of infection, whereas complement activation on bacterial surfaces is inhibited. This should have important implications for host-parasite relationships. In addition, soluble protein H·IgG complexes might contribute to immunological complications of streptococcal infections."

However, natural polyamines, cellular compounds required for cell proliferation, have been reported to strongly stimulate CK2-mediated phosphorylation of a number of substrates.

Other proteins localized in the cytoplasm or associated to membranes were also identified as CK2 substrates. The disruption of the genes encoding the CK2 catalytic subunits α and α′ led to a lethal phenotype in yeasts, underscoring CK2's essential role in cell proliferation (11Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P.

Further evidence supporting a role for polyamines as physiological CK2 stimulators includes the observation that extraphysiological magnesium concentrations (20–30 mm) are required for maximal CK2 catalytic activity. Indeed, most of the protein kinases, including the CK2 α subunit alone, are fully active in the presence of 4–5 times lower magnesium concentrations. It is thought that polyamines may act in synergy with this physiological magnesium concentration to confer a maximal activity to the tetrameric form of CK2. However, the precise molecular mechanism leading to the catalytic stimulation remains to be determined. Polyamines are ubiquitous cellular components that are indispensable for cell proliferation and differentiation (15Pegg A. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 16Scalabrino G. Lorenzini E.C. Ferioli M.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 77: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Polybasic compounds including natural polyamines have been shown to modulate the catalytic activities of a broad range of proteins such as insulin receptor, vitamin D receptor, GTPase activity of G proteins, protein phosphatase 2A, and DNA-topoisomerases I and II (17Xu Q.-Y.

Considering the crucial roles played in the cell by most of these polyamine-stimulated enzymes, the understanding of the mechanism by which polyamines exert their effects is urgently required. We have previously described a partial characterization of the mechanism by which polyamines stimulate CK2 activity. It has been initially observed that the kinase binds different polyamines and that the binding activity is localized to the β subunit (13Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, application of a photoaffinity labeling strategy, with a photoactivated analog of spermine, led to the identification of the polyamine-binding site within a highly acidic stretch situated between amino acid residues Asp51 and Tyr80 of the CK2 β subunit (23Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.-P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.-J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The characterization of the polyamine-binding site strongly suggested the involvement of four acidic amino acid residues in the interaction of the kinase with a spermine molecule. Furthermore, from the study of the interaction of several spermine analogs with the kinase, it has been hypothesized that the CK2 polyamine-binding site could fold into a pocket shape. 2D. Leroy. J.-K. Heriche, O. Filhol, E. M. Chambaz, and C. Cochet, submitted for publication. Overall, these in vitro studies point to the likelihood that the interaction of polyamines with this polyamine-binding site may induce conformational changes responsible for the stimulation of CK2 activity. A detailed analysis of this binding site is presented in this study, along with an evaluation of a potential model for a general mechanism of CK2 stimulation by polybasic ligands. In particular, we ask the following questions: what are the amino acid residues involved in the CK2 polyamine-binding site? Does this binding site behave like an autonomous and functional polyamine-binding domain when expressed alone? To what extent does the binding of polyamines to this domain provoke conformational changes in the CK2 holoenzyme? The mutagenesis of the CK2 β subunit was performed according to the rapid for site-directed mutagenesis described in Ref. 24Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar. The plasmid pSG5βHA, containing the cDNA of the chicken β subunit fused to the nucleotidic sequence coding for the HA epitope, was used as template for the PCR reactions performed with the following oligonucleotides: 1, TGGAATTCGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGAGCTCTTCCGAGGAGGTGTCGT; 2, ATGGATCCCCTAGAGGCTAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATAGCGGATGGTCTTCACG; 3, GTGAAATTTGTGATGC; M, CAGCCAGCGCTGCGTCAGGCTCGAGGTCG. The M oligonucleotide confer the replacement of the β subunit residues Glu60, Glu61, and Glu63 by 3 alanine residues. The mutated PCR product was digested by endonucleaseBamHI and cloned in the corresponding site of the plasmid pSG5 polylinker. The resulting recombinant plasmid pSG5β3HA was used in transient transfections to express the mutated subunit βAla60, Ala61,Ala63HA. COS 7 cells were cotransfected according to the DEAE-dextran method by the vectors pSG5α and pSG5βHA or pSG5α and pSG5β3HA (20 μg each) allowing the coexpression of the wild type α and βHA subunits or the coexpression of the wild type α and the mutated βAla60,Ala61,Ala63HA subunits, respectively. Transfection of COS 7 cells by the vector pSG5 was performed as control. The transfected cells were grown during 48 h in 6 plates of 10 cm of diameter and lysed with 6 × 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0, 1% Tween 20, 1m NaCl). The cell lysate (6 ml) was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered and used as soluble cell extract. The soluble cell extract was diluted 5 times in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 directed against the HA epitope of the wild type and mutated CK2 βHA subunits. Protein A-Sepharose, previously equilibrated in the immunoprecipitation buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA, was incubated with the immunoprecipitation mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation (2 min at 10,000 × g) and washed 4 times in the immunoprecipitation buffer adjusted to 500 mm NaCl. Two final washes were performed in the CK2 assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) and the immunocomplexes were aliquoted (20 μl) prior to the CK2 activity assay. The immunocomplexes were incubated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the absence or presence of increasing spermine concentrations and the kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of the radioactive solution (0.3 mg/ml casein, 10 μm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) in a final volume of 80 μl. After 5 min, the kinase reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid. The following steps of the assay were performed as described in Ref. 25Cochet C. Job D. Pirollet F. Chambaz E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. An immunoprecipitation performed with the lysate of COS cells transfected with the vector pSG5 was also analyzed for CK2 activity and was used for blank values of the kinase assay. The polyamine binding assay was achieved by the incubation at 4 °C for 5 min of the immunocomplexes with buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.4 μm[3H]spermine (0.5 μCi/assay) in the absence or presence of increasing spermine concentrations in a final volume of 80 μl. The final NaCl concentration was adjusted to 25 mm. The immunocomplexes were then washed three times with buffer B and the binding of [3H]spermine was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Polyamine binding assays performed on the immunoprecipitates prepared from cell lysates of COS cells transfected with the vector pSG5 were used for blank values. The β subunit domain encompassing amino acid residues Asp51 to Pro110 and the entire β subunit were fused to the maltose-binding protein (26Di Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The nucleotidic sequences encoding the β subunit domain or the entire β subunit were amplified by PCR from the chicken β cDNA (a generous gift of Dr E. Nigg), respectively, with the following oligonucleotides: β domain, 5′-CGGATCCGTTGACATGATCCTCGACCTCGAG; β domain, 3′-CAAGCTTGTTAGGGGCAGTACCCGAAATCGCC; β, 5′-ATTGGATCCATGAGCAGCTCCGAGGAGGTG; β, 3′-AGAAGCTTGTCAGCGGATGGTCTTCACGGG. The nucleotide sequence encoding the β3 subunit was amplified from the recombinant plasmid pSG5β3HA with the oligonucleotides β 5′ and B 3′. The PCR amplifications led to fragments carrying a BamHI site located at their 5′ extremities and an in-frame stop codon followed by a HindIII site at their 3′ extremities. Following digestion of the fragments by the corresponding endonucleases, PCR products were cloned in the polylinker of the pMal C2 vector (protein fusion and purification system, New England BioLabs). The resulting recombinant vectors were used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21. The cultures were induced during 2 h with 0.3 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside. The cell pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 0, 25% Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). After a thermal shock (−70 °C to +20 °C) and a 3 × 2-min sonication, the lysates were adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and subjected to centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were mixed with amylose resin (New England BioLabs) at 4 °C during 1 h and the fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose added to the column buffer (10 mmphosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). The recombinant proteins MBPβ51–110, MBPβ1–215, and MBPβ3 were finally concentrated on a Centricon cell up to 2 mg/ml. Recombinant proteins (0.5–2 μg of CK2 or the fusion proteins MBP-β51–110, MBP-β1–215) were incubated at 4 °C for 5 min with 0.5 μm [3H]spermine (106 cpm) in the absence or presence of different concentrations of non radioactive polyamines in a final assay volume of 80 μl of Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The NaCl concentration was settled at 25 mm in the binding experiments. The mixtures were then rapidly centrifuged at 4 °C, according to Penefsky (27Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), through small Sephadex G-50 superfine column previously equilibrated in Tris buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Bound [3H]spermine was determined by radioactive counting of the excluded volume, after subtraction of the blank values obtained in the absence of recombinant protein. Blank values represent less than 0.2% of the input radioactivity. CK2 was incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of 500 μm spermine or 20 mm MgCl2 at different temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 °C in a test tube heater (Stuart Scientific) before being added to the phosphorylation medium of the kinase assay at a final concentration of 4.8 nm. The CK2 activity assay was performed as described previously (6Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the amount of phosphorylated peptide was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CK2 was incubated for 10 min at different temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 °C in a test tube heater (Stuart Scientific) before being added to the medium of the polyamine binding assay at a final concentration of 71 nm. The assay was performed as described above and the amount of [3H]spermine bound to CK2 was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CK2 (2.14 μm) was incubated at different temperatures for 5 min in TDG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol) in the absence or presence of 500 μm spermine in a final volume of 100 μl. CD analyses were performed on a CD6 dichrograph (Jobin Yvon, Lyon, France). The temperature of the quartz cell was maintained by a water bath monitored through a Spectralink which is connected to the dichrograph. Data were collected for each 0.5 nm between 200 and 270 nm with an acquisition time of 4 s. Control analyses were performed similarly but in the absence of CK2 and the data were deduced from those obtained in the presence of the kinase. Previous experiments have suggested the involvement of negatively charged amino acid residues in the polyamine-binding site of the CK2 β subunit. Thus, we predicted that the acidic residues located in the polyacidic region encompassing residues Asp51 to Tyr80 represent good candidates for site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acid residues Glu60, Glu61, and Glu63 of the CK2 βHA subunit were replaced by alanine residues. The resulting mutated cDNA (βAla60,Ala61,Ala63) was cotransfected with the cDNA of the human α subunit in COS cells. Cotransfection of both cDNAs of α and βHA subunits was carried out as control. Both wild type and mutated CK2 holoenzymes were immunoprecipitated and the kinase activity was analyzed versus spermine concentrations in basal magnesium conditions of 1 mm. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, the CK2 activity of the mutated form was 4 times higher than the wild type form activity in the absence of spermine. Beyond 50 μmspermine, both activities were equivalent and reached a plateau at 250 μm spermine. The resulting stimulation factor calculated as the ratio between the CK2 activities measured in the absence or presence of 500 μm spermine, was 4 times weaker for the mutated kinase. When the immunoprecipitates of both wild type and mutated CK2 were incubated with tritiated spermine, the total binding of polyamine was 2.3 times lower with the mutated CK2, as compared with the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Scatchard plot analyses showed that both CK2 forms exhibit two binding systems (Fig. 1, C andD). Calculation of the affinity constants for the highest affinity system gave a K d of 1.4 μmfor the wild type CK2 (Fig. 1 C) and 4.3 μm for the mutated kinase (Fig. 1 D). For both forms of CK2, the stoichiometries of bound spermine were equivalent. Thus, the 3-fold lower affinity of the mutated CK2 for spermine strongly suggests the involvement of at least one of the three mutated glutamic acids in the CK2 polyamine-binding site. We have already observed the apparent divergence between the concentration of spermine required to stimulate kinase activity by 50% and the calculated K D values for the binding of spermine to CK2 (28Leroy D. Filhol O. Delcros J.-G. Pares S. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such feature was attributed to nonspecific interactions between polyamines and casein in the activity assay (29Moreno F.J. Lechuga C.G. Collado M. Benitez M.J. Jiménez J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previous experiments using a photoactivable spermine analog have shown the labeling of two β subunit peptides at amino acid residues Thr72 and His108 (23Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.-P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.-J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutational analysis described above suggests the involvement of at least one of the three glutamic acid residues 60, 61, and 63, located in the polyacidic region of the CK2 β subunit, in polyamine binding. Together, these observations define a domain lying from Asp51, the first amino acid residue of the β polyacidic region, to Pro110, the first secondary structure breaker following His108. The corresponding sequence was fused to the maltose-binding protein and the overexpressed fusion protein MBP β51–110 was purified in one step on amylose resin to roughly 90% purity. The entire β subunit was fused to MBP and was purified similarly (Fig.2). Spermine binding analyses were performed using the fusion proteins MBPβ51–110, MBPβ1–215, and MBPαlacZ as control. No spermine binding activity could be detected with the fusion protein MBPαlacZ (data not shown). In contrast, a spermine binding activity was observed for the MBPβ51–110 and MBPβ1–215 fusion proteins and half-maximal binding values were, respectively, 1.7 and 1.0 μm. The data analyzed by Scatchard plot showed the presence of one single binding system exhibiting affinity constants of 0.5 and 0.6 μm for the fusion proteins MBPβ51–110 and MBPβ1–215, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). From the same plots, it was calculated that 0.8 and 0.6 mol of spermine were bound per mol of fusion proteins MBPβ51–110 and MBPβ1–215, respectively. The calculated binding affinities fit with the values obtained in the experiments described in Fig. 1 using recombinant wild type CK2. The ligand binding specificities of both fusion proteins were analyzed and compared with those of the recombinant wild type CK2. Recombinant CK2 or the fusion proteins were incubated with [3H]spermine in the presence of spermine, spermidine, putrescine, polylysine (10 μm), and magnesium (10 mm). Spermine was found to be the strongest competitor for the interaction, since the presence of 10 μm spermine decreases the bound [3H]spermine by 60 and 80%, for CK2 and the fusion proteins MBPβ51–110 and MBPβ1–215, respectively (Fig. 3). A 30–50% loss of spermine binding was detected for all three proteins in the presence of spermidine. Putrescine was found to be the weakest competitor decreasing the interaction of spermine by only 10–20%. Polylysine is much less efficient at competing with spermine for binding full-length CK2 (20% displacement) while on both fusion proteins polylysine provokes a 60–80% displacement. Finally, magnesium was shown to antagonize the binding of spermine by 40–70% on all three proteins. Thus, we conclude that the fusion proteins MBPβ51–110, MBPβ1–215, and the oligomeric CK2 exhibit comparable ligand binding specificities. The thermal stability of CK2 was analyzed by the measurement of CK2 activity after preincubation of the enzyme at different temperatures in the absence or presence of 500 μm spermine or 20 mm magnesium. As shown on Fig.4 A, a maximal activity of CK2 alone was determined for preincubation temperatures ranging between 30 and 45 °C. A striking decrease of CK2 activity was detected after preincubation of the enzyme at temperatures between 45 and 55 °C, and the catalytic activity was completely lost at temperatures above 55 °C. Half-maximal activity was obtained at 48 °C. In the presence of 500 μm spermine or 20 mmmagnesium, a maximal CK2 activity was detected for preincubation temperatures ranging between 30 and 40 °C. This activity strongly decreased between 40 and 50 °C. Preincubation temperatures higher than 50 °C led to a total loss of CK2 activity. Under these conditions, half-maximal activities were obtained at 44 °C. A small variation in ionic strength of the buffer (equivalent to ≅50 mm NaCl) was observed after inclusion of 20 mmMgCl2. However, this variation could not account for the change in the thermal stability of the kinase. Similarly, resistivity determination indicated that the spermine-induced change in the thermal stability of CK2 could not be attributed to variation in the ionic strength of the medium. Therefore, the data provide strong evidence for a specific role of spermine in the change of CK2 thermed stability. The spermine binding activity of CK2 preincubated at different temperatures was also measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A maximal binding of spermine (10.0–13.0 pmol) was obtained for CK2 preincubated between 30 and 45 °C (Fig.4 B). A strong decrease of the spermine binding efficiency was observed between 45 and 55 °C and a residual binding activity (15%) was observed after preincubation of the enzyme at temperatures above 55 °C. Half-maximal binding of spermine was reached at 48 °C. To further investigate the effects of spermine on CK2 conformation, a spectroscopic method was used to reliably monitor the structural modifications that accompany the binding of this polyamine to the CK2 holoenzyme. Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded for CK2 at different temperatures in the absence or presence of 500 μm spermine. Fig.5 A shows primary and secondary maxima of the ellipticity at 209 and 223 nm, respectively. A loss of ellipticity was observed as temperatures increased from 20 to 90 °C. This observation is in agreement with a modulation of the CK2 conformation from a well defined structural state into a random conformation. Addition of 500 μm spermine led to a decrease of ellipticity as compared with the corresponding conditions in the absence of spermine. Changes in the spectrum were observed primary in the ellipticity at 209 nm and secondary at 221 nm (Fig.5 B). To compare the thermal stability of CK2 in the absence and presence of 500 μm spermine, the maximal ellipticities measured at 209 nm were represented as a function of the temperature (Fig.6). Both sigmoidal curves were characterized by a maximal ellipticity corresponding to the CK2 folded state and a minimal ellipticity, which was attributed to the random conformation of the denaturated CK2. Half-denaturation constants of 42 and 48 °C were determined for CK2 incubated in the presence and absence of spermine, respectively. Thus the binding of spermine induced a significant difference (6 °C) in the thermal stability of CK2, which may reflect a fundamental change in the conformation of the enzyme. Thermal stability of wild type CK2 and spermine binding-deficient mutant (βAla60,Ala61,Ala63) was also compared at different temperatures (Fig. 7). A maximal CK2 activity was obtained for CK2 preincubated between 30 and 40 °C. A decrease of CK2 activity was detected after preincubation of the enzyme at temperatures between 40 and 55 °C, and the catalytic activity was completely lost at temperatures above 55 °C. Half-maximal activity was obtained at 47 °C. In contrast, a sharp and constant decrease of the catalytic activity of the mutant kinase was observed for temperatures above 30 °C. Under these conditions, half-maximal activities were obtained at 41 °C. Thus the mutant kinase exhibits a much lower thermal stability and the data provide additional evidence for the implication of the acidic region of the β subunit in the polyamine-induced change of CK2 conformation. The biochemical analyses, previously used to demonstrate an interaction of CK2 with polyamines, were expanded in this work to investigate the mechanism by which these ligands stimulate the kinase. Particular attention was paid to the delineation of a polyamine-binding domain and to the detection of conformational changes induced upon binding of polyamines to this domain. We have shown that site-directed mutagenesis of the three glutamic acid residues (Glu60, Glu61, and Glu63) in the acidic stretch of the CK2 β subunit lead to a decrease in the spermine binding affinity of the enzyme which is associated with a loss of spermine-induced stimulation of CK2 activity. These results are in fair agreement with the observations of Boldyreff et al. (30Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12672-12677Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4827-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed an hyperactivated form of a CK2 holoenzyme containing mutations of acidic residues 55–57 and 59–64 of the β subunit. In our study, the effect of spermine on the CK2 activity was analyzed at physiological magnesium concentration (1 mm). Under these conditions, the basal activity of the mutated form of CK2 was found 4 times higher than the activity of the wild type enzyme. Consequently, spermine is able to stimulate the basal activity of the wild type enzyme by 8-fold, while the mutated kinase was stimulated only 2-fold. This difference correlates with the lowered spermine binding affinity observed for the mutant CK2. Interestingly, for spermine concentrations above 50 μm, the kinase activity of the wild type or mutated CK2 were similar. These data support the notion that mutations of specific residues in the acidic region of the CK2 β subunit eliminate a catalytic autoinhibition which is responsible, in physiological conditions, for the low basal activity of the wild type CK2. Thus, this effect would represent an intrasteric regulation of CK2 involving its β subunit. Previous observations have shown that a photoactivable spermine analog interacts with specific residues in a highly acidic stretch lying between amino acid residues 51 and 80. These data together with the observation that mutations of acidic residues in this region affect both the polyamine binding affinity and the polyamine-induced stimulation of the enzyme point to the likelihood that this region represents an important CK2 regulatory domain. This contention is supported by the experiments showing that a fusion protein involving the β subunit region Asp51 to Pro110 exhibits an efficient and specific polyamine binding activity similar to that observed for a fusion protein containing the full-length β subunit. As compared with CK2 holoenzyme, both fusion proteins exhibit a 2.5 higher affinity for spermine. A possible interpretation for this difference would be that the conformation of the β subunit changes when it is associated with the catalytic subunit. The second interpretation which is not exclusive of the first, is that the higher polyamine binding affinity of the free β subunit is due to the absence of interactions between its spermine-binding domain and the α subunit catalytic site (see below). Thus the polyamine-binding domain of the CK2 β subunit is still functional when it is isolated from the full-length protein, a situation already described for the well known SH2, SH3, and PH domains. For instance, SH2 and SH3 domains isolated from the proteins phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-associated protein p85 and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase exhibit full binding efficiencies for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and proline-rich peptides, respectively (32Felder S. Zhou M. Hu P. Urena J. Ullrich A. Chaudhuri M. White M. Shoelson S.E. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 33Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Similarly, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains isolated from the proteins phospholipase C-δ1 and pleckstrin were shown to specifically bind inositol phosphates (34Lemonn M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brian R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In a series of experiments designed to test the possibility that the binding of polyamines could induce changes in the CK2 conformation, it was observed that the thermal stability of the enzyme was affected by the presence of polyamines and magnesium. A difference of 4 °C in the T m values was observed for the holoenzyme incubated in the absence or presence of spermine or magnesium. This is large enough to correspond to a loss of CK2 stability upon spermine or magnesium binding. By analogy, a shift of 7 °C was recorded for theT m of the T4 lysozyme containing an engineered disulfide bond as compared with the T m of the wild type T4 lysozyme (35Perry L.J. Wetzel R. Science. 1984; 226: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 36Wetzel R. Perry L.J. Baase W.A. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study, the difference in thermal stability was interpreted as reflecting a change in the conformation of the mutated protein, providing a protection against a conformationally-related irreversible inactivation. The effect of spermine on the thermal stability of CK2 was also readily monitored over a wide range of temperatures by using far UV circular dichroism analyses. Raising the temperature induces a decrease in the ellipticity at 209 and 221 nm. Upon spermine binding a striking change in the ellipticity recorded at 209 nm was observed and a difference of 6 °C in the half-denaturation constants for CK2 incubated in the absence or presence of spermine was determined. Again this difference, which fits with the change in the T m values obtained in the study of the thermal inactivation of CK2 activity, is a strong indication that the observed loss of CK2 stability reflects a spermine-induced change in the enzyme conformation. The modifications in the circular dichroism spectra observed in the presence of spermine may arise from a decrease of the helical feature of the polyamine-binding domain complexed with spermine. Based on enzymatic and spectroscopic data, we propose a possible mechanism for the regulation of CK2 activity by polyamines. The CK2 holoenzyme is drawn as a globular sphere representing the association of the α catalytic subunit with the β regulatory subunit (Fig.8). In addition to the C-terminal domain, which is involved in the tight interaction between the two subunits (30Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12672-12677Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the complex is stabilized by four electrostatic interactions between the positively charged region of the α catalytic site and the highly negative stretch of the polyamine-binding domain of the β subunit. The resulting closed conformation is maintained in the presence of 1 mm magnesium and is responsible for the steric obstruction of the catalytic site and the limited access of protein substrates. Addition of spermine or increasing the magnesium concentration leads to the release of the polyamine-binding domain, resulting in an open conformation. The efficiency of the substrate binding to the catalytic pocket is consequently enhanced and the overall kinase activity is stimulated. This model takes into account the thermal denaturation studies, which show that, in the absence of spermine or high magnesium concentrations, the enzyme exists in a stable form (corresponding to the closed conformation), whereas, upon spermine or magnesium binding, the kinase adopts a less stable form possibly reflecting the open conformation. This model is also supported by the experiments performed on a CK2 holoenzyme containing specific mutations in the polyamine-binding domain. The prediction is that a decrease in the number of electrostatic interactions between the β subunit polyamine-binding domain and the α subunit catalytic site would lead to a weaker interaction resulting in a more efficient conversion to the open conformation, and an increased catalytic activity at low magnesium concentrations. As a result, the mutant was found to have a lowered thermal stability and a difference of 5 °C in the half-denaturation constants was observed for the wild type and mutant kinase. The polyamine-induced change in the CK2 conformation is also supported by our previous observations that both the maximal velocity of the catalytic reaction and the affinity of the kinase for its substrate increase in the presence of spermine (37Leroy D. Valero E. Filhol O. Heriché J.-K. Goldberg Y. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 441-453PubMed Google Scholar). According to our model, the accessibility of the catalytic site, which depends greatly on the kinase conformation, should be also influenced by the size of the protein substrate. This is in keeping with our observations that the optimal phosphorylation of a substrate such as casein by either the free catalytic subunit or the CK2 holoenzyme requires very different magnesium concentrations (7 and 20 mm, respectively). In contrast, an optimal phosphorylation of the small peptide substrate RRRDDDSEEE by both forms of CK2 is observed at the same magnesium concentration (7 mm). Moreover, the phosphorylation of this peptide substrate by the CK2 holoenzyme was found to be totally insensitive to polyamines at physiological magnesium concentrations. 3D. Leroy and C. Cochet, unpublished results. In summary, CK2 appears to be the target of an intrasteric regulation that involves an autoinhibition of its catalytic subunit by the β regulatory subunit. The driving force for this inhibition requires the acidic region of the β subunit, which is able to bind polyamines. The binding of polybasic ligands to this domain releases an intrasteric inhibition and allows access of the catalytic cleft to large protein substrates. These experimental results predict that the region of the β subunit that blocks the catalytic site has a relatively large freedom of movement. In this respect, CK2 belongs to the growing list of modular protein kinases such as protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase which catalytic sites are autoinhibited by regulatory domains (38House C.

https://openalex.org/W1972504457,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are composed of α, β, γ, and δ subunits, assembled into α2βγδ pentamers. A highly conserved feature of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors, such as AChRs, is a 15-amino acid cystine “loop.” We find that an intact cystine loop is necessary for complete AChR assembly. By preventing formation of the loop with 5 mm dithiothreitol, AChR subunits assemble into αβγ trimers, but the subsequent steps in assembly are blocked. When α subunit loop cysteines are mutated to serines, assembly is blocked at the same step as with dithiothreitol. In contrast, when β subunit loop cysteines are mutated to serines, assembly is blocked at a later step, i.e. after assembly of αβγδ tetramers and before the addition of the second α subunit. After formation of the cystine loop, the α subunit undergoes a conformational change, which buries the loop. This conformational change is concurrent with the step in assembly blocked by removal of the disulfide bond of the cystine loop, i.e. after assembly of αβγ trimers and before the addition of the δ subunit. The data indicate that the α subunit conformational change involving the cystine loop is key to a series of folding events that allow the addition of unassembled subunits.

The data indicate that the α subunit conformational change involving the cystine loop is key to a series of folding events that allow the addition of unassembled subunits. The molecular events involved in subunit folding and assembly of large oligomeric proteins remain largely uncharacterized. The subunit folding and oligomerization events that take place during the assembly of ion channels are particularly complex, since the finished product requires the correct oligomeric arrangement and subunit stoichiometry for proper function (1Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In terms of their structure, the best characterized ion channels are the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; BuTx, α-bungarotoxin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol. which are the neurotransmitter receptors responsible for rapid signaling between motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Muscle-type AChRs are composed of four distinct, homologous subunits, α, β, γ, and δ, which assemble into pentamers with the subunit stoichiometry of α2βγδ. Although AChR assembly is a slow process that takes ∼2 h to complete (2Merlie J.P. Lindstrom J. Cell. 1983; 34: 747-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), assembly intermediates have been difficult to isolate. A number of laboratories turned to expression of less than the full complement of subunits in different heterologous expression systems to isolate assembly intermediates (3Blount P. Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Saedi M.S. Conroy W.G. Lindstrom J. J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on their findings, the “heterodimer” model was proposed, where the α subunit must first fold or “mature,” as assayed by the formation of the α-bungarotoxin (BuTx) binding site and antigenic epitopes, before assembling with other subunits. The mature α subunit assembles with γ or δ subunits in parallel to form αγ and αδ heterodimers, and the heterodimers associate together and with β subunits to form α2βγδ pentamers. We have developed techniques that have allowed isolation of assembly intermediates in cells stably expressing all four AChR subunits (7Claudio T. Green W.N. Hartman D.S. Hayden D. Paulson H.L. Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Swedlund A. Science. 1987; 238: 1688-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and have obtained results at odds with the heterodimer model. Instead of heterodimers, two partially assembled complexes, αβγ trimers and αβγδ tetramers, were isolated. αβγ trimers, which assemble extremely rapidly, were assembled first into αβγδ tetramers and then into α2βγδ pentamers. Our data demonstrated that assembly occurs sequentially, each step being the addition of an uncomplexed subunit. We also demonstrated that the α subunit maturation steps, which were thought to precede its assembly, occurred after assembly into αβγ trimers but prior to the addition of the δ subunit. These folding events require a specific combination of subunits and correlate in time with the δ subunit addition. The data led us to suggest that the α subunit maturation steps are folding events forming the δ subunit recognition site,i.e. the site where the δ subunit associates with the αβγ trimer. Our goal has been to identify posttranslational processing sites and regions on the AChR subunits involved in AChR subunit folding and assembly. A good candidate is the highly conserved region defined by a pair of cysteine residues separated by a stretch of 13 amino acids, which is found on the neurotransmitter-binding, extracellular domain of the subunits (Fig. 1, A and B). The two cysteines form a disulfide bridge on all four Torpedo AChR subunits (9Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8085-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kellaris K.V. Ware D.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3469-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Analogous cystine “loops” appear to form on other neurotransmitter-gated ion channel subunits, which include all muscle and neuronal AChR subunits and all GABAA, glycine, and 5HT3 receptor subunits. Other residues in the loop are identically conserved across species from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals and are even conserved on some of the glutamate receptor subunits (11Hollmann M. O'Shea G.A. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S. Nature. 1989; 342: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations of the cysteines in the α subunit prevented BuTx binding site formation and reduced AChR expression (12Mishina M. Tobimatsu T. Tanaka K. Fujita Y. Fukuda K. Kurasake M. Takahashi H. Morimoto Y. Hirose T. Inayama S. Takahasi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1985; 313: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which suggested that the cystine loop is critical for subunit conformational stability or assembly. A recent study where the conserved proline in the cystine loop (see Fig.1, A and B) was mutated also suggested that the cystine loop may play a role in subunit assembly (13Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31479-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, mutated α or β subunits lacking the cystine loop disulfide bond assembled with other wild type subunits (14Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Sumikawa K. Gehle V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6286-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and produced functional receptors (15Sumikawa K. Gehle V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6286-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was suggested that formation of the cystine loop is not required for subunit assembly but instead plays an important role in the rate that subunits are degraded and in the efficiency of transport of AChRs to the cell surface. Contrary to this viewpoint, we demonstrate in this paper that an intact cystine loop is essential for proper AChR subunit assembly. Elimination of the cystine loop separately on the α and β subunits blocks different steps during assembly. For the α subunit, the cystine loop undergoes a conformational change, which appears to be an event required for assembly to continue.Figure 5Elimination of the cystine loop disulfide on the β subunit. A, AChR subunit assembly in the αβ128γδ cell line. αβ128γδ cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for the indicated times. Labeled subunits were immunoprecipitated with a mixture (cocktail) of α, β, γ, and δ subunit-specific antibodies (lane 1), the β subunit-specific mAb 148 (lanes 2–6), or mAb 14 (lane 7). As in Fig. 2, A and B, the band labeled as α′ coprecipitates with the other subunits. The band (∼43 kDa) that migrates between the α and β subunit bands is believed to be actin. B, the rate of β128 subunit degradation. Displayed are the scanned values for the β128 subunit bands and the α subunits that coprecipitated with the β128 subunits in Fig.5 A. The data are plotted on a semilog scale. The half-life was estimated to be 15.4 h for β128 subunits based on a least squares fit of an exponential function to the data, which is within the range of values found for the wild type subunits under the same conditions. C, sedimentation of αβ128γδ subunit complexes. αβ128γδ and αβγδ cells were bound with125I-BuTx as in Fig. 3 B and size-fractionated on a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient. Shown are 125I counts from the 125I-BuTx-bound intracellular complexes in fractions 4–14, which were immunoprecipitated with the β subunit-specific mAb 148. αβγδ cell surface complexes were first bound with cold BuTx to block 125I-BuTx binding to the surface AChRs. Also displayed on the figure are the standards, alkaline phosphatase (5.4 S), catalase (11 S), and surface α2βγδ complexes (9 S; dashed line). The αβ128γδ complexes peak at 8 S as estimated from a least squares linear regression fit to the S values of the standards. The shape of the intracellular αβγδ profile can be duplicated by the sum of the intracellular αβ128γδ profile reduced by 60% plus the 9 S peak cell-surface α2βγδ complexes. This indicates that intracellular αβ128γδ complexes are similar in size and composition to intracellular αβγδ complexes with the exception of the α2βγδ complexes in the 9 S peak. The broad profile observed for the intracellular AChR complexes relative to the cell surface α2βγδ 9 S peak has been seen in other studies both for the Torpedosubunits at reduced temperature (4Saedi M.S.

Displayed is the quantification of the mAb 14-precipitated α, β, γ, and δ subunit bands analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified from resultant fluorographs by scanning densitometry. Also displayed for comparison are the scanned values of the δ subunits coprecipitating with the precipitated γ subunits. The percentage assembled values are the scanned values divided by the value for the β subunit at the 48-h chase time (100%) and are shown to emphasize the time course of the α subunit doubling. D, the rate of γ subunit degradation in the absence or presence of DTT. Displayed are the scanned values for the γ subunit bands chased in the absence or presence of DTT and precipitated by the γ subunit-specific mAb (Fig. 2, A and B). Also displayed are values for the β subunits that coprecipitate with the γ subunits in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2 A). The data are plotted on a semilog scale. In the absence of DTT, the decay of the γ subunit signal is biphasic. The slowly decaying component corresponds to assembled γ subunits as shown by the similar rate of decay of the assembled β subunits. To estimate the rate of decay of unassembled γ subunits, the 48-h value was subtracted from the other values and plotted as the γ adjusted symbols.

The labeling was stopped with the addition of DMEM containing 5 mmmethionine and, if not “chased,” two washes of ice-cold PBS. To follow the subsequent changes in the labeled subunits, the cells were chased. Specifically, these cells were washed two more times with DMEM containing 5 mm methionine and incubated for various times in NB medium at 20 °C in the absence or presence of 5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). After a [35S]methionine pulse chase, cultures were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide plus 1% solubilizing agent. In some of the experiments, 1 mm MgATP replaced the 5 mm EDTA to reduce the amount of actin that nonspecifically precipitated with the subunits. To solubilize the labeled subunits, a Lubrol-phosphatidylcholine mixture composed of 1.83 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine and 1% Lubrol was used. Antibody-subunit complexes were precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixed, enhanced for 30 min, dried on a gel dryer, and exposed to film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Autoradiographs were quantified by scanning densitometry using a flatbed scanner and analyzed with the Intelligent Quantifier software from BioImage. To measure cell surface125I-BuTx binding, cultures were grown at 37 °C for 36 h in NB medium and then shifted to 20 °C for 48 h. Cultures were washed with PBS and incubated at room temperature in PBS containing 4 nm125I-BuTx (140–170 cpm/fmol) for 2 h, which results in the saturation of binding. Cultures were washed again and solubilized, and the cell surface counts were determined by γ-counting, or counts were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies and counted. Total cell 125I-BuTx binding was measured after solubilization. In this case, cell lysates were incubated in 10 nm125I-BuTx at 4 °C overnight to saturate binding at this lower temperature. The125I-BuTx in the lysates was then immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. To distinguish subunit complexes on the basis of their size, solubilized subunits (labeled with [35S]methionine and/or bound by 125I-BuTx) were sedimented on sucrose gradients. For this procedure, lysates were layered on a 5-ml 5–20% linear sucrose gradient prepared in the appropriate lysis buffer. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm to ω2 t = 9.0 × 1011. ∼17 fractions (300 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient, and the appropriate antibodies were then added to the fractions to be assayed. When added extracellularly to cultured cells, DTT reaches the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents the formation of protein disulfide bonds without altering most other cellular functions (18Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing the four Torpedo AChR subunits were subjected to an [35S]methionine pulse-chase protocol in the absence or presence of 5 mm DTT (Fig. 2,A and B). Labeled subunits were immunoprecipitated with either a γ subunit-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 168) or α subunit, conformation-dependent mAb 14, to assay for subunit assembly and formation of the mAb 14 epitope. During a 30-min pulse of [35S]methionine, αβγ trimers formed as shown by the coprecipitation of predominantly α and β subunits with the γ subunits (Fig.2 A). During the chase in the absence of DTT, progressively more δ subunits are added to the trimers, followed by the addition of the second α subunit as shown by the doubling in the amount of α subunit relative to the other coprecipitated subunits. These two subunit additions are better resolved by the mAb 14 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2, A and C). Since the mAb 14 epitope forms on αβγ trimers just prior to the addition of the δ subunit (8Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), these immunoprecipitations show the complete time course of both the addition of the δ and second α subunits to the αβγ trimers. In the presence of DTT, the subunits clearly retain the ability to assemble into αβγ trimers and with approximately the same efficiency as occurs in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2 B). This result is at odds with a recent study (19Gelman M.S. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10709-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which suggested that 5 mm DTT completely blocks AChR subunit assembly. There are several differences between this and the other study that explain the conflicting results. Probably the most important difference in terms of the ability to observe αβγ trimers was that their only assay for measuring the assembly of α subunits with other subunits was an immunoprecipitation with δ subunit-specific antibodies. Obviously, αβγ trimers could never be observed with this assay. Another difference was the protocol used to solubilize the AChR subunit complexes. We have shown previously that solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 causes the assembly intermediates to dissociate and that the subunit associations are stable when solubilized with a combination of Lubrol PX and phosphatidylcholine (8Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After αβγ trimers assemble in the presence of 5 mmDTT, the ensuing subunit associations, the addition of the δ and second α subunits, fail to occur, and the αβγ trimers that had assembled were degraded 48 h after the [35S]methionine pulse (Fig. 2 B). γ subunits in the presence of DTT degrade at about the same rate as unassembled γ subunits in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2 D). Subunit complexes degrade more rapidly in the presence of DTT because the complexes are no longer stabilized by events subsequent to trimer formation. Although there are almost as many αβγ trimers present with DTT at the times when δ subunits normally assemble with αβγ trimers (Fig. 2, A and B; 3- and 6-h chase), the formation of αβγδ tetramers and α2βγδ pentamers is inhibited in the presence of DTT. Furthermore, the BuTx binding site (Figs. 2 E and3 A) and the mAb 14 epitope (Fig. 2 B) do not form on the αβγ trimers in the presence of DTT. We conclude that the additio"

Although recent data have implicated PLD in receptor-stimulated secretion, the regulation of the activity of PLD enzymes remains to be clarified. Purified hPLD1 is activated by several cytosolic cofactors among which are protein kinase Cα, ARF, and RhoA. In human granulocytes, a strong correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and PLD activity has been established. In this study, the presence of hPLD1 in HL-60 granulocytes and its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues have been studied. We generated antipeptide antibodies (Abs) specific for hPLD1 but not PLD2 as shown by Western blotting (WB) of recombinant PLD1 and PLD2. These Abs identified the presence of hPLD1 in HL-60 cells with the bulk of it being detected in the membranes and only a minor fraction in the cytosol. The hPLD1 Abs detected a major band at 120 kDa (PLD1a) and a minor band at 115 kDa (PLD1b). The specificity of the Abs was confirmed using PLD antisera neutralized with the immunizing peptides. The two forms of hPLD1 were consistently detected by immunoprecipitation under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions following a WB analysis with hPLD1 Abs. Following exposure of HL-60 cells to peroxides of vanadate (V4+-OOH), an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, hPLD1 was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions from HL-60 cell lysates and assayed for tyrosine phosphorylation by WB. hPLD1 comigrated with a 120-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein by gel electrophoresis. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides of 160, 140, 135, 90, and 75–80 kDa were also detected in hPLD1 immune complexes. hPLD1 and the associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were not immunoprecipitated by neutralized hPLD1 Abs. Using denaturing conditions, the PLD immunoprecipitates were sequentially immunoblotted with anti-PLD1 and anti-phosphotyrosine Abs. PLD1a and PLD1b were detected, and the major PLD1a protein was superimposable with a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected at 120 kDa. Conversely, PLD1a and PLD1b were recovered, at least in part, in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. These results provide evidence that two PLD1 forms are expressed in human granulocytes.

The latter is a second messenger implicated in the regulation of many signaling proteins (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). PA can also be dephosphorylated by PA phosphohydrolases to diacylglycerol, which is an activator of certain isoforms of protein kinase C (2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar).

Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological function of PLD in cells is poorly understood, the receptor-stimulated PLD activity has been implicated in a broad range of human granulocyte cellular responses, including stimulated superoxide production and secretion (3Cockcroft S.

Protein kinase activities regulate, at least in part, the recruitment and the membrane association of ARF and RhoA, thereby potentiating the response to GTPγS in HL-60 cell membranes (24Houle M.G.

Furthermore, inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases such as peroxides of vanadate (V4+-OOH), stimulate PLD activity by G protein-independent (25Bourgoin S. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

The present study was undertaken to examine the presence and distribution as well as the potential tyrosine phosphorylation status of hPLD1 in HL-60 granulocytes. We provide evidence that V4+-OOH induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of hPLD1 and stimulates its association with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe generated hPLD1 antipeptide antisera to examine the presence of hPLD1 in human HL-60 cells. To minimize proteolysis, the cell lysates were prepared by direct transfer of cell suspensions into boiling sample buffer. The samples were electrophoresed, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with the anti-PLD1 serum 03 and 04. rPLD1 (Fig.1, A and B,lane 1) and rPLD2 (Fig. 1, A and B,lane 2) were added to the membrane samples before electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the anti-PLD1 sera. As shown in Fig. 1 the antibodies revealed a strong band at 120 kDa corresponding to rPLD1. rPLD2 was not recognized by the two anti-PLD1 sera. The presence of two immunoreactive bands in HL-60 granulocytes at 115 kDa and 120 kDa were consistently observed (lane 5). The immunoreactivity of the 120- and 115-kDa protein suggested the presence of two closely related PLD1 enzymes in HL-60 cells. The specificity of the two anti-PLD1 sera was demonstrated by the absence of the 120- and 115-kDa bands in immunoblots carried out with antigen-preneutralized antibodies (data not shown). The two immunoreactive bands at 120 and 115 kDa were detected in the membrane (lane 3) and to a lesser extent in the cytosolic (lane 4) compartments. Searches for hPLD1 isoforms revealed the presence of several closely related human PLD homologues (18Yoshimura S. Nakashima S. Ohguchi K. Sakai H. Shinoda J. Sakai N. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Ribbes G. Henry J. Cariven C. Pontarotti P. Chap H. Record M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis identified a second PLD1-related protein lacking 38 amino acids in the middle of the PLD1 sequence (amino acids 584–622). The 120- and 115-kDa PLD variants were named PLD1a and PLD1b, respectively (21Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). PLD1a and PLD1b are generated by alternative splicing of the PLD1 mRNA, and both forms are similarly sensitive to activation by small GTPases and protein kinase Cα (21Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It is likely that the two bands revealed by the anti-PLD1 sera correspond to PLD1a and PLD1b.Figure 1Immunoblot of the PLD1 from HL-60 cells.HL-60 cells (2 × 106 cells), cytosolic (C), and membrane (M) proteins (100 μg) were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and probed with the anti-PLD1 serum 03 (A) and 04 (B). Where indicated, rPLD1 or rPLD2 were added to the samples. The autoradiograms were obtained after a 30-min exposure with the membrane.

Bourgoin S. Jean N. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 522-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased PLD activity was also detected in the anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates of neutrophil lysates previously primed with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and stimulated with fMLP (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine) (29Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, granulocyte PLD activity was increased by a treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors such as V4+-OOH. 2As described previously (25Bourgoin S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in two independent experiments the levels of the phosphatidylethanol in intact HL-60 cells increased from 0.011 ± 0.01% of tritium label in control cells to 0.955 ± 0.11% of tritium label in cells stimulated with 100 μm V4+-OOH for 10 min. The molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are, however, poorly understood as it remained unclear whether PLD itself, or one or more of its cofactors, were subject to regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation. To assess the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of PLD, we immunoprecipitated PLD using the anti-PLD1 serum under nondenaturing and under denaturing conditions. HL-60 granulocytes were incubated with V4+-OOH (100 μm) or an equal volume of the diluent for the indicated times. The samples were prepared by direct transfer of the cell suspensions to an equal volume of ice-cold 2 × nondenaturing lysis buffer. The lysates were incubated with the PLD1 antibodies (preneutralized or not with the peptide antigens), and the immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads. The amounts of precipitated PLD1 and the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the precipitates were monitored, following transfer to PVDF membranes, by successive immunoblotting with anti-PLD1 and anti-Tyr(P) antibodies, respectively. Although PLD1 could be immunoprecipitated by the anti-PLD1 serum after the second immunization (Fig.2 A, lane 2) immunoprecipitation of PLD1 was more efficient after the fifth immunization (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–7). As shown in Fig. 2 A, two major bands corresponding to PLD1a and PLD1b were detected at 120 and 115 kDa, respectively. The two forms of PLD1 were recovered in the supernatant when the immunoprecipitations were carried out with a normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) or with the preneutralized PLD1 antibodies (Fig. 2 A,lane 8). The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (Fig. 2 B). A 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was reproducibly observed in PLD1 immunoprecipitates. Several other tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides of 160, 140, 135, 90, and 75–80 kDa were also detected in PLD1 immune complexes. Phosphorylation of the 120-kDa band as well as the presence of the other phosphorylated proteins in the PLD1 immune complexes was time-dependent reaching near-maximal levels between 5 and 10 min after the addition of V4+-OOH. PLD1a, PLD1b, and the associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were not detected in the immunoprecipitates carried out with a normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2,A and B, lane 1) or with the preneutralized PLD1 antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B,lane 8).To examine whether the 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is PLD1 itself or an associated protein, cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with the anti-PLD1 serum were conducted under reducing conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative blot for PLD1 under these conditions is shown in Fig.3 A. Both PLD1a and PLD1b were detected in the PLD1 immunoprecipitates. Similar amounts of PLD1a and PLD1b were immuprecipitated from control (lane 1) and V4+-OOH treated cells (lane 2). As compared with unstimulated cells, a major 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was observed in the immmunoprecitates derived from V4+-OOH-stimulated cells (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) but not from unstimulated granulocytes (Fig. 3 B,lane 1). Neutralization of the anti-PLD1 serum with the immunizing peptides specifically eliminated PLD1a and PLD1b in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) as well as the 120-kDa phosphorylated protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD1b was hardly detectable probably because of the small amounts of PLD1b in the PLD1 immunoprecipitates. These experiments were also performed using the reverse protocol, immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies and blotting with anti-PLD1 antibodies (Fig.4). Because of the large amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in lysates derived from V4+-OOH-treated cells and the low abundance of the PLD1 enzymes, we conducted two rounds of immunoprecipitations. A first immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-PLD1 serum under nonreducing conditions because the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of PLD1 was higher under these conditions (data not shown). The PLD1 immune complexes were collected and boiled in lysis buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. These manipulations would be expected to disrupt most, if not all, protein-protein interactions. After removing the denaturing agents (27Al-Shami A. Gilbert C. Barabe F. Gaudry M. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) antibodies, and the amounts of PLD1 in the immunoprecipitates were assessed by WB. A representative blot of these experiments is shown in Fig.4 A. The presence of PLD1a and PLD1b in the anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates was evident after stimulation with V4+-OOH (lane 2) but not in unstimulated cells (lane 1). Moreover, the PLD1 proteins were not detected in the immune complexes when the first round of immunoprecipitation was carried out with preneutralized anti-PLD1 serum (lane 3). The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (Fig. 4 B). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected at 120 kDa in V4+-OOH-stimulated cells (Fig. 4 B,lane 2) was superimposable with PLD1a (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). In contrast, no tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins could be detected in unstimulated cells (lane 1) or when immunoprecipitations were performed with neutralized anti-PLD1 serum (lane 3). Taken together these results demonstrate that PLD1a and possibly PLD1b can be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of intact HL-60 cells with V4+-OOH.Figure 3Immunoprecipitation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated PLD1. HL-60 cells were stimulated without (lane 1) or with (lanes 2 and 3) 100 μm V4+-OOH for 10 min. PLD1 was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions. Where indicated, immunoprecipitation was performed with the peptide-neutralized anti-PLD1 serum 03 (lane 3). The immune complexes were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and blotted with the anti-PLD1 serum 04 (A) and the anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (B).

HL-60 cells were stimulated without (lane 1) or without (lanes 2and 3) 100 μm V4+-OOH for 10 min. PLD1 was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions as described in Fig. 2. Where indicated, immunoprecipitation was performed with neutralized anti-PLD1 serum 03 (lane 3). The PLD1 immune complexes were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with the anti-Tyr(P) antibodies using denaturing conditions. The Tyr(P) immune complexes were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. The samples were analyzed for the presence of PLD1 (A) and of phosphotyrosine (B). One experiment representative of two with similar results is presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biochemical studies have detected PLD activities in both the membrane and the cytosolic fractions of HL-60 cells (11Siddiqi A.R.

The differential regulation of the membrane-associated and of the cytosolic PLD activity by Rho and ARF proteins suggested the presence of distinct PLD isoforms. We analyzed the presence and the distribution of PLD1a and PLD1b in the different cellular compartments of HL-60 granulocytes. In these experiments the membranes and the cytosols were prepared (24Houle M.G. Kahn R.A. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22795-22800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PLD1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates derived from 2 × 107 cell eq with the anti-PLD1 serum, and the amounts of PLD1a and PLD1b in the immunoprecipitates were determined by blotting with the anti-PLD1 antibodies. A representative blot from three different experiments with similar results is shown in Fig.5. Although PLD1a and PLD1b could be detected in the immunoprecipitates of both membrane and cytosolic compartments (Fig. 5 A), the two PLD1 proteins were predominantly recovered in the membrane fractions. A similar distribution of PLD1a and PLD1b in the membrane fractions of V4+-OOH-stimulated and nonstimulated HL-60 cells was observed, excluding a redistribution of the proteins upon cell stimulation. The same blot was subsequently probed for the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 B, no tyrosine-phosphorylated protein could be detected in the PLD immunoprecipitates from unstimulated HL-60 cells. In contrast, stimulation with V4+-OOH resulted in an increase of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cytosolic and membrane PLD immunoprecipitates. In the cytosolic fractions, two bands at 135 and ∼85 kDa were detected but we did not observe the presence of a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. The protein could not be detected by WB because of the small amount of PLD1 proteins in the immunoprecipitates obtained from cytosolic protein fractions (Fig.5 A). In the membrane fractions, a major 120-kDa phosphotyrosine protein was detected and was superimposable with PLD1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Several major unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the 160-, 85–100-, and 75–80-kDa regions were also recovered in the PLD1 immunoprecipitates. We also immunoprecipitated the membrane-bound and cytosolic PLD1 under denaturing conditions (28Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18122-18125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A doublet at 120 kDa and 115 kDa in the membrane fractions of V4+-OOH-stimulated or unstimulated HL-60 cells was detected by the anti-PLD1 serum (Fig. 5 C). The cytosolic PLD1 was hardly detectable by WB (data not shown). In this particular experiment the membrane-bound PLD1b was not clearly detected in the immune complexes obtained from V4+-OOH-treated cells but was present in two other similar experiments (see Fig. 3 and data not shown). These same membranes were probed for the presence of phosphotyrosine. In the membrane PLD1 immunoprecipitates, a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band was detected in cells stimulated with V4+-OOH. The tyrosine-phosphorylated band was perfectly superimposable with PLD1a and showed a similar shape (Fig. 5, C and D). The data indicate that the membrane-bound PLD1a is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Because of the low amount of cytosolic PLD1 proteins, it was not possible using this protocol to determine whether or not they were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Although these observations indicate that PLDs with similar antigenic properties can exist as soluble and membrane-associated proteins, the presence of additional PLD isoforms not recognized by our PLD1 antibodies is not excluded.Figure 5Subcellular distribution of PLD1 in control and V4+-OOH-stimulated HL60 cells. Cytosol (C) and membrane (M) were isolated from cells stimulated with or without 100 μm V4+-OOH for 10 min. Membrane and cytosolic PLD were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing (A, B) or denaturing conditions (C, D). Immune complexes were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and probed with the anti-PLD1 serum 04 (A, C).

We demonstrate direct interactions in vitro between pX and the bZip proteins tested. In contrast MyoD and Gal41–147 fail to interact with pX. We also demonstrate by the mammalian two-hybrid assay the direct interaction of pX with cAMP response element- binding protein, ICER IIγ, ATF3, and NF-IL6 in hepatocytes. In addition, pX increases the DNA binding potential of bZip proteins for their cognate DNA-binding site in vitro. In transient transfections in hepatocytes (AML12 cell line), pX increases the transcriptional efficacy of the bZip transcription factors. NF-IL6-mediated transcriptional activation is enhanced 3-fold by pX. Most interestingly, pX augments the repression mediated by bZip repressors ATF3 and ICER IIγ, by 6- and 7-fold, respectively, demonstrating for the first time the involvement of pX in gene repression. We conclude that pX is an enhancer of the DNA binding potential of bZip transcription factors, thereby increasing the transactivation or repression efficacy of bZip-responsive genes.

Interestingly, pX does not appear to bind double-stranded DNA. These multiple X-responsive, cis-acting elements suggest that the mechanism of pX action is pleiotropic. Studies to date support pX transactivation by a dual mechanism, i.e. both the activation of cytoplasmic signaling pathways and direct interactions with cellular transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery. Regarding this dual mechanism, pX activates in vivo the Ras, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and JNK signaling pathways, leading to transactivation of AP-1 and NF-κB sites (27Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 30Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J.

Yi M.-K. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), TBP (33Qadri I. Maguire H.F. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that pX is a general viral transactivator, acting by influencing the coactivator process (35Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct interactions between pX and cellular transcription factors have been uniquely demonstrated for the CREB/ATF family of proteins (1Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). CREB, which mediates the transcriptional induction of the cAMP-transduction pathway (36Andrisani O. Zhu Z. Pot D. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Gonzalez G.A. Montiminy M. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), is also the interaction target of the HTLVI Tax oncoprotein (38Adya N. Giam C.-Z. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bantignies F. Rousset R. Desbois C. Jalinot P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated that the interaction of pX with CREB increases by 1 order of magnitude its affinity for the CRE site, thereby increasing its in vivotranscriptional efficacy by 13-fold. In contrast to the CREB/Tax interactions (40Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), pX does not enhance the dimerization rate of CREB; it seems to target the basic, DNA-binding region of CREB (1Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the potential interaction of pX with other bZip transcription factors normally expressed in the hepatocyte. Our hypothesis is that pX interacts not only with CREB but also with other bZip proteins, by recognizing common structural features shared by bZip proteins (41Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweller A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we selected for analysis bZip proteins that play a role in hepatocyte physiology such as, NF-IL6 or C/EBPβ (42Akira S. Ishiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Hishio Y.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), it contains substitutions of three conserved residues in the basic region critical for DNA binding. Therefore, heterodimers of gadd153/Chop10 and C/EBP-like proteins are unable to bind to their cognate DNA binding site (43Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that gadd153/Chop10 functions as a stress-inducible transcriptional inhibitor (43Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that in certain cases gadd153/Chop10 may function as a direct transcriptional activator (54Ubeda M. Wang X.-Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATF3, is also of interest in this study since it is a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, sharing sequence similarity with the bZip domain of CREB and binding to the CRE site (44Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). However, while CREB is a positive regulator of transcription, ATF3 is a transcriptional repressor (56Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that ATF3 is induced by a variety of physiological stress conditions, such as mechanically injured and toxin-injured liver (55Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, during carbon tetrachloride injury of liver, gadd153/Chop10 and ATF3mRNAs are inversely induced but in an overlapping manner; gadd153/Chop10 mRNA, high in normal liver, decreases upon CCl4 exposure; ATF3 mRNA, low in normal liver, increases upon CCl4 exposure (55Chen B.P.C.

Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), a member of the cAMP-responsive element modulator subfamily of bZip proteins, is of interest since it is an inducible repressor, displaying high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the bZip of CREB and is devoid of a transactivation domain. Thus, ICER IIγ provides an ideal model system to demonstrate the effect of pX in repression of bZip transcription. Recent studies demonstrated ICER IIγ expression in liver regeneration (80Servillo G.

Plasmids GST-X1–154 and GST-X49–154 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction of pX DNA fragments corresponding either to amino acid residues 1–154 or 49–154 cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of plasmid pGEX-KG (61Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). GST-X fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), as described previously (62Williams J.S. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bacterial extract obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture was bound to 500 μl of resin for 30 min and washed (62Williams J.S. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of GST and GST-X1–154 bound to the resin was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE and by comparison to known amounts of bovine serum albumin run on the same gel. In vitroprotein-protein interaction assays were carried out as follows: 10 μg of GST and 2 μg of GST-X1–154 proteins immobilized onto 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin were incubated with 4 μl of TnT lysate for 3 h at 4 °C, in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation, the beads were washed six times in the above buffer. Analysis of the bound protein was by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. DNA protein binding assays were carried out as described previously (1Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).

The nucleotide sequence spanning positions −165 to −173 of the HIV-LTR (58Tesmer V.M. Rajadhyaksha A. Babin J. Bina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins for ICER IIγ, ATF3, gadd153/Chop10, ATF3/gadd153/Chop10, and MyoD/E47 were obtained by in vitro translation (TnT, Promega); 1–3 μl of in vitro translation mixture was used for each reaction. Bacterially produced CREB327 (70Colbran J.L. Fiol C.J. Roach P. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem.

Recombinant GST-X49–154 was added to binding reactions; control lanes contained equal amounts of GST protein. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by native acrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described (62Williams J.S. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M.

AML12 cells were kindly provided by Dr. N. Fausto. AML12 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, a mixture of insulin, transferrin, and selenium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and gentamicin, 50 μg/ml (65Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In functional assays, AML12 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, using the Life Technologies, Inc. transfection kit. Briefly, 10–20% subconfluent cultures were transfected with 5 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and the indicated amount of expressor plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. CAT activity was determined as described (66Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.-H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using equal amounts of protein extract per assay. Protein concentration of cellular extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The CAT reporter vector pC15ΔXE, kindly provided by Dr. M. Bina, contains only the NF-IL6-binding site I, at position −158 to −178 (58Tesmer V.M. Rajadhyaksha A. Babin J. Bina M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The RSV-CREB-VP16 and RSV-Gal4 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. R. Gaynor (68Yin M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Molina. The ATF3, gadd153/Chop10, ICER IIγ, and bZip of NF-IL6 (amino acid residues 259–335) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the respective fragments into the RSV-VP16 vector (68Yin M. Paulssen E. Seeler J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3420-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at the NcoI site, resulting in the construction of bZip-VP16 fusion proteins, as described by Yin et al.(68Yin M. Paulssen E. Seeler J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3420-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, RSV-X-Gal4 constructs were prepared by inserting the coding region of pX at the NcoI site, resulting in fusion proteins with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) at its C terminus. 5 μg of reporter plasmid, 5 × Gal4-E1b TATAA-luciferase, were cotransfected with 5–10 μg of each of the expressor plasmids. Transfections were performed in duplicates (60-mm plates) and repeated a minimum of three times. Interactions between pX and CREB were demonstrated by enhanced CREB binding to the CRE site in the presence of pX (1Williams J.S. Andrisani O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study we employed the CREB/pX-interacting proteins as the model system for developing an assay to detect direct protein-protein interactions. For this analysis the full-length X protein was produced as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (61Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The GST-X1–154fusion protein is selectively retained by glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and thus the complex provides a suitable affinity resin. Recombinant CREB327 (69Zhu Z. Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A.

We observe selective binding of 32P-CREB327 to GST-X1–154 but no binding to the control GST-resin (Fig.1 A). Additional control experiments include the following: first, the demonstration that under the conditions detecting CREB/pX interactions (Fig. 1 A), transcription factors of a different class, namely Gal41–147 (71Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and MyoD (64Murre C. McCaw P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), did not display detectable binding to GST-X1–154 (Fig. 1, B andC); and second, the demonstration that the interaction of CREB327 with GST-X1–154 involved the bZip domain of CREB327. For this analysis, CREB327and the N-terminal portion of CREB327, amino acid residues 1–198, were synthesized in vitro (Fig.2 A). In comparative analysis, the N-terminal region of CREB327 did not interact with GST-X1–154 (Fig. 2 B), whereas35S-CREB327 displayed specific binding to GST-X1–154 (Fig. 2 C). The results confirm our earlier observations that the bZip of CREB is the interacting target of pX and show that under the established conditions (Fig. 1) we detect specific binding of CREB327 to pX in vitro.Figure 2In vitro translated35S-labeled CREB variants.

https://openalex.org/W2008795750,"We have previously demonstrated that the phospholipase C-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-sensitive manner by a protein kinase of ∼40 kDa purified from porcine cerebellum (Tobin, A. B., Keys, B., and Nahorski, S. R. (1996) J. Biol Chem. 271, 3907–3916). This kinase, called muscarinic receptor kinase (MRK), is distinct from second messenger-regulated protein kinases and from β-adrenergic receptor kinase and other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family. In the present study we propose that MRK is casein kinase 1α (CK1α) based on the following evidence: 1) the amino acid sequence from two proteolytic peptide fragments derived from purified MRK corresponded exactly to sequences within CK1α. 2) Casein kinase activity co-eluted with MRK activity from the final two chromatography steps in the purification of porcine brain MRK. 3) Recombinant CK1α expressed in Sf9 cells is able to phosphorylate both casein and the bacterial fusion protein, Ex-m3, that contains a portion of the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor downstream of glutathione S-transferase. 4) Partially purified CK1α increased the level of muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in an agonist-sensitive manner when reconstituted with membranes from Chinese hamster ovary-m3 cells expressing the human recombinant m3-muscarinic receptor. 5) Partially-purified CK1α phosphorylated rhodopsin, contained in urea-treated bovine rod outer segment membranes, and the extent of phosphorylation was increased in the presence of light. These data demonstrate that the kinase previously called MRK is CK1α, and that CK1α offers an alternative protein kinase pathway from that of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family for the stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of the m3-muscarinic receptor, rhodopsin, and possibly other G-protein-coupled receptors. We have previously demonstrated that the phospholipase C-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor is phosphorylated in an agonist-sensitive manner by a protein kinase of ∼40 kDa purified from porcine cerebellum (Tobin, A.

Intensive research over the last decade have revealed that many GPCR 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CK1α, casein kinase 1α CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MRK, muscarinic receptor kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; β-ARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; GRK, G-protein coupled receptor kinase; PIP2, phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate; Sf9 cells, Spodoptera frugiperda cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CK1α, casein kinase 1α CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MRK, muscarinic receptor kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; β-ARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; GRK, G-protein coupled receptor kinase; PIP2, phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate; Sf9 cells, Spodoptera frugiperda cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. subtypes are phosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation (1Tobin A.B. Waugh M.G Tobin A.B. The Phospholipase C Pathway: Its Regulation and Densitisation. Springer Press, New York1996: 65-85Google Scholar). These receptors include those coupled to either the adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C (PLC) pathways and suggests that receptor phosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism employed by all but a few GPCR's (1Tobin A.B. Waugh M.G Tobin A.B. The Phospholipase C Pathway: Its Regulation and Densitisation. Springer Press, New York1996: 65-85Google Scholar). For the majority of these receptors the cellular protein kinases involved in agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation have yet to be determined. However, this is not the case for the extensively studied β-adrenergic receptor where agonist-dependent phosphorylation and receptor desensitization is mediated by the receptor-specific kinase, β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARK) (2Lohse M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar,3Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Studies using purified or partially purified receptor preparations reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles with purified β-ARK, have demonstrated that β-ARK is also able to phosphorylate both cyclase-coupled (e.g. m2-muscarinic (4Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2222-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and PLC-coupled (e.g. substance P receptor (5Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M.

Furthermore, the use of dominant negative mutants of β-ARK to inhibit endogenous β-ARK activity (6Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that β-ARK is the endogenous kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of recombinant PLC-coupled α1B-adrenergic receptors expressed in COS-7 cells and rat-1 fibroblasts (7Diviani D.

Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have indicated that β-ARK may have a broad receptor substrate specificity that extends beyond β-adrenergic receptors. β-ARK-1 and β-ARK-2 2β-ARK-1 and β-ARK-2 are also known as GRK-2 and GRK-3, respectively. 2β-ARK-1 and β-ARK-2 are also known as GRK-2 and GRK-3, respectively. are members of a protein kinase family called the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family (10Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The newly cloned members of the GRK family, namely IT-11 (GRK-4), GRK-5, and GRK-6, phosphorylate rhodopsin in reconstituted systems (11Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, GRK-5 is able to phosphorylate purified α2-and β2-adrenergic, and m2-muscarinic receptors (11Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GRK-6 to phosphorylate β2-adrenergic and m2-muscarinic receptors, in an agonist-dependent manner (14Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that β-ARK and other members of the GRK family are able to phosphorylate a number of GPCR subtypes in reconstituted systems lending support to the proposed role of this protein kinase family in phosphorylation of GPCRs. However, recent evidence suggests that receptor phosphorylation mediated by β-ARK and the GRKs may be inhibited by the PLC signaling pathway. For example, increased intracellular calcium concentrations and depletion of the phospholipid, phosphoinositide 4,5,-bisphosphate (PIP2), may contribute to a reduction in the activity of GRKs (see “Discussion”). This raises the possibility that agonist-dependent phosphorylation of PLC-coupled receptors may be mediated by an alternative protein kinase pathway from that of β-ARK and the other GRKs. Our early studies on the PLC-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor indicated that the rapid serine phosphorylation observed following agonist stimulation (15Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mediated by a receptor kinase that was distinct from β-ARK (15Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have recently purified a 40-kDa protein kinase from porcine cerebellum that is able to phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase bacterial fusion protein containing a portion of the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this 40-kDa protein kinase was able to enhance the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the muscarinic receptor present in membranes obtained from CHO-m3 cells transfected with the human m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular weight, chromatographic properties, and protein kinase inhibitor studies demonstrated that the 40-kDa protein kinase was distinct from the second messenger-regulated protein kinases (e.g. protein kinase C) and from β-ARK and other members of the GRK family (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the 40-kDa protein kinase, called muscarinic receptor kinase (MRK), represents a previously unidentified receptor-specific kinase that offers an additional/alternative protein kinase pathway for the phosphorylation of the m3-muscarinic receptor and possibly other GPCRs. In the present paper we present evidence that MRK is a member of the casein kinase 1 family, namely casein kinase 1α (CK1α), and reveal the ability of the recombinant kinase to phosphorylate m3-muscarinic receptors and rhodopsin in an agonist/stimulus-dependent manner. CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell cultures stably transfected with human m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA (CHO-m3 cells, a kind gift from Dr. N. J. Buckley, Dept. Pharmacology, University College, London, UK) contained ∼2100 fmol of receptor/mg of protein. These cells were routinely maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), and fetal calf serum (10% v/v). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained as suspension cultures in SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The procedure used for purification of MRK from porcine cerebellum has been previously described (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Preparation of the bacterial fusion protein, Ex-m3, where amino acids Ser345–Leu463 of the human m3-muscarinic receptor third intracellular loop are fused with glutathione S-transferase has previously been described (15Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excised Coomassie-stained protein band corresponding to MRK was digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted for 2 h in a sonicating water bath. After concentration, the peptides were resolved using a Relasil C18 column with a guard pre-column packed with AX-300 on a Michrom HPLC system. Peptides were sequenced at the low picomole level using a modified ABI 477a sequencer employing fast cycle chemistry (18Totty N.F. Waterfield M.D. Hsuan J.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for bovine CK1α (a kind gift from Dr. Melanie Cobb, Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers that inserted a Kozak (GCC ACC) sequence upstream of an epitope, FLAG-TAG (MDYKDDDDK), at the N terminus of CK1α (5′-primer, CCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGGCGAGCAGCAGCGGC; 3′-primer, CCCGGATCCTTAGAAACCTGTGGGGGTTTGGGC). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into theXbaI-BamHI sites of pVL1392 (Pharmingen). Recombinant baculovirus was generated using the BaculoGold system (Pharmingen). The coding sequence for the m3-muscarinic receptor was cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI sites in pVL1393. Recombinant baculovirus was then generated using the BaculoGold system. This baculovirus was used in control infections. (Note that controls were also run using non-infected Sf9 cells with similar results to cells infected with control virus. In this paper experiments with control infected cells are reported.) Sf9 cells (1 liter at 1 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with baculovirus containing the CK1α or control baculovirus (1–4 plaque-forming units/cell). After 4 days the cells were harvested and resuspended in 45 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml benzamine, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide). After 10 min on ice the cells were homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min and a high speed supernatant fraction (S200 fraction) obtained by further centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 35 min. The sample was applied to a 1-ml Resource S (Pharmacia) column which was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl over 20 bed volumes (flow rate = 2 ml/min). 1-ml fractions were collected. The kinase activity eluted as a single peak at ∼0.3 m NaCl. These fractions were combined and passed through a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.32m NaCl. The column was eluted using a linear gradient of 0.32–1.75 m NaCl over 15 ml. The kinase activity eluted as a single peak at ∼0.94 m NaCl. The peak activity was dialyzed against 0.3 m NaCl in TE buffer and stored at 4 °C. The kinase in this preparation was ∼4 ng/μl (0.1 pmol/μl), and represents ∼3.5% of the total protein in the fraction. Control purification protocol involved identical purification steps from Sf9 cells infected with the m3-muscarinic receptor baculovirus. The total protein in fractions obtained from the heparin purification of the control and CK1α-infected cells were very similar, 100 μg/ml total protein in the control, and 112 μg/ml from the CK1α-infected cells. Assay for the muscarinic receptor kinase involved using the muscarinic receptor fusion protein Ex-m3 as a substrate for the kinase (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Samples from chromatography fractions (10 μl) or from supernatant fractions from infected Sf9 cells were incubated with purified Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) or dephosphorylated α-casein (15 μg) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (0.4–1.0 cpm/fmol) for 10 min at 37 °C (final volume = 110 μl). Where Ex-m3 was used the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer. Glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl, Pharmacia) was added and collected by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 s) and washed twice with 1 ml of TE buffer. Bound fusion protein was dissociated by boiling in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 μl). Where α-casein was used, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100% trichloroacetic acid (11 μl). The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation in a Microfuge for 10 min at 13,000 ×g. The protein pellet was washed with acetone (−20 °C) and resuspended in 20 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins from the Ex-m3 or casein assay were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. To ensure the equal recovery of the protein substrates and to confirm their relative positions, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Gels were then dried and autoradiographs obtained and/or bands corresponding to the peptide substrates were excised and counted. Membrane phosphorylations were carried out as described previously (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude CHO-m3 cell membranes were prepared and resuspended in kinase buffer at 1 mg of protein/ml. 50 μl of membranes (∼0.1 pmol of receptor) were used in a phosphorylation reaction mixture that contained final concentrations of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1–4 cpm/fmol ATP), ± 1 mmcarbachol and ±20 μm atropine. To this reaction mixture 10 μl of partially purified CK1α (0.5–1 pmol) or control extract was added. Total volume was 100 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of ATP and continued at 32 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and membranes solubilized with 1 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) for 30 min on ice. m3-Muscarinic receptors were then immunoprecipitated with a specific antiserum (332) as described previously (15Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea-treated bovine rod outer segment membranes (30 pmol of rhodopsin/reaction; a kind gift from Dr. Martin Lohse, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Strasse 9, D-97078 Wurzburg, Germany) were added to kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP (1 cpm/fmol). To this partially purified CK1α (0.3 pmol), purified bovine β-ARK (0.3 pmol; a gift from Dr. Martin Lohse), or control extract were added. Total volume was 30 μl. The above reagents were combined at 4 °C (where necessary under a safe light). Reactions were started by placing the tubes in a water bath at 32 °C either under a safe light or in room fluorescent light for a given time period. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were then resolved on a 12% gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographs obtained. Bands corresponding to rhodopsin were excised and counted. Determination of relative intensities of phosphorylated bands was carried out using a Bio-Rad GS 670 densitometer. Western blotting of whole cell extracts from Sf9 cells used a commercially available antiserum (FLAG-M2, Kodak) that recognizes the FLAG epitope cloned onto the N terminus of CK1α. Proteolytic fragments of MRK purified from porcine brain were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences derived from two peptides were determine to be: 1, WYGQEK; and 2, IEYVHTK. These sequences matched exactly to sequences found exclusively within CK1α (peptide 1, Trp78–Lys83; and peptide 2, Ile124–Lys130). Furthermore, the predicted molecular mass of CK1α is 37.5 kDa, which corresponds closely with the ∼40-kDa mass suggested for MRK (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine if the kinase we previously defined as MRK was CK1α, samples from fractions obtained from the purification of MRK were assayed for both MRK activity, which is defined by the ability of fractions to phosphorylate the bacterial fusion protein Ex-m3 (glutathione S-transferase:m3-third intracellular loop; see “Experimental Procedures”), and casein kinase activity. Fractions from the final two column purification steps, namely the Resource S and heparin-Sepharose fractionation (see Ref. 17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were analyzed. The casein kinase activity was found to elute from the Resource S (data not shown) and heparin-Sepharose columns in an identical manner to MRK activity (Fig. 1). The peak of MRK and casein kinase activity co-eluted from the Resource S and heparin-Sepharose columns at ∼0.37 and ∼0.87 m NaCl, respectively. Attempts to express recombinant bovine CK1α in mammalian cells (COS-7, HEK 294, and CHO cells) have not proven successful. The reason for this is unclear and is currently under investigation. To obtain a source of recombinant CK1α, we turned to the insect cell baculovirus expression system. Recombinant CK1α was expressed in infected Sf9 cells as determined by Western blotting of whole cells using an antiserum against the FLAG-TAG epitope engineered onto the N terminus of CK1α (Fig.2 A). The activity of the recombinant kinase was confirmed by an increase in casein kinase activity in cytosolic extracts from CK1α-infected Sf9 cells compared with the control cell infection (Fig. 2 B). Correlating with an increase in casein kinase activity was an increase in the ability of the cell extract obtained from the CK1α-infected cells to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor fusion protein, Ex-m3 (Fig.2 B). To confirm that the recombinant CK1α contained in infected cell extracts was able to phosphorylate both casein and Ex-m3, the cell extracts were fractionated on a Resource S column. The peak of casein kinase activity contained in CK1α-infected cells co-eluted with the peak of MRK activity (Fig. 2 C). The peak of recombinant kinase activity eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl. Note, the presence of endogenous casein kinase activity is evident in the control fractionation (Fig. 2 C). MRK activity and casein kinase activity also co-eluted during heparin-Sepharose chromatography (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that membranes from CHO-m3 cells contained an endogenous protein kinase able to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In these earlier studies, addition of cerebellum-derived MRK to the CHO-m3 membrane preparation resulted in an enhancement of agonist-sensitive m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A parallel experiment was conducted here using partially purified extracts from infected Sf9 cells as the source of exogenous kinase. Fig. 3 shows that in the presence of control extract, purified on the Resource S column, the m3-muscarinic receptor (∼0.1 pmol of receptor/reaction) contained in CHO-m3 membranes undergoes agonist-sensitive phosphorylation which can be inhibited by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. Addition of Resource S purified extract from Sf9 cells infected with CK1α baculovirus (0.5–1 pmol of CK1α/reaction) resulted in an ∼2.3-fold increase in agonist-sensitive m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation with no significant change in the basal phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the increase in agonist-sensitive muscarinic receptor phosphorylation, mediated by CK1α, was inhibited by the antagonist atropine (Fig. 3). To further test the ability of CK1α to phosphorylate GPCR's, rhodopsin, contained in urea-treated rod outer segments, was used as substrate for CK1α. Heparin-Sepharose-purified CK1α (∼300 fmol) was incubated with rod outer segment membranes (containing rhodopsin at 30 pmol/reaction) either under a safe light or under room fluorescent lights. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was observed only in the extract obtained from cells infected with CK1α baculovirus and not from control extracts (Fig. 4 A). The CK1α extract did phosphorylate rhodopsin under dark conditions and this phosphorylation was enhanced in the presence of light (118 fmol of phosphate incorporated/5-min reaction) (Fig. 4 A). In comparison, β-ARK (∼300 fmol/reaction) did not phosphorylate rhodopsin in the absence of light but in the presence of light rhodopsin was phosphorylated to a similar extent as that seen for light-mediated CK1α phosphorylation (122 fmol of phosphate incorporated/5-min reaction) (Fig. 4 A). The time course for CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin was found to be similar to the time course for β-ARK-mediated phosphorylation (Fig.4 B). The present study has revealed that the 40-kDa protein kinase purified previously from porcine cerebellum, called MRK due to its ability to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner (17Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), can be identified as CK1α. These data, together with the ability of recombinant CK1α to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor and rhodopsin in a stimulus-dependent manner, indicate that CK1α offers an alternative protein kinase pathway, from that of β-ARK and the other GRKs, for the agonist-sensitive phosphorylation and the potential regulation of GPCR's. Due to the presence of endogenous receptor kinase activity in membranes from CHO-m3 cells, the enhancement of muscarinic receptor phosphorylation observed in the presence of CK1α may be due to an activation of the endogenous kinase rather than a direct phosphorylation of the receptor. This, however, appears unlikely since CK1α is also able to phosphorylate rhodopsin in a stimulus-dependent manner, in urea-treated rod outer segment membranes where there is no endogenous kinase activity. These data also suggest that like β-ARK, CK1α acts predominantly on the activated form of the receptor. This conclusion is supported by dose-response analysis of m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in intact CHO-m3 cells which have demonstrated a close correlation between receptor occupancy and receptor phosphorylation (19Tobin A.B. Willars G.B. Burford N.T. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1723-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of CK1α to mediate light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin suggests that the substrate specificity of CK1α is broader than just the m3-muscarinic receptor. Experiments are presently in progress to test the receptor-substrate specificity of CK1α against a range of cyclase- and PLC-coupled receptors. Casein kinase activity was one of the first protein kinase activities identified in mammalian cells and is attributed to two enzymes called casein kinase I and casein kinase II (20Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 21Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The true “biological” casein kinase responsible for phosphorylating casein in mammary glands is a transmembrane protein kinase of the Golgi apparatus that bears no relationship to casein kinase I or II. In this regard casein kinase I and II are misnomers since the biological substrates for these kinases is not casein. The casein kinase I gene family consists of at least six members; CK1α, CK1β (22Rowles J. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9548-9552Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), CK1γ1–3 (23Zhai L. Graves P.R. Robinson L.C. Italiano M. Culbertson M.R. Rowles J. Cobb M.H. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of in vitro substrates for this kinase family have been identified including: glycogen synthase, SV40 large T antigen (20Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar), p53 tumor suppressor protein (25Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar), and DARPP-32 (26Desdouits F. Cohen D. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear which are the biologically relevant substrates. The present study is the first to demonstrate that CK1α is able to phosphorylate GPCR's in a stimulus-dependent manner. The broad receptor substrate specificity of β-ARK (5Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A.

Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative mutant of β-ARK inhibits agonist-sensitive phosphorylation of PLC-coupled α1B-adrenergic receptors (7Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and type 1A angiotensin II receptors (8Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have indicated that the intracellular environment following activation of PLC-coupled receptors would not favor the membrane translocation of β-ARK and other GRK's. It is now clear that β-ARK activity in reconstituted systems is completely dependent on the presence of the phospholipid, PIP2 (28Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, translocation of β-ARK to the plasma membrane is dependent on the synergistic action of G-protein βγ-subunits and PIP2 at a site within the pleckstrin homology domain at the C terminus of β-ARK (28Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22552-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PIP2 is also involved in the anchoring of GRK-4, GRK-5, and GRK-6 to the plasma membrane by interacting with sites at the C terminus (30Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, receptors that regulate the level of PIP2 could have a profound influence on the activation and translocation of β-ARK and other members of the GRK family. Stimulation of the m3-muscarinic receptor in CHO-m3 cells 3A. B. Tobin, R. A. Challiss, and S. R. Nahorski, unpublished data. and in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y cells results in a 80% fall in the levels of PIP2 within the first 10 s of agonist stimulation and this is sustained for 10 min in the presence of agonist (31Willars G.B. Challiss R.A. Stuart J.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Fisher S.K. Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similar rapid falls in the level of PIP2 have been reported to occur following stimulation of m1-muscarinic (33Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148PubMed Google Scholar, 34Waugh, M. G., Challiss, R. A. J., Nahorski, S. R., and Tobin, A. B. (1997) Mol. Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar), vasopressin (35Koreh K. Monaco M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 88-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thrombin receptors (36Wilson D.B. Neufeld E.J. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1046-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Batty I.H. Downs P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PLC-coupled receptor activation may, therefore, discourage membrane translocation/association of the GRK's by depleting PIP2. In addition, recent studies indicate that calmodulin, in a calcium-dependent manner, can inhibit the association of β-ARK and GRK-5 with the plasma membrane (38Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Haga K. Tsuga H. Haga T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β-ARK translocation is inhibited by the ability of calcium/calmodulin to compete for the binding of βγ-subunits, and GRK-5 association with the membrane is disrupted by a direct interaction with the kinase (38Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, PLC-coupled receptors, by virtue of their ability to mobilize intracellular calcium stores and mediate calcium entry across the plasma membrane, could again discourage GRK activity. Overall, it could be anticipated that the intracellular environment following signal transduction via PLC-coupled receptors would not be conducive for GRK translocation and receptor phosphorylation. We would suggest, on the basis of the present study, that CK1α offers an attractive alternative route for the phosphorylation of PLC-coupled receptors. In this regard it is interesting to note that casein kinase I isolated from erythrocytes is inhibited by PIP2 (40Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

Therefore, in contrast to the GRK's, it is possible that PLC-coupled receptors may increase the activity of CK1α by the hydrolysis of membrane PIP2. Other regulatory features may also be important such as autophosphorylation which is reported to occur on both tyrosine and serine residues on CK1α (41Hoekstra M.F. Dhillon N. Carmel G. DeMaggio A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1996273963,"The products of cleavage of bovine factor Va by activated protein C (APC) in the presence and absence of phospholipid (25% phosphatidylserine, 75% phosphatidylcholine, PCPS) were evaluated using sedimentation velocity/equilibrium methods in the analytical ultracentrifuge and by immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against the light chain of the factor Va molecule. The molecular weight and sedimentation coefficient of the associated heavy and light chains of factor Va, 173,000 (7.9 S) is reduced to 132,000 (7.1 S) by APC cleavage at Arg505 and Arg662. Complete cleavage of the factor Va heavy chain (with APC-PCPS) at Arg505, Arg662 and Arg306 results in a drastic change in the molecular weight observed for the product. Two products are resolved with sedimentation coefficients of 3.3 and 6.3 S with estimated molecular weights of 48,000 and 114,000, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the products of factor Va cleavage at Arg505 and Arg662 (A1A2N·A2C·LC) are mostly noncovalently associated and consequently immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the light chain of the factor Va molecule. In contrast, for factor Va cleaved at Arg505, Arg662, and Arg306 the precipitated complex consisted of the A1 domain (residues 1–306) and the light chain (residues 1537–2183) of factor Va (A1·LC). The fragments corresponding to residues 307–505 (A2N) and 506–662 (A2C) are found in the supernatant. The combined mass of these two products (48,000) is similar to the estimated mass of the 3.3 S fragment estimated from sedimentation velocity/equilibrium studies; while the combined mass of the 1–306 + 1537–2183 products corresponds to 114,000, the estimated mass of the 6.3 S fragment. These data lead to the conclusion that cleavages at Arg306, Arg505, and Arg662 of the factor Va molecule resulted in the dissociation of the entire A2 domain as two noncovalently associated fragments (A2N·A2C). Enzyme kinetic and light scattering data suggest that the complete inactivation of the factor Va molecule involves not only cleavage at Arg306 but also the dissociation of the A2 domain. These data also suggest that the complete APC inactivation of the factor Va molecule is analogous to the spontaneous inactivation of factor VIIIa, which occurs via the dissociation of the A2 domain.

Bovine factor V circulates in blood as a single chain 330,000 molecular weight protein (1Nesheim M.E. Myrmel K. Hibbard L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 508-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is cleaved by thrombin to give rise to the active species, factor Va, which is composed of a heavy chain (A1A2, residues 1–713) and a light chain (A3C1C2, residues 1537–2183) (2Nesheim M.E. Foster W.B. Hewick R. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3187-3196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two subunits of the factor Va molecule are associated noncovalently (4Esmon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contribute both the membrane receptor site for factor Xa, the serine protease component of theprothrombinase complex (5Nesheim M.E.

(1993) Methods Enzymol. 261–280.Google Scholar) and an effector function which influences the k cat of the enzyme complex. As a consequence, this complex is 300,000-fold more efficient in the activation of plasma prothrombin than factor Xa at potential physiologic concentration. In addition to the proteolytic activation steps which result in a 400-fold (at a minimum) increase in activity (7Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) over factor V, the factor Va molecule is subject to proteolytic regulation by activated protein C (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine; PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine; PCPS, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine vesicles; DAPA, dansylarginine, 4-ethyl piperidine amide; LC, light chain; HC, heavy chain. generated as a consequence of thrombin-thrombomodulin cleavage of plasma protein C (8Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC cleaves the bovine factor Va heavy chain at Arg505, Arg306, and Arg662 to produce an inactive species (9Odegaard B. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation cleavages occur in sequential fashion with cleavage at Arg505 preceding cleavages at Arg306 and Arg662. Once cleaved the resulting product, factor Va, is no longer capable of binding factor Xa or prothrombin (11Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13986-13992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the cleavages at Arg505 and Arg306 are both influenced by phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, PCPS), the cleavage at Arg306 is dependent upon the presence of anionic phospholipids (10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor Va molecule cleaved only at Arg505 and Arg662 is still capable of binding factor Xa and influencing thrombin activation, but the affinity for factor Xa and the efficiency of prothrombin activation are reduced (10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J.

The present study was undertaken to examine the alterations in factor Va molecular composition associated with cleavage by APC. HEPES, Sepharose CL-4B, cyanogen bromide, bovine serum albumin, PS, and PC were purchased from Sigma. Bovine factor Va, bovine factor Xa, and bovine APC were purified as described previously (13Nesheim M. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Kisiel W. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS were prepared as described previously (15Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The concentration of the phospholipid vesicles in each preparation was determined by phosphorous assay. Dansylarginine 4-ethyl piperidine amide (DAPA) was a gift from Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT. Factor Va protein concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm, using ∈280nm1% = 17.4 (16Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The compositions of the products of APC cleavage were assessed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 5–15% gradient gels under reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Bovine factor Va was extensively dialyzed against 20 mmHEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS-Ca2+). Factor Va (2 μm) was incubated with bovine APC (40 nm) in the presence or absence of 20 μm PCPS vesicles. Following a 150-min incubation the reaction was terminated by addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to 1 mm. Functionally defined apparent dissociation constants (K d (app) for factor Xa binding to factor Va-PCPS were inferred from an assay that employs purified reagents and measures thrombin formation (18Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment a mixture of prothrombin (1.4 μm) PCPS vesicles (20 μm) and DAPA (3 μm) were incubated in the dark to allow equilibration. At selected time intervals, an aliquot of the mixture was added to a cuvette containing factor Va product (0.5 nm) and the reaction initiated by various concentrations of factor Xa. Thrombin formation was measured using a Perkin Elmer MPF-44A spectrofluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 550 nm (DAPA-thrombin fluorescence) (18Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The initial rate of thrombin formation for each factor Xa concentration was calculated and plotted as a function of the factor Xa concentration using the software PRIZM (GraphPad™, San Diego, CA), assuming that factor Xa has one binding site for factor Va. Sedimentation studies were conducted using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible absorbance scanning and Rayleigh Interference Optics. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 50,000 rpm using an An50-Ti, 8-hole rotor in 12-mm double-sector cells that housed sapphire windows. Data were collected using absorbance optics (λ = 280 nm). The dialysate (see above) was used in the cell reference sector. All velocity analyses were performed simultaneously. The measurements were made on 400-μl samples at 20 °C using a scan interval of 6 min. Weight average sedimentation coefficients (s20,w ) were determined by second moment analysis (19Goldberg R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1953; 57: 194-202Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). g*(s) analyses were conducted as described previously (20Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In both instances the absorbance versus time scans were analyzed on an IBM PS350 using the software package Microcal Origin version 3.78 supplied by Beckman with the X-LI. Estimations of the relative absorbance contributions for multiple species resolved by sedimentation (APC-PCPS cleavage) were made by graphical integration of theg*(s) plots. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed using the high speed meniscus depletion method as described by Yphantis (21Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 15,500 rpm for 14 h at 19.9 °C. The attainment of equilibrium was assessed empirically by the observation of identical gradients over a 3-h period. Molecular weight average estimates were evaluated using the Optima XL software package Microcal Origin Version 3.78 from Beckman. The reaction products were visualized on 5 to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, prior to and after the analytical ultracentrifuge runs. For all calculations a v̄ of 0.72 was used (22Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Estimates of the molecular weights of species present in heterogenous mixtures were accomplished by two approaches. One approximation made use of the relationship between sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight for nearly globular proteins.S1S2=M1M22/3Equation 1 In this instance the sedimentation coefficients of the two species observed are taken from the g*(s) analyses of the sedimenting boundaries. In the second approximation the sedimentation equilibrium profile derived from absorption optics was evaluated using a two-component ideal mixture model (XL-I software) in which the relative absorbance contributions of the two species known to be in the centrifuge cell were derived from integration of the g*(s) plots from the sedimentation velocity data. The relative absorbance area ratio for a:bwas 4.35. For modeling, the mass of the species was varied from 114,000–120,000 and 40,000–48,000 to obtain the model fit. The model fit was subsequently evaluated using fits to plots of ln A versus r 2 using Microsoft Excel (5.0a) To conduct immunoabsorption experiments, an anti-factor Va light chain antibody, αHFV#1, was coupled to Sepharose CL-4B beads (23Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 μg of the factor Va treated with APC (±PCPS vesicles) was incubated with 300 μl of αHFV-1 beads in 150 μl of buffer. Incubation was allowed to proceed for 30 min with occasional stirrings. Following 30 min of incubation the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The recovered supernatant was saved for analyses of the unbound material. The antibody beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Elution of the beads was performed with 2% SDS. The proteins were visualized on a 5 to 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The APC enzyme concentration dependence of the rate of factor Va inactivation process was evaluated by mixing factor Va (1 μm) PCPS (20 μm) and HBS-Ca2+at 37 °C with APC over a concentration range from 0 to 5 μm. Following a 3-min incubation period an aliquot of the reaction was removed for assessment of remaining activity in the prothrombin activation assay utilizing 10 nm factor Xa. The remaining sample was quenched into SDS buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Light scattering measurements were made in a photon counting Fluoromax II SPEX fluorimeter (Edison, NJ). Scattering intensity was measured at 320 nm (excitation and emission) with a band pass of 5 nm. Experiments were performed in degassed and filtered (0.2 μm) HBS-Ca2+ buffer in a fluorimeter cuvette with gentle stirring. Factor Va (100 nm) was incubated with 20 μm PCPS and the scattering intensity monitored. The decrease in scattering intensity upon addition of APC (20 nm) was continuously monitored over 30 min (24Nesheim M.E. Abbott T. Jenny R. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1037-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A first order fit of the data was achieved using a single exponential fit. In control experiments, the addition of 10 nm APC to PCPS vesicles in the absence of factor Va resulted in no detectable change in light scattering intensity under the experimental conditions used. Bovine factor Va was chosen for these studies because of its relative abundance and stability which permits reasonably dependable physical analyses of the protein. The species studied included factor Va, factor Va cleaved by APC, 5 mm Ca2+, in the absence of phospholipid (designated factor VaAPC, cleavage at Arg505, Arg662, and Arg1752/1753), and factor Va cleaved by APC, 5 mm Ca2+ in the presence of PCPS vesicles (designated factor VaAPC/PCPS, cleavage at Arg505, Arg306, Arg662, and Arg1752/1753). Fig.1 is a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel that illustrates the nature of the reaction products in the present study analyzed under denaturing conditions. Lanes 1 and2 are bovine factor Va. Lane 2 illustrates the lack of influence of PCPS. Lane 3 contains the products of APC cleavage in the absence of PCPS. Lane 4 contains the products of APC cleavage in the presence of PCPS vesicles. Unlike human factor Va the light chain of bovine factor Va is cleaved at Arg1752/1753 to give rise to products ofM r(app) 46,000/48,000 and 30,000. This latter cleavage has been shown to be irrelevant with respect to assembly or the activity of the factor Va molecule (9Odegaard B. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Krishnaswamy S.

The titrations of the activities of the various factor Va species as a function of factor Xa concentration are illustrated in Fig.2. The functionalK d (app) of the factor Va species are presented in Table I together with the nomenclature of the relevant fragments which comprise the factor Va products and their SDS apparent molecular weights.Figure 2Factor Va (▪), factor VaAPC(▴), and factor VaAPC/PCPS (•) prothrombinase rate saturation plots as a function of factor Xa at 20 μmphospholipid. The data points are derived from the initial rates of thrombin generation observed as a function of factor Xa concentration. The fitted curves are based upon a single binding site function.

Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed on each of the products represented in Fig. 1 and these data are illustrated in Table II. Factor Va and the products derived from factor Va following APC cleavage in the absence of phospholipid are relatively homogenous species by sedimentation velocity analysis. A small but significant change (7.9 to 7.1 S) in sedimentation coefficient is observed upon cleavage of factor Va at Arg505, Arg662, and Arg1752/1753. In contrast, the APC-PCPS cleavage of factor Va at Arg306 (in addition to the other cleavage sites) shows a significant reduction in the weight average sedimentation coefficient (s 20,w ).g*(s) analyses indicated two components,a with s 20,w 6.3 andb with s 20,w 3.3. The molecular weight estimated for intact factor Va (173,000) is in reasonable agreement to the sum of the heavy and light chain masses estimated from SDS gel electrophoresis (168,000) (Table I) and consistent with the molecular weight reported by Laue and co-workers for bovine factor Va (28Laue T.M. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The product of APC cleavage of factor Va (minus PCPS) displayed a heterogenous molecular weight distribution in sedimentation equilibrium with weight average molecular weight of 132,000. The light chain fragments are known to remain intact following cleavage at Arg1752/1753 (9Odegaard B. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cleavage at Arg505 gives rise to fragments of 153,000 and 20,000. The velocity and equilibrium data combined with activity data (9Odegaard B. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J.

The weight average molecular weight of the APC-PCPS cleaved product is significantly reduced corresponding to a loss in mass of >50,000. Since the cleavage products of the light chain (LCN and LCC) are known to remain self associated, the change in mass can only be accounted for either by the dissociation of the A1 domain (residues 1–306) or the fragments obtained from the A2 domain, A2N (residues 307–505) and A2C (residues 506–662). Estimation of the mass of the sedimenting products resolved using the g*(s) approach suggest that the molecular weights of these fragments are approximately 120,000 and 47,000, assuming that their frictional coefficients are similar to those of factor Va and factor Va HC respectively (28Laue T.M. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The relative absorbance contributions of a and bto the concentration profiles in sedimentation equilibrium experiments were inferred from integration of the areas from theg*(s) plot. The values of 48,000 and 114,000 provided the best fit to the sedimentation data assuming an “ideal” noninteracting two component model. These collected data suggest that following cleavage at Arg306 the entire A2 domain dissociates from the remainder of the molecule (A1·LC) and exists primarily as the noncovalently associated product A2N·A2C. The identical materials used in the sedimentation experiments (Fig. 1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation analyses using an anti-factor Va light chain antibody coupled to Sepharose. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3. The factor Va molecule cleaved at Arg505, Arg662, and Arg1752/1753 (lane 2) is quantitatively immunoprecipitated by the Sepharose coupled anti-light chain antibody (lane 4). No products are found in the supernatant (lane 3). These results are consistent with the conclusion of reversible association of the products of APC cleavage at Arg505, Arg662, and Arg1752/1753. A similar immunoprecipitation experiment conducted with the material cleaved using APC + PCPS (lane 5) reveals that while the light chain fragments (LCC and LCN) and the A1 domain are bound to the immunoprecipitate (lane 7) the A2N and A2C fragments are found in the supernatant (lane 6). The issues then arise as to whether ultimate inactivation is associated with cleavage at position Arg306 or whether inactivation is associated with cleavage or the dissociation of the components A2N + A2C which together comprise the entire A2 domain of the factor Va heavy chain or both the cleavage and dissociation process. Fig. 4 presents an analysis of the inactivation of factor Va as a function of APC concentration. It can been seen in this plot that the reaction is decidedly nonlinear with respect to enzyme concentration, ultimately becoming independent of enzyme at the highest concentrations evaluated (∼1.5–5 μm). These inactivation analyses are fundamentally more complicated than the analysis of the spontaneous inactivation factor VIIIa since the inactivating reaction is lipid dependent and because the identification of the factor Va inactivation associated with cleavage at Arg306 must be conducted by quantitative analysis of thrombin generation (at high factor Xa concentrations) rather than simply by a clotting assay. The inset in Fig. 4 illustrates plots of the activity loss, post heavy chain cleavage for two APC concentrations in the experiment described in Fig.4. These points correspond to the activity losses in the intervals following complete cleavage of the heavy chain, at 2.5 and 1 min following the addition of 1.7 μm (triangle) and 5 μm (squares) APC, respectively. In both cases activity remained after the factor Va heavy chain was entirely cleaved as assessed by gel analyses. However, the activity still remaining (∼20%) decays at a rate (k = 0.4 min−1) independent of the enzyme concentration. These data suggest an enzyme independent process, consistent with dissociation of the A2 domain fragments, is associated with complete activity loss. However since the rate of the cleavage-independent activity loss overlaps the Arg306 cleavage rate it is not possible to assign a totally independent value to the residual activity present in the factor Va cleaved at Arg505 and Arg306product prior to dissociation. The rate of mass reduction following APC inactivation of factor Va was studied using right angle light scattering. The data presented in the Fig. 5 illustrate the light scattering change associated with addition of APC (20 nm) to a factor Va (100 nm), PCPS (20 μm) reaction mixture. A dramatic decrease in light scattering intensity occurs upon addition of APC to the factor Va-phospholipid vesicle complex. At these concentrations the cleavage reactions would have been complete within approximately three minutes an interval accounting for about 70% of the total scattering intensity reduction. Thus cleavage and dissociation are occurring on roughly the same time scale. A 1st order exponential approximation to the data would suggest a dissociation ratek = 0.5 min−1 similar to the rate of the nonenzymatic factor Va decay rate (Fig. 4, inset). The collected data lead to the conclusion depicted in Fig.6. The complete inactivation of the factor Va molecule which occurs with cleavage of the heavy chain at Arg306, Arg505, and Arg662 results in the dissociation of the A2 domain fragments from the remainder of the factor Va molecule. The larger product at 6.3 S is a noncovalently associated trimeric complex composed of A1·LC (M r(app) 114,000). This product is incapable of binding factor Xa or prothrombin or serving in theprothrombinase complex (Fig. 2). The dissociated product (s) corresponds to the entire A2 domain, has as 20,w of 3.3 and is composed of two peptides A2N and A2C with a combined molecular weight of 48,000. It is likely, based upon the molecular weight estimated from the s 20,w of the component b and the best fit of sedimentation equilibrium data (Table II) that the two fragments, are noncovalently associated, most likely in a reversible interaction. The observation that the inactivating cleavage at Arg306results in the dissociation of the A2 domain suggest that the inactivated product, factor Vai, is equivalent in gross structure to the inactive factor VIIIa product which results following the thrombin activation cleavage of factor VIII at Arg372 (29Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amphlett G.W. Foster W.B. Coe M.L. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Hewick R.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). This required activation cleavage in factor VIII (at Arg372) results in the subsequent dissociation of the A2 domain and the spontaneous inactivation of factor VIIIa (30Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lollar P. Parker C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor Va APC cleavage at Arg306 produces a result similar to the Arg372 cleavage in factor VIII resulting in dissociation of the A2 domain and loss of factor Va activity. The process for factor Va occurs at a faster rate (>0.5 min−l) than the process for factor VIIIa A2 dissociation (0.32 min−l) (32Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of complete inactivation of factor Va by APC-PCPS has been controversial. The present data are consistent with the mechanism illustrated in Fig. 6 in which activity is totally lost following cleavage at Arg306 and the largely irreversible dissociation of the A2 domain fragments. Under the experimental conditions described in the present study (≥6 μm Va) it is clear that any affinities of the ultimate cleavage products for each other (if present at all) are relatively weak. However, since the dissociation of the A2 fragment is most likely the direct cause of the total factor Va inactivation, it is entirely possible that the rate-limiting step of factor Va inactivation can be shifted from peptide bond (Arg306) cleavage to A2 domain fragment dissociation by other constituents of the reaction mixture. In addition the products of the cleavage at Arg505 also appear to engage in a reversible binding phenomena which may also be influenced by third component binding. For example, it has been reported and confirmed by numerous studies that factor Xa stabilizes the factor Va molecule from inactivation by APC (33Walker F.J. Sexton P.W. Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Nesheim M.E. Canfield W.M. Kisiel W. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Similarly it has been shown that factor IXa stabilizes the thrombin activated factor VIIIa molecule presumably by preventing dissociation of the A2 subunit (37Lollar P. Knutson G. Fass D. Blood. 1984; 63: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 12: 3120-3126Crossref Google Scholar). The stabilization of factor Va by factor Xa may be, in part, a consequence of an altered dissociation of the products following APC cleavage. If this is indeed the case the presence of factor Xa or prothrombin during APC inactivation may be major confounding elements in kinetic evaluations of factor Va inactivation but elements that are biologically relevant. The ultimate deconvolution of the relative activity losses associated with factor Va cleavage at position 306 and the activity loss associated with the dissociation of the fragments of the A2 domain is a matter that will require further extensive experimental analysis. However the present results clearly indicate that the kinetics of APC inactivation of factor Va are associated with complex processes which influence both the binding of the enzyme factor Xa and the effector function of factor Va in the prothrombinase complex and include both the proteolysis and the dissociation of fragments of the A2 domain ultimately leading to a totally inactivated factor Va molecule."

While most affected individuals have extensive deletions of the STS gene, point mutations have been reported in three patients (1). In this study, we identify an additional three point mutations and characterize the effects of all six mutations on STS activity and expression. All six are unique single base pair substitutions. The mutations are located in a 105-amino acid region of the C-terminal half of the polypeptide. Five of the six mutations involve the substitutions of Pro or Arg for Trp372, Arg for His444, Tyr for Cys446, or Leu for Cys341. The other mutation is in a splice junction and results in a frameshift causing premature termination of the polypeptide at residue 427. All the affected residues are conserved to some degree within the sulfatase family. The six mutations were reproduced in normal STS cDNA and transiently expressed in STS-deficient cells. All six mutant vectors direct the expression of STS protein that lacks enzymatic activity. The mutant polypeptides show a shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE and resistance to proteinase K digestion when translated in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, indicating glycosylation and normal translocation."

The molecular basis of this effect is still unclear, but increased concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ may act at several levels to trigger fast fusion of pre-docked synaptic vesicles with the synaptic plasma membrane, promote endocytosis of the vesicle membranes and subsequent vesicle reformation, and mobilize additional vesicles to release sites (1Zucker R.S.

However, how Ca2+- and Ca2+/CaM-dependent reactions are integrated to promote and optimize synaptic responses remains to be determined. In the present investigation we examined the effects of Ca2+ and CaM on the behavior of Rab3A, a low molecular mass, di-geranylgeranylated, guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is attached to neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (22Fischer von Mollard G.F.

Furthermore, action of a Rab guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor protein (Rab GDI) had been implicated because of its known ability to form a complex with Rab3A and cause it to dissociate from synaptic membranes in cell-free experiments (27Araki S.

While exploring the possibility that increased concentrations of Ca2+ might affect the Rab3A dissociation process, we discovered that Ca2+/CaM also can cause Rab3A to dissociate from synaptic membranes.

Two different methods were used to prepare synaptosomes from cerebral cortex of nonhuman primates (Macaca nemestrina), obtained from the tissue distribution program of the Regional Primate Research Center at the University of Washington. In method 1, 50 g of cortex was sliced in ice-cold buffer A (320 mm sucrose; 2 mm EGTA; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A; and 2 μg/mlp-aminobenzamidine). Then a gray matter-enriched portion, diluted with 10 volumes of buffer A, was homogenized successively with an Oster blender and a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Finally, a crude synaptosomal pellet (9000 × g av) (whereg av is g force at tube half-length) was prepared and purified on a Ficoll gradient using a modification of the methods of Fisher von Mollard et al.

The crude synaptic vesicle fraction, which contained Rab3A-enriched membranes (REM), was resuspended in 2–3 ml of buffer containing 300 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Then aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at −70 °C. Both freshly prepared and freeze-thawed REM gave similar results. The 176,000 × g av supernatant was concentrated 10-fold with a PM10 membrane (Amicon), and aliquots were prepared and frozen as described above. REM (15 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with various additives in 50 μl of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 μmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). For specific incubation conditions, refer to the figure legends. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g av in a Beckman TLA 45 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (but without Ca2+) with brief sonication. For quantitation of Rab3A, aliquots of each pellet and supernatant fraction (5 and 7 μl, respectively) were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the use of anti-Rab3A antibodies (see below). Corresponding samples of untreated membranes (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 μg of protein/sample) were used as standards. For quantitation of Rab1A and Rab5A, 10- and 12-μl aliquots of pellet and supernatant fractions were used, respectively; the samples of untreated membranes used as standards were 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 μg of protein/sample. The Western blots were scanned with a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer, and the absorbance values obtained for the Rab protein bands were converted to μg of equivalence of Rab proteins on the basis of the standard curves that were generated. The amount of each Rab protein dissociated from the REM was reported as a percentage of the total Rab protein recovered in the supernatant and membrane fractions. Unless indicated otherwise, data points shown in the figures represent single or duplicate measurements. In general, results of replicate measurements varied by no more than 2%. For Rab3A, the number of experiments represented by each figure is reported in the figure texts. For Rab1A and Rab5A, two dissociation experiments were performed and gave similar results. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to amino acids Ala2-Asn18 of the cDNA-predicted sequence of bovine brain Rab3A (34Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12394-12401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (35Aepfelbacher M. Vauti F. Weber P.C. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) except that a C-terminal cysteine was added when the peptide was synthesized to facilitate conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). A 1/500 dilution of the affinity purified antibody was used for most anti-Rab3A Western analyses. However, for Western analyses in cross-linking experiments with Rab3A peptide Ala2-Asn18 (see below), a 1/500 dilution of a Rab3A-specific antibody that had been raised against Rab3A peptide Lys202-Asp217(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The anti-Rab1A and anti-Rab5A antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were each used at a 1/125 dilution. Antibodies were also prepared against peptides corresponding to amino acids Gly21-Ser45 of the cDNA-predicted sequence of bovine brain Rab GDI (36Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Kondo J. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4116-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A 1/200 dilution of this affinity purified antibody was used for all anti-Rab GDI Western analyses. Antibody specificity was determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (37O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lopez M.F. Patton W.F. Sawlivich W.B. Erdjument-Bromage H. Barry P. Gmyrek K. Hines T. Tempst P. Skea W.M. Biochim.

A. 1994; 91: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of Rab3A, 20 μg of of purified synaptic vesicle protein (33Huttner W.B. Schieber W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) were analyzed, and only one immunoreactive band, representing >95% of the antibody-reactive material, was found. In the case of Rab GDI, 100 μg of nonhuman primate brain cytosol (9200 ×g av × 20 min supernatant as described (33Huttner W.B. Schieber W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)) were similarly analyzed and found to contain two adjacent proteins (representing >90% of the antibody-reactive material) that most likely represented two charged isoforms of Rab GDI (39Steele-Mortimer O. Gruenberg J. Clague M.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the Rab3A·CaM complex was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation (27Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified as follows. Supernatants from Rab3A dissociation experiments with 90 μg of REM, 100 μmCaCl2, and 50 μm CaM in 250 μl of buffer B were overlaid onto a 5-ml, 5–25% continuous sucrose gradient containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors as described for buffer B. After centrifugation for 7 h at 173,000 × g av in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor, fractions were analyzed for Rab3A with an immuno-dot blot assay. The high speed supernatant fraction from synaptosomal lysates (1 mg/250 μl) was similarly analyzed. For cross-linking experiments, REM (15–25 μg of protein) were washed twice by centrifugation in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors as described for buffer B. The washed membranes were mixed with Ca2+/CaM in 25 μl of buffer B and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C as described in the figure legends. The incubation mixtures were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g av; the supernatants were treated for 30 min at 30 °C with freshly prepared 1 mm BS3 (40Giedroc D.P. Keravis T.M. Staros J.V. Ling N. Wells J.N. Puett D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the reactions were quenched with Tris buffer and analyzed as described above (41Taniuchi M. Clark H.B. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4094-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). A similar BS3 treatment procedure was used in all other cross-linking experiments. CaM (225 μg) in 50 μl of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, was modified by reaction with 0.5 mCi of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (2200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's directions. The125I-labeled CaM was then separated from unreacted reagent with the use of a Bio-Gel P-6 DG (Bio-Rad) spin column as described (42Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, a mixture of 50 μl of125I-labeled CaM (10 nmol) and 50 μl of REM (450 μg) was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm GDP. After incubation the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g av, half of the supernatant was treated with BS3, and half was reserved as control. An aliquot of each half (50 μl) was then immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of anti-Rab3A IgG (1 μg) for 24 h at 0 °C. After immunoprecipitation, 40 μl of immobilized protein A on Trisacryl beads (Pierce; 50% slurry), which had been pretreated with bovine serum albumin, were added, and the sample was mixed for 20 h at 4 °C in a tube rotator. The protein A beads were then washed four times by a procedure that involved suspension in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, followed by centrifugation for 4 min at 350 ×g av. The washed beads were boiled for 4 min in 30 μl of 2% SDS and prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis (described below). To generate Rab3A-depleted membranes, REM (30 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 1.6 μm Rab GDI in 50 μl of buffer B (but without Ca2+), pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g av, and suspended in 5 μl of buffer B (but without Ca2+). To study the transfer of Rab3A to these membranes, they were mixed with medium containing Rab3A·Ca2+/CaM complex (prepared by incubating REM with buffer containing 75 μm CaM and 100 μmCaCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of one of the peptides listed in Table I. Then the incubation mixtures were subfractionated by centrifugation and analyzed as described above. The ability of synaptosomes to secrete glutamate was measured after KCl-induced depolarization (24Fisher von Mollard G.F. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) or treatment with 4-aminopyridine + 4β-phorbol dibutyrate (31Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto R. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A modification of the method previously described (24Fisher von Mollard G.F. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, control and depolarized samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then placed in ice water for 2 min and centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 × g av. The amount of NADPH that had been produced was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 360 nm on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer using 390 nm as the reference wavelength. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) but with 14% gels. In some cases, EGTA was added to the samples just before they were boiled. Proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to Immobilon P membranes for 30 min at 80 V for Western analysis of Rab3A or transferred for 60 min to identify cross-linked products of higher molecular mass. Immunoblots were performed as described (35Aepfelbacher M. Vauti F. Weber P.C. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) or, for SDS-containing samples, the micro-BCA method (Pierce). Free calcium ion concentrations were varied in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, on the basis of established binding constants (45Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974: 269Google Scholar). The initial aim of this investigation was to determine whether Ca2+ and CaM influence the dissociation of Rab3A from synaptic membranes. To examine this possibility, we isolated synaptosomes from samples of macaque cerebral cortex, lysed the synaptosomes in hypotonic medium, and prepared Rab3A-enriched membranes (REM) from the lysates by ultracentrifugation. Then we suspended the REM in medium containing Ca2+ and/or various other additives, incubated the mixtures for 30 min at 30 °C, separated the membranes from the medium by centrifugation, and separately measured the amounts of Rab3A recovered in the membrane and supernatant fractions. The results of these experiments demonstrated that medium containing both Ca2+ and CaM, i.e. a Ca2+/CaM complex, caused Rab3A to dissociate from the membranes but that medium containing either 100 μmCa2+ or 60 μm CaM alone did not (Fig.1). The dissociation of Rab3A occurred in the absence of added ATP, and half-maximal effects were observed when the concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM were about 0.5 and 20 μm, respectively. Maximal dissociation of Rab3A (approximately 65%) was obtained when the concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM were about 10 and 65 μm, respectively (data no"

We have found that mixtures of chromogranin A fragments can inhibit fibroblast adhesion. The anti-adhesive activity was converted into pro-adhesive activity by limited trypsin treatment. Pro-adhesive effects were observed also with recombinant N-terminal fragments corresponding to residues 1–78 and 1–115 and with a synthetic peptide encompassing the residues 7–57. These fragments induced adhesion and spreading of fibroblasts on plates coated with collagen I or IV, laminin, fetal calf serum (FCS) but not on bovine serum albumin. The long incubation time required for adhesion assays (4 h) and the FCS requirements for optimal adhesion suggest that the adhesive activity is likely indirect and requires other proteins present in the FCS or made by the cells.These findings suggest that chromogranin A and its fragments could play a role in the regulation of cell adhesion. Since chromogranin A is concentrated and stored within granules and rapidly released by neuroendocrine cells and neurons after an appropriate stimulus, this protein could be important for the local control of cell adhesion by stimulated cells.

This protein was found later to be a member of a family of regulated secretory proteins present in the electron-dense granules of many other neuroendocrine tissues and of the nervous system (1Rosa P.

For instance, CgA is co-stored with various hormones in the secretory vesicles of cells of the gastrointestinal tract (4Qian J. Hickey W.F. Angeletti R.H. J.

Cytochem. 1990; 38: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, it is a component of dense core synaptic granules in many areas of the central nervous system (11Munoz D.G. Kobylinski L. Henry D.D. George D.H. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Adams L.A. Ang L.C. Munoz D.G. Brain Res. 1993; 602: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human CgA is a hydrophilic protein of 439 amino acids, characterized by low isoelectric point and by several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation (3Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Konecki D.S. Benedum U.M. Gerdes H.-H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11559-11563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the secretory vesicles, CgA may form dimers and tetramers as a function of pH and Ca2+concentration (15Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol.

A large body of evidence suggests that tissue-specific patterns of proteolytic processing generate different fragments of CgA (18Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur.

Moreover, multiple forms having different hydrodynamic sizes of 600, 100, and 55 kDa have been detected in the serum of cancer patients (22Corti A. Gasparri A. Chen F.X. Pelagi M. Brandazza A. Sidoli A. Siccardi A.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As far as the physiological role is concerned, CgA has been suggested to be involved in hormone packaging within secretory granules and in modulating the secretory granule functions by binding Ca2+and ATP. Moreover, it has been proposed that CgA represents a precursor of biologically active peptides with endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine functions (23Deftos L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For instance, CgA residues 248–293 were found to be homologous to pancreastatin, a pancreatic peptide that inhibits insulin secretion (24Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), whereas chromostatin, a peptide corresponding to residues 124–143, inhibits secretion of catecholamines from chromaffin cells (25Galindo E. Rill A. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1426-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Retrogradely perfused and nerve-stimulated bovine adrenal medullae release the CgA fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–76 and 1–113. These fragments have been named vasostatin I and II (VS-1 and VS-2), respectively, because of their inhibitory effects on vascular tension (26Aardal S. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 1992; 41: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Aardal S. Helle K.B. Elsayed S. Reed R.K. Serck-Hanssen G. J.

In this work, we show that CgA fragments from natural and recombinant sources can modulate the adhesion of fibroblasts on various substrates and that a pro-adhesive domain is present in the N-terminal portion of the molecule. 96-Well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Falcon Micro Test III flexible assay plates) were obtained from Becton Dickinson and Co.

Invest. 1994; 17: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), was kept at −20 °C until use. CgA was then purified from the pheochromocytoma heat stable fraction (HSF) by immunoaffinity chromatography on mAb A11-Sepharose as follows: 3 mg of mAb A11 was coupled to 0.5 g of activated CH-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), using 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 8.0, as coupling buffer (overnight at 4 °C), and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as blocking agent (2 h at room temperature). After column washings (three times with 0.5 msodium chloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) pheochromocytoma HSF, 1 mg in 1 ml of sodium chloride, sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (PBS), was loaded onto the mAb A11-agarose column and washed with PBS until the absorbance of the effluent reached the base line. The column was then eluted with 3 ml of 0.5 m sodium chloride, 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.0 (fraction I), and with 10 ml of PBS (fraction A). The protein content in the starting material and in the purified fractions was quantified using the “Bio-Rad Protein Assay” kit. After pH neutralization, the CgA fractions were mixed with 2 volumes of acetone, incubated overnight at −20 °C, and centrifuged 45 min at 2500 × g. The pellet was dried using a SpeedVac concentrator, resuspended in water, extensively dialyzed against distilled water (three changes), and kept at −20 °C. Various recombinant fragments of human CgA (rCgA) were prepared including the following: (a) rCgA-(7–439), (b) NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-rCgA-(1–78) (VS-1); (c) NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-rCgA-(1–115) (VS-2); (d) a variant of the rCgA-(7–439) in which residues 46–48 (RGD) were replaced with RGE (RGE-rCgA-(7–439)) (numbering according to Konecki et al. (13Konecki D.S. Benedum U.M. Gerdes H.-H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Cloning, purification, and characterization of all these recombinant polypeptides are described elsewhere. 2A. Corti, L. Perez-Sanchez, A. Gasparri, F. Curnis, R. Longhi, A. Brandazza, A. G. Siccardi, and A. Sidoli, manuscript in preparation. Since all products contain the residues 68–70 recognized by mAb B4E11 (30Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and were able to bind to B4E11-agarose, all products were purified from recombinant Escherichia coli strains using this immunoadsorbent, essentially as described for natural CgA. Various 23–25-mer peptides spanning most of the CgA sequence were simultaneously synthesized on pre-loaded NovaSyn TGA resin (Novabiochem) using an apparatus for manual multiple peptide synthesis and a solid phase method based on Fmoc chemistry (31Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Tyrosine and glycine spacers were added at the N or the C termini to those peptides not containing chromophoric amino acids, to allow spectrophotometric detection. Each peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized. The peptide 7–57 was synthesized by the solid phase Fmoc method using an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer. After peptide assembly the side chain protected peptidyl resin was de-blocked as described (32King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 36: 255-266Crossref Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and purified to apparent homogeneity by reverse-phase chromatography. The peptide, containing two cysteines, was oxidatively folded by overnight treatment with 5-fold excess of oxidized glutathione (33Ferrer M. Woodward C. Barany G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and purified by ion exchange followed by reverse-phase chromatography. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of VS-2 was carried out by PRIMM s.r.l. Laboratories (Milan, Italy). Polyvinylchloride microtiter plates were coated with B4E11 (10 μg/ml in PBS, 50 μl/well, overnight at 4 °C). All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (200 μl/well, 2 h at room temperature) and washed with PBS again. CgA standard or sample solutions, diluted 1:2 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 2.5% normal goat serum (“assay buffer”) were added (50 μl/well) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed eight times by emptying and filling with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated with rabbit anti-rCgA-(7–439) antiserum, 1:1000 in assay buffer (50 μl/well, 1.5 h at room temperature). The plates were washed again as above and further incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:3000 in assay buffer, 50 μl/well, 1 h at room temperature). After the final wash, the plates were incubated with 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine solution in 0.05 m phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 3.5 mm hydrogen peroxide (100 μl/well, 30 min). The reaction was stopped by adding 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid (100 μl/well), and the absorbance of each well was read at 492 nm. Each assay was calibrated with eight rCgA-(7–439) solutions at various concentrations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in a Phast System apparatus (Pharmacia) using ready made polyacrylamide gels (Phast Gels 12.5% or 20%, Pharmacia). Samples were 2-fold diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as follows: proteins, after SDS-PAGE, were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using 20 mA for 25 min and 25 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.9, as transfer buffer. The nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed twice with PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 3% (w/v) milk. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with anti-CgA or anti-CgB mAbs (2 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA, 3% (w/v) milk, 1% (v/v) normal goat serum (“binding buffer”). After washing with PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were further incubated for 2 h with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000) in binding buffer. After the final wash, the visualization reaction was carried out with “ECL™-Western blotting” kit (Amersham Corp.), based on chemiluminescence of a luminol substrate. HSFS-132 cells were detached by treatment with a prewarmed trypsin/EDTA solution (0.2 μg/ml trypsin, 0.2 mg/ml EDTA) for 5 min at 37 °C, and mixed with DMEM 1 × supplemented with 10% FCS. After three washings with 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride to remove residual FCS, by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min, the cells were resuspended at 3 × 105 cell/ml in DMEM 1 ×, containing 1% FCS. Ninety-six-well polystyrene cell culture plates (Nunc) were coated with 50 μl/well of CgA fraction solutions in PBS (90 min at 37 °C). After coating, 100-μl aliquots of a 3% (w/v) BSA solution in DMEM was added to each well and left to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. The plates were then washed two times by emptying and filling with 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride and filled with 50 μl/well cell suspension. After 4 h incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, 200-μl aliquots of DMEM were added to each well and aspirated using a glass pipette connected to a vacuum pump. The cells were washed again with DMEM and fixed by adding 100 μl/well of 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (5 min at room temperature). The solution was then removed, and the fixed cells were stained by adding 50 μl/well of 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet for 10 min. This assay was performed using solid phases coated with various solutions containing collagen type I (10 μg/ml) or type IV (10 μg/ml), or laminin (10 μg/ml), or 1% FCS, or poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml) in PBS (90 min at 37 °C). After coating, the plates were washed and blocked with BSA as described for assay 1. Cells were resuspended at 3 × 105cell/ml in DMEM containing 4 mm glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mm sodium pyruvate solution (DMEM, 2 ×) and 2% (w/v) BSA. Twenty-five μl of cell suspension was then added to each well and mixed with 25 μl of CgA fractions at various concentrations in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. After 4 h incubation, adherent cells were washed, fixed, and stained as described for assay 1. Human CgA was isolated from the heat stable fraction (HSF) of homogenized pheochromocytomas by immunoaffinity chromatography, using a Sepharose-bound monoclonal antibody directed against the CgA-(81–90) epitope (mAb A11) (30Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two sequential fractions containing immunoreactive CgA material were recovered by eluting the column with a pH 2.0 buffer (fraction I) and then with PBS (fraction A). Reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses were then performed using an antibody that recognizes an epitope located within residues 68–70 of CgA (mAb B4E11) (30Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies showed that both fractions consist of heterogeneous mixtures of CgA fragments (Fig.1, panels A andB). The effect of fraction I and fraction A on the adhesive properties of HFSF-132 human foreskin fibroblasts was examined using these fractions adsorbed onto a solid phase (adhesion assay 1). In the presence of 1% FCS in the culture medium, the pattern of cell adhesion to fraction I- or fraction A-coated plates was opposite, being enhanced by fraction A and inhibited by fraction I (Fig. 2,left panels). Interestingly, microscopic inspection revealed that in fraction A-coated wells both cell adhesion and spreading were increased, whereas virtually no cells were found in fraction I-coated wells (Fig. 2, right panels). In the absence of FCS, HFSF-132 fibroblasts were still able to adhere to fraction A which were totally unable to adhere to wells coated with BSA or with fraction I. Similar results were observed also with mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that these effects are not species-specific (not shown). The inhibitory effect of fraction I was further tested using a different type of assay, in the absence of FCS. Plates were coated with nonsaturating amounts of various adhesive proteins, such as type I or type IV collagen or fibronectin, further incubated with various amounts of fraction I, and then blocked with a large excess of BSA. As shown in Fig. 3, 10 μg/ml fraction I was sufficient to inhibit NIH-3T3 fibroblast adhesion to these substrates. Size-exclusion HPLC of fraction I and fraction A, followed by detection of CgA antigen and adhesion-promoting activity in the chromatographic fractions, indicated that the hydrodynamic properties of the pro-adhesive and anti-adhesive materials were different, being eluted at M r 50–150 × 103 andM r 300–700 × 103, respectively (Fig. 4). To characterize the structural correlates of the adhesive and anti-adhesive effects, CgA was then produced by recombinant DNA technology. The cDNA coding for residues 7–439 of human CgA was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The product was isolated from the heat stable fraction of E. coli extract by immunoaffinity chromatography on mAb B4E11-agarose, followed by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 5). Again, two fractions were obtained, named rCgA-fraction A and rCgA-fraction I, characterized by adhesive and anti-adhesive effects. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the products (Fig. 1, panels A andB) revealed various immunoreactive bands of 70, 60, 45, 32, and 30 kDa and several other <20-kDa bands in both products. The N-terminal sequence of the 70- and 60-kDa bands was identical to that of residues 7–20 of CgA (not shown). This pattern suggested that extensive proteolysis occurred also in rCgA, probably starting from the C terminus, and that both the isolated fractions are highly heterogeneous. Since rCgA-fraction A was lacking the 70-kDa band and was apparently more degraded than rCgA-fraction I, we assume that proteolysis was a critical event in the generation of the pro-adhesive activity. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out various digestions of rCgA-fraction I with trypsin-agarose, followed by removal of the immobilized enzyme and analysis of the adhesion activity. Limited trypsin treatment (5–10 min) was accompanied by a change from anti-adhesive to pro-adhesive effects, whereas extensive treatment (1–2 h) completely abolished both activities (Fig.6). Various bands corresponding to <20-kDa products were observed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting after limited digestion (not shown). These results strengthen the assumption that increased CgA fragmentation is associated with a change from anti-adhesive to pro-adhesive activity. In conclusion, both natural and recombinant CgA behave like precursors that generate polypeptides endowed with opposite adhesive activities. To assess the potential role of integrins in rCgA-fraction A-mediated cell adhesion, we performed competition experiments using a GRGDS-peptide, commonly used to compete the interaction with integrin and RGD-containing substrates, and an anti-β1 integrin antiserum. As shown in Fig.7, the adhesion of HFSF-132 fibroblasts to rCgA-fraction A-coated plates, was efficiently competed by GRGDS and by the anti-β1 antiserum and poorly or not at all by control GRGESP and BSA. Interestingly, cell adhesion to fraction A was virtually abolished by fraction I suggesting that these CgA mixtures contain materials that compete with each other in cell adhesion. These results indicate that the rCgA-fraction A-mediated cell adhesion can be inhibited by affecting the β1-integrin function, hinting at a specific adhesion mechanism. However, we are unable from these data to speculate whether β1-integrin interact directly or indirectly with CgA fragments. Considering the long incubation time required for this adhesion assay (4 h), it is possible that the adhesive activity is indirect and requires other proteins made by the cells. Three N-terminal fragments were prepared by recombinant DNA technology and peptide synthesis. In particular, we produced (a) the recombinant NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-rCgA-(1–78) fragment (VS-1); (b) the recombinant NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-rCgA-(1–115) fragment (VS-2); and (c) the synthetic CgA-(7–57) peptide. The homogeneity and authenticity of recombinant products were assessed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and in the case of VS-2, also by mass spectrometry. Reducing SDS-PAGE of the purified VS-1 and VS-2 showed bands of about 15 and 10 kDa (Fig. 1, panels C and D). Moreover, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of VS-2 indicated a molecular mass of 13247.38 ± 0.54 daltons, which differs of only 0.33 daltons from the calculated mass. These results are consistent with the expected sequences of VS-1 and VS-2. The effects of VS-1 and VS-2 and the synthetic CgA-(7–57) peptide on the adhesive properties of various cell lines were assessed by two adhesion assays in which these products were either adsorbed onto a solid phase (assay 1) or in the liquid phase (assay 2). The cell lines tested included both CgA-producing and non-producing cell lines. The results, shown in Fig. 8, can be summarized as follows. (a) VS-1 and VS-2 adsorbed onto the solid phase have little or no effect on the adhesion of human HFSF-132 in the absence of FCS in the medium (panel A), while these polypeptides can significantly increase adhesion and spreading of these cells in the presence of 1% FCS (panel B). (b) All soluble polypeptides, including CgA-(7–57), at concentrations greater than 3 μm, increase human and mouse fibroblast adhesion to solid phases coated with 1% FCS or with poly-l-lysine, even in the absence of FCS in the liquid phase (panels C and D, and E andF). (c) None of the polypeptides are effective on the adhesion of human CgA-producing SK-N-BE and CHP-134 neuroblastoma or rat PC12 cells (panels G–N). (d) similar amounts of control proteins such as BSA, E. coli protein extract, and invertase had no effects. No effects were observed also with other control proteins spanning a wide range of isoelectric points such as the mouse IgG1 B4E11, transferrin, and avidin (not shown). Of note, FCS was apparently necessary for VS-1 and VS-2 adhesive activity in assay 1 (Fig. 8, panels A and B) while it was not necessary for that of fraction A (Fig. 7). Possibly, VS-1 and VS-2 peptides stick to the plastic less efficiently than CgA or these peptides need a FCS component to work. The adhesive effects of N-terminal CgA polypeptides were not restricted to FCS or poly-l-lysine-coated plates. As shown in Fig.9, the same effects were observed also on the adhesion of human fibroblasts to plates coated with types I and IV collagens or laminin but not with BSA.

Since receptors for eiseniapore on target cell membranes are not known, we used lipid vesicles of various composition to determine whether specific lipids may serve as receptors. Lytic activity of eiseniapore was probed by the relief of fluorescence dequenching from the fluorophore 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid originally incorporated into the vesicle lumen as a complex withp-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide. Hemolysin binds to and disturbs the lipid bilayer only when distinct sphingolipids consisting of a hydrophilic head group as phosphorylcholine or galactosyl as well as the ceramide backbone, e.g. sphingomyelin, are present. Cholesterol enhances eiseniapore lytic activity toward sphingomyelin-containing vesicles probably due to interaction with sphingomyelin. Leakage of vesicles was most efficient when the lipid composition resembled that of the outer leaflet of human erythrocytes. Presumably, an oligomeric protein pore formed by six monomers is responsible for leakage of sphingomyelin-containing vesicles. The secondary structure of eiseniapore did not change upon binding to lipid membranes. The lytic activity of eiseniapore was completely abolished after its denaturation or after preincubation with polyclonal antibodies.

Coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia fetida ssp. (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae) containing more than 40 proteins exhibits several biological effects as follows: cytolytic, proteolytic, hemolytic, hemagglutinating, tumorstatic, mitogenic, and bacteriostatic activities (1Roch P.

Recently, efforts have been directed toward identifying the molecular nature and regulation of lytic activity. Based upon partial purification of coelomic fluid, cytolytic and hemolytic activities have been associated with a protein of an apparent molecular mass of about 42 kDa (11Bilej M. Brys L. Beschin A. Lucas R. Vercauteren E. Hanusová de Baetselier P. Immun. Lett. 1995; 45: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have isolated recently a hemolysin from the coelomic fluid of Eisenia fetida fetida, referred to as eiseniapore, for the first time (12Lange S. Nuessler F. Ehlers D. Kauschke E. Kraft R. Kostka S. Lutsch G. Herrmann A. 23rd Meeting of the FEBS, Basel August 13–18, 1995. FEBS, Basel, Switzerland1995: 285Google Scholar). The molecular mass of this thiol-activated hemolysin was 38 kDa, and it exerted a strong lytic activity against erythrocytes. At least two different mechanisms preventing homologous lysis by eiseniapore have to be considered. First, an eiseniapore-regulating factor (ERF) purified recently by us inhibits the eiseniapore hemolytic properties (12Lange S. Nuessler F. Ehlers D. Kauschke E. Kraft R. Kostka S. Lutsch G. Herrmann A. 23rd Meeting of the FEBS, Basel August 13–18, 1995. FEBS, Basel, Switzerland1995: 285Google Scholar). Eiseniapore-regulating factor shares immunological properties with vitronectin, an inhibitor of complement and perforin lytic activities (13Tschopp J. Nabholz M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 279-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Podack E.R. Hengartner H. Lichtenheld M.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Indeed, vitronectin and eiseniapore interacted reversibly to suppress hemolytic activity, and eiseniapore-regulating factor acted as a potent inhibitor of complement-induced hemolysis. Identification of an eiseniapore-regulating factor and its properties confirms the hypothesis of Canicatti (15Canicatti C. Experientia ( Basel ). 1990; 46: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which suggested that vitronectin and related structures act as possible protectors of autolysis in invertebrates. Second, another strategy that may prevent self-killing considers the absence of membrane-associated receptor(s), which are required for binding of eiseniapore to self-membranes. However, the receptor for eiseniapore and a mechanism of any subsequent interaction with the lipid bilayer are not identified. Glycoproteins of the cell membrane are suggested as receptors since various acetylated and methylated carbohydrates were effective inhibitors of hemolytic activity of coelom fluid (1Roch P. Valembois P. Davant N. Lassegues M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 69: 829-836Google Scholar). Moreover, preincubation of semi-purified hemolysin with sphingomyelin, a typical component of mammalian plasma membranes, strongly suppressed hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes (4Roch P. Canicatti C. Valembois P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results prompted the hypothesis of a specific involvement of sphingomyelin in the hemolysin-mediated lysis of target cells (15Canicatti C. Experientia ( Basel ). 1990; 46: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As a corollary, it is not known whether this lipid will act as a receptor for eiseniapore. Here we present a comprehensive analysis concerning the interaction of eiseniapore from E. fetida fetida with unilamellar liposomes of various lipid composition. We discovered for the first time that distinct sphingolipids are an absolute requirement for both binding of eiseniapore to lipid membranes and their subsequent leakage. In the presence of these lipids we observed the formation of oligomeric pore-like structures of eiseniapore on liposomal membranes and rapid leakage of vesicles. While cholesterol alone did not mediate binding of nor leakage by eiseniapore, complexes of sphingomyelin and cholesterol enhanced its lytic activity. Our data suggest that eiseniapore hemolytic activity is optimized toward a lipid composition typically for the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of mammalian erythrocytes. Most importantly, our results imply that membrane-(glyco)proteins, as receptors for eiseniapore, are not required as long as specific sphingolipids are present. Adult E. fetida fetida (58Bouché M.B. Lombriciens de France: Ecologie et Systematique. Institut National de la Recherche Argonomique, Paris1972Google Scholar), synonym E. fetida typica (59André F. Bull. Biol. Fr.

Earthworms were washed, cultured, and covered with wet filter paper for 48 h at 6 °C. Coelomic fluid was obtained by puncturing the coelomic cavity with a glass micropipette. The suspension pooled from 40 earthworms was centrifuged (13.000 × g, 17 min) and the supernatant used immediately for purification of eiseniapore.

Since we found that SDS destroyed the lytic activity of eiseniapore, 2S. Lange, unpublished data. it was omitted. We found that the pI of eiseniapore was below 8.5, and the lytic activity of eiseniapore was not impaired up to a pH of 9.5. Thus, we used the Ornstein-Davis system (Tris/chloride/glycine) (16Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar) as follows: upper and lower electrode buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine), elution buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 1.5 mm thioglycolic acid), and sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mmthioglycolic acid, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Addition of reduced glutathione and thioglycolic acid was required to protect the biological activity of the protein. The monomer concentration for maximum resolution was determined empirically with native analytical gels. The system used for preparative electrophoresis was composed of a running gel (38-ml monomer volume of 7% acrylamide, 0.18% bisacrylamide) and a stacking gel (5-ml monomer volume of 4% acrylamide, 0.106% bisacrylamide). Preparative electrophoresis (model 491 Prep Cell, Bio-Rad) was conducted at 15 watts for 13.5 h with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of the elution buffer were collected at 4 °C and tested for hemolytic activity of eiseniapore using a suspension of 2% sheep erythrocytes in a microtiter plate assay. Hemolytic fractions were monitored by using 5–10% SDS-PAGE (see below), and purified hemolysin was used for dialysis and lyophilization. SDS-PAGE (nonreducing condition) was performed with 5–10% acrylamide gels in a vertical gel apparatus (Protean 2 xi Vertical Electrophoresis Cells; Bio-Rad). Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of sample and buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and subsequent boiling for 5 min. Gels were run at 250 V. Rabbits were immunized subdermally into the backs with 20 μg of isolated eiseniapore in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. An additional immunization was made 2 weeks later. Sera were purified by using a protein A-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad) with a final concentration of antibodies of 0.5 mg/ml. To probe neutralization, samples (80 μl) of eiseniapore (5 μg/ml) were diluted with 40 μl of antibody solution (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter interfaced with an external water bath to maintain temperature control and connected to a PC for data recording and processing. Fused silica cells of 1 mm path length were used. Spectra were recorded from 195 to 250 nm using a scan speed of 10 nm/min. The spectra correspond to the average of three scans. For data processing, the base line was subtracted, and spectra were smoothed using the software package supplied with the spectropolarimeter. The protein concentration was 3 μm in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Fluorescence was measured at 25 °C with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (Rochester, NY) using 10-mm quartz cuvettes. Protein fluorescence intensity was measured at wavelengths of λex= 280 nm and λem = 330 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Background intensity measured in the absence of protein was subtracted. Vesicle membranes in the absence (control) and presence of eiseniapore were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde at room temperature. Fixation was stopped after 10 min by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Specimens were visualized with 1% di-sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0, applying a double-carbon film technique. As support, 400-mesh copper grids covered with a holey carbon film were used. Micrographs were taken with an EM 400T electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 80 kV with a magnification of 60,000 and 80,000 ×. Lipids (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) of the desired composition (total lipid concentration 750 μmol/liter) were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and subsequently dried under nitrogen at room temperature. Lipids were hydrated by the addition of phosphate-buffered saline (5.8 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). If not stated otherwise small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) have been used. SUV were prepared by sonification of the lipid suspension on ice with a Branson sonifier (Danbury, CT) until the suspension became opalescent, usually for 8 min (18Woodle M.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 193-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of different composition were prepared after six freeze-thaw cycles by extrusion (extruder from Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, Canada) through two stacked polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore, CA) with 0.1-μm pore size. ANTS (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, di-sodium salt) · DPX (p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide) (Molecular Probes, OR) -filled vesicles and ghosts, respectively, were used to measure eiseniapore-induced leakage of luminal aqueous contents. The incorporation of the water-soluble complex ANTS·DPX into vesicles and the leakage assay were performed following the method described in Ellens et al. (19Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Vesicles contained 12.5 mmANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Vesicles were separated from non-encapsulated ANTS·DPX complexes by chromatography on Sephadex G-75 with Tes buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tes, 2 mml-histidine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The same buffer but with 0.1 mm EDTA only was used for the leakage assay. For preparing resealed ghosts we followed the approach of Schwoch and Passow (20Schwoch G. Passow H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 2: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Pomorskiet al. (21Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Zachowski A. Devaux F. Müller P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysis of 2 ml of ice-cold suspension of washed erythrocytes (90% packed) in 1.2 mm acetic acid, 4 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm ATP, 1 mm CaCl2 (pH∼ 3) was performed at 4 °C. After 5 min erythrocytes were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer (12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 50 mm Tris-HCl) and pH 7.2 was adjusted by addition of appropriate amounts of 0.1 m NaOH. Resealing of ghosts was performed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. Ghosts were separated from non-incorporated fluorescence marker by gel filtration (Sephadex G-75 column) using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 85 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, as elution buffer. To study the influence of lysolipids on the interaction of eiseniapore with ghost membranes, ghosts (total lipid concentration 750 μmol/liter) were preincubated withl-α-lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (C16:0, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 7 min at 25 °C before gel filtration. Leakage measurements were performed using a Shimadzu RF5001PC spectrofluorometer (Duisburg, Germany) at various temperatures with the wavelengths set to λex = 355 nm and λem = 530 nm, respectively. Dilution of the ANTS·DPX complexes caused by their release from the vesicle or ghost lumen leads to complex dissociation and, by that, to the relief of fluorescence quenching of ANTS. Thus, leakage is accompanied by an increase of ANTS fluorescence intensity. To elucidate the percentage of leakage, at the end of each experiment Triton X-100 (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was added (final concentration 0.1 vol %) to allow infinite dilution and dissociation of the ANTS·DPX complexes. To characterize membrane fluidity of liposomes, we recorded the EPR membrane spectrum of the spin-labeled fatty acid I(12, 3) (5-doxyl-stearic acid; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). The paramagnetic NO moiety is localized in the hydrophobic membrane phase close to the head group region of lipids. The concentration of I (12Lange S. Nuessler F. Ehlers D. Kauschke E. Kraft R. Kostka S. Lutsch G. Herrmann A. 23rd Meeting of the FEBS, Basel August 13–18, 1995. FEBS, Basel, Switzerland1995: 285Google Scholar, 3Kauschke E. Mohrig W. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1987; 11: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was 1 mol % of endogenous lipids. EPR spectra were measured by a Bruker ECS 106 (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) or by a Radiscope RS100 (Magnettech GmbH, Berlin, Germany) both equipped with a temperature controller. From the spectra the order parameter was measured which has been shown to characterize membrane fluidity (22Marsh D. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 51-142Google Scholar); an increase in fluidity causes a decrease of this parameter. The order parameter S was calculated according to Equation 1.S=(A∥−A‖)(Azz−Axx)ao13(A∥+2A‖)Equation 1 with A ∥ and A ‖the outer and inner hyperfine splitting, respectively, obtained from spectra. A zz (33 G) and A xx (6.95 G) are the respective hyperfine tensors, and a 0(15.10 G) is the isotropic hyperfine splitting of the crystal (23Schreier S. Polnaszek C.F. Smith I.C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 395-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We measured leakage of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) in the presence of eiseniapore using the ANTS · DPX assay. We observed no eiseniapore-mediated destabilization and, thus, leakage of liposomes consisted only of egg phosphatidylcholine (egg-PC) (Fig. 1,curve a, pH 7.4, 25 °C, molar lipid to protein ratio (L/P) = 50:1 (mol/mol)). Even at an L/P as low as 10:1, eiseniapore caused no leakage of egg-PC liposomes. Likewise, variation in temperature, 10–37 °C, and pH, 4.8–8.1, did not affect the stability of egg-PC membranes in the presence of eiseniapore. Furthermore, no eiseniapore-mediated release of ANTS · DPX was observed upon incorporation of phosphatidylserine (PS) and/or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) up to 50 mol % into egg-PC liposomes (data not shown). When replacing egg-PC for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine also no lysis of liposomes was observed neither below nor above the phase transition of this phospholipid (data not shown) indicating that the phase state and/or membrane fluidity of the lipid bilayer did not determine the lytic activity of eiseniapore. A profound leakage of liposomes was observed, however, in the presence of sphingomyelin (SM) (Fig. 1). At an egg-PC/SM ratio of 3:1 the extent of leakage after 7 min was approximately 10% (Fig. 1, curve b, 25 °C, pH 7.4, L/P = 50:1). An increase in ANTS · DPX leakage occurred when the lipid ratio was changed from 3:1 to 1:3 (Fig.1, curves c and d). Leakage of sphingomyelin-containing vesicles was also found at much higher L/P ratios (Fig. 2, curve b, L/P 250:1, Fig. 4). Destabilization of egg-PC/SM liposomes by eiseniapore was efficient at all L/P ratios investigated in the presence of cholesterol (e.g. L/P = 250:1, pH 7.4, 25 °C, Fig.2). Both the extent (see also Fig. 4) and the kinetics of leakage were enhanced in liposomes composed of egg-PC/Chol/SM, but there was no leakage in the case of egg-PC/Chol (Fig. 2) nor PS/egg-PC/Chol liposomes. Since it is known that cholesterol exerts a profound influence on membrane fluidity, the latter observations support the preliminary conclusion that the membrane fluidity does not resemble a determinant of eiseniapore interaction with membranes.Figure 2Eiseniapore-induced (final concentration 40 nm) leakage of liposomes (SUV, final concentration 10 μm) of different lipid composition at pH 7.4, 25 °C, in Tes buffer (L/P = 250:1).

(See legend to Fig. 1 and “Materials and Methods.”)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent of lysis of sphingomyelin-containing liposomes by eiseniapore depends upon the molar lipid to protein ratio. The leakage process became accelerated, and the final extent of lysis was enhanced upon increasing the protein concentration relative to lipids as shown for PS/egg-PC/Chol/SM (1:1:2:4) vesicles in Fig.3 A (see also Fig.4). For kinetics, we measured the half-time of vesicle lysis corresponding to 50% of the extent of final leakage. Dependence of half-time on the inverse of protein concentration can be fitted to a first approximation by a linear function (Fig. 3 B, curve a). The extent of leakage is a function of molar lipid to protein ratio demonstrated for egg-PC/SM liposomes of various compositions (Fig. 4). Recently, we discovered that eiseniapore caused hemolysis of human erythrocytes (12Lange S. Nuessler F. Ehlers D. Kauschke E. Kraft R. Kostka S. Lutsch G. Herrmann A. 23rd Meeting of the FEBS, Basel August 13–18, 1995. FEBS, Basel, Switzerland1995: 285Google Scholar) which prompted the preparation of liposomes resembling in their lipid composition the erythrocyte outer leaflet. The main lipid components in the exoplasmic human erythrocyte membrane leaflet are cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin (24Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar,25Op den Kamp J.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphatidylethanolamine and gangliosides (GA) are present, whereas phosphatidylserine is almost exclusively oriented to the cytoplasmic leaflet (25Op den Kamp J.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). To mimic the exoplasmic leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane liposomes were made of egg-PC/Chol/SM/PE/GA (12:17:10:3:1). Indeed, those vesicles allowed high eiseniapore activity (Fig. 4). For example, L/P as low as 260:1 facilitated a significant leakage of about 40% after 7 min incubation at 25 °C (pH 7.4). Even at 15 °C, the extent was about 35% (data not shown). Remarkably, a sphingolipid as sphingomyelin was required for eiseniapore to exhibit lytic activity. Neither gangliosides nor the phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine could replace sphingomyelin. The presence of phosphatidylserine in sphingomyelin-containing liposomes, however, stimulated eiseniapore-induced leakage (Fig. 4). To elucidate whether high curvature of SUV is essential for eiseniapore-mediated leakage, we also probed large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). Using LUV composed of PS/egg-PC/Chol/SM (1:1:2:4), we observed a slight reduction in the extent of leakage when compared with SUV (25 °C, pH 7.4; Fig. 4, inset). This indicates that curvature of lipid membranes is not an essential determinant for destabilization of lipid membranes by eiseniapore. To prove that leakage of lipid vesicles is specifically related to eiseniapore, we preincubated the protein with polyclonal antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”). After adding of ANTS · DPX-containing liposomes (egg-PC/Chol/SM, 1:1:2) no leakage was observed. Denaturation of eiseniapore by preincubation at 56 °C in each instance caused a complete loss of its lytic activity suggesting that the native conformation of eiseniapore is essential for its activity. Eiseniapore-mediated release of ANTS · DPX from sphingomyelin-containing liposomes depended upon pH and temperature. As shown for PS/egg-PC/Chol/SM (1:1:2:4), liposomal leakage (Fig.5 A, 25 °C) at neutral pH reached a maximum. At acidic or alkaline pH, pH 4.8 and pH 8.1, respectively, extent of lysis as well as kinetics declined. While the eiseniapore-induced release of ANTS/DPX from vesicles was slow with a low final extent at 10 °C, leakage became faster and enhanced after increasing the temperature (Fig. 5 B, measured for 25 and 37 °C, respectively). By thin layer chromatography (data not shown) we verified that no destruction of lipids occurred during the time course of the experiments. Thus, we have no indication for a hydrolase activity of eiseniapore. Since (i) eiseniapore caused hemolysis of human erythrocytes (12Lange S. Nuessler F. Ehlers D. Kauschke E. Kraft R. Kostka S. Lutsch G. Herrmann A. 23rd Meeting of the FEBS, Basel August 13–18, 1995. FEBS, Basel, Switzerland1995: 285Google Scholar) and (ii) liposomes comparable in their lipid composition to the outer leaflet of erythrocytes are sensitive to eiseniapore (see above), we measured leakage of resealed human erythrocyte ghosts using the ANTS · DPX assay. As can be deduced from the kinetics and the extent of leakage (Fig.6 A, 25 °C, pH 7.4), eiseniapore-triggered release of fluorophore from ghosts was faster and more efficient in comparison to liposomes even for a lipid composition corresponding to the outer leaflet of human erythrocytes (see also Fig.3 B). Even at the low L/P of 16,000:1, we found a significant leakage (about 20% after 7 min). At a ratio of 100:1, leakage was high; after 1.5 min of the addition of eiseniapore, leakage attained approximately 80% close to its plateau (90%). To a first approximation the half-time of the kinetics (see above) depends also linearly upon the inverse of the eiseniapore concentration (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the composition of the lipid phase was also crucial for the interaction with eiseniapore in the case of ghosts, we preincubated ANTS · DPX filled ghosts with 0.5 mol % lysophosphatidylcholine (C16:0). By employing radioactively labeled lysophosphatidylcholine, we showed the rapid insertion of those lipids into ghosts membrane (data not shown). 3B. Baljinnyam, B. Schroth-Diez, A. Herrmann, unpublished results. The presence of 0.5 mol % lysophosphatidylcholine in ghost membranes caused a significant reduction of eiseniapore-mediated leakage (Fig. 6 B). Similar to liposomes, we observed no leakage of ghosts upon denaturation of eiseniapore by heat pretreatment (data not shown). To ascertain whether binding of eiseniapore to sphingomyelin-containing liposomes was reversible, we measured the ANTS · DPX leakage of liposomes after preincubation of eiseniapore with unlabeled vesicles. When eiseniapore was preincubated with sphingomyelin-free vesicles (egg-PC, egg-PC/Chol (1:1), or egg-PC/PS (1:1)) for 15 min at 25 °C, the subsequent addition of labeled egg-PC/Chol/SM (1:1:2) caused a release of ANTS · DPX that was similar in extent and kinetics to that of controls (preincubation in the absence of liposomes) (Fig.7). However, after preincubation of eiseniapore with egg-PC/Chol/SM (1:1:2) liposomes subsequently added ANTS · D"

As the translocating polypeptide chain emerges in the matrix, mhsp70 binds to it in an ATP-dependent manner, and ATP hydrolysis by mhsp70 then drives the inward movement of the polypeptide chain (13Kang P.J.

Although the different functions of mhsp70 have been extensively studied, very little is known about the properties of the purified protein, its interaction with nucleotides and protein substrates, and the effect of co-chaperones on these interactions. Information on these points will be essential for understanding how mhsp70 mediates the translocation of polypeptides across the mitochondrial inner membrane as well as the folding of some of these polypeptides in the mitochondrial matrix. To address these questions, we purified mhsp70 from yeast and studied its oligomeric state; we also explored the effect of nucleotides and a peptide substrate on mhsp70 oligomerization. Finally, we determined the N terminus of mature mGrpE, expressed the mature protein in Escherichia coli, and assayed its interaction with mhsp70. Two hundred mg of purified yeast mitochondria containing hexahistidine-tagged mhsp70 were solubilized in 40 ml of Buffer A (50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% nonionic detergent octyl-polyoxyethylene, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mmimidazole, and 10 units/ml apyrase). After a 20-min incubation at 4 °C, the solution was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with 1.25 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose for 90 min. The beads were washed three times with 100 ml of apyrase-free Buffer A. mGrpE was eluted by incubation for 20 min in 10 ml of Buffer A that lacked apyrase and NaCl but contained instead 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATP. For further purification of mGrpE, the eluate was applied to a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Corp.) equilibrated with 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% octyl-polyoxyethylene and eluted from the column with a linear salt gradient (0–500 mmNaCl). mGrpE eluted at about 200 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated in Centricon tubes, washed three times with 0.1% acetic acid, and applied to a reverse phase C4 HPLC column (Aquapore Butyl, 2.1–30 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. mGrpE was eluted by a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 60% acetonitrile in 30 min. The protein that eluted as a single peak was collected and subjected to N-terminal sequencing as described (15Jenö P. Mini T. Moes S. Hintermann J. Horst M. Anal.

Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was carried out with 10 mm glutaraldehyde at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer containing 200 mm glycine. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using either linear 4–18% slab gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or 4% tube gels (18Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow measurements were done at 25 °C with an SX-17MV spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Excitation was at 370 nm, and emission light was passed through a GG455 cutoff filter (Jena, Germany). The dissociation constant of the p5·mhsp70 complex was determined as described (30Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A solution of 50 nm p5 peptide was placed in a cuvette and the base line was recorded. Increasing amounts of mhsp70 were then added. After each addition, the fluorescence was recorded until equilibrium was reached. The dissociation constant was determined assuming one binding site and a right-angled hyperbola as the saturation curve. The ATPase activity of mhsp70 was measured as described by Viitanen et al. (19Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) at room temperature in 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.04 Ci/mmol). Aliquots of 25 μl were withdrawn at different intervals and mixed with 7 volumes of 1m perchloric acid, 1 mm sodium phosphate. After adding 16 volumes of 20 mm ammonium molybdate and 16 volumes of isopropyl acetate, the samples were mixed vigorously for 15 s. The inorganic and organic phases were separated by centrifugation for 15 s in a microcentrifuge, and an aliquot of the organic phase containing the radioactive phospho-molybdate complex was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. All ATPase values were calculated from initial rates during which the amount of ATP hydrolyzed was a linear function of time. In all experiments, the background resulting from contamination of ATP by inorganic phosphate or from spontaneous hydrolysis of ATP was <1.5% that of the measured values. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed at 20 °C in an analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman XLA) equipped with an optical absorption system. Sedimentation velocity was carried out at 56,000 rpm in a 12-mm double-sectored Epon cell (500 μl). Sedimentation velocity was measured at 20 °C with 100-μl samples at either 10,000 rpm (mhsp70 or mGrpE·mhsp70 complexes) or at 14,000 rpm (mGrpE alone). The molecular masses were determined using a linear regression computer program that adjusts the base-line absorption to obtain the best linear fit of ln A versus r 2 (A = absorption, r 2 = radial distance from the rotor center). Measurements of sedimentation equilibrium were carried out in the presence of 0.1 mm adenine nucleotide. Mhsp70 and nucleotides were purified as described (20Horst M. Oppliger W. Feifel B. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. DnaK and bacterial GrpE were gifts from Dr. H.-J. Schönfeld (Roche Co, Basel, Switzerland). Hexahistidine-tagged Mdj1 was purified on Ni-NTA beads as described (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). mGrpE is made as a precursor that is cleaved upon import into the mitochondrial matrix (21Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our previous attempt to identify the cleavage site had been unsuccessful, perhaps because the N terminus of the purified protein was blocked (21Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopoulos C. Jenö P. Kronidou N.G. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the mGrpE precursor with bacterial GrpE suggested to us that cleavage of the presequence occurs after amino acid 23 of the yeast precursor (21Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopoulos C. Jenö P. Kronidou N.G. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lalorayaet al. (22Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) concluded that a cleavage site occurs after amino acid 42. As it seemed possible that blockage of the mGrpE N terminus was an artifact caused by purification of the protein on SDS-PAGE, we used a different purification strategy. First, we isolated mitochondria from a yeast strain that overexpressed mhsp70 carrying a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Second, we solubilized the mitochondria with nonionic detergent in the absence of nucleotides, bound the mhsp70·mGrpE complex to Ni-NTA agarose beads, and removed unspecifically bound proteins by washing. Third, we specifically released mGrpE from the mGrpE·mhsp70·Ni-NTA-agarose complex by MgATP. Fourth, we purified the eluted mGrpE to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase HPLC. The N-terminal sequence of the pure mGrpE was Ser-Asp-Glu-Ala-Lys. Comparison of this sequence with that of the predicted mGrpE presequence indicated that the cleavage occurs after amino acid 44. To obtain large amounts of mGrpE and Mdj1, both proteins were tagged with a C-terminal hexahistidine extension, expressed in E. coli, bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads, and eluted with imidazole (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To check whether the C-terminal tag altered the structure of mGrpE, we analyzed the tagged protein by analytical equilibrium sedimentation. We determined a native molecular mass of 44 kDa (TableI). As the monomer has a mass of about 22 kDa, the tagged mGrpE seems to exist as a dimer, as was also shown for bacterial GrpE (24Osipiuk J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4821-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity centrifugation yielded a sedimentation coefficient of 2.3 S (Table I). This is a rather low value for a 44-kDa globular protein, suggesting that the mGrpE dimer has an elongated shape.Figure 4Cross-linking of mGrpE·hsp70 complexes. Mhsp70 (A) or DnaK (B) (0.5 μm monomer each) was preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 mm K-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 with GrpE at the ratio indicated on the top of each lane and then treated with glutaraldehyde.

In the corresponding bacterial system, DnaJ alone (which accelerates the ATP hydrolysis of DnaK) or GrpE alone (which acts as a nucleotide exchange factor) stimulates the ATPase of DnaK only slightly, whereas the combination of both co-chaperones stimulates strongly (26Liberek K.

Stimulation of the ATPase activity of mhsp70 by mGrpE and Mdj1 can thus be used as an indicator for specific interaction between these proteins. Table II presents an analysis of the mhsp70 ATPase in the presence of various cofactors. Mhsp70 alone only hydrolyzed 0.11 mol of ATP/mol of mhsp70/min (Table II). This value corresponds to one turnover of the ATPase in 9 min. mGrpE alone or Mdj1 alone each caused slight, but significant stimulation of the mhsp70 ATPase (to 0.21 mol and 0.8 mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol of mhsp70/min, respectively). The combination of mGrpE and Mdj1 strongly stimulated the mhsp70 ATPase to 2.58 mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol of mhsp70/min.Table IIEffect of cofactors on the mhsp70 ATPaseCofactorATPaseNone2-a1 μm mhsp70.0.11 (0.01)mGrpE2-a1 μm mhsp70.,2-b2 μm Δ45mGrpE.0.21 (0.01)Mdj12-a1 μm mhsp70.,2-c2 μm Mdj1.0.80 (0.03)p52-a1 μm mhsp70.,2-d2.5 μm p5 peptide.0.35 (0.01)mGrpE + p5 a,b,d0.85 (0.02)Mdj1 + p5 a,c,d0.72 (0.07)mGrpE + Mdj1 a,b,c2.58 (0.14)mGrpE + Mdj1 + p5 a,b,c,d2.63 (0.11)The specific activity of ATPase is expressed as mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol of mhsp70/min.

Open table in a new tab The specific activity of ATPase is expressed as mol of ATP hydrolyzed/mol of mhsp70/min. Standard deviations are given in parentheses. The oligomeric state of mhsp70 was studied by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and analytical ultracentrifugation. In our standard cross-linking protocol, we incubated the protein samples with 10 mm glutaraldehyde at 30 °C for 30 min, as preliminary experiments had shown these conditions to give maximal cross-linking (data not shown). In the absence of added nucleotides, mhsp70 formed oligomers (Fig.1, lane 1; Table I). ADP did not affect the type of oligomers detected by cross-linking (Fig. 1,lane 2) but increased the percentage of monomer 2-fold. In the absence of nucleotides, some of the cross-linked oligomers were apparently too large to enter the gel; this effect probably explains the lower combined intensity of the cross-linked bands seen inlane 1. ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP almost completely prevented oligomer formation; only a minor fraction of mhsp70 existed as dimers and trimers (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). These results were also confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Table I). Disoligomerization of mhsp70 in vitro thus appears to require only binding but not hydrolysis of ATP. To test the interaction of mhsp70 with a peptide substrate, we used the decapeptide CALLLSAPRR (termed p5) that represents part of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of aspartate aminotransferase from chicken. The peptide was labeled at its single cysteine residue with the fluorescent dye acrylodan (30Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Binding of fluorescent p5 to mhsp70 slightly shifted the emission maximum from 524 to 518 nm and increased the emission intensity at 500 nm by 50% (Fig.2). The dissociation constant for the interaction of p5 (50 nm) with mhsp70 in the absence of added nucleotides was 43 nm (Fig. 2, inset). This high affinity suggests a specific interaction. Addition of ATP caused the peptide to be released from mhsp70 with an apparent half-time of 40 ms. ADP did not cause any release (Fig.3). The ATPase activity of mhsp70 alone or in the presence of mGrpE was enhanced 3-fold in the presence of p5 peptide. In the presence of either Mdj1 alone or of both mGrpE and Mdj1, the p5 peptide did not provide any additional stimulation (Table II). The p5 peptide caused complete monomerization of mhsp70 (Fig. 1,lane 5; Table I), perhaps because it competes for hydrophobic surfaces on mhsp70 with other mhsp70 molecules or because it alters the structure of mhsp70 in a way that decreases the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. To study the interaction of mGrpE with mhsp70, we stabilized the hetero-oligomer formed between these two proteins by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (24Osipiuk J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4821-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows the cross-linking pattern observed with different mhsp70/mGrpE mixtures. As already shown in Fig.1, mhsp70 alone yielded only three cross-linked mhsp70 species, the monomer being dominant. As the mhsp70 concentration in this experiment was half that used in the experiment shown in Fig. 1, oligomer formation was less pronounced. Addition of mGrpE yielded a new species whose migration on SDS-PAGE suggested that it is composed of two molecules of mGrpE and one molecule of mhsp70 (Fig. 4). At mGrpE:mhsp70 ratios in excess of 1.5, this species was the predominant one. The existence of such an mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. In a solution containing mGrpE and mhsp70 at a molecular ratio of 2:1, a homogeneous species with an apparent mass of about 122 kDa was detected (Table I). In addition, cross-linking revealed a minor species with a mobility less than that of the mhsp70(mGrpE)2 hetero-oligomer (Fig.4 A, lanes 5–7, asterisk). This form has an apparent mass of ∼240 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE, consistent with a hetero-oligomer composed of two molecules of mhsp70 and four molecules of mGrpE. Recently it was suggested that at bacterial GrpE concentrations of above 0.32 mg/ml, six molecules of bacterial GrpE form a physiologically relevant complex with one molecule of DnaK (31Wu B. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4806-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To study the formation of mGrpE·mhsp70 complexes at high protein concentrations, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 4 with higher concentrations of mGrpE and mhsp70. We then separated the cross-linked products on SDS-PAGE and characterized them by immunoblotting with antibodies against mhsp70 or mGrpE (Fig.5). Cross-linking of mGrpE alone showed that at low concentration (1.0 μm) the protein exists mainly as a dimer (Fig. 5 B, lane 8), but that at 13 μm it forms larger oligomers (Fig.6 B, lane 9). Surprisingly, when mGrpE was tested by analytical ultracentrifugation at concentrations of up to 20 μm, only mGrpE dimers were detected (Table I), suggesting that the larger oligomers are rather labile. We then tested the effect of three different mhsp70 concentrations on the oligomeric state of mGrpE·mhsp70. At 0.5 μm mhsp70 and 1 μm mGrpE, only the usual mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex was detected (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). When the mGrpE concentration was raised to 3 μm, all of the mhsp70 was immunodetected as the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Even at 13 μm mGrpE, most of the mhsp70 was observed as mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex, although larger mhsp70-containing complexes could be detected. Some of these might not have entered the gel, thereby lowering the intensity of the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 band (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). At the high mGrpE concentrations at which mGrpE was in large excess over mhsp70, the excess mGrpE formed higher oligomers that lacked mhsp70 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and5). When the concentration of mhsp70 was raised so as to saturate all of the mGrpE (mhsp70/mGrpE = 0.5), most of the large mGrpE oligomers disappeared, and the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex again became the predominant species (Fig. 5 A and B,lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, when solutions containing up to 20 μm mGrpE were examined by analytical ultracentrifugation at an mhsp70/mGrpE ratio of 0.5, only the 122-kDa hetero-oligomer was detected. In the absence of nucleotides, mGrpE seemed to bind to mhsp70 with high affinity, as free mGrpE was detected only when no free mhsp70 molecules were available (Fig. 4, lane 6; see also Fig. 6). To study the effect of nucleotides on the mGrpE-mhsp70 interaction, we incubated 0.5 μm mhsp70 and 1.5 μm mGrpE with 1 mm of either ADP, ATP, or AMP-PNP before cross-linking (Fig. 6). The cross-linking products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and characterized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mhsp70 (Fig.6 A) and mGrpE (Fig. 6 B). In the absence of added nucleotides, we mainly detected the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2hetero-oligomer as well as the (mGrpE)2 homodimer (Fig. 5,lane 1). A similar result was obtained in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (Fig. 6, lane 4). Very little mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex was detected in the presence of ADP (Fig. 6, lane 2), whereas upon the addition of ATP the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 complex dissociated completely (Fig. 6,lane 3). Complete dissociation of the hetero-oligomeric complex thus seems to occur in the presence of ATP. The hsp70 chaperone system of E. coli consists of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (28Szabo A. Langer T.

Whereas homologs of DnaK and DnaJ have been found in the eukaryotic cytosol and in chloroplasts (32Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 33Schell D.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 521-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), eukaryotic homologs of all three proteins have only been detected in mitochondria. The mitochondrial hsp70 system thus appears to be the closest eukaryotic counterpart of the bacterial chaperone triad (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A.

Although the function of the mitochondrial system has been studied in intact cells, isolated mitochondria, and mitochondrial extracts, little is known on the properties of the purified proteins and their interaction with each other. In the work described here, we have studied the physical and functional interaction of purified mhsp70 with purified mGrpE in the presence and absence of cofactors using enzyme assays, analytical ultracentrifugation, and chemical cross-linking. For these studies, we first had to determine the N terminus of mature mGrpE. It is well established that mGrpE is made with a cleaved N-terminal matrix targeting signal, but the length of this signal has been controversial (21Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopoulos C. Jenö P. Kronidou N.G. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We now show that mature protein starts at amino acid 45 and that neither of the earlier predictions had been correct. Still, the recombinant mature mGrpE we have studied here behaved quite similarly to an earlier construct that lacked only the first 24 residues of the cleaved targeting signal (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Independently, Deloche and Georgopoulos (37Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that two mGrpE constructs similar to those used by us in this study could complement the growth defect of a bacterial temperature-sensitive GrpE mutant. Our study used hexahistidine-tagged mGrpE and Mdj1, and it might be argued that the properties of the tagged proteins are different from those of the authentic proteins. It is difficult to exclude such an artifact completely, but analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking showed that the quaternary structure of the tagged mGrpE closely resembles that of untagged bacterial GrpE. Also, the physical and functional interactions of the tagged mGrpE with mhsp70 or DnaK were essentially indistinguishable from those reported for bacterial GrpE or untagged mGrpE (16, 25, 27, 38; compare also Fig. 4 Bof this study with Fig. 3 of Ref. 37). Thus, the tag does not seem to profoundly alter the structure or function of mGrpE. Our results show that the mhsp70 chaperone system shares many structural features with its counterparts in E. coli and the eukaryotic cytosol. First, mhsp70 self-associates in the absence of added nucleotides or in the presence of ADP, and the oligomers are dissociated by ATP or a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (24, 25, 39-41). This effect has been proposed to be mechanistically important for the activity of hsp70 s. The ATP-induced conformation of hsp70 may have fewer exposed hydrophobic surfaces that lead to self-association. Second, mhsp70 interacts with both Mdj1 and mGrpE (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and these interactions stimulate the ATPase activity of mhsp70 (26Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 27McCarty J. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol.

Third, mhsp70 binds a peptide substrate in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of ADP but not in the presence of ATP, and peptide binding dissociates the mhsp70 oligomers and stimulates the mhsp70 ATPase (27McCarty J. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar,30Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P.

Fourth, mGrpE and Mdj1 can bind to DnaK and replace their bacterial homologs in stimulating the DnaK ATPase (Fig. 4 Bof this paper and Refs. 16Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and 38Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested that the complex formed at high concentrations of bacterial GrpE and DnaK is composed of six molecules of GrpE and of one molecule of DnaK (31Wu B. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4806-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached on the basis of experiments employing cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and gel filtration. We investigated the oligomeric state and the interaction of mGrpE with mhsp70 at high protein concentration by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas cross-linking revealed that mGrpE alone at concentrations >3 μm oligomerizes to tetramers and hexamers (Fig. 5,lane 9), analytical ultracentrifugation only detected mGrpE dimers, even at mGrpE concentrations of up to 20 μm(Table I). This discrepancy might either mean that glutaraldehyde induces oligomerization of mGrpE or that the higher oligomers are too labile to be detected without covalent stabilization. In contrast, analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde yielded identical results for the structure of the mhsp70·mGrpE complex. At high concentrations of mGrpE and mhsp70, cross-linking detected mostly the mhsp70·(mGrpE)2complex, and analytical ultracentrifugation detected the corresponding 122-kDa species. We conclude that a complex of two molecules of mGrpE and one molecule of mhsp70 is the major hetero-oligomer both at low and at high protein concentrations. The mhsp70·(mGrpE)2 oligomer is stable in the absence of externally added nucleotides or in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP but dissociates in the presence of ATP. This result appears to conflict with the recent report that ATPγS, another nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, dissociates the mGrpE·DnaK complex (37Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be explained by the different methods used. The dissociating effect of ATPγS was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which measures the steady state interaction between DnaK and mGrpE. In contrast, cross-linking by glutaraldehyde is much faster and irreversible, thereby allowing detection of weak and transient interactions (31Wu B. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4806-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We thank M. Jaeggi and L. Müller for the artwork, H.-J. Schönfeld for samples of DnaK and bacterial GrpE, and N. G.

All are members of a protein family with repetitive immunoglobulin C2 and fibronectin type III motifs. The myosin binding domain was mapped to a single immunoglobulin motif in cardiac MyBP-C and skeletal MyBP-H. Limited α-chymotryptic digestion of cardiac MyBP-C generated three peptides, similar in relative mobility to those of skeletal MyBP-C: ∼100, 40, and 15 kDa.

Only the 14- and 15-kDa peptides bound to myosin. Thus, the myosin binding site in all three proteins resides within an homologous, C-terminal immunoglobulin domain. Binding reactions (2) between the skeletal and cardiac MyBPs and corresponding myosin isoforms demonstrated saturable binding of theMyBP proteins and their C-terminal peptides to myosin, but there are higher limiting stoichiometries with the homologous isoform partners.

The Structural Basis of Muscular Contraction. Plenum Press, New York1981: 344-362Google Scholar). This zone contains a set of 11 transverse repeats of 43 nm axial spacing, distributed along the constant diameter region of the thick filaments. Seven to nine of these repeats are decorated with antibodies specific for one or more isoforms of MyBP-C (18Bennett P. Craig R. Starr R. Offer G. J. Muscle Res.

The molecular mechanisms and physiological implications for sorting of the MyBP isoforms remain obscure. Mammalian and avian MyBP-H exhibit anomalous electrophoretic mobilities in reducing SDS-PAGE: the molecular weight of MyBP-H has been estimated to be 86 kDa by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Fn, fibronectin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. and ultracentrifugation (9Starr R. Offer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 675-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the true masses of the chicken and human proteins, based on cDNA sequences, are 58,487 and 51,986 kDa, respectively (3Vaughan K.T.

Genomics. 1993; 16: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This anomalous retardation in SDS gels is a property of the N-terminal 24 kDa of the protein, which contains two extended motifs of alternating alanine and proline residues, resembling the N terminus of skeletal muscle myosin light chain 1 (33Nabeshima Y.I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Muramatsu M. Ogata K. Nature. 1984; 308: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 40-kDa section of MyBP-H is comparable in structure to the C terminus of MyBP-C; the two proteins share 49.6% sequence identity and 17% conservative amino acids in this region (1Einheber S. Fischman D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2157-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J.

The amino acid sequences reveal seven immunoglobulin (Ig) C2 sets and three fibronectin (Fn) type III motifs in MyBP-C and four IgC2 and two Fn type III repeats in MyBP-H. Thus, MyBP-C and MyBP-H are members of the Ig superfamily (34Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20302-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myosin binding domain of chicken MyBP-C has been mapped to a 14-kDa C-terminal, α-chymotryptic peptide, containing one IgC2 repeat (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that a comparable myosin binding domain resides at the C terminus of cardiac MyBP-C and skeletal MyBP-H and also show that this domain plays a central role in the binding specificities between the different myosin isoforms and variant forms of the MyBPs expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Evidence is presented for competitive binding of MyBP-C and MyBP-H to myosin. Crude myosin was prepared from fresh chicken heart and skeletal muscle as described (19Reinach F.C. Masaki T. Shafiq S. Obinata T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Only ventricles were used to isolate proteins from the heart. The MyBPs were purified as described (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). α-Chymotryptic cleavage of skeletal and cardiac MyBP-C was performed with proteins predialyzed in 0.1 mKCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), and 1 mmDTT. Cardiac or skeletal MyBP-C (0.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 1:250 w/w of α-chymotrypsin in 0.001 n HCl and then incubated at 23 °C for 30 min. The cleavage reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. Tryptic cleavage of MyBP-H was performed after dialysis of MyBP-H against 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT. MyBP-H (0.2 mg/ml) was mixed with 1:500 w/w of trypsin in 0.001 nHCl and incubated at 23 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.3:1 w/w of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington). To purify the proteolytic fragments under nondenaturing conditions, products of the cleavage reaction were fractionated on a Superose 12 FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 10 × 300 mm; run at 0.5 ml/min) equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF. After proteolytic cleavage, peptides in the reaction mixtures were separated electrophoretically by 15% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresed peptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (43Yuen S.W. Chue A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis each gel was soaked for 5 min in transfer buffer. Transfer of peptides was performed at 75 mA (constant current) at 4 °C for 8 h. The membranes were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol in 1% acetic acid for 10 min and destained with 90% methanol and then washed in water. Stained bands were excised and sent for immediate sequencing or stored at −20 °C in sealed Eppendorf tubes. Myosin (cardiac or skeletal) stored in glycerol was dialyzed against 0.1m KCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), and 1 mm DTT to obtain synthetic (reconstituted) filaments. The filaments were then pelletted by centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 1 h) and solubilized in 0.6 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT. Myosin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.58 mg/ml/cm (44Godfrey J.E. Harrington W.F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In all cases the binding reactions were performed between the MyBPs and myosin in filament form. The final concentration of myosin in all experiments was 1.5 μm. Thus, myosin was aliquoted into an Eppendorf tube, the solution was diluted 6-fold with water (reducing the KCl concentration from 0.6 to 0.1 m), and the MyBPs or their proteolytic peptides added at varying concentrations (0–4 μm.). The solution was incubated for 30 min on ice in a final volume of 100 μl. Myosin filaments with associated binding proteins were then sedimented in an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 22 p.s.i. for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.5 mm PMSF. Supernatants and pellets were displayed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a GC300 Hoffer (San Francisco) densitometer linked to a GS350 data processing system. The amount of bound proteins or their fragments was normalized to the myosin light chain concentrations. In all experiments the binding stoichiometry is described as mol MyBP or MyBP peptide bound per mol of myosin molecule. Curve fitting for all binding plots was performed with the Slide Write Plus version 4 program. A solution phase binding assay (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was used to examine the interactions between fast-type MyBP-C and reconstituted filaments prepared from fast-type skeletal myosin purified from the pectoralis major muscle of adult chickens. The same assay was also used to analyze the binding of cardiac MyBP-C and MyBP-H to different myosin isoforms. Briefly, binding of the MyBPs to myosin filaments was examined at constant myosin concentrations (1.5 μm) while varying the concentrations of the MyBPs (0–4 μm). The binding reaction was performed for 30 min, twice the time needed to reach reaction equilibrium (data not shown), and the filaments with associated proteins were then separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. Several experiments are illustrated in Fig.1 A in which the binding assays were performed at equimolar ratios of the MyBPs and myosin (1.5 μm:1.5 μm), and the pellet fractions were displayed by SDS-PAGE. Densitometric analyses of the pellets revealed that all of the MyBPs exhibited saturable binding to reconstituted filaments prepared skeletal or cardiac myosins, but there were differences in the amounts bound at saturation (the limiting stoichiometries), which was characteristic of the respective isoforms. Based on half-maximal binding values, only minor differences in relative affinities were apparent. At saturation MyBP-H bound to skeletal myosin filaments with a molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1 B). Different results were obtained with the MyBP-C isoforms. Skeletal muscle MyBP-C bound to skeletal myosin filaments with a limiting stoichiometry of about 0.6:1, but with cardiac myosin it saturated at a molar ratio of 0.25:1. MyBP-H exhibited similar myosin isoform-specific binding values. At saturation 0.35 mol of MyBP-H bound/mol of cardiac myosin, as compared with the 1:1 binding ratios with skeletal myosin. Thus, both of the skeletal muscle MyBPs had significantly higher limiting stoichiometries with skeletal than cardiac myosin filaments. The reverse was true for cardiac MyBP-C; almost twice as much cardiac MyBP-C bound to cardiac as to skeletal myosin filaments (Fig.1 B). At saturation, ∼0.6 mol of cardiac MyBP-C bound to 1 mol of cardiac myosin, whereas ∼0.3 mol of MyBP-C bound to 1 mol of fast skeletal myosin filaments. To test if MyBP-C and MyBP-H bound to a common site on myosin, a series of competition binding assays were performed. Myosin, skeletal or cardiac (1.5 μm), was incubated with 1.5 μm of skeletal or cardiac MyBP-C for 30 min; this was twice the time required for the binding complex of myosin-MyBP to form (data not shown). Varying concentrations of skeletal MyBP-H were then added to this mixture (Fig. 2, A andC), and the reaction mixtures were incubated for another 30 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged as above, the supernatants and pellets were displayed by SDS-PAGE, and the Coomassie Blue-stained gels were analyzed by scanning densitometry. The results indicated that addition of MyBP-H reduced the binding of MyBP-C to myosin filaments (Fig. 2, A and C). Identical results were obtained when skeletal or cardiac myosin filaments were first incubated with saturating levels (3, 4, or 5 μm) of skeletal or cardiac MyBP-C for 30 min, and then 1.5 μm of skeletal MyBP-H was added to the mixture (data not shown). This reduction was most pronounced with the cardiac proteins, i.e. MyBP-H could displace greater amounts of cardiac MyBP-C from cardiac myosin filaments than skeletal MyBP-C bound to skeletal myosin filaments (Fig.2). Competitive binding of the two proteins was independent of the order in which the two myosin-binding proteins were mixed. The presence of MyBP-C did not alter the amount of MyBP-H bound to the myosin filaments at saturation. Similar saturating amounts of MyBP-H bound to myosin filaments in both the competition experiments and in the direct binding assays performed in the absence of MyBP-C (∼1 mol MyBP-H/mol of skeletal myosin and 0.55 mol MyBP-H/mol of cardiac myosin) (Figs. 1and 2).Figure 2Competition between skeletal MyBP-C and MyBP-H for binding to reconstituted myosin filaments. Skeletal (A and B) or cardiac (C andD) myosin in 0.1 m KCl was incubated for 30 min on ice with saturating concentrations of skeletal MyBP-C (A), cardiac MyBP-C (C), or skeletal MyBP-H (B and D). Varying concentrations of skeletal MyBP-H (A and C), skeletal MyBP-C (B), or cardiac MyBP-C (D) were added to the mixture, incubated another 30 min, then centrifuged, and analyzed as described for Fig.1 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Competitive binding of the two proteins was independent of the order in which the two myosin-binding proteins were mixed. Although MyBP-H was capable of displacing MyBP-C from myosin filaments, the reverse was not true (Fig. 2, B and D). In these experiments skeletal or cardiac myosin filaments were incubated with 1.5 μm of skeletal MyBP-H for 30 min, and then varying concentrations of MyBP-C were added to the mixture and incubated for another 30 min. Increasing amounts of MyBP-C, whether skeletal or cardiac, did not affect the binding of MyBP-H to either skeletal or myosin filaments. These results suggest that MyBP-H has a greater avidity for the binding sites on myosin filaments than does MyBP-C, although the half-maximal binding values appear rather similar. Digestion of skeletal MyBP-C with α-chymotrypsin gives rise to three peptides with relative mobilities (M r of ∼100,000, 28,000, and 14,000; the C-terminal M r 14,000 fragment contains the major myosin binding domain (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because MyBP-C and MyBP-H share 50% sequence identity in the C-terminal third of each molecule (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Vaughan K.T. Weber F.E. Einheber S. Fischman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3670-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that selective proteolysis of MyBP-H and the other MyBP-C isoforms might release comparable C-terminal cleavage fragments, which could then be tested for binding to myosin filaments. MyBP-C from chicken cardiac muscle was digested with α-chymotrypsin, generating three proteolytic fragments, M r∼100,000, 40,000, and 15,000 (Fig. 3,A and B). These fragments were separated by FPLC chromatography and purity assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 A). The purified fragments ofM r 40,000 and 15,000 were partially sequenced (Fig. 5, A and B), and the fragments positioned within the primary structure were established by cDNA sequencing (45Yasuda M. Koshida S. Sato N. Obinata T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2275-2286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The M r40,000 fragment could be assigned to the N terminus of the molecule, the M r 15,000 peptide to the C terminus, and the 100-kDa fragment placed in between (Fig.6). The summed relative mobilities of the three peptides came to 155,000 matching the M rof cardiac MyBP-C (46Hartzell H.C. Sale W.S. J.

However, tryptic digestion of skeletal MyBP-H, under identical conditions, generated two major proteolytic fragments with M r of 50,000 and 14,000, respectively (Fig. 3 B). These fragments were separated by FPLC gel filtration, and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B). Partial amino sequencing was used to place theM r 14,000 fragments along the derived amino sequences obtained from cDNA analyses. TheM r 14,000 peptide contained the C-terminal sequence of skeletal MyBP-H beginning at residue Val-429 (3Vaughan K.T. Weber F.E. Einheber S. Fischman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3670-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). We were unsuccessful in obtaining sequence data from theM r 50,000 fragment, suggesting a capped N terminus. As discussed by Vaughan et al. (3Vaughan K.T. Weber F.E. Einheber S. Fischman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3670-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the true mass of the M r 50,000 fragment may be less thanM r 50,000. The deduced order of these peptides in the MyBP-H molecule is indicated in Fig. 6. When the total α-chymotryptic digest of cardiac MyBP-C was incubated with reconstituted filaments prepared from cardiac myosin, only the 15-kDa C-terminal fragment exhibited significant cosedimentation with the myosin filaments. The N-terminal 40-kDa peptide and the large internal 100-kDa fragment associated weakly if at all to the myosin filaments (Fig.7 A). An equivalent result was obtained when the tryptic hydrolysate of skeletal MyBP-H was incubated with reconstituted skeletal myosin filaments; only the C-terminal 14-kDa fragment cosedimented with the myosin filaments (Fig.7 A). No detectable binding to myosin filaments was observed with the N-terminal 50-kDa fragment. We then purified the C-terminal peptides under nondenaturing conditions and used them for solution-phase binding assays with reconstituted skeletal and cardiac myosin filaments (Fig. 3 B). In all cases, saturable binding of the 14- and 15-kDa fragments with myosin was observed (Fig. 7 B). At saturation ∼1.5 mol of the C-terminal fragments of skeletal MyBP-C and skeletal MyBP-H bound/mol of skeletal myosin, whereas less than 1 mol (∼0.6 mol) of the 15-kDa fragment of cardiac MyBP-C bound to this same concentration of either skeletal or cardiac myosin. Of particular note was the observation that significantly less of the 14-kDa fragment of skeletal MyBP-C bound to cardiac than to skeletal myosin filaments (0.35 versus 1.5 mol/mol). As noted above with the full-length MyBPs, significantly more MyBP-C peptide bound to skeletal than to cardiac myosin filaments. Thus, the 14-kDa proteolytic fragment of MyBP-C and the full-length molecule exhibit qualitatively similar binding reactions with these two myosin isoforms. We did not obtain sufficient quantities of the 14-kDa fragment from skeletal MyBP-H to perform binding reactions with cardiac myosin. However, clear differences were observed between the C-terminal peptides of skeletal MyBP-C and cardiac MyBP-C when binding was tested with cardiac myosin. At saturation more cardiac MyBP-C peptide bound to cardiac myosin than did the skeletal MyBP-C peptide. Based on its half-maximal binding values, the cardiac C-terminal peptide had an ∼2-fold greater affinity for cardiac myosin than did the skeletal muscle C-terminal peptide for this same myosin isoform. Thus, isoform recognition of the MyBPs for myosin appears to reside in the C-terminal Ig motif of both MyBP-C and MyBP-H. We have established that only the 14-kDa fragment of skeletal MyBP-H and the 15-kDa fragment of cardiac MyBP-C, each located at the C termini of the respective molecules, account for the myosin binding properties of these molecules. These results confirm and extend the data of Okagaki et al. (2Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that the myosin binding domain of skeletal MyBP-C resides in a C-terminal 14-kDa peptide. Because the proteolytic digestions and myosin binding assays were performed under nondenaturing conditions, we assume that the released fragments retain tertiary structures present within the full-length, native molecules. That being the case, it is likely that each of these MyBPs has a related three-dimensional structure at its C terminus, the myosin binding domain of each molecule. Our observations have significance in clarifying the pathogenesis of those cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mutations of the cardiac MyBP-C gene on chromosome 17. Both published reports (47Watkins H. Conner D. Thierfelder L. Jarcho J.A. MacRae C. McKenna W.J. Maron B.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nature. 1995; 11 (abstr.): 433-438Google Scholar, 48Bonne G. Carrier L. Bercovici J. Cruaud C. Richard P. Hainque B. Gautel M. Labeit S. James M. Beckmann J. Weissenbach J. Vosberg H.-P. Fiszman M. Komajda M. Schwartz K. Nature. 1995; 11: 438-440Google Scholar) indicate that the mutations cluster in the C terminus of MyBP-C and would be expected to alter expression of a region of this molecule that is now demonstrated to bind myosin. We have demonstrated that when varying combinations of skeletal or cardiac myosin are mixed with each MyBP or its C-terminal fragment, there is saturable binding between these reactants. It appears that all of the in vitro binding properties of MyBP-C and MyBP-H to myosin filaments can be accounted for by a single Ig motif at the C terminus of each protein. Cross-binding studies between isoforms from skeletal and cardiac muscles demonstrate that at saturation there is a higher limiting stoichiometry between homologous partners than between heterologous pairs. More skeletal MyBP-C or its C-terminal peptide bound to skeletal myosin at saturation than to cardiac myosin. The reverse was true for cardiac MyBP-C. In short, there is a degree of isoform specificity or molecular recognition in these binding reactions. Interestingly, more C-terminal peptide bound per mole of myosin at saturation than did the full-length protein. Twice as much of the C-terminal peptide of MyBP-C bound per mole of myosin than did the full-length MyBP-C. This same phenomenon was true for each of the MyBPs. At this time it is not possible to fully interpret these differences with certainty since they involve the interactions of a small protein molecule or peptide with a large polymer of myosin. Both differential affinities, stearic hindrances and changes in polymer structure during the binding reaction might interplay to affect the results observed. Because the 14-kDa C-terminal peptide of MyBP-C is approximately one-tenth the size of the full-length molecule, it might have greater accessibility to myosin filament cores than does full-length MyBP-C. Alternatively, upstream sites in MyBP-C might inhibit the binding of the C-terminal domain to the myosin rod. Available data cannot distinguish between these possibilities. Evidence exists that titin binds to MyBP-C and that this binding may occur within the last four domains of the MyBP (49Freiburg A. Gautel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is likely that titin forms a trimeric complex with myosin and MyBP-C, thereby facilitating and organizing the binding of MyBP-C to native myosin filaments. Because all of our binding studies were performed in the absence of titin; future analyses are warranted with native thick filaments stripped of MyBP-C or with reconstituted myosin filaments in the presence of added titin. These considerations are important forin vivo considerations of C-protein targeting (discussed below). There has been one prior study on the binding of MyBP-H to skeletal myosin (50Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7163-7168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using rabbit muscle proteins; it was found that 1.5 mol of MyBP-H bound per mol of myosin at saturation. That might be compared with the value of 1 mol/mol found in the present report. Considering the differences in species and binding assays, the results are reasonably consistent. Competitive binding experiments indicate that chicken MyBP-H can inhibit the binding of both skeletal and cardiac MyBP-C to reconstituted myosin filaments. A different result was obtained in the prior study with rabbit muscle proteins (50Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7163-7168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the rabbit study binding of MyBP-C to myosin filaments was only partially inhibited by the presence of saturating levels of MyBP-H. These species-specific differences are informative. Immunoelectronmicroscopic studies by Bennett et al. (18Bennett P. Craig R. Starr R. Offer G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 550-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have shown that rabbit MyBP-H is confined to the P-zone of the A-band and does not overlap the distribution of MyBP-C in the C-zone. In contrast, Bahler et al. (32Bahler M. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that chicken MyBP-H is distributed along the 43 nm stripes of both the P- and C-zones of the A-band. Thus, chicken MyBP-H must co-distribute with MyBP-C along the thick filament, whereas rabbit MyBP-H binds at different sites than does MyBP-C. Several possibilities might be considered to account for these binding data: (a) myosin filaments contain only one docking site for the MyBPs that is capable of binding either MyBP-C or MyBP-H but with differing affinities; (b) myosin filaments contain two (or more) sets of related docking sites for the MyBPs, but these differ in relative affinity for MyBP-H and MyBP-C; (c) myosin filaments contain independent binding sites for these two proteins, but occupancy of one site affects the binding properties of the other,i.e. the two sites interact allosterically; (d) association of a MyBP with a myosin filament could alter the higher order structure of the filament, thereby changing its interactions with other proteins, including the MyBPs. Present data cannot discriminate between these possibilities, but the two-site model seems to account for most of our observations and those of Yamamoto (50Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7163-7168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the existence in the chicken of two binding sites/mol of myosin in the thick filament that are capable of binding a MyBP molecule. MyBP-H binds to both of these sites with comparable affinity, but MyBP-C binds to only one of these sites and does so with a lower avidity than that of MyBP-H. In rabbit muscle we suggest that MyBP-C and -H bind to separate sites, and this might account for theirin vivo sorting to different positions in the A-band. On the other hand, if the two MyBPs share common binding sites with equivalent avidities, additional protein interactions must define their final distributions in the cell. In this case, A-band distributions of the two proteins could be specified by additional interactions between myosin and other A-band components, e.g. titin. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that the myosin binding domain (motif 10) of MyBP-C is required for targeting of this protein to the A-band, but this motif is not sufficient to do so alone (51Gilbert R. Kelly M.G. Mikawa T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 101-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three adjacent motifs (motifs 7, 8, and 9) are also required for proper targeting of MyBP-C to the C-zone of the sarcomere. Because these latter modules appear to bind titin (36Fürst D.O. Vinkemeier U. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 769-778PubMed Google Scholar, 49Freiburg A. Gautel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), it seems likely that insertion of MyBP-C into its native sites in the A-band requires the cooperative interaction of myosin, titin, and the MyBP. Thus, MyBP-H and MyBP-C could compete for binding to myosin, but their distinctive interactions with titin would modify their insertion in the sarcomere. Although MyBP-H and MyBP-C share considerable sequence homology over their C-terminal 400 amino acids and contain alternating Fn III and IgC2 motifs in this section of both molecules, the proteins differ substantially at their N termini. Conceivably, N-terminal regions of each molecule might define additional protein-protein interactions required for the final placement of each molecule in the sarcomere and function in their regulatory properties. We express appreciation to Dr. Marina Lebedeva for helpful advice during the course of this study and to Dr. Daniel Wellner for assistance with amino acid sequencing."

Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that PFK-M associates with caveolin-3 with a significant time lag after the biosynthesis of PFK-M. In addition, we show that this interaction is (i) highly regulated by the extracellular concentration of glucose and (ii) can be stabilized by a number of relevant intracellular metabolites, such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which are known allosteric activators of PFK. While the bulk of these experiments were performed in C2C12 cells, identical results were obtained using mouse skeletal muscle extracts.

Taken together, our results suggest that glucose-dependent plasma membrane recruitment of activated PFK-M by caveolin-3 could have important implications for understanding the mechanisms that regulate energy metabolism in skeletal muscle fibers. An extensive body of evidence suggests that certain glycolytic enzymes associate with other enzymes or with cytoskeletal components (1Bronstein W. Knull H.R. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Ovadi J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 486-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Such interactions are thought to modulate the activities of these enzymes. Phosphofructokinase is the key enzyme in the control of glycolysis. It catalyzes the committed and rate-limiting step in glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. As such, phosphofructokinase is subject to a myriad of allosteric effectors, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, ATP, AMP, H+, and citrate.There are three different isoforms of phosphofructokinase (PFK) 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, phosphofructokinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, phosphofructokinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.: PFK-A, PFK-B, and PFK-C (4Tsai M.Y.

These isoforms combine to give rise to homo- and hetero-tetrameric complexes (6Weil D. Cottreau D. Van Cong N. Rebourcet R. Foubert C. Gross M.-S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. Ann. Hum.

PFK-B (PFK-L in rat and human) is most highly expressed in liver. Finally, PFK-C (PFK-C in rat, PFK-P in human) expression is relatively brain-specific.A number of reports describe the association of PFK-M 2In this report, we refer to the muscle-specific isoform of PFK as PFK-M.

However, this isoform has also been termed PFK-A in the mouse. with various cytoskeletal elements and signal transduction-related kinases. In heart muscle, a fraction of PFK-M is associated with phospholipase A2 (9Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, PFK-M associates with tubulin under certain conditions (10Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovadi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin plays a key role in this process, as it stimulates binding of both PFK and aldolase to the muscle cytoskeleton (11Chen-Zion M. Bassukevitz Y. Beitner R. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PFK can undergo reversible phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and protein kinase C (12Mahrenholz A.M. Lan L. Mansour T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression levels are highest in cell types that contain numerous caveolae, i.e.adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts (reviewed in Ref. 22Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of caveolin-2 mRNA greatly resembles the distribution of caveolin-1, and both appear to be co-expressed in the same cell types (23Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In contrast, caveolin-3 expression is limited to muscle tissue types (skeletal muscle, diaphragm, and heart) where it is localized to the muscle cell's plasma membrane (sarcolemma) (24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Similarly, caveolin-3 protein expression is dramatically induced during the differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts to myotubes in culture (24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown which molecules interact with caveolin-3 in vivo.Here, we show that an ∼80-kDa protein specifically co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin-3 expressed in differentiated skeletal C2C12 myotubes. Microsequence analysis of this 80-kDa polypeptide revealed its identity as PFK-M, a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that association of PFK-M with caveolin-3 is highly dependent on extracellular glucose concentrations and can be stabilized by a number of relevant intracellular metabolites such as fructose 1,6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-phosphate.DISCUSSIONHere, we have demonstrated that under certain metabolic conditions PFK-M and caveolin-3 form a stable complex. Formation of this complex is relevant in vivo as judged by cross-linking experiments in intact C2C12 cells as well as co-immunoprecipitation of PFK-M with caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle tissue lysates. The level of complex formation can be modulated by the presence of various intracellular metabolites that are known allosteric activators or inhibitors of PFK activity. In line with these observations, PFK-M-caveolin-3 complex formation is exquisitely sensitive to extracellular glucose concentrations.Since the interaction between PFK-M and caveolin-3 is observed under conditions of physiologic extracellular glucose, we believe it is an enzymatically active form of PFK that associates with caveolin-3. This type of interaction with caveolin-3 would recruit PFK-M to the muscle cell plasma membrane (sarcolemma), the site of glucose entry into the cell. In previous studies, we and others have shown that a fraction of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter Glut4 partitions into caveolar membrane domains in adipocytes and that this fraction can be increased in response to insulin (35Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 43Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 367-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). While we have not studied this phenomenon in skeletal muscle cells that also express Glut4, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that glucose transporters and a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis would be recruited to the plasma membrane and locally concentrated in caveolar domains. In support of this hypothesis, Glut4 has been previously localized to caveolae-like domains in skeletal muscle fibers by immunoelectron microscopy (44Friedman J.E. Dudek R.W. Whitehead D.S. Downes D. Frisell W.R. Caro J.F. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,45Dohm G.L. Dolan P.L. Frisell W.R. Dudek R.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Adipocytes primarily express caveolins-1 and -2 (23Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 35Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), have much less of an acute energy demand, and thus, would not require such a mechanism. Indeed, we were unable to find any evidence for an interaction of caveolin-1 with PFK-M despite fairly high sequence homology between caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 (85% similarity and 65% identity) (24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). We and others have proposed the idea that caveolins-1, -2, -and -3 function as scaffolding proteins to locally concentrate molecules involved in signal transduction within caveolar microdomains of the plasma membrane (22Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). By analogy, caveolin-3 homo-oligomers could act as a plasma membrane-bound scaffold involved in meeting the high energy demand of skeletal muscle cells.In line with this proposal, PFK-M is known to be regulated by a variety of serine and tyrosine kinases, which are signal-transducing molecules (protein kinases A and C, and epidermal growth factor receptor; see Introduction).PFK has been the subject of intense study for many years. Why has this interaction between PFK-M and caveolin-3 gone unreported? We believe that several reasons have allowed the PFK-M/caveolin-3 interaction to escape detection. First, the interaction between these two proteins is quite labile and may not survive a variety of harsh purification procedures. Second, conventional lysis protocols focus on the soluble fraction of PFK-M or lysis using the detergent Triton X-100. All caveolins described to date are not solubilized under these conditions and require the presence of additional detergents such as octyl glucoside (23Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Third, and perhaps most important, all members of the caveolin gene family are very difficult to visualize. Caveolins stain poorly with conventional reagents such as Coomassie Blue, Ponceau S, or silver-staining protocols (39Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Additionally, caveolin-3 has a very slow turnover rate, resulting in poor incorporation of35S-labeled amino acids during the course of pulse-chase experiments. The only way to effectively detect the presence of caveolin-3 is by Western blot analysis. We have only recently cloned the cDNA for caveolin-3 (24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and subsequently generated a caveolin-3-specific monoclonal antibody (25Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) that recognizes the unique N-terminal region of the protein that is not shared by other caveolin family members. Thus, molecular cloning of caveolin-3 and generation of a mono-specific antibody has allowed us to identify PFK-M as a prominent caveolin-3-associated protein.Importantly, we do not wish to imply that PFK-M represents the only protein interacting with caveolin-3. Caveolin-1 has been shown to interact directly with a number of signal transducing molecules, including H-Ras, heterotrimeric G proteins, Src-like kinases, and ecNOS (30Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P.

We suspect that such interactions could also occur with caveolin-3, since peptides derived from caveolin-3 have similar inhibitory effects on the GTPase activity of Gα-subunits as caveolin-1 derived peptides (24Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolar organization of signaling molecules and certain glycolytic enzymes could help to physically couple the generation of cellular energy with environmental cues provided by extracellular signals such as the concentration of glucose, and ligands that may activate growth factor receptors or G protein-coupled receptors.While we and others have provided evidence that certain signaling molecules are concentrated in the inactive conformation within caveolae membranes (G proteins, Src-like kinases, protein kinase C) (30Li S.

James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, other molecules, such as PFK-M, may be recruited to plasmalemmal caveolae after activation by the appropriate stimuli.As caveolin-3 is a component of the dystrophin complex (25Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), our current findings with PFK-M may also have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Duchenne's and related muscular dystrophies. In support of this assertion, PFK-M demonstrates abnormal allosteric properties in mdx mice (54Lilling G. Beitner R. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1991; 45: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of dystrophin expression may adversely affect the regulated interaction of PFK-M with caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle fibers. An extensive body of evidence suggests that certain glycolytic enzymes associate with other enzymes or with cytoskeletal components (1Bronstein W. Knull H.R. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Ovadi J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 486-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Such interactions are thought to modulate the activities of these enzymes. Phosphofructokinase is the key enzyme in the control of glycolysis. It catalyzes the committed and rate-limiting step in glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. As such, phosphofructokinase is subject to a myriad of allosteric effectors, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, ATP, AMP, H+, and citrate. There are three different isoforms of phosphofructokinase (PFK) 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, phosphofructokinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, phosphofructokinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.: PFK-A, PFK-B, and PFK-C (4Tsai M.Y.

These isoforms combine to give rise to homo- and hetero-tetrameric complexes (6Weil D. Cottreau D. Van Cong N. Rebourcet R. Foubert C. Gross M.-S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1980; 44: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Vora S. Francke U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Vora S. Blood. 1981; 57: 724-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PFK-A (also termed PFK-M for the rat and human isoform) is predominant in muscle tissues. PFK-B (PFK-L in rat and human) is most highly expressed in liver. Finally, PFK-C (PFK-C in rat, PFK-P in human) expression is relatively brain-specific. A number of reports describe the association of PFK-M 2In this report, we refer to the muscle-specific isoform of PFK as PFK-M. However, this isoform has also been termed PFK-A in the mouse. 2In this report, we refer to the muscle-specific isoform of PFK as PFK-M. However, this isoform has also been termed PFK-A in the mouse. with various cytoskeletal elements and signal transduction-related kinases. In heart muscle, a fraction of PFK-M is associated with phospholipase A2 (9Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, PFK-M associates with tubulin under certain conditions (10Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovadi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin plays a key role in this process, as it stimulates binding of both PFK and aldolase to the muscle cytoskeleton (11Chen-Zion M. Bassukevitz Y. Beitner R. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PFK can undergo reversible phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and protein kinase C (12Mahrenholz A.M. Lan L. Mansour T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Hofer H.W. Schlatter S. Graefe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it is a substrate for regulation by a number of retroviral transforming protein kinases (14Hue L. Rousseau G.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Also, purified epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor can phosphorylate PFK on tyrosine residues (15Reiss N.

CSB cells exhibited rapid repair near the transcription initiation site but were deficient in repair of sequences encountered by RNA polymerase during elongation (beginning at position +20). Since transcription of the JUN gene was UV-induced in all fibroblast strains, including CSB, the defective repair of the transcribed strand in CSB cannot be explained by a lack of transcription; rather, it appears to be a true DNA repair defect.

Ultraviolet irradiation induces two major types of photoproducts in DNA, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; NER, nucleotide excision repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; CS, Cockayne syndrome; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; NER, nucleotide excision repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; CS, Cockayne syndrome; nt, nucleotide(s). and the pyrimidine (6-4)-pyrimidone photoproducts, as well as much lower amounts of purine dimers, pyrimidine monoadducts, and a photoproduct between adjacent A and T bases (for reviews see Refs. 1Brash D.E.

UV mutagenesis is characterized by a high frequency of transition mutations at dipyrimidine sequences containing cytosine (1Brash D.E. Photochem.

Based on its much slower repair rate relative to the pyrimidine (6-4)-pyrimidone photoproduct (2Mitchell D.L. Nairn R.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 5van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and based on a number of mutagenesis studies using photoreactivation of CPDs, the CPD is thought to be the major mutagenic UV-induced lesion in mammalian cells (1Brash D.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 3Sage E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Repair rates of both CPDs and pyrimidine (6-4)-pyrimidone photoproducts are heterogenous along the mammalian genome. This heterogeneity could result in selective mutation of specific DNA sequences. There is a preferential repair of active genes relative to inactive genes, and the transcribed strand of active genes is repaired faster than the nontranscribed strand (5van Hoffen A. Venema J.

The specific chromatin environment of the lesion is also considered to be an important factor that may affect recognition of lesions and repair rates (4Pfeifer G.P. Photochem.

Furthermore, the repair rates of UV-induced CPDs can vary along the same gene sequence, even between adjacent base positions (12Kunala S. Brash D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Defects in several of these proteins are associated with rare inherited genetic disorders, including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (20Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Many of these genes and their gene products have been cloned and are characterized by their ability to correct the defects in XP or CS cells. The XPA protein binds preferentially to damaged DNA and is believed to be a major factor in the DNA damage recognition step of the NER process (32Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Both XPB and XPD are components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (33Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V.

XPC, complexed with HHR23B (the human homologue of the yeast protein RAD23B), is involved in the global genome repair pathway and appears to be dispensable for transcription-coupled repair of active genes (36Venema J. van Hoffen A.

The precise function of the XPC protein is unknown. The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B gene product is essential for transcription-coupled repair of active genes (38Venema J.

Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) or, as suggested more recently, as a repair-transcription uncoupling factor (41van Oosterwijk M.F. Versteeg A. Filon R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation triggers the so-called UV response, a transcriptional response that may serve a protective function and provide a mechanism for the cells to replace damaged components (42Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 43Fornace Jr A.J. Annu. Rev.

The JUN gene, which codes for a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, is one of the UV response genes in mammalian cells (45Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 46Stein B. Angel P. van Dam H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. van der Eb A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previously, we established a detailed map of DNA repair rates along the JUN gene and its upstream promoter region using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We reported slow repair rates along the promoter sequences, very fast repair rates surrounding the transcription initiation site, and a repair gradient along the transcribed DNA strand with faster repair within the 5′-end and diminished repair toward the 3′-end of the gene (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To further elucidate mechanisms of sequence-specific and domain-specific NER, we have characterized the repair rate patterns along the JUN promoter and sequences surrounding the transcription initiation site in several repair-deficient fibroblast strains including xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A, B, C, and D and Cockayne syndrome complementation group B. The following repair-deficient human fibroblast strains were obtained from the NIGMS (National Institutes of Health) human genetic mutant cell repository: GM00710B (XPA), GM13025 (XPB), GM00676 (XPC), GM10428 (XPD), and GM01098B (CSB). The repair-deficient fibroblast strains were grown as contact-inhibited monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum. Normal human foreskin fibroblasts (strain HF-35) were used as repair-proficient cells. Before UV irradiation (254 nm), the medium was removed, and the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The UV dose was 10 J/m2 as determined with a UVX radiometer (Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA). For DNA repair experiments, the original medium was returned to the cells, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time before lysis and DNA analysis. Nonirradiated cells and cells collected immediately after irradiation served as negative controls and positive controls (no repair), respectively. Total cellular RNA from nonirradiated fibroblasts and from fibroblasts at various times after UV irradiation was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (47Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were sequentially hybridized with probes specific for the human JUN and GAPDH genes. The probes were made by repeated run-off polymerization from PCR products (48Törmänen V.T. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1729-1736PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation to allow DNA repair, cells were lysed, and DNA was isolated and purified as described previously (49Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). DNA was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA) to a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. The UV-irradiated DNA was cleaved to completion with T4 endonuclease V for 1 h at 37 °C to generate single-strand breaks at CPDs and then incubated with Escherichia coli photolyase to generate ligatable ends (50Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After enzyme treatment, the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was dissolved in TE buffer to a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Damage and repair of CPDs in the total genome was estimated by separation of T4 endonuclease V cleavage products on 0.6% alkaline agarose gels using published procedures (51Drouin R. Gao S. Holmquist G.P. Pfeifer G.P. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 37-43Crossref Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction was performed as described previously (52Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Pfeifer G.P. Technologies for Detection of DNA Damage and Mutations. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 199-209Crossref Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer set JC, which is specific for sequences of the human JUN gene, was used to map CPDs in the JUN promoter along sequences surrounding the transcription initiation site, and along the transcribed DNA strand (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Primer sets JS and JT were used to analyze repair rates on the transcribed and nontranscribed DNA strands, respectively, in an area approximately 250–450 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the transcription start site (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nylon membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and radioactivity was determined in all CPD-specific bands of the sequencing gel that showed a consistent and measurable signal above background. Background values (from the lanes with no UV) were subtracted. Positions were measured at least two or three times from independent experiments, and average values were calculated. The variation between individual experiments was in the range of ±20%. A repair curve was established for each CPD position that gave a sufficient signal above background. The time at which 50% of the initial damage was removed was then determined from this curve. These values were incorporated into Fig. 9.Figure 9Quantitation of DNA repair rates along the promoter and transcription initiation site. Sequence data are from Hattori et al. (65Hattori K. Angel P.

Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of UV irradiation on transcription of the JUN gene in repair-deficient fibroblasts, we UV-irradiated several repair-deficient fibroblast strains including xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A, B, C, and D, and Cockayne syndrome complementation group B and determined the mRNA levels at various time points after irradiation (Fig. 1). For all repair-deficient fibroblasts analyzed, as well as for the normal fibroblasts, the JUN mRNA levels were induced significantly between 1 and 2 h following irradiation. The degree of induction varied somewhat between the strains. Induction was approximately 2-fold for normal cells and XPA, XPB, XPD, and CSB cells but was higher for the XPC strain (5-fold). Maximum mRNA levels were generally attained after 2 h with the exception of XPB, which showed a peak level of expression at 1 h following UV irradiation. The results show that induction of the JUN gene is not abolished in repair-deficient cells, i.e. there is active transcription of the gene in all cell types after UV damage. To estimate repair of total genomic DNA in the various fibroblast strains, we digested DNA from UV-irradiated cells with T4 endonuclease V and separated the cleavage products in alkaline agarose gels. Fig. 2 shows that in normal fibroblasts and CSB cells, there is an increase in molecular weight of T4 endonuclease-digested DNA beginning 6–10 h after irradiation that is most pronounced at the 24-h time point. Repair was approximately 70% complete after 24 h, which is consistent with data on genomic repair of CPDs as determined by others (53Kantor G.J. Setlow R.B. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 819-825PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, XPA, XPB, XPC, and XPD cells showed almost no repair of total genomic DNA (<15%) after 24 h (Fig. 2). We had previously derived a map of nucleotide excision repair rates along theJUN gene in normal fibroblasts using a UV dose of 20 J/m2 (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since the NER-deficient fibroblast strains are much more sensitive to UV irradiation than normal cells, all experiments described here were carried out with a UV dose of 10 J/m2. To determine if a similar repair rate pattern is seen in normal cells at 10 and 20 J/m2 and to determine whether the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction assay is sensitive enough to be used at the lower UV dose, we mapped the repair of CPDs along the JUN promoter and transcribed sequences at 10 J/m2 (Fig. 3). The promoter of the JUN gene is covered by a number of sequence-specific transcription factors, which we had mapped previously using in vivo footprinting techniques (54Rozek D. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5490-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 55Rozek D. Pfeifer G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CPDs along the promoter region were repaired slowly with little repair evident after 10 h and some remaining signals after 24 h (Fig. 3; data summarized in Fig. 9). In accordance with the previous study (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we found that repair rates were significantly increased beginning around nt −40 upstream of the major transcription initiation site near the binding site of the transcription factor RSRF (related toserum response factor; also known as MEF2D; Ref. 56Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The fastest repair rates were seen at sequences surrounding the transcription start site, where most of the repair events took place between 1 and 2 h after irradiation. In general, the repair rate patterns were very similar between the UV doses of 10 and 20 J/m2 (this study; Ref. 15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At the lower dose, repair rates were about 1.5-fold faster, perhaps because the repair system is less saturated. We have analyzed the same sequences of the JUN gene and promoter in a series of repair-deficient fibroblast strains. The first repair-deficient cells analyzed were fibroblasts from a patient belonging to complementation group A (Fig.4). These XPA fibroblasts showed very little repair when total genomic DNA was analyzed on alkaline agarose gels after T4 endonuclease V cleavage (Fig. 2). The data for repair in the JUN gene and promoter show that repair was almost completely absent along all sequences analyzed. Even sequences near the transcription initiation site and along the transcribed strand, which were repaired very efficiently in normal fibroblasts, were repaired extremely poorly in XPA cells (Fig. 4). A fibroblast strain from an XPD patient was analyzed in Fig. 5. Similar to XPA, these cells showed a strong deficiency of repair at all sequences analyzed including the sequences near the transcription initiation site and the transcribed strand. However, a comparison between the 0- and 24-h lanes indicates that there is some residual repair activity along the transcribed strand (although less than 50% after 24 h). We next analyzed repair in fibroblasts from an individual with XPB (Fig. 6). These cells were also largely repair-defective as evident from alkaline agarose gels (Fig. 2). Very slow repair rates were seen along the promoter (nt −40 to −105). Repair rates near the transcription start site and along transcribed sequences were very slow, although some sites were partially repaired after 24 h (Figs. 6 and 9). In general, the repair patterns were quite similar for XPD (Fig. 5) and XPB (Fig. 6). XPC cells are characterized by a DNA repair defect in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome (36Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We have analyzed repair of CPDs along the promoter and transcription start site of the JUN gene in XPC cells (Fig.7). There was a lack of repair along the nontranscribed upstream promoter sequences, and fast repair rates were seen along the transcribed strand downstream of the transcription start site. It appears that repair of the transcribed strand is even more efficient in XPC (Fig. 7) than in normal cells (Fig. 3), perhaps because the gene is most efficiently transcribed in XPC cells (see Fig.1). In contrast to normal cells, where the domain of fast repair extended upstream to nt −40, fast repair was seen only up to nt −20 in XPC cells. The results suggest that the XPC protein is specifically involved in repair of promoter DNA including the sequence positions spanning nt −20 to −40 upstream of the transcription initiation site but is not required for repair of sequences near the start site. Cells from Cockayne syndrome patients are characterized by a DNA repair defect that selectively affects repair of the transcribed strand of active genes (38Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 39van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The CSB cells used in our study showed efficient repair of total genomic DNA, which approached similar levels as seen in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Fig.8 shows the repair rate pattern in CSB cells along the JUN gene. There was inefficient repair of the promoter from nt −40 to −105, and there was a diminished repair of sequences along the transcribed strand beginning approximately at nt position +20 and extending downstream. However, a clear window of remaining repair activity was seen at sequences surrounding the transcription initiation site, from nt −40 to +20 (Figs. 8 and9). To determine repair rates on the two DNA strands within the same area of the gene, we analyzed repair rates between nt +250 and +450. The sequences near the transcription start site contain only very few dipyrimidines on the nontranscribed strand that would make comparisons in this area more difficult. We first analyzed repair in normal fibroblasts and obtained faster repair rates for the transcribed strand relative to the nontranscribed strand as previously reported (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The transcribed strand was repaired about 1.5–2 times faster at 10 J/m2 compared with 20 J/m2 (data not shown); i.e. the strand difference was more pronounced at the lower levels of genomic damage, as similarly observed by others (5van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). XPC cells showed the most pronounced strand-specific repair (Fig.10). Repair of the transcribed strand was virtually completed after 4 h, similar to normal cells (Fig. 3and data not shown), while there was a complete lack of repair of the nontranscribed strand. XPB was repair-deficient on both DNA strands, although there was some remaining repair activity at some sites, in particular on the transcribed strand at the 24-h time point (Fig. 10; quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis). CSB cells showed a clear deficiency of repair in the transcribed strand (Fig. 10). Repair of the nontranscribed strand was similar to that in normal fibroblasts (Ref.15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and data not shown). Cells from patients having the DNA repair-deficient diseases xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome are characterized by specific defects in one of the proteins that function in nucleotide excision repair. Depending on the complementation group and the nature of the specific defect, the general DNA repair activity or only a specific subpathway of NER may be affected. NER in mammalian cells can be subdivided into at least two major subpathways. Based on present knowledge, this hierarchy of repair activity involves (i) the genome overall repair pathway thought to be involved in the repair of all DNA sequences including nontranscribed DNA and (ii) the transcription-coupled repair pathway that efficiently removes lesions from transcriptionally active DNA sequences and has a preference for repair of the transcribed DNA strand (57Hanawalt P.C. Donahue B.A. Sweder K.S. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 518-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 58Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2885-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our previous study (15Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), together with the data presented here, argue that the transcription-coupled repair pathway may be further subdivided into (i) a pathway that involves preferential repair of the transcribed strand and depends on RNA polymerase that is in an elongation mode and (ii) a second pathway, which is selective for sequences near the transcription initiation site. The present study on repair-deficient cells shows that the repair defect in XPA cells extends to all sequences analyzed including the nucleotide positions near the transcription start site. This finding implies that the XPA protein is indispensable for these specific repair reactions and makes less likely a model in which the TFIIH basal transcription factor (containing the XPB and XPD subunits) functions as a DNA damage recognition factor (59Naegeli H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that might operate even in the absence of XPA. The data on repair in the XPC fibroblast strain is largely consistent with the known genome overall repair deficiency in XPC, with near normal repair only of the transcribed DNA strand (36Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, there was one interesting difference between normal fibroblasts and XPC cells. Normal cells very efficiently repaired the sequences upstream of the transcription initiation site, up to nt position −40 (Fig. 3). XPC cells, however, lacked the repair of CPDs between nt −20 and −40 (Fig. 7). The reason for this difference is unknown, but the data suggest that in normal cells the XPC protein is required for the efficient repair of these positions. The biochemical function of XPC in nucleotide excision repair is currently unknown. The XPD protein also appears to be an essential component for repair of all sequence positions, since repair was almost absent in the XPD fibroblast strain investigated here (Fig. 5). We have analyzed two additional XPD fibroblast strains (GM00434 and GM00436) that were described as being only partially repair-deficient. However, also these two XPD strains showed an almost complete lack of repair at all sequence positions analyzed in the JUN gene (data not shown). Using a gene-specific DNA repair assay, Evans et al.(60Evans M.K. Robbins J.H. Ganges M.B. Tarone R.E. Nairn R.S. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4839-4847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that XPA and XPD cells lack gene-specific DNA repair in the DHFR gene, which is in accordance with our results. The data with XPB cells were similar to XPD. Both XPD and XPB were deficient in global NER and transcription-coupled repair, which is consistent with data obtained with yeast mutants defective in TFIIH subunits (61Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Sweder K.S. Chun R. Mori T. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The XPB and XPD fibroblast strains used here displayed some residual repair activity of the transcribed DNA strand. In addition, there was a clear reduction in repair rates near the transcription initiation site (Figs. 5 and 6). The results obtained with XPD and XPB cells are thus consistent with a model in which TFIIH is somehow functionally involved in the rapid repair of sequences near this site. Cells representing Cockayne syndrome (CSB) were clearly deficient in repair of the transcribed DNA strand but still efficiently repaired sequences near the transcription initiation site. This implies that the CSB gene product is not required for repair of these sites but functions specifically in repair of sequences that are encountered by RNA polymerase when it is in an elongation mode (downstream of nt +20). This is strikingly similar to the situation in E. coli, where, under conditions of in vitro transcription, stimulation of repair by transcription-repair coupling factor in the transcribed strand starts only at position +15 (63Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest that the CSB protein is the mammalian homologue of the E. coli transcription-repair coupling factor. It may be argued that the defective repair of the transcribed DNA strand in Cockayne syndrome cells is not due to a DNA repair defect but is rather a transcription defect in which a gene is not repaired because it is not transcribed (64Friedberg E.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The data presented here argue against this possibility. The expression of the JUN gene was actively induced by UV irradiation in CSB cells as indicated by an increase in mRNA levels (Fig. 1). A block of transcription initiation by UV light would instead have resulted in a decrease of mRNA levels given the relatively short half-life of JUN mRNA. The size of theJUN gene is approximately 3 kilobases, and it is likely that a significant proportion of the genes were without dimers at the UV dose employed. Thus, formally we are measuring transcription and repair in two populations of the molecules. However, there is no reason to assume that the presence of a dimer in the transcribed DNA strand would prevent transcription initiation further upstream, i.e. incis (if this were the case, transcription-coupled repair as we understand it according to current concepts would not exist, even in normal cells). In conclusion, we observed a lack of repair of the transcribed DNA strand despite ongoing transcription. From this argument it would appear that the CSB defect is not merely a transcription defect (with lack of transcription-coupled repair being only a secondary consequence of lack of transcription), but is rather a true DNA repair defect, with the CSB gene product being the transcription-repair coupling factor. The data on repair along the JUN gene in normal and repair-deficient fibroblasts can be incorporated into a hypothetical model as follows (Fig.11). Repair of the promoter from nt −105 to nt −20 requires the XPC gene product as well as functional XPA, XPB, and XPD (interestingly, repair of this promoter region was also reduced in the CSB fibroblast strain despite rather efficient overall genome repair); repair of sequences near the transcription initiation site (nt −40 to +20) depends on functional XPB, XPD, and XPA proteins but does not require XPC or CSB proteins; repair of the transcribed strand beginning from nt +20 is dependent on the CSB gene product and also requires XPA, XPD, and XPB. Repair of the nontranscribed strand requires XPA, XPD, XPB, and XPC. Further studies will show if this model can be generalized and applied also to the repair of other genes.

In this study, we asked whether signals activating JNK regulate the c-jun promoter. Using NIH 3T3 cells expressing G protein-coupled m1 acetylcholine receptors as an experimental model, we have recently shown that the cholinergic agonist carbachol, but not platelet-derived growth factor, potently elevates JNK activity. Consistent with these findings, carbachol, but not platelet-derived growth factor, increased the activity of a c-jun promoter-driven reporter gene (for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase). However, coexpression of JNK kinase kinase (MEKK) effectively increased JNK activity, but resulted in surprisingly limited induction of the c-junpromoter. This raised the possibility that pathway(s) distinct from JNK control the c-jun promoter, and prompted us to explore which of its regulatory elements participate in transcriptional control. We observed that deletion of the 3′ AP-1 site diminished chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in response to carbachol, but only to a limited extent. In contrast, deletion of a MEF2 site dramatically reduced expression, and deletion of both the MEF2 and 3′ AP-1 sites abolished induction. Furthermore, cotransfection with MEF2C and MEF2D cDNAs potently enhanced the activity of the c-jun promoter in response to carbachol, and stimulation of m1 receptors, but not direct JNK activation, induced expression of a MEF2-responsive plasmid. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that MEF2 mediates c-jun promoter expression by G protein-coupled receptors through a yet to be identified pathway, distinct from that of JNK.

The jun and fos gene families are nuclear proto-oncogenes whose expression is induced in quiescent cells by the addition of serum or other growth promoting stimuli (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 2Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The expression of these genes is rapid and does not require newly synthesized proteins, thus suggesting that their induction involves posttranslational modification of pre-existing transcription factors. For example, c-jun is stimulated in a rapid and transient fashion by a variety of growth factors (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 2Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev.

Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The protein product of the c-jun gene, c-Jun, then homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with various Jun and Fos family members to form the AP-1 transcription factor (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

In turn, AP-1 binds a palindromic DNA sequence, known as the TPA 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TRE, TPA-responsive element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MEKK, JNK kinase kinase; MEKEE, constitutively active mutant of MEK; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; MEF, myocyte enhancer family. 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TRE, TPA-responsive element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MEKK, JNK kinase kinase; MEKEE, constitutively active mutant of MEK; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; MEF, myocyte enhancer family.-responsive element or TRE, that is present within the regulatory region of a variety of genes. Interestingly, c-jun itself has been described among the genes that display TRE sequences in their promoter regions, thus suggesting that the product of the c-jun gene regulates its own expression (5Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The induction of c-junexpression appears to be critical for cell proliferation, as microinjection of neutralizing anti-c-Jun antibodies blocks cell cycle progression upon serum stimulation (6Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Molecules affecting the function of nuclear transcription factors have just begun to be identified. One such example is the family of extracellular signal-regulated kinases or MAPKs (7Graves J.D. Campbell J.S. Krebs E.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 320-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The role of MAPKs is to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of key molecules which ultimately control the expression of genes essential for many cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, programmed cell death, and neoplastic transformation (9Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that a novel family of kinases structurally related to MAPK, termed stress-activated protein kinases or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), phosphorylate in vivo Ser-63 and Ser-73 in the NH2-terminal transactivating domain of the c-Jun protein, thereby positively regulating its transcriptional activity (10Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we have genetically engineered NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts to express subtypes of the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), and have utilized these cells as a model system for the study of proliferative signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (11Crespo P. Xu N. Daniotti J.L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this biological system, the m1 class of mAChR can effectively transduce mitogenic signals and, if persistently activated, can behave as a potent agonist-dependent oncogene (12Gutkind J.S. Novotny E.A. Brann M.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that activation of m1 G protein-coupled receptors by its agonist, carbachol, induces the expression of a clearly distinct set of nuclear transcription factors when compared with those expressed in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), a mitogen acting on endogenous tyrosine kinase receptors. In particular, carbachol caused a much greater induction of c-jun mRNA expression and AP-1 activity (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed that the m1 agonist, carbachol, but not PDGF, can induce a remarkable increase in JNK activity, following a temporal pattern distinct from that of MAPK activation (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, we set out to investigate whether signals activating JNK regulate expression from the c-junpromoter, using NIH 3T3 cells expressing m1 G protein-coupled receptors (NIH-m1.2 cells) as an experimental model. In these cells, we observed that carbachol, but not PDGF, potently increased the expression from a reporter plasmid containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the murine c-jun promoter. However, this effect was not mimicked by expression of activated molecules acting downstream from m1 receptors in the JNK pathway, although they activated JNK to an extent much greater than that caused by the m1 agonist alone. This prompted us to explore the existence of JNK-independent signaling pathways regulating the expression from the c-jun promoter. Using deletion and point mutational analysis of the c-jun promoter, we found a critical role for a DNA sequence that binds the MEF2 family of transcription factors. Furthermore, cotransfection with plasmids carrying the MEF2C and MEF2D cDNAs potently enhanced expression from the c-junpromoter in response to carbachol. In addition, we found that signaling from m1 receptors, but not direct JNK activation, induced expression from a MEF2-responsive plasmid. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that signaling from G protein-coupled receptors to the c-jun promoter involves a novel, JNK-independent pathway acting on the MEF2 family of transcription factors. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing approximately 20,000 human m1 mAChRs/cell, designated NIH-m1.2 cells (11Crespo P. Xu N. Daniotti J.L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, adjusting the total amount of plasmid DNA to 5–10 μg/plate with vector alone. NIH-m1.2 cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 1 μg of pCMV-βgal, a plasmid expressing the enzyme β-galactosidase, and 1 μg of each of the reporter plasmids. After overnight incubation, the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM, and kept for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then stimulated with agonists for an additional 6 h and lysed using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). CAT activity was assayed in the cell extracts by incubation for 6–16 h in the presence of 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (100 mCi/mmol) and 200 μg/ml butyryl-CoA in 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Labeled butyrylated products were extracted using a mixture of xylenes (Aldrich) and counted as described (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity present in cellular lysates was assayed usingd-luciferin and ATP as substrates, and light emission was quantitated with the aid of a luminometer, Monolight 2010, as specified by the manufacturer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). β-Galactosidase activity present in each sample was assayed by a colorimetric method, and used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Phosphorylating activity of endogenous MAPK, JNK, and p38, or of transfected, epitope-tagged MAPK, JNK, and p38 was determined as follows. Cells were seeded at 10% confluence, and the following day cells were left untreated for endogenous activity, or transfected with pcDNA3-HA-MAPK, pcDNA3-HA-JNK, and pcDNA3-HA-p38 and additional DNAs by the LipofectAMINE technique (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 5–10 μg/plate with vector DNA (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) when necessary. Two days later, NIH-m1.2 cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight for MAPK or for 2 h for JNK and p38, respectively. Cells were then stimulated with agonists for different periods of time at 37 °C, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as described (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated on ice for 2 h with an antibody against ERK-2 (SC-154, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for endogenous MAPK, with an antibody against JNK-1 (15701A, PharMingen) for endogenous JNK, and with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co.) for the epitope-tagged MAPK, JNK, and p38. The immunoprecipitates were washed, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using 1.5 μg/μl myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate for MAPK or 1 μg of purified, bacterially expressed, GST-ATF2 protein as substrate for JNK and p38. Samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. A reporter plasmid containing the MEF2 DNA binding sequence (pGL3MEF2) was engineered by inserting the sequence 5′-TCGACGGGCTATTTTTAGGGCCG-3′ in the SalI site of the pGL3 plasmid DNA (Promega), upstream of an SV40 minimal promoter and a luciferase gene. The mutant sequence 5′-TCGACGGGCGATTTTTCGGGCCG-3′, that does not bind MEF2 proteins (13Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), was used to generate pGL3MEF2mut. pJC6, pJC8, pJC9, pJTX, pJSX, and pJSTX have been described previously (14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MEF2C and MEF2D cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Paterson (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and subcloned in the pcDNAIIIB expression vector (Invitrogen). Other cDNA expression vectors have already been described (15Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have observed that stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors of the m1 class by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, potently elevates JNK activity (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M.

Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In turn, JNK has been shown to phosphorylate the NH2-terminal transactivating domain of c-Jun, thereby stimulating AP-1-mediated transcription (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). We have also reported that, consistent with these observations, stimulation of quiescent NIH-m1.2 cells with carbachol induces AP-1 activity and greatly enhances the expression of c-jun mRNA (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As an approach to explore the relationship between the enzymatic activity of JNK and the regulation of c-jun expression, we transfected NIH-m1.2 cells with a reporter construct containing murine c-jun promoter sequences from −225 to +150 fused to the CAT gene (pJC6) (14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (see below). In agreement with our previous observations (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we show in Fig. 1 that, whereas carbachol, the tyrosine kinase-receptor ligand PDGF, and the phorbol ester TPA induced MAPK activity to similar extents, only carbachol elevated the phosphorylating activity of JNK in these cells. When reporter gene assays were performed in parallel, we observed that c-junpromoter activity was strongly enhanced by addition of carbachol, whereas treatment with PDGF and TPA did not result in demonstrable activation. Thus, these data suggest that the activity of the c-jun promoter correlated with JNK, but not MAPK activation. To further explore the roles of JNK and MAPK in the regulation of expression from the c-jun promoter, we employed a constitutively active mutant of MEK, MEKEE, which results in a remarkable increase in MAPK activity (15Coso O.A.

Accordingly, we cotransfected expression plasmids for MEKEE and MEKK together with plasmids expressing epitope-tagged MAPK and epitope-tagged JNK, or the c-jun promoter containing reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2, whereas MEKEE strongly induced MAPK activity, it had no effect on JNK or on the expression of the c-jun promoter-driven reporter plasmid. On the other hand, MEKK did not elevate MAPK activity but potently stimulated JNK-phosphorylating activity, to an extent much greater than even that elicited by m1 receptor stimulation. Surprisingly, however, activation of CAT expression in response to carbachol was severalfold higher than that induced by MEKK (Fig. 2). These observation raised the possibility that signaling pathways in addition to JNK, may participate in the activation of the c-jun promoter by m1 G protein-coupled receptors. The lack of a strict correlation between JNK activation and the expression from the c-jun promoter-containing reporter plasmid prompted us to search for those regulatory elements in the c-jun promoter that participate in the m1-induced response. In this regard, binding sites for Sp1, AP-1, CTF, and MEF2 transcription factors have been identified in the c-junpromoter at nucleotides −117, −92, −72, and −59, respectively, and two GATAA elements are found at −33 and −11 (Fig.3 A) (14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, a putative site for AP-1, referred to here as AP-1-like, is located at −180 (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of the AP-1-like and Sp1 sites, and the CAAT box in the response to m1 receptors, we used two deletion mutants, pJC8 and pJC9, containing fragments −115 to +150 and −80 to +150 of the c-jun promoter, respectively (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, carbachol addition to cells transfected with pJC8 or pJC9 caused an even higher level of CAT expression than that observed for pJC6. These data suggest that the AP-1-like and the Sp1 sites that are absent in both constructs, as well as the CAAT box that is deleted in pJC9, are dispensable for signaling from m1 receptors to the c-jun promoter. To explore the role of the AP-1 and MEF2 sites, we used a plasmid, pJTX, that harbors four point mutations in the TRE element located at −72 thereby abolishing AP-1 binding (5Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); a plasmid, pJSX, containing two point mutations, at nucleotides −51 and −58, that have been shown to abolish MEF2 binding (13Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); and a double mutant, pJSTX, that lacks both AP-1 and MEF2 binding sites (14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). As expected, in control experiments we observed that mutation of the AP-1 site, but not of the MEF2 site, nearly abolishes the expression from the reporter plasmid elicited by cotransfection of the activated JNK kinase kinase, MEKK (data not shown). However, the TRE-deficient mutant, pJTX, showed only a relatively small reduction in the response to m1 stimulation (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the MEF2-binding mutant, which contains an intact TRE site (pJSX), showed a drastic reduction in the m1-induced response (70–80%). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 B, mutation of both MEF2 and TRE sites in the c-jun promoter (pJSTX) nearly abolished the expression of CAT elicited by carbachol in m1-expressing cells. These results suggest that both the MEF2 and AP-1 regulatory sites are critical for the regulation of expression from the c-jun promoter in response to intracellular signals transmitted by G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, these data suggest that, in these cells, the majority of the stimulatory response on the c-junpromoter-containing reporter plasmid is exerted through the MEF2 binding site and not through the TRE, as we had initially hypothesized. MEF2 proteins bind the consensus sequence motif CTA(A/T)4TAG (13Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is present in the c-jun promoter between positions −50 and −59. As an attempt to further investigate if that sequence participates in the transcriptional response triggered by stimulation of m1 receptors, we engineered a reporter construct by introducing oligonucleotides that match exactly the sequence CTATTTTTAG found in the c-junpromoter, upstream of a minimal promoter in the pGL3promoter plasmid (Promega). The resulting construct expresses a luciferase reporter gene and was designated pGL3MEF2. As a control, we generated a similar reporter plasmid containing the mutant sequence CGATTTTTCG, which does not bind MEF2 (13Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and therefore is not able to respond to MEF2 (pGL3MEF2mut). Fig.4 shows that upon transfection in NIH-m1.2 cells with pGL3MEF2, carbachol induced a remarkable increase in the luciferase activity when compared with the unstimulated control cells. Furthermore, coexpression of MEF2C (Fig. 4) or MEF2D (data not shown) also elevated the reporter gene activity. However, no demonstrable response was observed upon transfection with MEKK, thus suggesting that the MEF2 binding site is insensitive to the activation of the JNK pathway. On the other hand, cells transfected with the construct pGL3MEF2mut exhibited the same level of luciferase activity in each of these conditions, supporting that an intact MEF2 binding site is required to elicit a transcriptional response. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the MEF2 binding site could be the target for signaling pathways linking G protein-coupled receptors to the c-jun promoter. To address directly whether proteins of the MEF2 family could regulate the activity of the c-jun promoter, we next cotransfected pJC6 with expression plasmids harboring the cDNAs for MEF2C or c-Jun in NIH-m1.2 cells. As shown in Fig.5, CAT expression driven by the c-jun promoter was elevated by cotransfection with the c-Jun and MEF2C expression plasmids. A similar result was obtained by overexpressing MEF2D (data not shown). When cells were stimulated with carbachol, we observed that coexpression of c-Jun potentiated the response by only 30–40%, while both MEF2C (Fig. 5) and MEF2D (data not shown) nearly tripled CAT activity in response to the cholinergic agonist. Taken together, these findings support a critical role for MEF2 proteins in signaling from G protein-coupled receptors to the c-jun promoter. A recent study (29Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch J. Nature. 1991; 386: 296-299Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar) showed that one of the members of the MEF2 family (MEF2C) is phosphorylated by a novel member of the MAPK superfamily, p38, in myeloid lineage cells. Therefore we explored whether p38, by regulating the activity of MEF2, might mediate in the induction of the c-jun promoter by G protein-coupled receptors. To that end, we transfected NIH-m1.2 cells with pJC6 and measured CAT activity upon carbachol stimulation in the presence or absence of the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (30Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, incubation with SB203580 nearly abolished p38 activation by anisomycin or carbachol but did not have any demonstrable effect on transcriptional activation by the c-jun promoter. Similar results were obtained using pJTX, the mutant of the c-jun promoter lacking the AP-1 site but containing a MEF2-responsive element (Fig. 6). These results suggest that p38 does not regulate MEF2 activation of the c-junpromoter in NIH-m1.2 cells. Positive autoregulation has been considered the major regulatory event in the response of the c-jun promoter to proliferative stimuli. Two steps have been described as participating in that process: 1) post-translational modification of preexisting c-Jun proteins and 2) transcriptional activation of c-jun that leads to an increase in the pool of c-Jun protein present in the cell (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar, 5Angel P.

Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). c-Jun is a constitutive part of the AP-1 transcription factor, and binding of such a factor to the TRE element in the c-jun promoter has been shown to result in the stimulation of transcription (5Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Using NIH-3T3 cells expressing m1 G protein-coupled receptors, we had previously observed that addition of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, results in a remarkable increase in JNK activity and in the level of c-jun expression. Thus, we expected a major participation of the JNK pathway on the regulation of c-jun promoter activity. Indeed, we observed a positive correlation between the c-jun promoter activity and JNK, but not with MAPK. Surprisingly, direct activation of the JNK pathway by overexpression of MEKK resulted in activation of the c-junpromoter but to a much more limited extent than that induced upon m1 stimulation. This observation prompted us to ask whether other biochemical routes, in addition to the JNK pathway, participate in the transduction of signals from G protein-coupled receptors to the promoter of c-jun. Mapping of the regulatory elements in the c-jun promoter has yielded the existence of several consensus binding sites for different transcription factors such as Sp1, CTF, AP-1, and MEF2 (5Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using a series of c-jun promoter mutants fused to a reporter gene, we observe that deletion of the binding sites for Sp1 or CTF did not affect reporter gene activity. Furthermore, we found that mutations that abolish AP-1 binding prevent expression from the reporter plasmid when induced by MEKK, but display only a partial reduction in the response to carbachol. In contrast, a more dramatic decrease was observed when mutations that inhibit binding of MEF2 factors were introduced, thus suggesting a role for the MEF2 factors in regulating c-jun promoter activity, perhaps even more critical than that played by AP-1 itself. Furthermore, the fact that the double mutant that does not bind AP-1 or MEF2 fails to respond to carbachol, indicates that, for signals initiated at the level of m1 G protein-coupled receptors, the AP-1 and MEF2 sites are sufficient to account for the transcriptional response of the c-junpromoter. While extensive studies have established the role of AP-1 complexes in transcriptional control, very limited information is available about the functions of MEF2 proteins. The myocyte enhancer family (MEF) of transcription factors comprises a group of transcriptional activators MEF2A, -B, -C, and -D (22Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Leifer D. Krainc D. Yu Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal-Ginard B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl.

MEF2 binding sites have been found in the promoters and enhancers of many skeletal and cardiac muscle structural genes (26Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Structurally, MEF2 proteins contain a common motif that was named the MEF2 domain, this feature being unique to all MEF2 family members described so far (26Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of MEF2 factors in the regulation of muscle gene expression, very little is known about the mechanism by which these proteins promote transcription or the signal transduction pathways controlling their activity. Recently, MEF2C, but not the other members of the family, has been shown to be a substrate for the MAPK-related p38 (29Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch J. Nature. 1991; 386: 296-299Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar). While the expression of MEF2A, -B, and -D proteins is ubiquitous, the expression of MEF2C seems to be restricted to cortical neurons, monomyelocytic and muscle cells (23Leifer D. Krainc D. Yu Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal-Ginard B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Breitbart R.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This wide distribution suggests that their function is not limited to the regulation of muscle specific gene expression (27Dodou E. Sparrow D.B. Mohun T. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, they share with other transcription factors, such as serum response factor, the presence of a common structural domain termed MADS box, and due to that characteristic they were originally named RSRFs (related to serum response factors) (13Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for a critical role for MEF2 in the regulation of c-jun promoter activity by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, we show that overexpression of the MEF2 protein potentiates carbachol-induced expression of the c-jun promoter, strengthening the concept of MEF2 proteins as the targets of a yet uncharacterized signal transduction pathway. We also report here that an isolated MEF2 binding site stimulates transcription of a reporter gene when m1-expressing cells are stimulated by carbachol, but not by cotransfection with the JNK-inducing construct MEKK. Taken together, our data support the existence of two distinct signaling pathways that initiating on the same receptor at the level of the plasma membrane converge on the c-jun promoter: a JNK-dependent pathway, acting on the AP-1 responsive element; and a JNK-independent pathway, acting on the MEF2 regulatory sequence. In this regard, a recent report showed that the transactivating activity of MEF2C can be regulated by p38 (29Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch J. Nature. 1991; 386: 296-299Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, we observed that SB205380, a potent p38 and p38β blocker, fails to inhibit c-jun promoter activity, thus ruling out these p38 proteins as mediators of the carbachol-induced signal to MEF2. Nevertheless, NIH 3T3 cells express MEF2A, -B, and -D but not MEF2C (23Leifer D. Krainc D. Yu Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal-Ginard B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Breitbart R.E. Liang C.S. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Development. 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dodou E. Sparrow D.B. Mohun T. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and it has been recently shown that p38γ and p38δ are not inhibited by SB205380 (31Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that these or other members of the MAPK superfamily might mediate MEF2 activity in these cells. The identity of such regulatory molecule acting on other members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors is under current investigation. Our results assign a critical role for MEF2 in the regulation of c-jun expression by the G protein-linked class of cell surface receptors. Interestingly, Han et al. provided evidence that the MEF2 binding site in the c-jun promoter also participates in the activation of c-jun by epidermal growth factor receptors and serum in HeLa cells (14Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of the molecular entities that participate in the transduction of signals from the membrane to MEF2 proteins, as well as of the mechanisms whereby those signaling molecules control the transcriptional activity of MEF2, is expected to be central for understanding the regulation of c-jun expression by growth promoting factors. Furthermore, considering the ubiquitous expression of MEF2 proteins and their resemblance to other transcription factors such as serum response factor, we can envision a growing interest for dissecting the signaling pathways that converge on MEF2."
https://openalex.org/W2042000895,"The effect of the Arg506 → Gln mutation in factor VLEIDEN on thrombin generation was evaluated in a reconstituted system using the purified components of the tissue factor (TF) pathway to thrombin and the components of the protein C pathway. Recombinant full-length tissue factor pathway inhibitor (RTFPI) was included in the system because of a previously observed synergistic inhibitory effect of TFPI and the protein C pathway on TF-initiated thrombin generation. Thrombin generation initiated by 1.25 pm factor VIIa·TF in the absence of the protein C pathway components occurs following an initiation phase, after which prothrombin is quantitatively converted to 1.4 μm thrombin. The factor VLEIDEN mutation did not influence thrombin generation in the reconstituted model in the absence of the protein C pathway. In the presence of 2.5 nmTFPI, 65 nm protein C, and 10 nm recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Tm), thrombin generation catalyzed by normal factor V was abolished after the initial formation of 25 nmthrombin. In contrast, persistent thrombin generation was observed in the presence of factor VLEIDEN in the same system, although the rate of thrombin generation was slower compared with the reaction without protein C and Tm. The rate of thrombin generation with factor VLEIDEN increased with time and ultimately resulted in quantitative prothrombin activation. When the TFPI concentration was reduced to 1.25 nm, thrombin generation is still curtailed in the presence of normal factor V. In contrast, under similar conditions using factor VLEIDEN, the protein C pathway totally failed to down-regulate thrombin generation. The dramatic effect of a 50% reduction in TFPI concentration on the inhibitory potential of the protein C pathway on thrombin generation catalyzed by factor VLEIDEN suggests that the observed synergy between TFPI and the protein C pathway is directly governed by the TFPI concentration and by cleavage of the factor Va heavy chain at Arg506. This cleavage appears to have a dramatic regulatory effect in the presence of low concentrations of TFPI. Markedly increased thrombin generation in the presence of both 1.25 nm TFPI and factor VLEIDEN was also observed when antithrombin-III was added to the system to complete the natural set of coagulation inhibitors. Protein S (300 nm) had a minimal effect in the model on the inhibition of thrombin generation by protein C, Tm, and TFPI, with either normal factor V or factor VLEIDEN. Protein S also failed to significantly potentiate the action of the protein C pathway in the presence of antithrombin-III in reactions employing normal factor V or factor VLEIDEN. The absence of an effect of protein S in the model, which employs saturating concentrations of phospholipid, suggests that the reported interactions of protein S with coagulation factors are not decisive in the reaction. Altogether the data predict that TFPI levels in the lower range of normal values are a risk factor for thrombosis when combined with the Arg506 → Gln mutation in factor VLEIDEN.

Altogether the data predict that TFPI levels in the lower range of normal values are a risk factor for thrombosis when combined with the Arg506 → Gln mutation in factor VLEIDEN. The procoagulant reactions leading to the generation of thrombin during the blood clotting process are governed by three vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes, each of which is composed of a serine protease and a cofactor protein assembled on a membrane surface (1Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Hemostasis Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-227PubMed Google Scholar). The serine protease (factor VIIa, factor IXa, or factor Xa) in each case is derived from a plasma zymogen, while cofactors are regulated either by presentation (tissue factor) or proteolytic activation (factor Va or factor VIIIa). The procoagulant process is thought to be initiated when the small amounts of circulating two-chain factor VIIa bind to the tissue factor (TF) 1The abbreviations used are: TF, tissue factor; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; AT-III, antithrombin-III; APC, activated protein C; Tm, thrombomodulin. (2Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) presented as a consequence of vascular disruption or an inflammatory process. The reaction initiated by the formation of this complex activates the serine protease components of both the intrinsic tenase (factor IXa·factor VIIIa) and prothrombinase (factor Xa·factor Va). The latter complex converts prothrombin to thrombin (for a review on blood coagulation, see Ref. 3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The formation of thrombin is tightly regulated by a system of the stoichiometric inhibitors tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (4Broze Jr., G.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and antithrombin-III (AT-III) (5Blajchman M.N. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and by the activated protein C (APC) pathway through which thrombin serves as its own down-regulator by complexing with constitutively expressed vascular thrombomodulin (Tm) (7Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The resulting complex activates the plasma zymogen protein C to APC. APC down-regulates coagulation by proteolytic inactivation of the cofactor factor Va. We have shown in earlier studies that the combination of the stoichiometric inhibitors TFPI, which regulates the factor VIIa·TF complex, and AT-III, an inhibitor of all the procoagulant serine proteases, and the protein C pathway behave synergistically in their attenuation of thrombin generation (8van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7983-7994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that the system produces threshold-limited bursts of thrombin when the procoagulant reactions proceed in the presence of the combined regulatory systems. The cooperative interactions between procoagulant and anticoagulant systems regulate thrombin generation such that it is limited by the extent of presentation of tissue factor and concentrations of pro- and anticoagulants. Congenital and acquired alterations of either the procoagulant or anticoagulant pathways are associated with hemorrhagic disease or thrombosis. A factor V genetic mutation (factor VLEIDEN) has recently been described that is present in approximately 5% of the Caucasian population and appears to be responsible for 20% of familial venous thrombosis (10Dahlbäck B.

The G → A mutation at nucleotide 1691 leads to the substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 506 in the factor VLEIDEN molecule. The principle regulatory influence of the protein C pathway is associated with the inactivation of factor Va (9van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The normal proteolytic inactivation process involves cleavages of the factor Va molecule at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679 in the heavy chain (13Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 506 slows the inactivation process and therefore extends the kinetic lifetime of the expression of prothrombinase complex activity (14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The synergistic relationships between the stoichiometric inhibitors and the protein C system in the regulation of thrombin generation is a largely kinetic phenomenon (8van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J.

We have therefore studied the influence of the slowed inactivation rate of factor VLEIDEN on the expression of thrombin in a reconstituted system of procoagulant and anticoagulation reactions representative of the blood clotting process.

Hirudin was provided as a gift by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Thrombin generation initiated by factor VIIa·TF in a reconstituted model using normal plasma protein concentrations was studied as described previously (19Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TF was relipidated into 400 μm 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine vesicles, for 30 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (Hepes/Ca2+). The relipidated TF was incubated with factor VIIa for 20 min at 37 °C to allow factor VIIa·TF complex formation. Factor V and factor VIII were added in microliter amounts of concentrated stock solutions to the equilibrated factor VIIa·TF mixture (total volume of the addition not exceeding 0.25% of the final reaction volume), and immediately thereafter the reaction was started by the addition of a solution containing factor X, factor IX, and prothrombin, which was prepared in Hepes/Ca2+. The zymogen solution was preheated at 37 °C for 3 min before the addition to the factor VIIa·TF, factor V, and factor VIII mixture. When protein C, TFPI, AT-III, or protein S was included it was added to the factor X, factor IX, and prothrombin mixture. Thrombomodulin was added to the factor VIIa·TF mixture. The final concentrations of the proteins in the reaction, chosen to represent mean plasma values, are 160 nm factor X, 90 nm factor IX, 0.7 nm factor VIII, 20 nm factor V, and 1.4 μm prothrombin (19Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When added, protein C (65 nm), TFPI (2.5 nm), protein S (300 nm), and AT-III (3.4 μm) (20Ikeda K. Stenflo J. Thromb.

Hematol. 1991; 28: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar) were also present at their respective plasma concentrations in the reaction unless indicated otherwise. The final phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine concentration in the reactions was 200 μm. Following initiation of the reaction, aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and quenched in either 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to assay for thrombin formation or in 2% SDS, 0.062 m Tris, 10% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol Blue, pH 6.8, for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Assays for thrombin activity were performed using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme TH. The hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Vmax spectrophotometer. Thrombin measurements in samples withdrawn from experiments that included AT-III were performed by rapid quenching of samples in a solution containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.4 mm Spectrozyme TH, and thrombin generation was measured immediately as described (8van ‘t Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4367-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thrombin generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared with serial dilutions of purified human α-thrombin. APC generation was measured using substrate S2366 in samples that were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and diluted 5-fold into excess hirudin (7 μm), tick anticoagulant peptide (2.31 μm), and 20 mmEDTA/Tris-buffered saline. APC generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified human APC. Some residual amidolytic activity was observed in the thrombin activity assay in the presence of hirudin in samples taken from reactions with Tm and protein C. This residual amidolytic activity, caused by generated APC, did not significantly affect the higher thrombin levels measured in the reactions and never exceeded 20% of the total amidolytic activity at the lowest thrombin levels measured. The SDS-quenched samples were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels essentially as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis using the techniques described by Towbin et al. (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 350-4354Crossref Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.05% Tween, Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 1.5 h with monoclonal antibody αHFV-6. This antibody recognizes an epitope on the heavy chain of factor V between residues 307 and 506 (14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This fragment is a final product of factor Va cleavage by APC. The products of factor V recognized by this antibody were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG and the Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent obtained from DuPont. The membranes were stripped with 0.5m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, to remove bound antibodies. The stripped membranes were blocked again with 5% nonfat milk and probed for prothrombin activation products using a polyclonal burro anti-prethrombin-1 antibody as described (19Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the factor VLEIDEN mutation was studied in reactions that were initiated with 1.25 pm factor VIIa·TF in the presence of 2.5 nm TFPI. TFPI was included in the reaction mixtures to provide the physiological kinetically transient factor VIIa·TF activity and because of a synergistic effect of TFPI and the protein C pathway observed in this model (9van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7983-7994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thrombin generation with normal factor V or factor VLEIDEN in the absence of the protein C pathway occurred following an initial lag phase of 2.5 min, after which prothrombin was converted into thrombin at 180 nm·min−1 during the propagation phase. The profile was essentially the same for normal factor V and factor VLEIDEN (Fig. 1, filled symbols). In the presence of protein C and 10 nm Tm with normal factor V (Fig. 1, open circles), thrombin generation occurred at a reduced rate after a lag time of 2.5 min. At 5 min, thrombin generation ceased after ∼25 nm thrombin was produced. Thus, at the factor VIIa·TF concentration used (1.25 pm) the protein C pathway eliminated the propagation phase of the reaction after a limited amount of thrombin was formed (9van ‘t Veer C. Golden N.J. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7983-7994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the case of factor VLEIDEN (Fig. 1, open squares) the same lag time (2.5 min) was observed; however, subsequent thrombin generation, while slowed, continued at a rate of ∼26 nm·min−1. After 10 min, the rate of thrombin generation increased, ultimately rising at 12 min to the rate observed in the absence of protein C/Tm. Prothrombin was quantitatively converted to thrombin (1.4 μm) in the presence of factor VLEIDEN after 20 min. The rate of APC generation (∼3 nm·min−1) was the same in reactions containing either normal factor V or factor VaLEIDEN (data not shown). Thrombin generation with normal factor V in the presence of protein C, 10 nm Tm and 300 nm protein S (Fig.1, open triangles) results in a nearly identical rate of thrombin generation as observed in the absence of protein S (Fig. 1,open circles). Thus, under the conditions used, protein S does not strongly potentiate the inhibitory effect of the protein C pathway. Protein S (300 nm) had only minimal influence on the initial rate of thrombin generation by factor VLEIDEN(Fig. 1, diamonds) in the presence of the components of the protein C pathway. The rate of secondary thrombin generation in the presence of factor VLEIDEN and the protein C pathway is decreased slightly by protein S (by approximately 30%) but still results in the quantitative activation of prothrombin. The lack of a major effect of protein S on thrombin generation under these conditions in the presence of factor VaLEIDEN and the protein C pathway does not support a decisive role for protein S in accelerating the APC-dependent cleavage at Arg306 and subsequent inactivation of factor VaLEIDEN as reported by Rosing et al. (26Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwartz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol.

Analyses of the proteolytic activation and inactivation of normal factor V and factor VLEIDEN by immunoblotting using an antibody reacting with an epitope on the heavy chain within residues 307–506 (αHFV-6) (14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that both cofactors were cleaved during the initial phase (0–1.5 min) of thrombin generation to generate the heavy chain (Fig.2). Densitometric data of the factor Va heavy chain bands of the immunoblots is shown in Fig.3. No factor V intermediate is observed at M r = 280,000, indicating that there is no significant direct inactivation of intact factor V by cleavage of the procofactor at Arg306 (14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 nm thrombomodulin and protein C (Fig. 2 A), inactivation of normal factor Va occurs during the initiation phase of the reaction (1.5 min) due to initial cleavage at Arg506. A subsequent cleavage at Arg306 gives rise to aM r 30,000 product (14Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). After 5 min, most of the heavy chain is degraded by APC, yielding theM r 30,000 fragment, consistent with the elimination of prothrombinase activity at 5 min (Fig. 1, open circles).Figure 2Proteolysis of factor V and factor VLEIDEN in the presence of the protein C pathway during TF-initiated thrombin generation.

https://openalex.org/W2113178702,"The imprinted U2af1-rs1 gene on mouse chromosome 11 is expressed exclusively from the paternal allele. We found that U2af1-rs1 resides in a chromosomal domain that displays marked differences in chromatin conformation and DNA methylation between the parental chromosomes. Chromatin conformation was assayed in brain and liver, in fetuses, and in embryonic stem cells by sensitivity to nucleases in nuclei. In all these tissues, the unmethylated paternal chromosome is sensitive to DNase-I andMspI and has two DNase-I hypersensitive sites in the 5′-untranslated region. In brain and in differentiated stem cells, which display high levels of U2af1-rs1 expression, a paternal DNase-I hypersensitive site is also readily apparent in the promoter region. On the maternal chromosome, in contrast, the entireU2af1-rs1 gene and its promoter are highly resistant to DNase-I and MspI in all tissues analyzed and are fully methylated. No differential MNase sensitivity was detected in this imprinted domain. The parental chromosome-specific DNA methylation and chromatin conformation were also present in parthenogenetic and androgenetic cells and in tissues from animals maternally or paternally disomic for chromosome 11. This demonstrates that these parental chromosome-specific epigenotypes are independently established and maintained and provides no evidence for interallelictrans-sensing and counting mechanisms inU2af1-rs1.

Parental imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism in mammals that gives rise to differential expression of the maternally and paternally inherited alleles of certain genes. The identification of the epigenetic modifications (imprints) responsible for parental allele-specific expression has gained considerable impetus since the discovery of the first imprinted genes, and it is generally assumed that primary modifications are established in the germline or prior to syngamy after fertilization (1Efstratiadis A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2John R.S. Surani M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 348-353Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CpG methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA that has been found to correlate with the allelic expression of imprinted genes (3Reik W. Feil R. Allen N.D. Moore T.F. Walter J. Genomic Imprinting: Causes and Consequences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995: 157-169Google Scholar). In several imprinted genes, such asH19, SNRPN, and U2af1-rs1 (4Bartolomei M.S. Weber A.

Genet. 1994; 8: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), DNA sequences involved in expression are methylated specifically on the repressed allele, which suggests that allelic methylation represses transcription. In contrast, there are other imprinted genes in which small intragenic regions are methylated exclusively on the expressed allele. These include Igf2 (9Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Igf2r (10Stöger R. Kubicka P. Liu C.-G. Kafri T. Razin A. Cedar H. Barlow D.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and methylation in these genes may be involved in activation of transcription. Imprinting studies in DNA methyltransferase-deficient mice have shown that DNA methylation is clearly required for at least the somatic maintenance of monoallelic expression (11Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 12Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausman J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H.L. Jaenisch R. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the imprinted genes analyzed so far, with the possible exception of a region upstream of H19 (13Tremblay K.D.

They would therefore not necessarily constitute primary imprints and may reflect other, pre-existing epigenetic features of chromatin.

Earlier studies had established asynchrony of replication of genes on the differentially compacted, active, and inactive X chromosome in female mammals (19Taylor J.H. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1960; 7: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The asynchronous replication of imprinted and X-linked genes suggests that differential chromatin compaction may be another characteristic of mono-allelically expressed genes. For the imprinted Igf2/H19 domain on mouse distal chromosome 7, this has been studied more directly by our laboratory and by others in assays that analyze allelic sensitivity to nucleases in nuclei. No parental chromosome-specific chromatin conformation was thus detected in the Igf2 gene, including its promoters (20Sasaki H. Jones P.A. Chaillet J.R. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Barton S.C. Reik W. Surani M.A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1843-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Feil R. Handel M.A. Allen N.D. Reik W. Dev.

Both regions were equally sensitive to DNase-I on the maternal and the paternal chromosome, and the same was found for the 90-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); Ag, androgenetic; ES, embryonic stem; HSS, hypersensitive site(s); MNase, micrococcal nuclease; Matdi-11, maternal disomy 11; Patdi-11, paternal disomy 11; Pg, parthenogenetic; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; UTR, untranslated region(s). region between the two genes (22Koide T. Ainscough J. Wijgerde M. Surani M.A. Genomics. 1994; 24: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the H19 promoter was found to be more sensitive to nucleases on the expressed maternal than on the repressed paternal chromosome (4Bartolomei M.S. Weber A. Brunkow M.A. Tilghman S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This finding suggests chromosome-specific chromatin compaction in the regulatory sequences of H19, which could be associated with the allelic expression of this imprinted gene. To gain more insight into the role of chromatin in the regulation of imprinting, we analyzed allelic chromatin conformation in the imprinted mouse U2af1-rs1 gene. U2af1-rs1 (named SP2 (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) orU2afbp-rs (7Hayashizaki Y. Shibata H. Hirotsune S. Sugino H. Okazaki Y. Sasaki N. Hirose K.

It codes for a protein with homology to the splicing factor U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Hayashizaki Y. Shibata H. Hirotsune S. Sugino H. Okazaki Y. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Imoto H. Okuizumi H. Muramatsu M.

It is the only imprinted gene identified on mouse proximal chromosome 11, the paternal disomy of which gives fetal overgrowth, whereas maternal disomy leads to fetal growth retardation (23Cattanach B.M. Kirk M. Nature. 1985; 315: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that specific CpG dinucleotides in the promoter and in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of U2af1-rs1 are methylated on the repressed maternal allele (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Hayashizaki Y. Shibata H. Hirotsune S. Sugino H. Okazaki Y. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Imoto H. Okuizumi H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study we show that, in fact, a larger domain comprising the entire U2af1-rs1 gene becomes completely methylated on the maternal chromosomes during early development but remains unmethylated on paternal chromosomes. Most interestingly and in contrast to the previous studies on the imprintedIgf2 and H19 genes, the parental chromosomes also showed a pronounced difference in generalized sensitivity to nucleases in the entire U2af1-rs1 domain of differential methylation. We also characterized paternal DNase-I hypersensitive sites (HSS) in the 5′-UTR and the promoter of the gene. These sites have been independently identified by Shibata and collegues (25Shibata H. Yoshino K. Sunahara S. Gondo Y. Katsuki M. Ueda T. Kamiya M. Muramatsu M. Marakami Y. Kalcheva I. Plass C. Chapman V.M. Hayashizaki Y. Genomics. 1996; 35: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) but only in a single tissue. Our study, however, specifically addresses the nature and the developmental regulation of differential chromatin conformation in the U2af1-rs1 domain. It shows that the parental chromosome-specific chromatin conformation and the maternal DNA methylation in the U2af1-rs1 domain are intricately linked and become established before implantation. It has been proposed that intergenomic and trans-allelic interactions play a role in the mechanism of genomic imprinting (16Shemer R. Birger Y. Dean W. Reik W. Riggs A. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6018-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the U2af1-rs1 gene, which is paternally expressed from the two-cell stage on (24Hatada I. Kitagawa K. Yamaoka T. Wang X. Arai Y. Hashido H. Ohishi S. Masuda J. Ogata J. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Latham K.E. Rambhatla L. Hayashizaki Y. Chapman V.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 670-676Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it has been found that androgenetic preimplantation embryos expressed about twice as much mRNA as normal embryos, whereas mRNA expression was much lower in gynogenetic preimplantation embryos (31Latham K.E. Rambhatla L. Hayashizaki Y. Chapman V.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 670-676Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further address a possible involvement of trans-sensing in the imprinting ofU2af1-rs1, we analyzed parthenogenetic (Pg) and androgenetic (Ag) embryonic stem (ES) cells and tissues from animals uniparentally disomic for mouse proximal chromosome 11, which all showed the appropriate parental chromosome-specific DNA methylation and chromatin conformational patterns. These findings suggest that the maternal and paternal imprints in U2af1-rs1 are independently established and maintained and provide no evidence for trans-sensing in this imprinted gene. Hybrid F1 mice were produced by crossing C57BL/6 females to Mus spretus males, and the reciprocal F2 mice were produced by backcrossing F1 females to C57BL/6 males. Mice maternally (Matdi-11) or paternally (Patdi-11) disomic for proximal chromosome 11 were produced by intercrossing mice heterozygous for the Robertsonian translocation, Rb(11.13)4Bnr (23Cattanach B.M. Kirk M. Nature. 1985; 315: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Pg embryos and Pg and Ag ES cells were derived as described before (32Allen N.D. Barton S.C. Hilton K. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1473-1482PubMed Google Scholar). Biparental, hybrid ES cells were derived as follows: mature (C57BL/6 × CBA/CA)F1 eggs were in vitro fertilized with M. spretus sperm, embryos were cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage, and ES cell lines were derived subsequently as described before (32Allen N.D. Barton S.C. Hilton K. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1473-1482PubMed Google Scholar). ES cell lines were maintained on feeder cells, but for the chromatin and methylation assays, culture was performed in the absence of feeder cells, and only semiconfluent early passage (<passage 6) cells were used, which showed <10% of morphologically apparent differentiation. For in vitro differentiation, Ag and normal ES cells were seeded at low density on tissue-culture dishes and grown in ES medium without LIF. After 5 days, semi-confluently growing differentiated cells (>90%) were obtained that appeared mostly parietal endoderm in morphology (32Allen N.D. Barton S.C. Hilton K. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1473-1482PubMed Google Scholar). Phage λmU2D1 was isolated from a genomic library of 129/Sv DNA (33Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Luckow B. Schutz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) using aNotI-EcoRV fragment from the plasmid pSP2 (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mapping of endonuclease restriction sites in this 15-kb phage (see Fig.1) was performed by partial digestion and labeling with left arm- and right arm-specific oligonucleotide probes. Nuclei were isolated from tissues and ES cells as described previously (21Feil R. Handel M.A. Allen N.D. Reik W. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNase-I assays were described before (21Feil R. Handel M.A. Allen N.D. Reik W. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the unit definition was as defined by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestions were performed on purified nuclei for 5 min at 37 °C in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.34m sucrose, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mm CaCl2. MspI digestions on nuclei were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation with DNase-I, MNase, orMspI, the 200-μl reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS. Proteinase-K was added to 200 μg/ml, and proteinase-K digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C, after which genomic DNA was extracted. Genomic DNA extraction, endonuclease digestion, electrophoresis, and Southern blotting were performed as described before (9Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C57BL/6 and M. spretus DNAs were analyzed for RFLPs between the two mouse species using the restriction endonucleasesApaI, BamHI, BglII, BsaI,DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV,HindIII, KpnI, PstI, PvuII,MspI, RsaI, SacI, StuI,XbaI, and XhoI. Densitometric measurements on x-ray films were performed with a Bio-Rad GelDoc-1000 apparatus. The allele-specific expression analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification on hybrid ES cell RNAs was performed as described by Hatada et al. (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and M. spretus had the same polymorphic RsaI restriction site as described previously for Mus musculus molossinus (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNAs was performed as described previously (32Allen N.D. Barton S.C. Hilton K. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1473-1482PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed sensitivity to DNase-I in theU2af1-rs1 gene in adult liver and brain and in day 15 fetuses. Interspecific F1 hybrids between M. m. domesticusfemales and M. spretus males ([C57BL/6 × M. spretus] F1) and the reciprocal hybrids ([C57BL/6 ×M. spretus] × C57BL/6) F2) were studied. To distinguish between the parental chromosomes in these interspecific hybrids, we used RFLPs between the two mouse species. Fig.1 shows the chromosomal region analyzed and indicates the RFLPs and the genomic DNA probes used in this study. Using the BglII RFLP, which has polymorphic fragments that cover the entire gene, we found that in liver (Fig.2 A), brain (Fig.2 B), and day 15 fetuses (not shown), the paternal chromosome was more sensitive to DNase-I than the maternal chromosome. Hence, in (M. m. domesticus × M. spretus) F1 hybrid nuclei, the 4.3-kb paternal M. spretus restriction fragment was sensitive to DNase-I, whereas the 5.6-kb maternal M. m. domesticus restriction fragment was highly resistant to DNase-I. In addition, in liver, brain, and fetuses, two paternal chromosome-specific DNase-I HSS were detected in the 5′-UTR. These closely linked HSS mapped directly downstream of the previously described, maternally methylated, NotI restriction site (Refs. 6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 7Hayashizaki Y. Shibata H. Hirotsune S. Sugino H. Okazaki Y. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Imoto H. Okuizumi H. Muramatsu M. Komatsubara H. Shiroishi T. Moriwaki K. Katsuki M. Hatano N. Sasaki H. Ueda T. Mise N. Takagi N. Plass C. Chapman V.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 A). Both for liver (Fig.2 A) and brain (not shown), we studied reciprocal (C57BL/6 × M. spretus) × C57BL/6) F2 hybrid nuclei as well. Again, it was the paternal chromosome that displayed preferential DNase-I sensitivity in these F2 hybrids (Fig. 2 A), with theM. m. domesticus chromosome now being the more readily digested one. This indicates that the observed preferential paternal DNase-I sensitivity in the interspecific hybrids did not result from DNA sequence polymorphisms between M. m. domesticus andM. spretus. In brain, where in contrast to other tissues U2af1-rs1expression is very high (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we detected an additional strong HSS in the promoter region (Figs. 1 A and 2 B). In a maternal chromosome-specific DNase-I assay we demonstrated that this promoter HSS was also present only on the paternal chromosomes. Hence, F1 hybrid brain nuclei were incubated with increasing concentrations of DNase-I, and genomic DNA was extracted and then digested with bothBglII and with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII. Because HpaII leaves intact the maternal allele, which is methylated in this domain (Fig.3), and completely digests the unmethylated paternal allele, DNase-I sensitivity was thus assayed specifically on the maternal chromosomes, which did not show any HSS sites in the U2af1-rs1 domain (Fig. 2 B). The paternal chromosome-specific promoter HSS was not as pronounced in liver (Fig. 2 A) or embryonic stem cells (see Fig.5 A), where U2af1-rs1 expression levels are lower than in brain (6Hatada I. Sugama T. Mukai T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5577-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, in (C57BL/6 × M. spretus) F1 day 15 fetuses we detected paternal hypersensitivity in the promoter region, albeit not as strong as in adult brain, possibly due to the proportional contribution of brain (or other high expressing tissues) in these fetuses (not shown).Figure 2Parental chromosome-specific nuclease sensitivity in the U2af1-rs1 gene. A, paternal DNase-I sensitivity and hypersensitive sites in the 5′-UTR. ABglII RFLP was used to analyze adult liver nuclei, isolated from (C57BL/6 × M. spretus) F1 and ((C57BL/6 ×M. spretus) × C57BL/6) F2 mice. After incubation at increasing concentrations of DNase-I (lanes 1–7 were at 0, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 units/ml, respectively), DNA was extracted from the nuclei, digested with BglII, electrophoresed, and probed with fragment 1. To the left, the BglII fragments in C57BL/6 (M) and M. spretus (S) adult livers, and the 1.8-kbBglII-NotI digestion product that derives from the unmethylated paternal chromosome in the (M × S) F1 adult liver. For the (M × S) F1 DNase-I series, the ratios of the intensities of the maternal (5.6 kb) and the paternal (4.3 kb) bands were 1.1, 1.5, 3.2, and 3.7 for lanes 1–4, respectively.

In theleft panel, BglII-digested (M × S) F1 nuclei DNAs, probed with fragment 1, showing the presence of the two HSS in the 5′-UTR, and a prominent HSS in the promoter. DNase-I concentrations (lanes 1–7) in this analysis were as inA. The ratios of the intensities of the maternal (5.6 kb) and the paternal (4.3 kb) bands are 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 3.4, and 4.9 forlanes 1–5, respectively. In the right panel, the same DNase-I-digested nuclei DNAs were digested with BglII and HpaII. The methylation-sensitive restriction enzymeHpaII digested sites on the unmethylated paternal allele (4.3-kb fragment) exclusively and thereby allowed analysis of DNase-I sensitivity on the maternal chromosome. The weak band of 5.3 kb corresponds to a single, partially demethylated HpaII site on the maternal chomosome 1 kb upstream of U2af1-rs1 (see also Fig. 3). Fragments corresponding to DNase-I HSS are indicated with arrows. C, paternal chromosome-specific nuclease sensitivity in 3′ part of the U2af1-rs1 gene.

The paternal 1.3-kb fragment is more sensitive to DNase-I than the maternal 2.6-kb fragment. The ratios of the 2.6- and 1.3-kb bands are 1.4, 1.6, 4.0, and 4.4 for lanes 4–7, respectively. In the middle panel, the hybrid liver nuclei were incubated for increasing periods of time (0, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 30 min, in lanes 1–8, respectively) withMspI (at 10,000 units/ml). DNA was extracted and digested with BglII and SacI, electrophoresed, and probed with fragment 1. The ratios of the 2.6- and 1.3-kb bands are 1.6, 3.5, and 6.8 for lanes 3–5, respectively. In the right panel, analysis of MNase sensitivity. (M × S) F1 hybrid liver nuclei were incubated with increasing concentrations of MNase (0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.8 units/ml, in lanes 1–4, respectively), DNAs were extracted, digested withBglII+SacI, electrophoresed, and probed with fragment 1.

The basolateral targeting of the BC1 isoform of MCP was analyzed by generating deletion mutants and point mutants within the cytoplasmic tail of 16 amino acids. A sequence of four amino acids, FTSL, was found to be indispensable for the basolateral transport of MCP. This tetrapeptide has two unique features compared with the targeting motifs of other basolateral proteins: (i) it contains a phenylalanine rather than a tyrosine at position 1; (ii) it is located at the very COOH-terminal end. Replacement of the phenylalanine or the leucine by an alanine resulted in a nonpolarized delivery to the cell surface. On the other hand, substitution of a tyrosine for the phenylalanine did not affect the basolateral transport of MCP. The latter mutant, however, was efficiently internalized, whereas the wild type protein was not subject to endocytosis. Our results indicate that the targeting signal YXX-large aliphatic that is involved in various sorting events has been modulated in MCP in such a way that it allows basolateral transport but not endocytosis.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In other polarized cells,e.g. hepatocytes, apical proteins are first delivered to the basolateral side where they are sorted and transcytosed to the apical membrane (6Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In recent years, a correlation between the cytoplasmic tail of a protein and the basolateral targeting has been established (for review, see Ref. 7Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For some basolateral sorting signals involving a critical tyrosine residue, a close relationship to determinants for coated pit localization has been described (8Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Patzak A. Patil N. Chao M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

However, some other proteins, e.g. the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor or the low density lipoprotein receptor, possess unrelated targeting and endocytosis signals (11Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast to the basolateral sorting, the apical targeting is not well characterized. For apically secreted proteins the importance ofN-glycans has been demonstrated (13Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, for membrane-bound apical proteins the involvement of the carbohydrate moiety is still speculative. Proteins anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MCP, membrane cofactor protein; SCR, short consensus repeat; STP, serine, threonine, proline-rich region; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; DAF, decay accelerating factor; TM, transmembrane; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VCNA, Vibrio cholerae sialidase; wt, wild type; SA, sialic acid(s). 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MCP, membrane cofactor protein; SCR, short consensus repeat; STP, serine, threonine, proline-rich region; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; DAF, decay accelerating factor; TM, transmembrane; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VCNA, Vibrio cholerae sialidase; wt, wild type; SA, sialic acid(s). are normally delivered to the apical plasma membrane (14Lisanti M.P.

Science. 1989; 245: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the distribution of GPI is nonpolarized, indicating that the sorting machinery for nonprotein-linked GPIs and for GPI-anchored proteins is different (16van‘t Hof W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) is a type I membrane protein and is expressed on all nucleated human cells tested. MCP functions as a cofactor for the plasma serine protease factor I by binding to complement factors C3b and C4b deposited on self tissue (17Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). By promoting the proteolytic degradation of these factors, it protects the cell from complement-mediated damage. In addition, MCP serves as a receptor for measles virus (18Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dörig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). For virus binding, theN-glycans of MCP are of critical importance (20Maisner A. Herrler G. Virology. 1995; 210: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Maisner A. Alvarez J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson D.J. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of MCP consists of four cysteine-rich short consensus repeats (SCRs), three of which contain sites forN-glycosylation. The SCRs are followed by a serine, threonine, and proline-rich region (STP), the site ofO-glycosylation. By alternative splicing multiple MCP isoforms arise which contain different combinations of the STP regions A, B, and C. A commonly expressed isoform contains the BC regions consisting of 29 amino acids. The extracellular portion of MCP is connected to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain by a short region of unknown function. The intracellular domain of the protein is divided into two parts. The membrane proximal portion, designated as the intracytoplasmic anchor, is present in all MCP isoforms and consists of 10 mainly basic amino acids. The carboxyl-terminal end of MCP, designated as cytoplasmic tail 1 or 2, is subjected to alternative splicing like the STP region. In the various isoforms of MCP either of two different tails was found: one comprising 16 amino acids (tail 1) and the other consisting of 23 amino acids (tail 2). The nomenclature of MCP isoforms indicates which segments (A, B, or C) of the STP region and which cytoplasmic tail (1 or 2) are expressed (for review, see Ref.17Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent paper, we reported that two MCP isoforms with different tails (MCP-BC1 and MCP-BC2) were directed to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. A mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail was transported in a nonpolarized fashion. This result indicated that both tails contain a basolateral sorting signal. We also showed that the targeting signal of tail 1 is tyrosine-independent in contrast to most basolateral signals identified so far (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the sorting signal in the cytoplasmic tail of MCP-BC1 in more detail. By analysis of MCP-BC1 mutants with deletions in the cytoplasmic tail, an important part of the basolateral targeting signal was localized in the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids (FTSL). Studies with point mutants revealed that in addition to the phenylalanine, the leucine residue at the very COOH-terminal end is also important. A mutant with the phenylalanine replaced by tyrosine was also transported to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells; but in contrast to the wild type protein, it was efficiently endocytosed. MDCK cells (strain I) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. Tissue culture-treated 0.4-μm pore size Transwell polycarbonate filters (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were used for all experiments. Cells were seeded 5 days before experiments (2 × 105cells/7.5-mm unit and 2 × 106 cells/24-mm unit). The polarity was determined by measurement of the transepithelial resistance using a Millipore ERS apparatus (Bedford, MA). MDCK cells formed a tight monolayer with an electrical resistance of 1,000–2,500 Ω × cm2. The different patterns of surface proteins on the apical and basolateral membrane of the polarized cell lines were controlled by surface biotinylation. The construction of the two chimeric MCP proteins used in this study was described by Lublin and Coyne (24Lublin D.M. Coyne K.E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The DAF-TM consists of amino acids 1–304 of decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and amino acids 270–350 of MCP-BC2, resulting in a DAF molecule anchored by the MCP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. The CD46-GPI (MCP-PI) consists of amino acids 1–269 of MCP and 307–347 of DAF (numbering starts from the first amino acid of the mature protein without the signal peptide), representing a GPI-anchored version of MCP (Fig.1 upper panel). For our studies both chimeras were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the stable expression vector pHβApr-1-neo (25Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The construction of the four cDNAs with larger deletions in the cytoplasmic tail of the isoform BC1 of MCP (tail-minus, d1–6, d7–12, and d13–16) was described by Liszewski et al. (26Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the generation of the cDNA mutants 13F/Y, 13F/A, d14–16, d16, and 16L/A, MCP isoform BC1 was subcloned into the replicative form DNA of M13mp18. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis based on the phosphorothioate method using single-stranded DNA of M13mp18 was performed with a commercial kit (Amersham Corp.). M13mp18-MCP phages with the desired mutation were selected by sequencing the single-stranded DNA with a Sequenase kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). The mutated MCP cDNA was excised from the phage replicative form DNA and ligated into the EcoRI site of pHβApr-1-neo. The amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic tail of all MCP mutants are shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel). For stable expression, 1.5 × 106 MDCK cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation and selected for neomycin resistance. For each mutant the experiments were performed on uncloned populations of transfectants to minimize the effect of clonal variations and on at least two subclones with different expression levels (moderate and high expression). MCP expression was controlled based upon Western blot and immunofluorescence. Although the expression levels of the different cell populations varied, the relative amount of each mutant protein delivered to the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, was almost identical in at least three experiments. Surfaces of filter-grown MDCK cells were labeled with the non-membrane-permeating reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotin (Pierce) as described recently (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For surface immunofluorescence, MDCK cell clones grown on 7.5-mm Transwell units were fixed on ice with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min). The apical and basolateral surfaces were incubated with mAb J4/48 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Denmark) as described earlier (27Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence label was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany) working with the blue line of an argon laser. MDCK cells stably expressing MCP were grown on coverslips. At 10–50% confluence, surface-expressed MCP was labeled with a mAb directed against MCP (J4/48; Dianova) diluted 1:20 in PBS-bovine serum albumin. After an incubation for 60 min on ice, the antibody was removed by washing with PBS+, and the cells were incubated with cell culture medium for 60 min either at 4 °C or 37 °C to allow endocytosis of the MCP-antibody complex. Internalization was stopped by rapid cooling on ice. Surface-bound antibody was detected by an incubation for 60 min on ice with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS-bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBS+, the cells were fixed and permeabilized for 5 min at −20 °C with methanol/acetone (1:1). Internalized antibodies were detected with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS-bovine serum albumin. To avoid nonspecific binding to the rhodamine-labeled goat Fab fragments bound to the cell surface, the FITC-labeled antiserum was preabsorbed with goat-IgG agarose (Sigma). After the double immunofluorescence staining, the samples were mounted in Mowiol and 10% triethylenediamine. Conventional epifluorescence was performed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken with Kodak Tmax film (3200 ASA) exposed for identical times for both fluorochromes. MDCK cells expressing MCP were grown on six-well plastic dishes and surface labeled at 4 °C with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotin as described earlier (27Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After stopping the biotinylation reaction by adding PBS+containing 0.1 m glycine and washing with cold PBS+, prewarmed serum-free cell culture medium was added. The cells were transferred to a 37 °C incubator for various times. To stop internalization, the cells were cooled on ice and washed with cold PBS+. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 500 milliunits Vibrio cholerae sialidase (VCNA; Behring, Marburg, Germany) for 60 min at 4 °C. This treatment removed all sialic acid residues on surface MCP, whereas internalized MCP was protected from the sialidase. After extensive washing with cold PBS+, the cells were lysed, and MCP was immunoprecipitated as described earlier (27Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated MCP was separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected as described above. The internalization rate of MCP was determined by densitometric quantification of the sialylated and desialylated MCP bands. We have reported recently that the cytoplasmic tail of MCP is responsible for the basolateral transport of the isoforms BC1 and BC2 in polarized epithelial cells (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the basolateral targeting signal of MCP is able to redirect an apical protein to the basolateral domain, two chimeric molecules (Fig. 1,upper panel) that have been constructed from MCP-BC2 and DAF (24Lublin D.M. Coyne K.E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were stably expressed in MDCK cells. DAF is known to be localized on the apical surface of polarized cells (28Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The first chimera was a form of DAF in which the GPI anchor was replaced by the MCP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (DAF-TM). The second chimera represents a form of MCP which lacked both the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain and was anchored by GPI (MCP-PI). To analyze the transport of these proteins, MDCK cells stably expressing either of the chimeras were grown on permeable filter supports. Either the apical or the basolateral surface proteins were labeled by adding the non-membrane-permeating reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotin to the respective chamber. The cells were lysed, and MCP and DAF were isolated by immunoprecipitation (mAb J4/48 for MCP, anti-CD55 for DAF). The samples were divided into two aliquots. One was used for a Western blot analysis to ensure that there was no difference in the total amount of protein in the cells labeled from two different sides (not shown). The second aliquot was separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and the biotin-labeled proteins were detected with streptavidin/peroxidase. As shown in Fig. 2, MCP and MCP chimeras were distributed in a different way on epithelial cells. MCP-BC1 representing a wild type isoform is almost exclusively expressed on the basolateral surface as described recently (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DAF-TM was also found predominantly on the basolateral side indicating that the MCP COOH terminus comprising the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain is able to direct an apical protein to the basolateral membrane of polarized cells. In contrast to DAF-TM, an efficient biotinylation of the MCP-PI molecules was only obtained after labeling the cells from the apical side. Replacement of the COOH terminus of MCP by a GPI anchor resulted in the apical expression of the protein. This finding is in agreement with the apical localization of other GPI-anchored proteins. Our previous work indicated that the basolateral sorting signal of the BC1 isoform of MCP is localized in the 16 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Studies on a deletion mutant lacking the six membrane-proximal amino acids (TYLTDE) indicated that the targeting signal is not dependent on the only tyrosine of the cytoplasmic tail (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed two additional deletion mutants lacking either six amino acids in the central portion (BC1-d7–12) or four amino acids at the very COOH-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail (BC1-d13–16). The amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic portion of these and all mutants described in this paper are shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel). The distribution of the BC1 deletion mutants was analyzed by domain-specific surface biotinylation of stably expressing MDCK cells grown on filters. The result is shown in Fig. 2. As demonstrated recently (23Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the MCP form lacking the cytoplasmic tail (tail-minus) was almost equally distributed on the apical and the basolateral membranes. The deletion mutants lacking either the first six amino acids or the following six amino acids (BC1-d1–6 and BC1-d7–12) were transported like the wild type protein (MCP-BC1). Therefore, the first 12 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail are dispensable for the correct basolateral sorting of MCP. In contrast, the mutant lacking the four COOH-terminal amino acids of the tail (BC1-d13–16) was transported like the tail-minus mutant. This finding indicates that the basolateral sorting of MCP is dependent on the amino acids FTSL at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Aromatic amino acids, especially tyrosine, are involved in the targeting of several basolateral proteins. As phenylalanine is the only aromatic amino acid in the FTSL motif of MCP, we analyzed the importance of this residue. We established MDCK cells stably expressing MCP-BC1 with the phenylalanine at position 13 of the cytoplasmic tail replaced either by tyrosine (13F/Y) or by alanine (13F/A). Mutant MCP forms were analyzed by surface biotinylation of filter-grown cells. The result of domain-specific biotinylation is shown in Fig.3. Like the wild type protein (Fig. 2, MCP-BC1), 13F/Y was found mainly on the basolateral membrane. This finding indicates that phenylalanine in the basolateral targeting signal of MCP can be replaced by tyrosine without changing the direction of the transport. In contrast, substitution of an alanine for the phenylalanine altered the polarized transport dramatically. 13F/A was found to be equally distributed on both sides of the cells, similar to the BC1-d13–16 mutant. To confirm the different distribution of the 13F/Y and 13F/A mutants, the filter-grown cells were also analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using a confocal laser scanning microscope. After cell fixation with paraformaldehyde, the nonpermeabilized cells were incubated from both the apical and the basolateral side with mAb J4/48 and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Horizontal sections of the apical, the center, and the basal portions of the cells are shown in Fig. 4 (upper panel). In addition, a vertical section (side view) of the cells is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. Almost no fluorescence signals were detected in the apical section of MDCK cells expressing BC1–13F/Y. The section through the center of the cells showed a honeycomb pattern that in a more diffuse manner was also seen in the basal section. In the side view, a cup-like pattern typical for basolateral proteins was observed. In contrast, strong fluorescence signals were found in all sections of MDCK cells expressing BC1–13F/A. In the vertical profile, BC1–13F/A was found to encircle the cells completely. The confocal immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the result that replacement of the phenylalanine by a tyrosine has no effect on the targeting of MCP to the basolateral surface of polarized cells, whereas the replacement by an alanine resulted in the loss of polarized surface expression.Figure 4Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of MCP-BC1 with an exchange of the phenylalanine in the cytoplasmic tail. MDCK cells expressing MCP-BC1 with a tyrosine (13F/Y) or an alanine (13F/A) instead of a phenylalanine at position 13 of the cytoplasmic tail were grown on filters. After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde, the apical and basolateral surfaces were incubated with mAb J4/48 and a FITC-conjugated second antibody. Analysis was performed with a laser scanning microscope. Confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of horizontal focal planes through the apical surface, the center, the basal surface, and a vertical profile (side view) through the monolayers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze further the basolateral targeting of MCP, three mutants with changes in the three COOH-terminal amino acids (TSL) were generated. MCP lacking all three amino acids (d14–16) or only lacking the leucine (d16) and a MCP form with a substitution of an alanine for the leucine (16L/A) were stably expressed in MDCK cells and analyzed by surface biotinylation and confocal microscopy of filter-grown cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the three mutants were almost equally distributed on the surface of MDCK cells, indicating that removal or substitution of the leucine in position 16 of the cytoplasmic tail results in the loss of the polarized transport. The confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of BC1-d14–16, BC1-d16, and BC1–16L/A are shown in Fig.6. Fluorescence signals were detected in all sections (apical, center, and basal) of MDCK cells expressing any of the three mutants. This result confirms the result of the domain-specific biotinylation and indicates that in addition to the phenylalanine at position 13 the leucine at position 16 is also essential for the correct sorting of MCP.Figure 6Analysis of the surface expression of MCP-BC1 with changes in the last three amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail by confocal microscopy. MDCK cells expressing MCP isoform BC1 lacking the last three amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (BC1-d14–16), lacking the last amino acid (BC1-d16), or having the leucine at position 16 replaced by an alanine (BC1–16L/A) were grown on filters. The apical and basolateral side was stained with mAb J4/48 and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of horizontal planes through the apical surface, the center, and the basolateral surface are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MCP with the phenylalanine replaced by tyrosine (BC1–13F/Y) was transported to the basolateral membrane like the wild type protein (BC1-wt). In contrast to all other mutants we tested, the amount of surface-expressed protein BC1–13F/Y was strongly reduced although the total amount of protein was comparable to BC1-wt. Because a motif (YXXL) similar to that one generated in this mutant (YTSL) is described as an endocytosis signal for several proteins (29Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,30Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the weak surface expression may have resulted from internalization of BC1–13F/Y. To examine this possibility, we analyzed BC1–13F/Y for endocytosis by an antibody uptake experiment. MCP at the surface of living cells was incubated with mAb J4/48 at 4 °C, and the cells were either kept on ice for 60 min or warmed to 37 °C to allow endocytosis to occur. Surface-bound antibodies were detected by incubation of the living cells with a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody at 4 °C. After permeabilization of the cells, internalized MCP-J4/48 complexes were detected with a FITC-conjugated second antibody. In Fig. 7, the result of the double immunofluorescence staining (surface, intracellular) is shown for wild type MCP (BC1-wt) and the tyrosine mutant (BC1–13F/Y). With cells maintained at 4 °C neither wild type nor mutant MCP was detected intracellularly. After incubation at 37 °C, most of the surface-bound J4/48 was still"

Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar for reviews). kDNA consists of several thousand circular DNA molecules, which are all catenated into a giant network. In the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata, the subject of this study, electron microscopy reveals that an isolated network is an eliptically shaped monolayer of interlocked DNA circles, about 10 μm × 15 μm in size. Each cell has one network, which is condensed into a disc-shaped structure within its single mitochondrion. The network contains two kinds of DNA circles known as minicircles and maxicircles. In C. fasciculata the network contains about 5000 minicircles, each 2.5 kilobases, and 25 maxicircles, each 38 kilobases. Maxicircles have a genetic function resembling that of mitochondrial DNAs in other eukaryotes, encoding ribosomal RNAs and proteins required for mitochondrial energy transduction. Most maxicircle transcripts undergo editing, a process by which uridine residues are inserted into or deleted from the sequence, thus forming an open reading frame. Minicircles encode small guide RNAs, which control the specificity of editing (see Refs. 4Hajduk S.L. Harris M.E. Pollard V.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 5Simpson L. Maslov D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 1870-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar for reviews on editing). The network structure of kDNA must require unusual mechanisms for its replication. For example, minicircles do not replicate while topologically linked to the network, but instead they are released from the network by a topoisomerase. After release they replicate as free minicircles, using a θ mechanism, and the progeny minicircles are then reattached to the network periphery. When all minicircles have replicated, the network has doubled in size. Then it splits in two, and the two progeny networks segregate into daughter cells during cell division (see Refs. 3Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 6Ray D.S. Plasmid. 1987; 17: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, and 7Shlomai J. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 341-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for reviews). A current goal in our laboratory is to study proteins and enzymes that are involved in the maintenance and replication of kDNA. These proteins are interesting not only in their own right, but also because in at least some cases they are assembled into mitochondrial protein complexes, which can be easily visualized by immunofluorescence. For example, both a topoisomerase II (8Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a DNA polymerase β (9Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) co-localize within two discrete protein complexes (each roughly 0.4 μm in diameter), which are situated in antipodal positions at the edge of the kinetoplast disc (the disc is approximately 1 μm in diameter and 0.4 μm thick). Since minicircles thought to be replication intermediates (as visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization) are also present in these two complexes (9Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it is likely that these structures are involved in minicircle replication (see Ref. 3Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar for review). In this paper we report the purification of a C. fasciculatamitochondrial DNA primase, the enzyme responsible for making short RNA molecules that initiate the synthesis of a DNA strand. We found that the primase is a single polypeptide of 28 kDa, and we describe some of its enzymatic properties. Using immunofluorescence, we found unexpectedly that the primase does not co-localize with the topoisomerase II and the DNA polymerase β in the two protein complexes that flank the kinetoplast disc. Instead it localizes above and below the disc. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the mechanism of kDNA replication. Ribo- and deoxynucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Poly(dT), from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., had an average length of 200–300 nucleotides. A coupled assay was used to follow the enzyme during purification (10Mendelman L.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this assay, using ATP as a substrate, the primase synthesized non-radioactive oligo(A) primers complementary to a poly(dT) template. The primers were then extended by Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP, and acid-insoluble radioactivity was measured. The 25-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaOAc, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (the 10 mg/ml stock solution had been heated at 60 °C for 15 min), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg of poly(dT), 1 mm ATP, 50 μm [α-32P]dATP (about 2400 cpm/pmol), 0–0.5 unit of primase, and 0.5 unit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment (New England Biolabs). After 30 min at 30 °C, products of the reaction were precipitated by sequential addition of 10 μl of BSA (10 mg/ml), 10 μl of 0.1 msodium pyrophosphate, 35 μl of H2O, and 20 μl of 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The acid-insoluble product was collected onto GF/C filters (Whatman) under vacuum and washed, first with 0.1m HCl and 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, and then with 95% (v/v) ethanol. Radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. One DNA primase unit is defined as the amount required for conversion of 1 pmol of [32P]dAMP/h into an acid-insoluble form under assay conditions. The activity is linear with enzyme concentration in the range of 0–1 unit. The standard buffer conditions and temperature (30 °C) were used in all primase reactions described in this paper. Parasites were grown in a 150-liter Fermatron fermenter (in the Department of Biochemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health) at 26 °C in medium containing 1.8% Deltown AE80M peptone, 0.45% yeast extract, 0.45% NaCl, 0.9% glucose, and 10 mg/liter hemin (11Melendy T. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, they were grown at room temperature in 6-liter flasks (each containing 4 liter of medium) with vigorous shaking (200 rpm). Cells at a density of about 4 × 107/ml were harvested by centrifugation either using a Sharples continuous flow centrifuge or a Sorvall GS3 rotor (5000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). They were washed in STE buffer (250 mmsucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) (12Li C. Hwa K.-Y. Englund P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4426-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The yield of cells was 2–3 g (wet weight)/liter of culture. Two procedures, both conducted at 0–4 °C, were used for isolation of mitochondria. In Method A (modified from a previous procedure; Ref.12Li C. Hwa K.-Y. Englund P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4426-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the cells (220 g, wet weight) were suspended in 1200 ml of cell disruption buffer (STE buffer supplemented with 0.15 m KCl and 5 mm MgCl2). The cell suspension (in 600-ml aliquots) was transferred to a Parr cell disruption bomb. The bomb was pressurized with nitrogen to 1800–2000 p.s.i. for 30 min, while the contents were stirred with a magnetic bar. The cells were disrupted as the suspension was released to atmospheric pressure through the discharge valve. To maintain the pressure through the discharge process, it was necessary to stop the flow, restore the nitrogen pressure to 1800–2000 p.s.i., and then resume the discharge. Microscopy revealed that more than 95% of cells were disrupted. Fluorescence microscopy, after staining with DAPI (1 μg/ml) to visualize the kDNA, showed that most of the mitochondria appeared as brightly fluorescent dots, indicating that the membranes enclosing the kDNA were still intact. To isolate a mitochondrial fraction, the suspension was centrifuged (Sorvall GS-3 rotor, 9000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C); the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of cell disruption buffer and centrifuged again under the same conditions. This washing procedure was repeated four times. In Method B (modified from a scheme developed by Joseph Shlomai, Hebrew University), 2J. Shlomai, personal communication. the cells (450 g, wet weight) were suspended in 2000 ml of ice-cold 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and then transferred to the Parr cell disruption bomb. The bomb was pressurized to 1000 p.s.i. for 30 min, while stirring with a magnetic bar. The cells were released from the discharge valve, which was connected to an 18-gauge needle. Microscopy indicated that almost all cells were broken and most mitochondria were intact. The cell homogenate was centrifuged (Sorvall GS-3 rotor, 2000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove unbroken cells, and then the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again (Sorvall GSA rotor, 12,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellets from the second centrifugation, containing mitochondria, were pooled and used for the enzyme purification. Method B gives a better recovery of mitochondria, although it is probably a more crude preparation. Cells were grown to about 4 × 107cells/ml with vigorous shaking (200 rpm) at room temperature in 8 liters of 3.7% (w/v) Brain Heart Infusion supplemented with 20 μg/ml hemin using two 6-liter flasks. The cells were harvested as described above and disrupted in a Parr cell disruption bomb using Method A. After centrifugation of the lysate to sediment the mitochondria (Sorvall GSA rotor, 12,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), the pellet was washed twice with 200 ml of cell disruption buffer. The final pellet was gently resuspended with 125 ml of 100% Percoll (Pharmacia) and 125 ml of cell disruption buffer by means of a Dounce homogenizer with loose pestle (type B). The Percoll suspension was evenly divided into 10 tubes and centrifuged (Beckman Ti 50.2 rotor, 26,000 rpm, 45 min, 4 °C), generating Percoll concentration gradients. In this gradient the mitochondrial fraction formed a turbid band about 1 cm thick, at about 2/3 of the distance from the top of each tube. These fractions were pooled and recentrifuged (Beckman SW27 rotor, 25,000 rpm, 90 min, 4 °C). The mitochondrial fraction formed a loose layer just above the Percoll pellet. The mitochondria were collected and washed once with STE buffer (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 15,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). All purification procedures were conducted at 4 °C using Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and all dialyses were performed against Buffer A. Mitochondria (prepared by Method A from 220 g (wet weight) of cells) were lysed by gentle stirring at 4 °C for 30 min in 500 ml of mitochondrial lysis buffer (0.5 m KCl, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (Sorvall GSA rotor, 12,500 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Crude mitochondrial lysate (Fraction 1, 500 ml) was loaded onto a 50-ml Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. DNA primase activity does not bind to this column; however, this step was essential for removal of nucleic acids in the lysate. The flow-through fraction (Fraction 2, 450 ml) was loaded onto a 50-ml S-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column at 2 ml/min, which was washed with 250 ml of buffer A, then with 250 ml of 0.2 m KCl in buffer A, and finally with 300 ml of 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. DNA primase activity was eluted at the 0.5 m KCl step (Fraction 3, 300 ml). Fraction 3 was then dialyzed and loaded onto a 30-ml double-stranded DNA-cellulose column (Sigma) at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A and eluted with a 240-ml gradient of 50 mm to 1m KCl in buffer A at 0.5 ml/min. The DNA primase activity eluted between 0.25 and 0.4 m KCl. The active fractions were pooled (Fraction 4, 40 ml), dialyzed, and loaded onto a 1-ml Poros HS column (PerSeptive Biosystems) at 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 20 ml of buffer A, the column was eluted with a 25-ml gradient of 50 mm to 1 m KCl in buffer A at 0.5 ml/min. The activity was eluted at about 0.3–0.4 m KCl. Pooled active fractions (Fraction 5, 4 ml) were diluted with 4 ml of 4 mKCl and loaded onto a phenyl-Superose column (HR5/5, Pharmacia) at 0.5 ml/min. The column was eluted with a 35-ml reverse gradient, 2m to 0 m KCl in buffer A, at 0.5 ml/min. The DNA primase activity eluted at about 1 m KCl. The active fractions (Fraction 6, 1 ml) were dialyzed against buffer A containing 40% glycerol to reduce the volume to about 300 μl. The final chromatographic procedure was gel filtration on a 30-ml Superose 12 FPLC column (Pharmacia) using buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 40% glycerol (v/v) and stored at −80 °C (Fraction 7, 0.8 ml). In a second purification, we used a mitochondrial fraction isolated by Method B. The purification steps were identical to those described in the previous paragraph with the following exceptions: 1) a 150-ml phosphocellulose column, eluted with a 1200-ml gradient from 0 to 1m KCl in buffer A, substituted for the DNA cellulose column; 2) column sizes (except for the Poros HS column) and volumes of elution buffers were increased proportionally to the amount of protein; 3) a 10-ml phenyl-Sepharose column substituted for the phenyl-Superose, and this column was run before the Poros HS column, and 4) the final Superose 12 FPLC step was omitted because the protein was pure after Poros HS chromatography. Rabbit antibody to mitochondrial DNA polymerase β was a gift from Dr. Al Torri (13Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to the DNA primase was prepared by immunizing female BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injections with purified DNA primase (Fraction 7, 2–5 μg/injection). The initial inoculations were in Freund's complete adjuvant, and four subsequent boosts were at 3-week intervals with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The serum (at 1:1000 dilution) was screened by Western blot for specific recognition of the 28-kDa protein. The antibody recognizes the homogeneous primase on a Western blot (Fig. 1, lane 12; see lane 10 for Coomassie-stained gel) and also recognizes a polypeptide of the same size in a preparation of isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1, lane 11; see lane 9 for Coomassie-stained gel). Preincubation of 5 μl of primase antiserum with 5 μl of primase solution (30 min, 4 °C) resulted in 70% loss of primase activity in the standard assay. A control experiment with DNA polymerase β antiserum resulted in loss of only 15% of primase activity. In an immunodepletion assay, antiserum bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was able to deplete 74% of the primase activity. In a control experiment with DNA polymerase β antiserum, only 10% of the primase activity was depleted. Log phase C. fasciculata cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were washed with 5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmNaH2PO4, 130 mm NaCl (PBS) (Sorvall GSA rotor, 10 min, 4000 rpm, 4 °C) and resuspended in PBS at the same cell concentration. Cell suspension (10 μl) was spotted onto 10-well slides pretreated with a 1/10 dilution of poly-l-lysine (Sigma, 0.1%). The slides were kept in a humidity chamber for 20 min to allow cells to adhere prior to a wash with PBS. The cells were first fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (2 min at room temperature), a treatment followed by fixation in 100% methanol (overnight at −20 °C). The fixed cells were washed with PBS and then treated with 20 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min to neutralize residual aldehyde groups. After washing again with PBS, the slides were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 10% (w/v) BSA, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (blocking solution), and then incubated in a humidity chamber for 1 h at room temperature with mouse anti-primase serum diluted 1:250 in blocking solution. After washing in PBS, they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:250 in blocking solution. The slides were washed in PBS and then in PBS with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml). After washing with PBS for another 10 min, the slides were then mounted with Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem) (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 418Google Scholar) containing p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml). To double-label the cells, the primary antibody reaction (1 h, room temperature) included rabbit antibody to DNA polymerase β (1:250 dilution) and mouse antibody to DNA primase (1:250 dilution). The secondary antibody reaction (1 h, room temperature) included rhodamine-conjugated affinity-purified goat antibody to rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim, 1:250 dilution) and fluorescein-conjugated affinity-purified goat antibody to mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim, 1:250 dilution). The slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and the images captured on Kodak Tmax 400 film. The negatives were scanned with a Nikon 35-mm film scanner (LS-1000) and processed in Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh computer. Table Ipresents a summary of the purification. Starting from the mitochondrial lysate supernatant (prepared by Method A), the DNA primase was purified 14,500-fold and the yield of activity was about 8%. Fig.1 shows an analysis of Fractions 1–7 by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fraction 7 appears to contain only a single homogeneous protein of 28 kDa.Table IPurification of DNA primaseFraction Total protein1-aProtein was assayed with the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Total activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunitsunits/mg-fold1.

Open table in a new tab Purification was from mitochondria isolated by Method A (see “Experimental Procedures”) from 220 g of log phase C. fasciculata. The final yield of primase from mitochondria prepared by Method A was only about 10 μg of protein (Table I). We considered the possibility that this mitochondrial isolation procedure had a low yield, due at least in part to the extensive washing of the mitochondrial fraction in Method A. We therefore did a second purification using a mitochondrial fraction isolated by Method B. In the preparation shown in Table I, we started with only 1750 mg of mitochondrial protein in a mitochondrial lysate prepared from 220 g of cells. Using Method B in a second purification, we started with 27,200 mg of mitochondrial protein from 450 g of cells. Using this procedure we obtained about 300 μg of purified DNA primase in about 10% yield. Its specific activity was comparable to that shown in Table I. Fig. 1 (lane 8) shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the final product. This most pure fraction, or the Fraction 7 enzyme in Table I, was used in all experiments described in this paper. The purified enzyme was stored at −80 °C in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 40% glycerol. It maintains over 50% of its activity after 6 months of storage. As shown in Fig. 2, the DNA primase activity (panel A) co-eluted from the Superose 12 column with the 28-kDa protein as indicated by the intensity of the silver-stained band on SDS-PAGE (panel B). Primase activity and the 28-kDa protein both peak in fraction 31. The 28-kDa protein also co-eluted with primase activity on the phenyl-Superose and Poros HS columns, and the ratio of activity to silver staining of the band was comparable to that of Fraction 7. These data provide strong evidence that the 28-kDa protein is responsible for activity. To assess the size of the native enzyme, we also compared its behavior in gel filtration (Superose 12 FPLC) with that of two reference single-chain proteins, carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) and BSA (67 kDa). The elution position of the DNA primase was the same as that of carbonic anhydrase (see legend of Fig. 2 A), providing strong evidence that the primase is a 28-kDa monomer. Maximal primase activity requires ATP and a divalent cation (Mg2+) (TableII). The enzyme may have a tightly bound metal ion, as 21% of maximal activity is detectable in the absence of added Mg2+. However, EDTA inhibits activity completely when added at a concentration equivalent to that of the divalent cation. Rifampicin and N-ethylmaleimide inhibit the activity only weakly. To determine whether in our standard assay (using a poly(dT) template) the incorporation of [32P]dAMP into an acid-insoluble form depends on the activity of primase, we varied the ATP concentration from 0 to 4 mm. As shown in Fig.3 A, there was no incorporation in the absence of ATP and incorporation was maximal at 1 mm(closed symbols). In a control experiment (open symbols), there was little effect of ATP on the incorporation of [32P]dAMP when primase was omitted and oligo(dA) was used as a primer. In a related experiment we used single-stranded M13 DNA as a template (Fig. 3 B). Again there was dependence upon the presence of rNTPs (compare lower line to upper line), and the magnitude of [32P]dAMP incorporation depended upon the primase concentration.Table IICharacteristics of DNA primaseDNA primase activity%Complete system2-aThe standard assay conditions with a poly(dT) template, described under “Experimental Procedures.”100−Mg2+21−KCl49−ATP0+EDTA (5 mm)0+Rifampicin2-bAdded at beginning of reaction with no preincubation. 100 μg/ml59 50 μg/ml80+N-Ethylmaleimide2-bAdded at beginning of reaction with no preincubation. 10 mm48 5 mm952-a The standard assay conditions with a poly(dT) template, described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-b Added at beginning of reaction with no preincubation. Open table in a new tab To characterize the products, we conducted reactions (for times up to 45 min) containing poly(dT) template, [α-32P]ATP as substrate, and DNA primase. Analysis of the reaction products on a 20% polyacrylamide gel revealed a ladder of fragments ranging up to about 10 nucleotides in size (Fig. 4 A). However, with a long exposure of the autoradiogram, there were very small amounts of larger oligonucleotides, up to about 15 nucleotides in size. We also found in a similar experiment using M13 DNA as a template and the 4 rNTPs that the primase synthesized a very heterogeneous population of oligonucleotides in the same size range (data not shown). We next used a chase to determine whether the oligonucleotides synthesized by primase can prime DNA synthesis (Fig. 4 B). We first synthesized primers using [α-32P]ATP as a substrate (lane 1), and the products are the characteristic ladder of fragments up to about 10 nucleotides in size. We then added Klenow DNA polymerase and increasing concentrations of dATP to the reaction. As shown in lanes 2–4, the primers were elongated and the products appeared in or near the slot. The products of DNA primase can also be elongated by the purified C. fasciculatamitochondrial DNA polymerase β (15Torri A.F. Kunkel T.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8165-8171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of the low processivity of this enzyme, the primer extensions occurred with much lower efficiency (data not shown). Four lines of evidence support the mitochondrial localization of this primase. First, in a small scale purification (from about 25 g of cells), we used Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria to purify the primase through the phenyl-Superose fraction. The primase obtained from the purified mitochondria had activity and chromatographic behavior similar to that obtained from the crude mitochondrial fraction. 3C. Li and P. T. Englund, unpublished data. Second, the activity in the crude mitochondrial fraction was latent, requiring release from vesicles by treatment with a buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 m KCl. In a control assay in which the detergent/KCl treatment was omitted, the amount of detectable primase activity was only about 10% of that obtained with detergent/KCl.3 Third, a Western blot of proteins from a mitochondrial fraction revealed a 28-kDa polypeptide that reacted with anti-primase antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 11). Finally, immunolocalization experiments proved conclusively that the primase is localized within the single mitochondrion of this parasite. For immunolocalization we used a polyclonal antibody against the primase. The results indicate that the primase is indeed situated within the mitochondrion in discrete sites near the kDNA network. Fig.5 A shows two C. fasciculata cells visualized by Nomarski optics. Fig.5 B shows the same cells stained with DAPI, which brightly stains the kinetoplasts (the nuclei stain poorly under these conditions and are barely visible). The kinetoplast is a disc-shaped structure, oriented perpendicular to the flagellum, and this image shows the edges of the discs. Fig. 5 C shows the primase in the same cells, localized above and below the kinetoplast disc. Somewhat more fluorescence is observed on the side of the disc nearest the flagellum, a distribution observed in many cells. We were concerned that the images of primase and DAPI staining might have been misaligned and that both components of the primase fluorescence may have been on the same side of the kinetoplast disc. This possibility is highly unlikely, given that the two cells are oriented in opposite directions and that the distances between the DAPI stains and the primase stains in the two cells are identical. Therefore we conclude that the primase forms a sandwich-like structure around the kinetoplast disc. DNA primase is localized in the same positions in the majority of log phase cells (90% or more). In another experiment, Fig. 5 (panels D–G) shows images of a single cell, which is visualized by Nomarski optics (panel D), DAPI staining (panel E), immunolocalization of the primase (panel F), and immunolocalization of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase β (panel G). It is clear that the two enzymes have distinctly different locations. The primase is situated above and below the disc (panel F), whereas the DNA polymerase β is situated in two protein complexes (as described previously; Ref. 9Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on opposite sides of the kinetoplast disc (panel G). Starting with a mitochondrial fraction from C. fasciculata, we have purified a DNA primase to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, and its active form is a single polypeptide chain. Assuming that the recovery of mitochondria used for purification was 100%, we can make a rough estimate that there are about 11,000 molecules of primase within the parasite's single mitochondrion. Using a poly(dT) template, the primase produces a ladder of homopolymeric products, with a maximum size of about 10 nucleotides. Using single-stranded M13 DNA as a template, the primase makes products in roughly the same size range (data not shown). However, due to sequence heterogeneity, the M13 products are not resolved into a uniform ladder by gel electrophoresis, a finding which implies that initiation on M13 occurs at multiple sites. The primase products can be efficiently elongated by Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of the appropriate dNTPs. However, when poly(dT) is used as a template, the only primers that are efficiently extended by Klenow polymerase are the 10-mers and, to a lesser extent, the 9-mers (see Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and4). Shorter oligonucleotides are not elongated efficiently by the DNA polymerase. A similar effect has been observed with mammalian primases (16Podust V.N. Vladimirova E.N. Manakova E.N. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A chase experiment, in which non-radioactive ATP was added after synthesis of primers with [α-32P]ATP, did not result in the shorter oligonucleotides being extended (data not shown). It is possible that many of the shorter oligonucleotides had dissociated from the dT template and therefore could not serve as intermediates in primer synthesis. In another experiment, we found that the primers were poorly extended by the C. fasciculata mitochondrial DNA polymerase β, a result not surprising given that that enzyme may not be the major replicative enzyme in this organelle (see below). Intracellular enzyme localization studies have been valuable in clarifying our understanding of kDNA replication. The C. fasciculata kinetoplast system is ideal for these studies because the non-replicating cell has only one kDNA network, which resides within its single mitochondrion. The network in vivo is condensed into a characteristic disc-shaped structure, about 1 μm in diameter and 0.4 μm thick, well within the resolution of fluorescence microscopy. Previous immunolocalization studies had demonstrated that a mitochondrial topoisomerase II (8Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a mitochondrial DNA polymerase β (9Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) co-localize within two protein complexes, which are situated in antipodal positions adjacent to the kinetoplast disc (see localization of DNA polymerase β in Fig. 5 G). Based on the presence of two enzymes involved in replication, and other evidence (9Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we had hypothesized that these two protein complexes are involved in minicircle replication. Another topoisomerase II (7Shlomai J. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 341-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as well as some histone-like DNA binding proteins (17Xu C.W. Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Russell D.G. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), localize within the kinetoplast disc. An hsp70 heat shock protein surrounds but does not appear to penetrate the kinetoplast disc (18Engman D.M. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Effron P.N. Torri A.F. Engman D.M. Donelson J.E. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now report that the primase has a distinct localization, being situated both above and below the kinetoplast disc. Little if any appears to flank the edge of the disc or is associated with the two complexes containing DNA polymerase β and topoisomerase II. We have not yet determined whether the primase covers the entire upper and lower surfaces of the kinetoplast disc or if it covers only part of these surfaces. We also do not know if the enzyme is completely excluded from the kinetoplast disc or if it penetrates the upper and lower regions of the disc. Studies at higher resolution, involving confocal fluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy, will be needed to address these issues. What is the significance of the primase localization to the mechanism of minicircle replication? A current view of this mechanism is shown in Fig. 6. The diagram shows a section through the kinetoplast disc, with interlocked minicircles forming a monolayer (see Ref. 3Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar for further information about this arrangement and about the replication scheme). Covalently closed minicircles are released from the central region of the network by a topoisomerase II, which is situated within the disc. Ultimately these free minicircles migrate to one of the two protein complexes (containing topoisomerase II and DNA polymerase β) that flank the kinetoplast disc. The newly replicated progeny minicircles, containing gaps, are attached to the network periphery adjacent to these protein complexes, in another topoisomerase reaction (20Pérez-Morga D. Englund P.T. Cell. 1993; 74: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The localization of the primase above and below the disc raises the possibility that replication may not actually occur within the antipodal protein complexes. Instead, minicircle replication could occur in the region above or below the kinetoplast disc. A replicative DNA polymerase in this location (not yet discovered but possibly related to DNA polymerase γ) could have the major responsibility for DNA synthesis. The minicircle progeny could then migrate to one of the two protein complexes where many of the gaps in the discontinuously synthesized strand could be repaired immediately prior to network attachment (21Kitchin P.A. Klein V.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3844-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase β is ideally situated to carry out this reaction, and it is known to have a preference for gap filling. The progeny minicircles could then be attached to the network periphery by topoisomerase II. In an alternative scheme, the covalently closed minicircle, immediately after release from the network, could associate with primase and other proteins to form a replication initiation complex. It could then migrate to one of the two antipodal protein complexes to complete its replication. Further studies, including the localization of additional replication enzymes, will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.

Expression of SP-B is essential for the surface tension lowering properties of pulmonary surfactant and for normal respiratory function. Absence or inactivation of SP-B in animal models results in respiratory distress and/or respiratory failure, and inherited deficiency of SP-B is a lethal disorder of infants (1Ballard P.L. J. Perinatol. 1996; 16: S28-34PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the SP-B gene is limited to the lung and is developmentally regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (2Ballard P.L. Ertsey R. Gonzales L.W. Gonzales J. Am. J.

Recent studies of the SP-B gene promoter have identified important roles for two transcription factors in the cell selective expression of the gene (4Bohinski R.J. Huffman J.A. Whitsett J.A.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a member of the NKx2n family of homeodomain transcription factors, binds to sites in both the proximal and more distal SP-B promoter and transactivates the promoter in vitro. TTF-1 also transactivates expression of two other surfactant protein genes, SP-A and SP-C (7Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol.

Consistent with its proposed roles in lung organogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation, expression of TTF-1 in developing lung has a temporal-spatial distribution pattern similar to that of SP-B and in adult lung is expressed only in type II cells and subsets of nonciliated bronchiolar (clara) cells (13Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The other known transcription factor affecting expression of the SP-B gene is hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3), which is a member of the forkhead winged helix family of transcription factors. HNF3 binds to the proximal region of the human SP-B promoter adjacent to the TTF-1 binding sites and enhances promoter activity (5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The HNF3 family, consisting of isoforms, α, β, and γ, also act as enhancers for the lung-specific CCSP gene (14Sawaya P.L.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 183-205Google Scholar). In liver and thyroid, respectively, HNF3 and TTF-1 have been implicated in the response of tissue-specific genes to hormones and other agents. Down-regulation of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase by insulin and phorbol ester localizes to the promoter region, which contains a HNF3 binding sequence (17Wang D.-P. Stroup D. Marrapodi M. Crestani M. Galli G. Chang J.Y.L. J.

In thyroid cells, down-regulation of thyroid-specific genes by thyrotropin, cAMP, v-Ras activation, interferon-γ, or phorbol ester is associated with a decrease in either TTF-1 content (19Saito T.

At present there is no information regarding the possible role of TTF-1 and/or HNF3 in hormonal modulation of lung-specific proteins. Development of the fetal lung, including synthesis of surfactant components, is regulated by a variety of hormones and other factors (23Ballard P.L. Endocrinol. Rev. 1989; 10: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Expression of the SP-B gene is increased by glucocorticoids and activators of cAMP and inhibited by transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, insulin, and phorbol ester (2Ballard P.L.

The mechanism of action of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on SP-B gene expression was initially examined in pulmonary adenocarcinoma NCI H441 cells, and evidence was obtained for post-transcriptional regulation mediated by cis-acting elements in the 3′-untranslated region (24Pryhuber G.S.

Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L16-L24PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found that TPA decreased the transcription rate of the SP-B gene in both H441 cells and fetal lung (29Planer B.C. Ning Y. Kumar A.S. Ballard P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a deletional study of the SP-B gene promoter localized TPA responsiveness to the proximal promoter region (30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar). This region (−140/+7 bp) of the promoter does not contain AP-1 sites which are known to mediate many effects of TPA through binding of the nuclear protooncogenes fos andjun. Since the TPA-responsive region of the promoter includes the binding sites for both TTF-1 and HNF3, which are known to activate SP-B gene transcription, we proposed that the inhibitory effects of phorbol ester were mediated through one or both of these transcription factors. In the present report we have further localized TPA responsiveness to the TTF-1 and HNF3 cis-acting elements of the SP-B promoter and demonstrate that TPA treatment causes a loss of both transcription factors from the nucleus and their accumulation in the cell cytoplasm. Preliminary results from this study have been reported in abstracts (31Kumar A.S. Venkatesh V.C. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: A359Google Scholar, 32Kumar A.S. Venkatesh V.C. Ballard P.L. Am.

Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The plasmid 6RL expressing lacZ under the RSV-LTR promoter-enhancer was used as control for transfection efficiency in experiments with plasmids containing CAT (38An G. Hidaka K. Siminovitch L. Mol.

A series of SP-B 5′-flanking sequences (−404/−35, −404/−255, −217/−141, −140/−65 and −217/−53) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification and confirmed by sequencing (Table I). These DNA fragments were linked to pOTCO. TTF-1, HNF3, and AP-2 oligonucleotides were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Coralville, IA) and were purified by Bio-Gel columns. Double-stranded (ds) TTF-1 oligonucleotides were designed with 5′ HindIII and 3′ SalI compatible ends, while HNF3 ds oligonucleotides were made with 5′ SalI and 3′XbaI compatible ends (Table I).

Open table in a new tab DNA fragments are numbered relative to the transcription start site and were linked to TK-CAT for transfection studies except for SP-B(−1039/+431) which contains the full length SP-B promoter linked to CAT (SP-B(−1039/+431)COΔn) as previously described. Longer SP-B DNA fragments were cloned by PCR, and TTF-1, HNF3, and AP-2 were synthesized as oligonucleotides. The NCI H441 and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and HeLa cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml). H441 cells were plated 1–2 days prior to treatment with combinations of dexamethasone (50 nm), TPA (0.1–30 nm), and 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mm) plus isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mm). For experiments involving dexamethasone plus TPA treatment, cells were induced first with dexamethasone (50 nm) for ∼24 h. In time course experiments cells were treated with TPA for different time periods (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h) prior to harvest. Test plasmid DNA (2.5 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of internal control plasmid 6RL and coprecipitated by the CaCl2 procedure (37Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Total DNA in each treatment, including vector alone, was kept constant at 5 μg with the addition of Bluescript plasmid. Coprecipitates were added directly to cells and incubated for 18–20 h at 37 °C. Subsequently cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum added, and incubation continued for 48–54 h. To test the effect of TPA on expression of different test plasmids, cells were grown in 10 nm TPA following transfection. Total protein, β-galactosidase, and CAT assays were determined in cells as described (30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for comparisons between different plasmid constituents in untreated cultures. Since TPA treatment increases the expression of β-galactosidase, comparisons of CAT activity in the presence and absence of TPA used non-normalized data. Total RNA was extracted from H441 cells grown in TPA + dexamethasone by the acidic phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate method (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and poly(A)+RNA was isolated using the PolyATtract® mRNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). Either 20 μg of total RNA or 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was used for Northern blot analysis. Contents of SP-B, TTF-1, HNF3, and β-actin mRNAs were determined by hybridizing at 42 °C with labeled cDNA probes. For dot blot hybridization analysis, serial dilutions of RNA were immobilized on membranes using a 96-well dot blot apparatus and hybridized as above. Blots were exposed to DuPont reflection film with intensifying screens for 1–4 days. The autoradiograms were scanned using a densitometer (Hoeffer GS300, Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) and relative densities calculated from the linear portions of the dose-response curve for each RNA sample. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells following the method of Dignamet al. (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, H441 cells (∼108) were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After 10 min on ice the lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was designated as the cytoplasmic fraction and was stored at −80 °C at 10 mg/ml. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min to obtain a purified nuclear pellet. Nuclear extract was isolated by resuspending the pellet in 25 μl of buffer B (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm each of leupeptin and pepstatin) with frequent vortexing for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifuging at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and extracts were stored at −80 °C as 1 μg/μl aliquots. A modified method of Hennighausen and Lubon (41Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was adopted to identify DNA-protein interactions. The end-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) was incubated with 2 μg of nuclear protein in a reaction mix with binding buffer (0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 6% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 20 min. For cytoplasmic EMSA experiments the same amount of probe was incubated with 20 μg of cytoplasmic protein with binding buffer. For supershift analysis, the probe and nuclear extract were incubated for 15 min on ice in a total volume of 25 μl and for an additional 15 min at 22 °C after addition of 1 μl of antibody (TTF-1, HNF3α, HNF3β, or HNF3γ, diluted 1:10 or 1:100) or preimmune antisera. For competitor analysis cold probes (1 ×, 10 ×, and 100 ×) were added along with labeled probe, nuclear extract, and binding buffer and incubated for 15 min on ice. Products were analyzed on low ionic strength gels (4.5 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 5.0% Long Ranger (FMI Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) with 0.25% glycerol and autoradiography performed. To quantitate the amount of probe in a retarded complex, the area on the gel with a retarded band was excised and counts/min determined in a scintillation counter. The 76- and 77-bp fragments of the SP-B gene 5′-flanking sequence corresponding to −140/−65 and −217/−141 bp upstream of the transcription start site and the commercially synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides designated TTF-1, HNF3, and AP-2 (Table I) were used as probes for EMSA. Mixtures of complementary oligonucleotides were heated initially to 95 °C for 5 min and were annealed by incubating serially at 65 °C, 37 °C, and on ice for 10 min each. 1–2 pmol of DNA or oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega Corp.) and purified using Sephadex G-50 columns. SouthWestern blot analysis was done following the modified method of Singh et al. (42Singh K. Dennis E.S. Ellis J.G. Llewellyn D.J. Tokuhisa J.G. Wahleithner J.A. Peacock W.J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 891-903PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were dialyzed at 4 °C in excess volume of dialysis buffer without glycerol for 6 h with two to three buffer changes. Twenty-five μg of protein of nuclear extracts were separated on 12% SDS (TTF-1 and AP-2) or 4.5–14% gradient native (HNF3) PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Duralose membrane as described (33Beers M.F. Wali A. Eckenhoff M.F. Feinstein S.I. Fisher J.H. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 3% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and denatured with serial dilutions (1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.18, 0.09 m) of guanidium chloride in HEPES, pH 7.0, buffer. Denatured membranes were blocked again for 30 min and incubated overnight with end-labeled TTF-1, HNF3, or AP2 ds oligonucleotides in binding buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Blots were washed and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screen for 4 to 5 days. H441 and HeLa cells were plated on 10-cm culture dishes at ∼30–35% confluence; after 1 day the cells were treated with 10 nm TPA for 24 h. Cells were fixed in methanol for 20 min at 20 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti-SP-B, -TTF-1, -HNF3α, or -HNF3β antibodies (1:500 dilution) or non-immune serum (1:250) overnight at 4 °C, followed by CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody treatment for 2 h at 22 °C. Stained cells were observed on an inverted microscope with a fluorescent light source and photographed. A cytoplasmic fraction was recovered from H441 cells, and 25 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Duralose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies to HNF3α, HNF3β (1:1000) and HNF3γ (1:500), and goat anti-rabbit IgG antisera conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). Immunoreactive products were detected on a x-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's directions (NEN Life Science Products). Bands were quantitated by scanning densitometer. In all experiments we included two to three replicates, and the experimental results were confirmed in two or more experiments. Data analysis was performed with Statview 512+ (Abacus Concepts, Calabasas, CA) and analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance, compared by Fisher Exact Test. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. except where otherwise noted. We have shown previously that treatment of transfected H441 cells with TPA inhibited the expression of CAT reporter gene driven by the SP-B gene promoter fragment −1039/+431 (30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar); similar responsiveness was found with lacZ as a reporter gene. 2B. C. Planer and P. L. Ballard, unpublished observations. Deletional studies using SP-B-CAT constructs localized TPA responsiveness to the proximal promoter (30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar), however, studies of TPA inhibition with further deletions of the 5′-flanking region were not possible because of low basal SP-B promoter activity. We therefore used the heterologous TK minimal promoter to test TPA responsiveness of linked SP-B DNA elements that did not contain the SP-B gene TATA box (−33/−30). To establish TPA responsiveness of SP-B DNA fragments linked to a heterologous promoter, we initially performed TPA dose-response studies. H441 cells were grown with different concentrations of TPA for 48 h after transfecting with SP-B(−1039/+431)CAT or with SP-B(−404/−35)TK-CAT. Inhibition was comparable with the two constructs; half-maximal inhibition occurred at ∼0.5 nm TPA, and CAT activity was 10% of control at 10 nm TPA (Fig.1 A). Cell specificity of the TPA response was examined in H441 and A549 cells, both derived from lung adenocarcinomas, and HeLa cells. After transfection with TK-CAT, TPA treatment (10 nm, 24 h) decreased CAT activity in H441 cells, increased activity in A549 cells, and had no effect in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B). Compared with these control results, transfection with plasmids containing the SP-B DNA fragment resulted in TPA inhibition of CAT activity in H441 and A549 cells but did not affect the activity in HeLa cells. These findings are consistent with the previous observation of lung cell line specificity of SP-B promoter activity (30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar) and localization of cell-specific enhancer elements in the proximal sequence (5Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 30Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar). To localize more precisely the region for TPA responsiveness, we transfected H441 cells with plasmids containing different fragments of SP-B proximal promoter, generated by polymerase chain reaction, linked to TK-CAT (Fig. 1 C). In these experiments TPA reduced the strength of TK promoter alone (TK-CAT) to ∼50% of control. In cel"

Dysregulation of IGF2 imprinting is commonly observed in Wilms' tumor and other human tumors. Previous work comparing promoter-specific imprinting of human and mouseIgf2 suggested the presence of a cis element upstream ofIgf2 that regulates or maintains the imprinting of three downstream promoters. To explore the molecular mechanism of maintenance of genomic imprinting, we targeted the region between insulin 2 andIgf2, where the cis imprint maintenance element (IME) resides in mouse fibroblasts. In those clones in which the targeting vector was randomly integrated into the genome, mouse Igf2remained imprinted. However, when the targeted region containing the IME was deleted by homologous recombination, whether from the paternal or maternal allele, activation of the imprinted maternal allele ofIgf2 was observed. In addition, there was a loss ofH19 imprinting when the IME was deleted. The requirement of IME from both parental alleles for the maintenance of genomic imprinting thus suggests the importance of a spatial structure of DNA around Igf2 and H19. Modifications in the IME, like abnormal methylation in Wilms' tumors, may represent a novel mechanism for loss of genomic imprinting.

Genomic imprinting refers to a process whereby there is unequal transcription of the two parental alleles. Approximately 20 mammalian genes are known to be imprinted, and 5 of them, insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2) 1The abbreviations used are: Igf2, insulin-like growth factor II; IME, imprint maintenance element; kb, kilobase pairs; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pairs.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3026-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), are aggregated on the distal end of chromosome 7 in mouse. Although Igf2 and H19 are contiguous genes, Igf2 is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele, whereas H19 is only expressed from the maternal allele. In mouse, these two genes are coordinately regulated (6Eversole-Cire P. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Surani M.A. Jones P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 337-345PubMed Google Scholar), with high expression in embryonic and neonatal tissues and decreased expression in adult tissues (7Liu J. Kahri A.I. Heikkila P. Ilvesmaki V. Voutilainen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 492-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We (8Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and others (9Ohlsson R. Hedborg F. Holmgren L. Walsh C. Ekstrom T.J. Development. 1994; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that the four promoters of human IGF2 show different patterns of imprinting, depending upon the tissues tested. The first promoter of human IGF2(hP1) is located just downstream of the insulin gene. Like insulin in the pancreas (4Giddings S.J. King C.D. Harman K.W. Flood J.F. Carnaghi L.R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and central nervous system (10Deltour L. Montagutelli X. Guenet J.L. Jami J. Paldi A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the IGF2transcripts from hP1 are derived from both parental chromosomes, showing no imprinting, in liver and chondrocytes. Three downstream promoters, hP2–hP4, on the other hand, are always imprinted. The differential imprinting of human IGF2 promoters thus suggests the presence of an imprint maintenance element (IME) between hP1 and the other three promoters (8Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Examination of promoter-specific imprinting of mouse Igf2 also lends support for the hypothesis that an IME lies upstream of three mouse promoters. MurineIgf2 contains three promoters (mP1–mP3) that are homologous to the three imprinted promoters (hP2–hP4) of human IGF2. As expected, all Igf2 transcripts from these three promoters are expressed mono-allelically in all tissues tested (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for central nervous system, where all three promoters drive Igf2expression from both parental alleles (1DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA methylation studies also suggest the presence of an IME in the area upstream of Igf2. Genomic imprinting requires the two parental alleles to be differentially marked for the appropriate expression pattern. Methylation at CpG dinucleotides within or near the imprinted genes is a promising candidate for this epigenetic marking. A short stretch of genomic DNA ∼3 kb upstream of mouse Igf2has been found to be differentially methylated between the two parental alleles (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamic changes in the methylation of CpG dinucleotides in this area parallel the establishment of genomic imprinting during development (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In cultured MatDi7 cells, acquired DNA methylation in the 5′ region of Igf2 is associated with reactivation of the maternal allele (6Eversole-Cire P. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Surani M.A. Jones P.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 337-345PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus proposed that differential methylation at these CpG sites may serve as an imprinting signal (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In mouse embryo mutants that are deficient in the DNA methyltransferase gene (dnmt), allelic expression of Igf2 is altered such that the normally expressed paternal allele is repressed (14Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), suggesting the requirement of DNA methylation for the normal imprinting of Igf2 in the early embryo. By using neonatal astrocytes as a model, however, we found that DNA demethylation induced by 5-azacytidine increases expression of Igf2 by releasing the repressed allele (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the role of DNA methylation in Igf2 imprinting depends upon the developmental stage. Deficiency in DNA methylation prior to resetting of the imprint will suppress expression of Igf2from the active allele, whereas DNA demethylation in cells derived from neonates will reactivate the imprinted allele, leading to loss of imprinting. When the wild-type dnmt was expressed indnmt-deficient ES cells, normal methylation and expression of those imprinted genes were not efficiently restored unless the cells passed through the germ line (16Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson G.L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, resetting and maintaining the imprint may represent two functionally separate processes that are regulated by different mechanisms, although both are associated with DNA methylation. It is interesting to note that the high frequency of abnormal imprinting of IGF2 in many human tumors, especially in Wilm's tumors (17Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 18Rainier S. Johnson L.A. Dobry C.J. Ping A.J. Grundy P.E. Feinberg A.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), is also related to the failure of maintaining the imprint. Therefore, we utilized cultured skin fibroblasts as a model to study those factors that are involved in the maintenance of Igf2imprinting. Because Igf2 imprinting in these fibroblasts has been established during embryonic life, this model will allow us to exclude those factors that participate in resetting of the imprint. In the knock-out mouse model, however, the targeting deletion occurs in stem cells, and therefore, this model may be more useful in studying those factors that participate in the development rather than the maintenance of the imprint. Using our fibroblast model, we demonstrate here that deletion of the IME by genomic targeting results in biallelic expression of both Igf2 and H19, suggesting that the loss and/or abnormal modification of IME, as in Wilm's tumor, may directly or indirectly involved in alterations of the imprint. The goal of this experiment was to use homologous recombination to delete a DNA fragment that covers threeHpaII sites that are differentially methylated between the parental alleles (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and thus may contain the cis element that is required for the maintenance of Igf2 imprinting. A 2.5-kbBamHI fragment (19Wentworth B.M. Schaefer I.M. Villa K.L. Chirgwin J.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), containing the coding region of mouse insulin 2 (kindly provided by Dr. Chirgwin), was ligated into theBamHI site of pNTK vector (20Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer L.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A 6-kb fragment ofHindIII-SphI DNA (Fig. 1), covering the first four exons of mouse Igf2 (21Rotwein P. Hall L.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Kou K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar), was derived from a 15-kb clone of mouse Igf2 (kindly provided by Dr. Holthuizen) and was ligated to HindIII-SphI sites of pCAT2 vector (23Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The 6-kb fragment of Igf2 DNA was then cut byHindIII-ClaI and was ligated into the pNTK in which 2.5-kb insulin DNA was introduced. Plasmid DNA of the targeting vector was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and was used for cell transfection by electroporation as below. Two mouse fibroblast cell lines that were prepared from newborn interspecific mice were used for genomic targeting. One fibroblast cell line (MSK02) was cultured from the skin of F1 interspecific mice derived from breeding M.musculus females with M. spretusmales. The other cultured fibroblast cell line (MSK10) was derived from skin of the informative backcross between F1 females and M.musculus males. Fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fresh skin was removed from newborn mice and minced with scissors into small pieces and centrifuged 5 min at 150 ×g. The tissue pellet was directly suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. When confluent, the cells were trypsinized and subcultured into fresh plates. From those plates, cells were collected for targeting. These two fibroblast cell lines contain a BsaAI polymorphism in exon 6 of Igf2 (Fig. 1), which allows each parental allele to be identified (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MSK02 cells derived from F1 mice expressed only the paternal M. spretus Igf2allele (that can be digested by BsaAI), whereas MSK10 cells, derived from backcross mice, exclusively expressed the paternalM. musculus allele, which cannot be digested byBsaAI. These two fibroblast cell lines maintained the genomic imprinting of Igf2 under these culture conditions for at least 16 passages (data not shown). We used the third passage of fibroblasts for this genomic targeting study. The targeting vector was linearized at a unique MluI site and then transfected into the two mouse fibroblast cell lines by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 220 V. The transfected cells were double-selected by G418 (200 μg/ml) and gancyclovir (100 μg/ml) 24 h after electroporation. Antibiotic-resistant cell clones were collected for DNA and RNA analysis. Total nucleic acids, prepared as described previously (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) from the cell clones, were directly screened by PCR using primers in the targeted region. The oligonucleotide primers used for screening targeting clones were as follows: number 3652 (5′-primer), CCCAGAACCTTGCTCATCTCTG; and number 3653 (3′-primer), ATCCACCAGCCTCTATCCCTGGCTT. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 20 s, for 30 cycles. The 3′-primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The end-labeled PCR products were digested by DraI, which identifies a unique polymorphism in M. spretus (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel to distinguish which parental allele was targeted. The parental allele that is targeted by homologous recombination was not amplified by the sensitive PCR assay. In those clones in which the targeting vector was integrated randomly into the genome, both parental alleles were equally amplified by PCR. These randomly integrated clones serve as vector controls for the genomic targeting of the IME. Maintenance of Igf2 imprinting in these randomly integrated clones, which grew in the same conditions as those targeted clones, strongly excludes the possibility that loss of imprinting ofIgf2 is induced by cell culturing. cDNA samples, prepared as described previously (8Vu T.H.

The 5′-primer (#3302) used in the PCR reaction was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The cDNAs were amplified for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. The amplified PCR products were diluted and digested with theBsaAI restriction enzyme for examining the allelic expression of Igf2 (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The allelic expression of H19 was assessed using PCR primers covering H19 exons 8 and 9 under the same PCR conditions as used for Igf2 imprinting. PCR primers were as follows: number 4025 (5′ primer), TAAGTCGATTGCACTGGTTTGGAGT; and number 4026 (3′ primer), TGATGGAACTGCTTCCAGACTAG. The 5′-primer (no. 4025) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. PCR DNAs were digested with FokI, a polymorphic site found only in M. spretus (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), to distinguish allelic expression ofH19. The promoter-specific RNA transcripts were amplified from cDNA samples by using each promoter-specific primer and a common γ-32P-end-labeled reverse primer (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for promoter amplification were as follows: 1) no. 1871 (mP1-specific 5′-primer), ACCGGGCATTGCCCCCAGTC(T)TCC; 2) no. 1872 (mP2-specific 5′-primer), CGTCGCACATTCGGCCC(T)CC(T)GCGACT; 3) no. 1873 (mP3-specific 5′-primer), TCCTCCTCC(T)TCCT(A)GCCCCAGCG; and no. 2384 (the common 3′-primer), TTGGAAGAACTTGCCCACGGGGTATC. The PCR conditions were the same as those used for allelic expression of Igf2, except for the longer extension time (72 °C for 1 min). For the dominant promoter, mP2, a single PCR was used to amplify the full-length cDNA. However, nested PCR was used to amplify the less-abundantly utilized promoters (mP1 and mP3). The amplified products (2.5 μl) were digested with 0.5 units of MboI, which specifically digests the M.spretus allele of H19 (24Villar A.J. Eddy E.M. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and then separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. The DNA fragment deleted between the mouse insulin 2 gene and Igf2 (Fig.1) contains a short stretch of CpG dinucleotide sequences, which are differentially methylated on each parental chromosome (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These CpG dinucleotides were assumed to function as an imprint maintenance element to guide the allelic expression of three downstream imprinted promoters. After double selection with G418 and ganciclovir (25Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), a total of 64 single resistant colonies were obtained. We then used the DraI polymorphism site (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which is located within the deleted region, to distinguish those clones that showed homologous recombination from those in which the targeting vector is randomly integrated into the genome (Fig. 2). In the homologously targeted clones, only one of the parental alleles is detected by the sensitive PCR method. The other parental allele in the targeted region is not amplified because it was deleted by genomic targeting (Fig.2 B, lanes 9–12). In those clones in which the vector was randomly integrated, however, the two intact parental alleles are amplified (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–8). Furthermore, by using thisDraI polymorphism, it is possible to distinguish which parental allele has been targeted. By screening all the resistant clones, we noted that all deletion-positive clones lost the M. musculusallele, whether it was paternally or maternally derived. None of the identified clones showed deletion of the M.spretus allele. This specificity was probably due to the fact that the targeted vector (Fig. 1) was constructed from a DNA fragment derived from M. musculus and is therefore identical to the M. musculus allele. As a result, the latter allele had a higher likelihood of being targeted by homologous recombination (25Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 26Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). The M. spretus allele contains several known and potentially many other unknown polymorphisms in the targeted region (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2J.-F. Hu, T. H. Vu, and A. R. Hoffman, unpublished data. and it thus was much less likely to be targeted. The influence of deletion of the IME on genomic imprinting of Igf2 (Fig.3) was examined in fibroblast clones by methods described elsewhere (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As predicted, both MSK02 and MSK10 cells collected prior to genomic targeting showed absolute mono-allelic expression of Igf2 (Fig. 3, A andB, lane 4), with a typical maternal imprinting pattern (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating that the imprinting trait has been faithfully maintained in these fibroblasts. The cells that contained the targeted vector by random integration into the genome also expressed only the paternal allele (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8 and Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–7), indicating that DNA integration of the targeting vector into random sites of the mouse genome does not interfere with the regulation of Igf2imprinting. In those cells in which the IME was deleted by homologous recombination, however, the Igf2 maternal allele, which was originally suppressed, became expressed at variable levels (Fig.3 A, lanes 9 and 10 and Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–11). Biallelic expression of Igf2 was observed in cells in which the IME had been deleted from the maternal chromosome (Fig. 3 A) as well as from the paternal chromosome (Fig.3 B). As a result, all targeted clones showed loss of genomic imprinting, expressing Igf2 from both parental alleles. We then asked whether all threeIgf2 downstream promoters exhibited absence of imprinting after targeted deletion of the IME. Full-length RNA transcripts of eachIgf2 promoter were amplified with PCR using promoter-specific primer sets (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and were then subjected toMboI digestion (24Villar A.J. Eddy E.M. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), allowing each parental allele to be distinguished (Fig. 4 A). In MSK02 cells, Igf2 promoter mP2 was the predominant promoter; similar results have previously been observed in astrocytes (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in the F1 generation skin (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from which MSK02 was cultured. After digestion with MboI, the clones that were targeted by homologous recombination showed biallelic expression ofIgf2. As expected, there was a maintenance ofIgf2 imprinting from each of the three promoters in those clones that exhibited random integration of the targeting vector in the genome (Fig. 4 B). As compared with mP2, the other two promoters (mP1 and mP3) of Igf2 were less abundantly expressed. In cells targeted by homologous recombination,Igf2 was biallelically expressed from each of the three promoters. Thus, genomic imprinting from each of the three downstream promoters of Igf2 was lost when the upstream IME was deleted. We were curious whether the deletion of the Igf2 IME would affect the local DNA structure and thus influence the imprinting of H19. The cDNA samples were amplified by PCR using the same PCR conditions as used for Igf2 and were subjected to digestion byFokI, which identifies a unique polymorphic site in M. spretus H19 (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5,H19 also showed loss of genomic imprinting when the IME was deleted in MSK02 fibroblasts (lanes 9 and 10). In those clones with random integration of the targeting vector,H19 was monoallelically expressed from the maternal allele (lanes 5–8), indicating the maintenance of genomic imprinting. Similar results were also seen in targeted MSK10 fibroblast clones, although the expression levels of H19 were very low (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that although the IME is located upstream of Igf2, it may also participate in the distal regulation of H19 genomic imprinting. Using genomic targeting, we have demonstrated that deletion of an IME located upstream of Igf2 interferes with the maintenance of imprinting of both Igf2 and H19. All threeIgf2 promoters showed the loss of genomic imprinting in the targeted cell clones. In those clones in which the targeting vector was integrated into the genome in a random fashion, there was a normal imprinting pattern identical to that seen in normal control fibroblasts. These results suggest that the IME is essential for the maintenance of normal imprinting of the downstream Igf2gene. Loss of genomic imprinting of all Igf2 promoters is also seen in mouse central nervous system (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Wilms' tumors (27Vu T.H. Hoffman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9014-9023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and rhabdomyosarcoma (28Zhan S. Shapiro D. Zhan S. Zhang L. Hirschfeld S. Elassal J. Helman L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), where all imprinted promoters ofIgf2 (mP1–mP3 in mouse and hP2-hP4 in human) become biallelically expressed. Thus, loss of the IME as was achieved by targeted deletion in this study or abnormal modification of the IME, such as changes in DNA methylation, may represent a mechanism for the dysregulation of genomic imprinting of IGF2 seen in Wilms' tumor (17Ogawa O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9014-9023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and many other human tumors (29Zhan S. Shapiro D.N. Helman L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Yballe C.M. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA methylation has been suggested to be an important molecular mechanism for initiating and/or maintaining genomic imprinting. Parental DNA ∼3 kb upstream of Igf2 mP1 is differentially methylated, with hypermethylation observed in the expressed paternal DNA and hypomethylation in the imprinted maternal DNA (12Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Rasin A. Ceder H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of Igf2 expression during passage of cells was paralleled by the demethylation of the 5′ region of Igf2(31Szabo P. Mann J.R. Development. 1994; 120: 1651-1660PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryos that lack DNA methyltransferase activity by homologous targeting (14Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar) were found to have abnormal imprinting. The paternal allele of the IGF2 gene, which is normally expressed, became transcriptionally silent due to the global demethylation of the genome because of the deleted DNA methyltransferase. In both human and mouse astrocyte cells, DNA demethylation induced by treatment with 5-azacytidine and 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine, two potent DNA methylation inhibitors, also modulated the allelic expression of Igf2 (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leading to biallelic Igf2 expression. H19 is located downstream of Igf2. However, as opposed toIgf2, only the maternal allele of H19 is usually transcribed. When the region of chromosome 7 containing H19and its enhancers is deleted by homologous recombination, there was an increase in expression and loss of genomic imprinting ofIgf2 (32Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), suggesting the requirement of a spatial structure of genomic DNA around Igf2 and H19. It was hypothesized that both H19 and Igf2 may compete for two shared enhancers (33Bartolomei M.S. Webber A.L. Brunkow M.E. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Due to the paternal imprinting, untreated MSK02 cells as well as those clones that had the randomly integrated vector exclusively expressed the M. musculusallele. Two MSK02 clones that underwent homologous recombination, however, showed biallelic expression of H19. In four targeted MSK10 clones, which were cultured from backcross mice,H19 was transcribed at very low levels. However, using nested PCR (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were still able to observe either loss of imprinting or allelic switching in some clones (data not shown). Our interspecific cell culture provides a unique system for studying genomic imprinting. Although it would be interesting to replicate our data in an in vivo model, this fibroblast model provides different information from a knock-out mouse. In our model, the deletion of the IME occurs after the imprinting pattern has already been established and maintained through numerous cell passages, whereas in a traditional knock-out mouse, the targeting deletion occurs before the establishment of genomic imprinting. Thus, our model allows us to examine those factors that are involved in the maintenance ofIgf2 imprinting which was established during embryonic life. Various factors may play ontogenetically different roles in controlling the allelic expression of imprinted genes, some regulating genomic imprinting at an early stage of embryogenesis, while others control allelic expression exclusively later in life. It has been reported that in cultured cells, normally imprinted genes often become biallelically expressed after multiple passages due to growth pressure. However, we have kept our cells in low passages for the targeting, and we found that Igf2 imprinting was maintained in our cultured cells, as shown in those randomly integrated cell clones and non-targeted control fibroblasts which grew in parallel with the experimental fibroblasts (Fig. 3). It is also interesting to note that in the H19 knock-out study (32Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) the neomycin resistance gene (neo), when placed in the position ofH19, adopted the maternal expression pattern ofH19. In our study, however, we did not observe the adopted expression of the neo gene because as a selective marker,neo was always expressed, regardless of its paternal or maternal position in targeting. Neither did we see the effect of the inserted neo on the relative expression of the downstreamIgf2 promoters. As previously reported in astrocytes (15Hu J.-F. Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18253-18262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in F1 skin (11Hu J. Vu T. Hoffman A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the three Igf2 promoters (mP1–mP3) are differentially transcribed (Fig. 4), with the majority ofIgf2 mRNA transcripts originating from mP2. It should be emphasized that after targeting, those clones undergoing homologous recombination still maintained the same pattern of promoter usage as those randomly integrated or normal control clones, whereIgf2 promoter (mP2) was dominantly transcribed, and the first promoter (mP1), which is located immediately downstream ofneo, was utilized at very low level. This finding suggests that neo did not artifactually induce the transcription of genes downstream from its insertion. It is not obvious how the IME, which is located upstream ofIgf2, can affect the genomic imprinting of H19which is ∼100 kb distant from Igf2. Experiments in knock-out mice have demonstrated that parental deletion ofH19 and two H19 enhancers dramatically affect the allelic expression of both Igf2 and H19 (32Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, loss of Igf2 imprinting in these mice could not be rescued by introducing the transgene containing H19 andH19 enhancers (34Pfeifer K. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13876-13883Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the intact chromosomal structure around Igf2 and H19 is crucial for the regulation of Igf2 and H19imprinting. One possible explanation for this phenomenon may be thatIgf2 and H19 are organized in separate topological domains (35Banerjee S. Smallwood A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 237-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that are anchored together in specific regions via interactions between trans factors andcis-regulating elements. IME may be one of the cis-anchoring elements. Imprinting factor(s), when binding to the IME, may also interact with other trans factors, like enhancer-binding factors and transcription factors, thus twisting together the chromatin domains where Igf2 and H19 reside. As in the “kiss” model (36LaSalle J.M. Lalande M. Science. 1996; 272: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it may be possible that both parental alleles join together by interacting with these trans factors and create a spatial structure that is required for the proper regulation of genomic imprinting. With this chromatin structure, genomic imprinting of Igf2 andH19 can be tightly regulated by trans factors, depending upon the methylation status of IME and other cis elements. Deletion of either parental IME or alterations in DNA methylation in the IME or in the promoter region of H19, as seen in Wilms' tumors (37Moulton T. Crenshaw T. Hao Y. Moosikasuwan J. Lin N.

Under these conditions, the activity of the B site binding factor (Bbf), 1The abbreviations used are: Bbf, B box-binding factor; ATF, activating transcription factor; BMV, tobacco mosaic virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; H, heavy; L, light; PKA, protein kinase A. 1The abbreviations used are: Bbf, B box-binding factor; ATF, activating transcription factor; BMV, tobacco mosaic virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; H, heavy; L, light; PKA, protein kinase A. assayed by transient transfection with target promoter or by DNA binding assays, specifically increases in the nucleus. Here we show that Bbf, a protein of approximately 120 kDa, is required for cAMP induction of the ferritin promoter. Bbf does not bind the consensus CRE sequence and does not react with antibodiesversus CREB or ATF1. Furthermore, Bbf binds in vivo the transcriptional adaptors CBP and p300. The product of adenovirus E1A specifically competes the formation of the p300-Bbf complex. Transient or stable expression of E1A inhibits the transcription driven from the ferritin promoter. In the same cells, overexpression of p300 completely reverses E1A inhibition of ferritin transcription. We propose that Bbf mediates cAMP induction of ferritin promoter and that the mechanism of transcriptional repression of the H ferritin gene by E1A is caused by the competition of E1A with Bbf for p300 binding, resulting in the disruption of the active transcriptional complex on the ferritin promoter. HeLa cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/liter penicillin (Hyclone). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The H promoter/CAT constructs 5′-H A/M, 5′-H H/A, and 5′-H H/M have been previously described (12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Bbf-TATAA construct contains a double-stranded B-site oligonucleotide (5′-CGGCGCTGATTGGCCGGG-GCGGGC-3′), in the correct 5′ to 3′ orientation, cloned in the SmaI site of the 5′-H H/M construct upstream the ferritin TATAA box. The Bbfmut-TATAA construct was obtained by inserting a mutated B-site oligonucleotide (5′-CGGCTCTTACAGGCCGTTGCGAGC-3′), in the correct 5′ to 3′ orientation, in the SmaI site of the 5′-H H/M construct. The pSVEK and pSVEKmut are expression vectors carrying PKA-specific inhibitor tagged with a nuclear localization signal under the control of SV40 promoter. 2A. Porcellini, unpublished results. The CRE-CAT construct was a gift of Dr. P. Sassone-Corsi (13Sassone Corsi P. Visvader J. Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For each experiment, 5 pmol of plasmid DNA were transfected into cultured HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (14Graham F. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). To correct for variations in DNA uptake and transfection efficiency, 5 μg of a plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer were included. For the cAMP treatment, 10−6m 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (Sigma) was added directly for the indicated times. CAT and luciferase assays were performed as described (4Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. De Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). The values reported in the figures are the mean of three independent transfection experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells as previously described (4Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were: CTF-site 5′-TTATTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA- 3; CRE-site 5′-GTTCCGCCCAGT-GACGTAGGAAGTC-3′. To study DNA-protein interaction on the B-site, the −100 to +1 region from the human H promoter, terminally labeled, was used. EMSAs and competition assays were performed as described previously (9Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. D'Agostino P. Quaresima B. Tiano M.T. Pignata S. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anti-CREB antibody (Santa Cruz, X-12) was assayed as supershifting reagent; the antibody was added to the nuclear extract and incubated for 1 h on ice before the addition of the labeled probes. 0.5 ng of terminally labeled B-site oligo (5′-CGGCGCTGATTGGCCGGGGCGGGC-3′) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl, with 25 or 50 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence of 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were UV irradiated for 2 min at a wavelength of 254 nm and then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The retarded bands corresponding to the DNA-protein complexes were excised from the gel and loaded on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (16Raychaudhuri P. Rooney R. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations, deoxycholate elutions, and gel retardation assays were performed as described in Ref. 17Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly, 300 μg of HeLa whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-p300 (05–222 UBI) antibody or with non-immune antisera for 1 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1 mg/ml leupeptine, 1 mg/ml aprotinin. The samples were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with the incubation buffer, and finally incubated 20 min on ice with 10 μl of incubation buffer, 1% deoxycholate. Immunoprecipitates were collected and assayed by EMSA with the radioactive probes. Alternatively, whole cell extracts from wild type HeLa cells were mixed with recombinant E1A protein or with recombinant BMV (tobacco mosaic virus, TNT Promega) protein 30 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-p300 antibodies. cAMP stimulates the transcription of H ferritin gene (3Colucci D'Amato L.G.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 666-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the promoter elements responsive to cAMP, we used several plasmid fusions carrying segments of ferritin promoter upstream the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) (12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 5′-H A/M construct (−160 to +1) contains the positive cis-elements A and B necessary for the expression of H ferritin in vivo. The A element is the target for the transcription factor Sp1, while the B element is recognized by a nuclear protein, which we named Bbf. The 5′-H H/A construct (−100 to +1) retains only the B element; the 5′-H H/M construct contains only the TATAA box and the start of transcription of the H gene (−50 to +1). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with these plasmids and stimulated with cAMP. CAT activity was measured and normalized for the transfection efficiency by including in each transfection the luciferase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-Luc). Fig.1 (panel A) shows that the segment of the promoter between −100 and −50 from the transcription start site was essential for cAMP-induced transcription. The presence of the Sp1 site in the 5′-H A/M construct increased the basal activity of the promoter (4Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and partly masked the cAMP-induced transcription. Deletion of the −100 to −50 region inhibited significantly both the basal and cAMP induced transcription of the ferritin promoter. The region −100 to −50 contains the B site, which by footprint and EMSA appears to bind only the Bbf complex. To determine if this site is responsible for cAMP induction of ferritin promoter, we synthesized a 20-base pair oligonucleotide spanning the wild-type Bbf binding sequence and an equivalent mutated version of this site, and fused these oligonucleotides to the minimal promoter element 5′-H H/M. Note that the mutated version of the oligonucleotide, tested by EMSA, did not bind Bbf (data not shown). The resulting constructs have been named Bbf-TATAA and Bbfmut-TATAA, respectively. Panel A of Fig. 1 shows that the B oligonucleotide fused to the ferritin TATAA box transactivates the basal transcriptional activity of the resulting construct (compare the activities of constructs 5′-H H/A, 5′-H H/M, and Bbf-TATAA) and confers induction of transcription by cAMP. The Bbfmut-TATAA construct shows a basal activity comparable to that given by the TATAA box only and does not respond to cAMP stimulation. Time course of the cAMP-induced transcription in cells expressing the −100/+1 promoter indicated that the maximal response was achieved within 1–2 h of continuous stimulation with cAMP (Fig. 1, panel B). The specificity of cAMP-induced transcription was tested by including in the transfection mixture a plasmid expressing the PKA-specific inhibitor tagged with a nuclear localization signal derived from SV40 LT antigen (pSVEK). cAMP-induced CAT expression driven by the ferritin promoter was completely inhibited by PKA-specific inhibitor, but not by its mutated version (pSVEKmut) (Fig. 1, panel C). As positive control a CAT fusion driven by the CRE element derived from the somatostatin promoter was included (Fig. 1, panel C). The kinetics of induction of CAT activity was very similar to that of ferritin mRNA accumulation stimulated in vivo by cAMP (data not shown). These data indicate that the region of ferritin promoter between −100 to −50, where Bbf binds, contains the sequence element responsible for cAMP induction of transcription. Inspection of the DNA sequence in the −100 to −50 region of ferritin promoter did not indicate the presence of a classical or spurious CRE site or a palindrome resembling the target of ATF/CREB family (for review, see Ref. 18Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting analysis of this region with nuclear extracts from different cell types (4Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a single cis-element (B box) was recognized by the transcription factor Bbf. We determined the specificity of Bbf binding to its DNA element in cells stimulated with cAMP. Panel A of Fig.2 shows that Bbf binding was not stimulated by cAMP and was not competed by a canonical CRE oligonucleotide. We have also analyzed the DNA-protein complexes at the CRE and Bbf sites in the presence of anti-CREB or anti-ATF1 antibodies. Bbf binding was not affected by the inclusion of the antibody (CREB) in the binding reaction; under the same conditions CRE-binding complexes were supershifted by the specific CREB antibody (Fig. 2, panel B). The same results have been obtained with an anti-ATF1 antibody (data not shown). To identify more precisely Bbf, we cross-linked protein-DNA complexes to labeled B oligonucleotide and visualized the labeled band by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, panel C). A single specific band of approximately 120 kDa was detected. This band was specifically removed by excess of specific unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, panel C, and data not shown). Recently, it has been shown that the nuclear proteins CBP and p300 interact with CREB to mediate cAMP induction of transcription. CBP and p300 are highly homologous (92%) and are thought to target CREB and other trans-acting factors to RNA polymerase initiation complex, by binding TFIIB (19Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We have explored the possibility that Bbf might use the same mechanism. To this end, we have immunoprecipitated HeLa total proteins with specific anti-p300 antibodies, eluted the immunoprecipitated proteins with deoxycholate, and analyzed the presence of Bbf by EMSA.Panel A of Fig. 3 shows that Bbf is present in the p300 immunocomplexes; CREB also was in the same immunocomplexes (Fig. 3, panel B). We have tested whether other transacting factors, such as CTF1 (Fig. 3, panel C) or NFκB (not shown), were also forming complexes with p300. The results indicate that neither of the aforementioned factors interacted with p300. Since cAMP does not stimulate the binding of BBf to the promoter, we have tested whether BBF binding to p300 was stimulated by cAMP. Fig.3, panel D, shows that the binding of BBF1 to p300 is markedly stimulated in cAMP-treated extracts. At present we cannot determine if the phosphorylation of p300, BBF1, or both stimulates the formation of the complex. p300 is highly homologous to the protein CBP in the CREB-binding region (19Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It is possible that Bbf could react with CBP as well. We have immunoprecipitated the HeLa whole cell extracts with specific anti-CBP antibody, and tested for the presence of Bbf. Similarly to p300, CBP immunoprecipitates contained Bbf (data not shown). These data indicate that Bbf interacts with p300 and CBP in vivo. p300 has been isolated as E1A binding nuclear protein (20Bandara L.R. La Thangue N.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Since E1A represses ferritin transcription (11Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether E1A competed with the formation of Bbf-p300 complex. To this end, total extracts from HeLa cells were mixed with recombinant E1A protein prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-p300 antibodies. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed for Bbf binding activity by EMSA, as described above. Bbf-DNA retarded complex was inhibited when recombinant E1A was added to the extracts (Fig.4). This inhibition was specific for E1A protein, since another recombinant protein (BMV) did not significantly reduce Bbf concentration in the p300 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). This result indicates that E1A competes with Bbf for the binding to p300. The mechanism of the E1A inhibition of ferritin transcription might be caused by competition of E1A with Bbf for p300 binding, as suggested by Fig. 4. To explore this possibility, we transiently expressed E1A carrying plasmids (12 S and 13 S) in several cell lines (HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary, and thyroid cells) with the −100/+1 ferritin-CAT construct (5′-H/HA). Fig. 5 shows that the transcription of the CAT gene, driven by the ferritin promoter, is markedly inhibited by coexpression of E1A gene. Bbf appears to be the target of E1A repression, since the minimal ferritin promoter construct (5′-H H/M) is not affected by E1A expression. Transient transfection of a p300-expressing plasmid in normal or in cAMP-treated HeLa cells slightly stimulated ferritin/CAT expression. Conversely, when p300 was co-transfected with E1A, the ferritin/CAT expression was restored at normal levels. Under the same conditions, p300 expression completely reversed the E1A inhibition of CAT transcription driven by CRE promoter (data not shown). The same results have been obtained with cells stably expressing E1A or transformed by adenovirus (data not shown). These data suggest that E1A reduces ferritin transcription by titrating p300 and inhibiting the assembly of productive p300 complexes with Bbf. Expression of ferritin is controlled by intracellular (such as iron) and by extracellular (hormones, growth factors) signals (2Aziz N. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8478-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 3Colucci D'Amato L.G. Ursini M.V. Colletta G. Cirafici A.M. De Franciscis V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The expression of the protein is controlled at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of the stimuli and the mechanisms governing the expression of the gene explain the variety of ferritin phenotypes exploited by the cell under different conditions. H ferritin mRNA levels and transcription of the gene in vivo are stimulated by cAMP (3Colucci D'Amato L.G. Ursini M.V. Colletta G. Cirafici A.M. De Franciscis V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. J. Biol.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 91-95PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of the primary target sequences responsive to cAMP signaling in the H ferritin promoter has not been carried out extensively. The human H ferritin promoter is a compact element, where the basic and the upstream control elements are contained in about 170 nucleotides upstream the transcription start site (12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the mouse promoter it has been also described as an enhancer element located at −4.1 kilobases from the start of transcription (23Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Yusaku N. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have restricted our analysis to the main promoter element, previously mapped by mutagenesis (12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two sites have been mapped in this region, recognized by Sp1 (at −132) and Bbf (at −62), respectively. Bbf is a factor not yet cloned, which by competition analysis and size does not appear to be a known nuclear transacting protein (4Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Russo T. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Bevilacqua M.A. Giordano M. D'Agostino P. Santoro C. Cimino F. Costanzo F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The deletion of the element recognized by Bbf completely abolishes both the basal and the cAMP-induced transcription driven by the ferritin promoter. Moreover, fusion of a B-site oligonucleotide to the ferritin minimal promoter element confers cAMP stimulation of transcription. Bbf does not seem to be a CREB or ATF1 factor, since it is not competed by the specific oligonucleotides and its binding is not affected by anti-ATF1 or anti-CREB antibodies (Fig. 2). Note that we have used anti-CREB antibodies which recognize the KID domain, a common structural motif present in all members of the CREB family (18Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, Bbf shows all the functional properties of a CREB protein (Fig. 2): its binding is not sensitive to cAMP (Fig. 2), it is phosphorylated (data not shown), and it binds the nuclear adaptor molecules, CBP and p300 (Fig. 3). Definite answer to the question of Bbf identity has to await the molecular cloning of the protein. We have noted that a sequence similar to the Bbf-binding site (5′-CGGCGCTGATTGGCCGGGGCGGGC-3′) is present in the promoter of the human tryptophan hydroxylase gene and in the promoter of the rat fatty acid synthase gene. This sequence has been shown to be the target of cAMP induced transcription (24Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Rangan V.S. Oskouian B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We suggest that this DNA element identify a new class of transacting factor(s) which mediate(s) cAMP-induction of transcription. p300 and CBP are two high molecular weight proteins, resident in the nucleus, which have an intrinsic transcription activation function (26Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). They bind TFIIB (19Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), as well as other transacting factors, such as CREB, Jun, and YY1 (27Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 28Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The interaction with CREB and Jun is facilitated by phosphorylation of these proteins (19Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 30Nordheim A. Nature. 1994; 370: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have shown that also Bbf interacts in vivo with p300 and CBP (Fig. 3). We suggest that p300 and CBP function as molecular adaptors which bring together Bbf and the RNA polymerase transcription initiation complex. Since the DNA binding of Bbf is not stimulated by cAMP or by treatment with okadaic acid (data not shown), we suggest that Bbf is permanently located on the DNA and that cAMP signaling stimulates the assembly of the complex Bbf-p300. This is consistent with our finding (Fig. 3, panel D) that BBF-p300 complex is stimulated by cAMP. Preliminary data indicate that both p300 and Bbf are phosphorylated by PKA. At present we cannot determine whether cAMP phosphorylation of Bbf directly stimulates the formation of the complex. Ferritin composition is altered in some tumors (31Bomford A.B. Munro H.N. Pathobiology. 1992; 60: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Alpert M.E. Coston R.L. Drysdale J.W. Nature. 1973; 242: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the ferritin phenotypes remains unknown. Adenovirus E1A expression in mouse cells induces preferential down-regulation of H ferritin transcription and results in the production of ferritin molecules with altered H-L ratio (11Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Yusaku N. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data we have shown indicate that E1A protein reduces the formation of p300-Bbf complex in vitro (Fig. 4). This reduction parallels the inhibition of transcription in vivoby E1A (Fig. 5). Overexpression of p300 completely reverses the transcription block and restores ferritin expression (Fig. 5). In our conditions, we did not detect any significant stimulation of ferritin promoter, at variance with the CREB-mediated activation shown by others (26Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Note, that in the latter cases CREB was overexpressed (26Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R.

E1A expression possibly titrates p300 and reduces the formation of the active complex; under these conditions, expression of exogenous p300 shifts the equilibrium from E1A-p300 to Bbf-p300 and reactivates ferritin transcription. At present we do not know if cAMP might alter the equilibrium between these complexes. We have evidence that ferritin transcription is not efficiently induced by cAMP in the presence of E1A. It is likely that the equilibrium between p300/Bbf and p300/E1A depends on the relative concentrations of active Bbf and E1A proteins. Recently, it has been reported that an enhancer element, found at −4.1 kilobase from the start of transcription of the mouse H ferritin gene, is the target of E1A that mediates the repression of ferritin transcription (23Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Yusaku N. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This sequence element located far upstream from the promoter, relative to the region target of Bbf, contains an AP1-like site. This site probably positively controls the ferritin transcription induced by other extracellular stimuli. At this site we predict p300 or CBP to play an essential role, since they can form complexes with Jun and other components of the AP1 complex (28Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). E1A expression in principle should disrupt both AP1 and Bbf complexes, resulting in the complete inhibition of ferritin transcription. We propose that the −4.1 kilobase enhancer is sensitive to signal-targeted transcriptional activators (30Nordheim A. Nature. 1994; 370: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), while the Bbf site is induced by cAMP signaling. The interplay between cAMP and tyrosine kinases signals in vivo regulates the transcription of H ferritin gene."

This study reports on the localization of the binding site of P-glycoprotein for iodomycin, the Bolton-Hunter derivative of the anthracycline daunomycin. Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary B30 cells were photolabeled with [125I]iodomycin. After chemical cleavage behind the tryptophan residues, 125I-labeled peptides were separated by electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. Edman sequencing revealed that [125I]iodomycin had been predominantly incorporated into the fragment 230–312 of isoform I of hamster P-glycoprotein. According to models based on hydropathy plots, the amino acid sequence 230–312 forms the distal part of transmembrane segment 4, the second cytoplasmic loop, and the proximal part of transmembrane segment 5 in the N-terminal half of P-glycoprotein.

Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Riordan J.R. Cano-Gauci D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Iodomycin binds to P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane vesicles and intact cells with an affinity of 107 to 108m−1 (39Busche R. Tümmler B. Cano-Gauci D.F. Riordan J.R. Eur. J.

Tümmler B. Riordan J.R. Cano-Gauci D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar). Since the photoreaction is several orders of magnitude slower than the formation of the non-covalent drug-protein complex, the thermodynamic affinity constant determines the concentration-dependent yield of photoincorporation of iodomycin into protein and the competitive reduction of photobinding of radioactive [125I]iodomycin by increasing concentrations of non-radioactive anthracycline (39Busche R. Tümmler B. Cano-Gauci D.F. Riordan J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Vinblastine and cyclosporin compete strongly with iodomycin for its photobinding site in P-glycoprotein, whereas colchicine and nifedipine are poor inhibitors of the photobinding (27Busche R. Tümmler B. Riordan J.R. Cano-Gauci D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 414-421PubMed Google Scholar).

Photolabeled P-glycoprotein was cleaved behind its tryptophan residues with BNPS-skatol (40Crimmins D.L. Mc Court D.W. Thoma R.S. Scott M.G. Macke K. Schwartz B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the resulting peptides were purified by electrophoresis and HPLC. Edman sequencing revealed that the binding site for iodomycin resides in a region in the N-terminal half of the protein that is distinct from the binding site described for [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin (37Zhang X. Collins K.I. Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5441-5448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis study reports on the localization of the binding site for iodomycin in hamster P-glycoprotein. Chemical cleavage of iodomycin-photolabeled P-glycoprotein behind the tryptophan residues revealed that the drug had been predominantly incorporated into the pgp1 fragment 230–312. According to the topology predicted by hydropathy plots (18Gros P. Ben Neriah Y. Croop J.M. Housman D.E. Nature. 1986; 323: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 19Juranka P.F.

Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) this amino acid sequence 230–312 forms the distal part of TM4, the second cytoplasmic loop, and the proximal part of TM5 in the N-terminal half of P-glycoprotein (Fig. 8).To identify a drug photobinding site in P-glycoprotein, the tools and methodology had to be carefully selected and optimized, i.e.the requirements were a photoreactive substrate for P-glycoprotein of high specific activity, a cellular source of high P-glycoprotein contents, a site-specific reagent that reliably cleaves membrane proteins without blockage of the N terminus, and a purification procedure that separates hydrophobic peptides and has been minimized for loss of photoproduct and contamination by compounds that could affect protein sequencing. Our current protocol is considered to fulfill these criteria. Iodomycin photolabels P-glycoprotein in cells and plasma membrane vesicles with high sensitivity and specificity. The overexpression of P-glycoprotein in CHO B30 cells was instrumental to photolabeling P-glycoprotein in sufficient amounts so that125I-photoproducts were detectable by radioimaging throughout the whole purification procedure. Enzymatic and chemical means were tested for cleavage of purified P-glycoprotein and crude membrane vesicles. Enzymatic proteolysis was found to be disadvantageous because the self-digestion of enzyme contaminated the sample and impeded purification and sequencing of target peptide. In contrast, site-specific cleavage behind tryptophan with BNPS-skatol enabled low background Edman sequencing of the purified125I-labeled skatol fragment. Its N-terminal sequence enabled us to discriminate between hamster pgp isoforms and to identify pgp1 as the photobinding acceptor of iodomycin. In summary, peptide identification by Edman analysis was chosen because the method yields unequivocal data on the localization of the binding site in the primary sequence.Apart from iodomycin, some other photoreactive compounds have already been used for the photoaffinity labeling of drug binding sites in P-glycoprotein. Azidopine and the photoreactive derivatives of prazosin and forskolin label both halves of P-glycoprotein (34Bruggemann E.P. Currier S.J. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol.

[3H]Azidopine, [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin, and probably also 125I-AIPP-forskolin bind to a common domain in P-glycoprotein (29Greenberger L.M. Yang C.-P.H. Gindin E. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal half of P-glycoprotein could be more clearly discerned in studies on MDR1 (class I)/MDR3 (class III) chimera (37Zhang X. Collins K.I. Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5441-5448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TM 12 and the loop connecting TM 11 and TM 12 were found to contain determinants for substrate specificity and photobinding of [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin. The distinct localization of photobinding sites for prazosin and iodomycin may reflect different reaction pathways of photolabeling (50Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Striessnig J. Goll A. Moosburger K.

Sci. 1987; 8: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and/or the presence of more than one binding site for the interaction of P-glycoprotein with its substrate.Tamai and Safa (51Tamai I. Safa A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16796-16800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the interaction of vinblastine with the azidopine binding site was noncompetitive. Cyclosporin A competitively inhibited Vinca alkaloid binding, but inhibited azidopine binding in a noncompetitive manner (52Tamai I Safa A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16509-16513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested the existence of two binding sites on P-glycoprotein, one specific forVinca alkaloids, verapamil, and cyclosporins and one binding site specific for azidopine. Ayesh et al. (53Ayesh S. Shao Y.-M. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 54Shao Y.-M. Ayesh S. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) extended the model whereby they proposed two different binding sites. One is recognized by substances such as vinblastine, mefloquine, and tamoxifen and the other one by substances such as verapamil. Cyclosporin A may interact with both sites (53Ayesh S. Shao Y.-M. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An even more complex view arose from photolabeling studies with a novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative (55Boer R. Dichtl M. Borchers C. Ulrich W.R. Marecek J.F. Prestwich G.D. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Multiple chemosensitizer domains were identified in P-glycoprotein, which were distinct from the Vinca alkaloid binding site. In contrast to these data, Bruggemann et al. (34Bruggemann E.P. Currier S.J. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21020-21026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that vinblastine and azidopine bind to a single site in human MDR1. Vinblastine was only able to prevent azidopine binding if a valine was at position 185 instead of a glycine, which occurred during selection of cells with colchicine (9Choi K. Chen C.-J. Krigler M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1988; 53: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These data indicate the direct contact of photobinding sites with substrate specificity influencing amino acids. Friche et al. (56Friche E. Demant E.J.F. Sehested M. Nissen N.I. Cancer Res. 1993; 67: 226-231Google Scholar) examined the effect of anthracycline analogues on photolabeling of P-glycoprotein by iodomycin and azidopine. Their data suggest that anthracyclines and Vincaalkaloids may bind to a common site in P-glycoprotein and that azidopine and iodomycin label P-glycoprotein with different binding affinities and/or at different sites. The latter view is supported by binding studies with prazosin. This drug inhibited photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein by azidopine (29Greenberger L.M. Yang C.-P.H. Gindin E. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4394-4401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but did not displace iodomycin out of its binding pocket (29Greenberger L.M. Yang C.-P.H. Gindin E. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4394-4401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Demmer and T. Brandt, unpublished data. The major photobinding site of arylazidoprazosin was localized in and C-terminal to TM6 and TM12 and a second minor site between TM4 and up to TM6 (36Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which the latter corresponds with the iodomycin binding site described in this report (Fig. 8).Although photoaffinity labeling studies provided strong evidence that P-glycoprotein has more than one binding site for drugs and modulators, it is not definite proof because of the inherent limitations of the methodology. Photoreactions with arylazido groups under UV irradiation and iodomycin with visible light share no common pathways, and correspondingly other reaction centers in the protein are selected, which may be part of the same binding site or another one (50Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Striessnig J. Goll A. Moosburger K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 57Safa A.R. Cancer Invest. 1993; 11: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this differential photoreactivity has the advantage of localizing various epitopes of the three-dimensional binding pocket(s), albeit the number of sites remains elusive. The latter issue is more appropriately addressed by analysis of substrate interaction at equilibrium (39Busche R. Tümmler B. Cano-Gauci D.F. Riordan J.R. Eur. J.

Freeman, San Francisco1980: 849-886Google Scholar).Since covalent photolabels just indicate the binding domain by primary sequence, supplementary information about the topology of the protein and its functional states is instrumental for the characterization of the binding site(s). According to the topological model of P-glycoprotein predicted from the hydropathy plot (18Gros P. Ben Neriah Y. Croop J.M. Housman D.E.

However, PKCμ differs in some structural and enzymatic features from the other PKC isotypes known so far (1Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol.

Thus, the two cysteine-rich domains, which serve as binding sites for cofactors and activators, are much further apart in PKCμ than in all the other PKCs and in contrast to the other PKC isoenzymes, PKCμ contains a pleckstrin homology domain and lacks a region corresponding to pseudosubstrate regions of the PKC family members. Moreover, PKCμ is not inhibited by a PKC-specific inhibitor (7Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Müller H.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and is not down-regulated upon prolonged TPA treatment of murine keratinocytes and epidermis (8Rennecke J. Johannes F.-J. Richter K.H. Kittstein W. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As yet, no substrate proteins of PKCμ have been found (3Dieterich S.

Recently, Sidorenko et al. (10Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) claimed that the tyrosine kinase Syk and the phospholipase Cγ1 were substrates of PKCμ. However, incorporation of phosphate into these proteins was lower than into myelin basic protein, which was shown by us and others to be an extremely poor substrate of PKCμ (3Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Böttinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint H. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As PKCμ substrates are not known so far, the function of PKCμ in cellular signaling is for the most part obscure. Very recently, data were presented suggesting that PKCμ is located at the Golgi apparatus and is involved in basal transport processes (11Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was suggested that PKCμ regulates lymphocyte signaling (10Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we report on a possibly differential regulation of the kinase activities of PKCμ and other PKC isoenzymes. In contrast to other PKCs, PKCμ is inhibited by various proteins and peptides, most likely due to clusters of basic residues in their structure, and is activated by heparin and dextran sulfate. Based on these results, the putative role of an acidic domain in the activation of PKCμ is discussed. TPA was supplied by Prof. Dr. E. Hecker, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. Gö6976 and Gö6983 were kindly provided by Gödecke, A.G., Freiburg, Germany. The tumor suppressor protein p53 was given by Dr. M. Frey, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. Syntide 2, μ-peptide 1, μ-peptide 2, p53-peptide, and the Ser-pseudosubstrate peptides of PKCδ, ζ, and η (δ-peptide, [ζ]-peptide, [ζ]-peptide-1, [ζ]-peptide-2, [η]-peptide) were synthesized by Dr. R. Pipkorn, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Other materials were bought from companies as indicated: [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 5000 Ci/mmol), Hartman Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany); aldolase, Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany); heparin, phosphatidylserine (PS), protamine sulfate, dextran sulfate, histone H1 (III-S), myelin basic protein, poly-l-lysine (M r 15,000–60,000), poly-l-lysine (M r 1,000–4,000) poly-l-arginine (M r 15,000–60,000),l-lysine, histamine, quinine, Sigma (Munich, Germany). Sf 158 cells were infected with recombinant PKCμ baculovirus, and cell extracts were prepared and used as source for PKCμ as described previously (3Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Böttinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Müller H.-J. Johannes F.-J.

Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), 4 mm MgCl2, 5 μl of a Sf 158 cell extract containing recombinant PKCμ, 35 μmATP containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of syntide 2 or μ-peptide 1 as substrates. PS, TPA, heparin, Gö6976, Gö6983, or various other compounds (see Table I) were added at concentrations indicated in the legends of the figures and Table I. After incubation for 7 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by transferring 50 μl of the assay mixture onto a 20-mm square piece of phosphocellulose paper (Whatman p81), which was washed three times in deionized water and twice in acetone. The radioactivity on each paper was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphate incorporated into the substrate peptide was obtained by subtracting values determined in the absence of kinase.Table IInhibition of PKCμ-catalyzed syntide 2 phosphorylation by various proteins, basic peptides, and other basic compoundsCompound (5 μg)Inhibition of syntide 2 phosphorylation%Protamine sulfate95Histone H194Myelin basic protein78p5368EF-1α6p53-peptide, SHLKSKKGQSTSRHKK58MARCKS-peptide, KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKSK92Ser-pseudosubstrate ζ (ζ-peptide), IYRRGSRRWRKL62Ser-pseudosubstrate ζ-1 (ζ-peptide-1), IYRRGSIRWRKL48Ser-pseudosubstrate ζ-2 (ζ-peptide-2), IYRRGSIRWAKL29Ser-pseudosubstrate η (η-peptide), RKRQRSMRRRVH51Ser-pseudosubstrate δ (δ-peptide), MNRRGSIKQAKI15μ-Peptide 2, GVRRRRL5Poly-l-arginine,M r 15,000–60,00090Poly-l-lysine, M r15,000–60,00076Poly-l-lysine,M r 1,000–4,00064l-Lysine, histamine, quinine (free base)0Incorporation of phosphate into syntide 2 by PKCμ was determined by applying the kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutated amino acids in the Ser-pseudosubstrates ζ1 and ζ2 are in bold.

However, no substrate was added for the autophosphorylation, and for the phosphorylation of aldolase or histone H1, these proteins instead of the substrate peptides were added, at the concentrations indicated in the text. The assay contained 7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins of the reaction mixture were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. No substrate protein of PKCμ, neither in vitro norin vivo, has been found so far. In accordance with previous reports (3Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Böttinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint H. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we observed that typical PKC substrates, such as histone H1, myelin basic protein, and protamine sulfate, were phosphorylated very weakly by PKCμ and, therefore, cannot be considered as PKCμ substrates. Recently, the tyrosine kinase Syk and the phospholipase Cγ1 were claimed to be substrates of PKCμ. However, phosphorylation by PKCμ in vitro of these proteins was even weaker than that of myelin basic protein (10Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here we show that aldolase can serve as a substrate for PKCμ in vitro. Aldolase was phosphorylated by PKCμ much more effectively than histone H1 (Fig. 1). To our surprise, when aldolase (5 μg) and histone (5 or 10 μg) were both present in the kinase assay, histone H1 suppressed the phosphorylation of aldolase almost completely and also autophosphorylation of PKCμ was inhibited (Fig. 1). To determine the dose dependence of the inhibitory effect of histone H1 on PKCμ, we used syntide 2 as well as a novel synthetic peptide that we termed μ-peptide 1 as substrates for PKCμ. The μ-peptide 1 with the amino acid sequence RKRYSVDKTLSHPWL, corresponding to the sequence 825–839 of human PKCμ, proved to be a potent PKCμ substrate. It incorporated around 30% more phosphate than syntide 2 on phosphorylation with PKCμ. 2M. Gschwendt, F.-J. Johannes, W. Kittstein, and F. Marks, unpublished results. Phosphorylation of syntide 2 and μ-peptide 1 by PKCμ was inhibited by histone H1 depending on the concentration of the inhibitor (Fig.2). Half-maximal inhibition was reached with 0.2–0.3 μg of histone H1/100 μl (IC50). To prove the hypothesis that the basic properties of histone H1 were responsible for the suppression of PKCμ activity, we tested various proteins and peptides containing basic regions and other basic compounds (5 μg/100 μl each) for their inhibitory capacity (TableI). All proteins tested suppressed the PKCμ-catalyzed phosphorylation, with the exception of the elongation factor EF-1α. Protamine sulfate and histone H1 were most effective in this respect, followed by myelin basic protein and the human tumor suppressor protein p53. The p53-peptide with the amino acid sequence SHLKSKKGQSTSRHKK, corresponding to sequence 367–382 of human p53, was similarly active as the p53 protein. Peptides derived from the pseudosubstrate domain of PKCζ (IYRRGSRRWRKL) and η (RKRQRSMRRRVH), which contain serine instead of alanine and therefore serve as substrates for several PKC isoenzymes, were also found to effectively inhibit PKCμ. However, the respective peptide derived from the pseudosubstrate of PKCδ (MNRRGSIKQAKI) as well as the μ-peptide 2 (GVRRRRL), corresponding to the amino acid sequence 198–204 of human PKCμ, did not show such an inhibitory effect. A major difference between the two peptides and the inhibitory peptides (ζ-peptide, η-peptide, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-peptide, and p53-peptide) exists in the total number and clustering of basic amino acids (Arg/Lys). The δ-peptide and the μ-peptide 2 contain four basic amino acids and one cluster of two or four basic amino acids, respectively, whereas the inhibitory peptides have at least six basic amino acids arranged in two or three clusters. The myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-peptide (KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKSK) with 12 basic residues and three clusters was the most effective inhibitor peptide. Thus, a peptide might require a minimal positive net charge and/or specific clusters of basic amino acids to be able to inhibit PKCμ. In fact, an exchange of one or two basic amino acids in the ζ-peptide for neutral residues resulting in ζ-peptide-1 (IYRRGSIRWRKL) and ζ-peptide-2 (IYRRGSIRWAKL) caused a gradual loss of inhibitory activity (Table I). ζ-peptide-2 has a similar arrangement of basic amino acids as the δ-peptide. EF-1α protein, which does not contain any cluster of basic amino acids even though it is basic (pI = 9), did not inhibit PKCμ thus further supporting our notion. The strongly basic polypeptides poly-l-arginine and poly-l-lysine (molecular weights of 15–60 kDa), and even the smaller poly-l-lysine (molecular mass of 1–4 kDa) inhibited PKCμ effectively.l-Lysine and other basic low molecular weight compounds, such as histamine and quinine, were on the other hand unable to inhibit PKCμ activity. This indicates that structural features, such as the above mentioned clusters of basic amino acids, rather than a positive net charge, determine the suitability of a compound to act as PKCμ inhibitor, thus pointing to some specificity of the interaction with the kinase. Most of the proteins and peptides inhibiting PKCμ are substrates rather than inhibitors of the other PKC isoenzymes, and some of them, such as protamine and poly-l-arginine, have been found to activate other PKC isoenzymes (13Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, none of the inhibitory proteins and peptides was significantly phosphorylated by PKCμ. Thus, inhibition of PKCμ was not likely to be due to a competition of the inhibitory compound with the substrate syntide 2 for ATP. Inhibition was not reduced by increasing substrate concentrations, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 for the inhibition by protamine sulfate of syntide 2 phosphorylation by PKCμ. For comparative purposes, Fig. 3 shows also the inhibition of PKCδ by the pseudosubstrate peptide. In this case, inhibition decreased upon increasing the concentration of the substrate syntide 2. This clearly demonstrates that the PKCμ-inhibiting peptides do not act like the well known pseudosubstrate peptides that inhibit other PKC isoenzymes by competing with the PKC substrate for its binding site (14House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulate that PKCμ contains an acidic domain, different from the acidic substrate-binding motif of other PKCs (see Ref. 15House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is involved in enzyme activation or stabilization of the active state of the kinase. In the active state PKCμ is inhibited by proteins and peptides containing clusters of basic residues probably due to an interaction with this “activating” domain. In the inactive state the acidic domain might not be accessible, due to an interaction with an autoregulatory basic domain of the enzyme. Indeed, PKCμ exhibits a highly acidic domain (amino acid sequence 336–391 of human PKCμ) in the regulatory part close to the C terminus of the cysteine-rich regions. This domain contains 40% acidic and just 2% basic residues and, in a smaller region (342–362), even 48% acidic residues. It is intriguing that the other PKC isoenzymes lack a comparable domain. Our hypothesis would imply that polyanions are able to break up the autoinhibitory interaction between the acidic and the basic domain. In fact, the highly sulfated polysaccharides heparin and dextran sulfate were found to function as potent activators of PKCμ. Maximal activation of PKCμ by heparin alone, i.e. in the absence of any other cofactor, was about twice and that by dextran sulfate four times as effective as maximal activation by PS/TPA (Fig.4). Dextran sulfate contains more sulfate groups than heparin and is, therefore probably, more active than heparin in stimulating PKCμ. Application of PS/TPA together with heparin or dextran sulfate did not further increase the activity of PKCμ. Activation of PKCμ by heparin or dextran sulfate was saturable at low concentrations (Fig. 5). The K a values for heparin and dextran sulfate, as determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot, were approximately 0.36 and 0.05 μm (based on an average molecular weight of 20,000 and 500,000, respectively, as given by the supplier). Thus, heparin and dextran sulfate are very effective activators as compared for instance with diacylglycerol (e.g. the K a value of dioctanoylglycerol for PKCδ is 10 μm, see Ref. 16Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, A andB, the maximal velocities (V max) of the heparin- and dextran sulfate-activated syntide 2 phosphorylations (23.3 pmol/min and 41.7 pmol/min, respectively) were much higher than that of the PS/TPA-activated phosphorylation (9.5 pmol/min). On the other hand, the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate was rather lower upon activation with the two polyanions (sameK m for both: 9.5) than with PS/TPA (K m : 4.8 μm). Thus, the much more effective incorporation of phosphate into syntide 2 by the polyanion-activated PKCμ than by the PS/TPA-activated kinase is due to an increase in the maximal velocity of the phosphorylation reaction. As the mechanisms of action of heparin and dextran sulfate are likely to be identical, we will in the following just deal with heparin. Autophosphorylation of PKCμ was also more efficiently stimulated by heparin alone than by PS/TPA (Fig. 7). Both, heparin- and PS/TPA-activated (7Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Müller H.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) autophosphorylation could be strongly suppressed by 1 μm of the PKC inhibitor Gö6976, but not at all by 1 μm of Gö6983, an effective inhibitor of the other PKC isoenzymes. These inhibitors are known to interact with the ATP binding site of PKC.Figure 6Dependence of PKCμ activation by PS/TPA, heparin, and dextran sulfate on substrate kinetics.

Autophosphorylation of PKCμ was performed in the absence or presence of heparin (various concentrations as indicated), 3 μg/100 μl of heparin (Hep), 10 μg/100 μl of PS, 100 nm TPA, and 1 μm each of the PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and Gö6983, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated PKCμ was visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TPA is generally thought to activate PKC by a conformational change that results from its binding to the zinc finger regions of the enzymes (4Marks F. Gschwendt M. Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 81-116Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As a consequence, an inhibitory pseudosubstrate domain is removed from the substrate binding site. Whether this mechanism can explain the activation by TPA/PS of PKCμ remains an open question, since a domain corresponding to the pseudosubstrate regions of other PKC isoenzymes has not been found in the PKCμ structure (7Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Müller H.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). This does not exclude, however, that upon identification of bona fide in vivosubstrates of PKCμ, a specific pseudosubstrate sequence will be identified in the future. Within the PKC family the activation by heparin may, on the other hand, turn out to be a specific feature of PKCμ, since PKCδ activity was not affected by heparin (data not shown) and a PKC preparation from rat brain (containing mainly PKC α, β, γ) was even inhibited by heparin (17Herbert J.-M. Maffrand J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The latter result is in agreement with the finding that heparin might block smooth muscle cell proliferation by inhibition of PKCα (18Herbert J.-M. Clowes M. Lea H.J. Pascal M. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25928-25935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several other protein kinases, such as casein kinase 1 and 2, nuclear kinases, the tyrosine kinase Syk, and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases are inhibited by heparin (17, 19, 20, and references in Ref. 17Herbert J.-M. Maffrand J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation by heparin was reported for instance for a RNA-activated protein kinase (21Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18593-18598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a Lyn-related tyrosine protein kinase (22Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ralph S. Marchiori F. Borin G. Fischer S. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Activation of each of the two kinases by heparin was shown to occur through mechanisms different from those of other known activators of these kinases, thus resembling the activation of PKCμ by heparin. Moreover, many growth factors are known to bear specific heparin-binding sites that contain a cluster of basic amino acid residues (23Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 24Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The activation by heparin or dextran sulfate of PKCμ appears to be rather specific, as other acidic compounds, such as chondroitin sulfate, cholesterol sulfate, double-stranded polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, DNA (calf thymus), poly-l-aspartic acid, and poly-l-glutamic acid, did not or just very weakly activate PKCμ (data not shown). This supports the notion that heparin and dextran sulfate specifically break up the intramolecular interaction of basic residues with an acidic domain of PKCμ. The apparent specificity of the stimulatory effect may be taken as an indication for a physiological function of heparin or heparin-like compounds in the control of PKCμ activity. Heparin has been shown to affect various intracellular signaling pathways, including PKC-dependent pathways, and to be a potent proliferation inhibitor of several cell types (Refs. 25Ottlinger M.E. Pukac L.A. Karnovsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19173-19176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Pukac L.A. Ottlinger M.E. Karnovsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3707-3711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). However, these effects are thought to be mediated by binding of heparin to cell surface binding sites or growth factors (23Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 24Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 27Gao G. Goldfarb M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Little is known about possibly direct actions of heparin on signaling pathways inside the cell. As heparin is synthesized in the Golgi complex and PKCμ has recently been shown to be localized there (11Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a direct action of heparin on PKCμ in this cellular compartment is conceivable. Alternatively, heparin might mimic the effects of heparin-like factors in vivo. Such factors are produced, for instance, by endothelial and smooth muscle cells and are growth-inhibitory for these cells (28Castellot Jr., J.J. Addonizio M.L. Rosenberg R. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 29Fritze L.M.S. Reilly C.F. Rosenberg R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)."

Phenylalanine 198 (Phe198) has been identified as a crucial residue involved in the interaction of the Shc PI/PTB with phosphopeptides. In NIH 3T3 cells expressing MT, p52 Shc carrying the F198V mutation is weakly phosphorylated and does not bind MT or Grb2. Overexpression of the PI/PTB domain alone as Shc amino acids 1-238 acted in a dominant interfering fashion blocking MT-induced transformation. However, expression of a slightly longer construct, Shc 1-260, which encompasses Tyr239/Tyr240, a novel Shc tyrosine phosphorylation site, did not block transformation. This was found to be due to the ability of Shc 1-260 to become tyrosine-phosphorylated and bind Grb2. Furthermore, full-length Shc in which Tyr239/Tyr240 had been mutated to phenylalanine did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated or bind Grb2 but did inhibit colony formation in soft agar. Conversely, p52 Shc carrying a mutation in the other tyrosine phosphorylation site, Tyr317, became heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated, bound Grb2, and gave rise to colonies in soft agar."

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which leukocytes migrate across the endothelial barrier after binding and what molecules participate in the process. Addition of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced a decrease in the amount of focal adhesion kinase (p125 FAK ) protein, a tyrosine kinase localized at focal contacts and essential for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, whereas little change was observed in the amount of other molecules associated with cell adhesion such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, α-catenin, and talin. A maximum decrease in the amount of p125 FAK was observed 15–30 min after addition of THP-1 cells to HUVEC, after which the level of p125 FAK gradually recovered. A reduction in the density of actin stress fibers in IL-1β-activated HUVEC was observed in parallel with the decrease in p125 FAK . The p125 FAK decrease was partially inhibited by preventing THP-1 binding to HUVEC using a mixture of antibodies to adhesion molecules.

We suggest that the decrease in p125 FAK triggered by binding of monocytes in inflammation facilitates the transendothelial migration of the monocytes by altering the adhesiveness of endothelial cells to the extracellular matrix. In the early stages of inflammation, monocytes and other leukocytes in the blood circulation migrate across endothelial cell monolayers lining the blood vessels and enter the perivascular tissues. The migration of leukocytes involves multiple steps, and various types of adhesion molecules participate in these processes, including selectins mediating initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes over the endothelial cells, and integrins on leukocytes interacting with adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on the endothelial cells (1Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6395) Google Scholar). In acute inflammation, the expression and activation of adhesion molecules are regulated by mediators such as thrombin, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6395) Google Scholar). Although many observations have focused on the molecules participating in the events from tethering to adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, little is known about the mechanisms whereby leukocytes migrate across the endothelial barrier after binding and which molecules participate in the process.

Ratti C.M. McDonnell S.L. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Anti-PECAM-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or soluble PECAM-1 inhibits the transmigration of leukocytes through endothelial cell monolayers in vitro without interfering with the leukocyte's potential to adhere tightly to the apical surface of endothelial cells (4Muller W.A. Weigl S.A. Deng X. Phillips D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). For neutrophils, integrin-associated protein (CD47) present on both neutrophils and endothelial cells is supposed to be essential for invasion (5Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by binding of T cells has been reported to transduce a signal into endothelial cells, which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein cortactin, indicating alterations in the cytoskeleton (6Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.0. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggesting the possibility that binding itself induces changes in endothelial cells leading to relaxation of interendothelial cell junctions are significant. To delineate the mechanism whereby monocytes can transmigrate through the endothelium during inflammation, we first investigated the changes in protein phosphorylation patterns of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) overlayered with human monocytic THP-1 cells and found that the addition of THP-1 cells induces a decrease in the amount of a phosphorylated 120–130-kDa protein(s) in HUVEC. In this study, we show that the decreased protein is focal adhesion kinase (p125 FAK ), a tyrosine kinase present at focal contact sites, and we discuss the possible involvement of this alteration in the process of leukocyte migration at sites of inflammation. HUVEC were purchased from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan) and were cultured on gelatin-coated culture flasks (Iwaki glass, Tokyo, Japan) with EGM-UV medium (Kurabo). Human monocytic THP-1 cells (Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Tokyo, Japan), monoblastic U937 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), promyelocytic HL-60 cells (Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Labs., Inc., Okayama, Japan), and T leukemic MOLT-16 cells (Fujisaki Cell Center) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human IL-1β was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Human natural tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (specific activity of 2 × 106 Japan reference unit/mg) was prepared in our laboratory (7Nobuhara M. Kanamori T. Ashida Y. Ogino H. Horisawa Y. Nakayama K. Asami T. Iketani M. Noda K. Andoh S. Kurimoto M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1987; 78: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) PY20, anti-Tyr(P) 4G10, anti-p125 FAK 2A7, and anti-α4 integrin SG/73 were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal anti-p125 FAK C-20 antibody and goat polyclonal anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) C-19 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β2 integrin mAb MEM 48 was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and anti-sialyl Lex CSLEX1 (IgM) was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Anti-talin mAb TA205 was purchased from Genosys (Cambridge, UK). Rabbit polyclonal anti-α-catenin was purchased from Sigma. Six-cm culture dishes (Falcon 3002, Becton Dickinson) were coated with 4 ml of a 100 μg/ml solution of gelatin (Iwaki Glass) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h, and HUVEC were grown to confluency on the coated dishes. HUVEC were stimulated with IL-1β or TNF-α for 5 h and subsequently overlayered with various human leukemic cells for the indicated times at different cell densities. After washing the mixed cultures of HUVEC and leukemic cells with PBS, the cells were lysed with 500 μl of an extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with the aid of a cell scraper. The lysates were stood on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. One hundred μl of the lysates were then transferred to new tubes as the whole cell lysate. The residual lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected and used as the cell extract. Four hundred μl of extraction buffer solutions containing 1% SDS were added to each remaining pellet and were dissolved by vigorous pipetting. These fractions were defined as the insoluble fraction. The cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Tyr(P) 4G10 for 2 h or with 4 μg of anti-p125 FAK 2A7 for 16–18 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and once with a washing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5), and the resin pellet was resuspended in washing buffer. The resins from 100-μl volumes of 50% suspensions were mixed with the HUVEC lysates and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The resins were washed three times with washing buffer and then resuspended in 40 μl of a 2 × SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris, 5% SDS, 30% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. In the case of direct immunoblotting, samples were treated with half their volume of 3 × SDS-sample buffer (150 mm Tris, 7.5% SDS, 45% glycerol, 7.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and 20 μl of the treated samples were subjected to electrophoresis. After blocking nonspecific binding with Block Ace (Yukijirushi, Sapporo, Japan), the filters were probed with the antibody of interest for 2–3 h at room temperature (rt), followed by either horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse Igs (Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan), horseradish peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit Igs (Dako, Japan), or a Vectastain ABC-PO kit for goat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2–3 h at rt. Washing of the membranes was performed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Buckingamshire, United Kingdom) as directed by the manufacturer. In the case of reprobing the same membranes with a different first antibody, the horseradish peroxidase of the already bound second antibody was inactivated by treating the filters with Block Ace supplemented with 0.1% NaN3 for 16–18 h at rt. Quantification of the density of the detected blots was performed by scanning densitometry using ImageMaster DTS (Pharmacia). Polystyrene chamber slides (Nippon InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) were coated with gelatin for 2 h. HUVEC were plated on the slides and cultured to confluency. HUVEC were then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β for 5 h and were subsequently layered with 1.5 × 104 THP-1 cells at different periods. After removing the supernatant and washing, the cells were fixed with a mixture of acetone and methanol (1:1 v/v) for 20 min at −20 °C, and after washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 2.5 units/ml of rhodamine phalloidin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 1 h at rt. After washing, the slides were mounted using 50% glycerol in PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (model BHF, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Ten thousand HUVEC were seeded in each well of gelatin-coated 96-well culture plates (Iwaki Glass) and cultured for 48 h. Confluent cultures of HUVEC were stimulated with IL-1β or TNF-α at 37 °C for 5 h and then washed once with assay medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Armour Pharmaceutical, Kankakee, IL), 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) before addition of isotope-labeled THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were labeled with51CrO4 (Amersham) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the culture medium, 5 × 104 labeled THP-1 cells suspended in the assay medium were added to each well in 100-μl volumes. In inhibition experiments using adhesion-blocking antibodies, 51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells incubated with 50 μg/ml mAbs to adhesion molecules for 60 min at rt and washed twice were used. After mild centrifugation at 40 ×g for 1 min, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with the assay medium, and the adherent THP-1 cells were lysed with 1 nNaOH. Radioactivity from samples of supernatants from each well and the original THP-1 cell suspension was determined by gamma counter, and the percentage of THP-1 cells adhering to HUVEC in each well was calculated. First we investigated the changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of molecules in HUVEC after adding human leukemic THP-1, U937, HL-60, or MOLT-16 cells. To simulate the activated state of blood vessels in inflammation, HUVEC were pretreated with IL-1β for 5 h. After treating HUVEC with leukemic cells, the cells were lysed with the extraction buffer, and cell extracts were prepared. Tyrosine phosphorylation patterns were assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) 4G10 and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) PY20. As shown in Fig. 1 A, several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were observed in IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC in the absence of the leukemic cell lines (lane 1). In the case of co-culture with THP-1 cells, a decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated 120–130-kDa proteins in IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC was very obvious (lanes 2 and 3). Considering the molecular size and the levels of expression of the phosphorylated molecule(s) observed in our experiments, p125 FAK was selected as a probable candidate for the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120–130-kDa protein observed in HUVEC. To confirm the identity of the protein(s) banding at 120–130 kDa, cell extracts from HUVEC co-cultured with leukemic cell lines were immunoprecipitated with anti-p125 FAK 2A7 and probed with anti-Tyr(P) PY20. As shown in Fig. 1 B, anti-p125 FAK 2A7 immunoprecipitated a 120–130 kDa protein, and the amount of immunoprecipitated molecule(s) was reduced by THP-1 co-culture in a manner depending on the number of seeded THP-1 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). This indicates that a component of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120–130-kDa band is identical to p125 FAK . The residual immunoprecipitates obtained by immunoprecipitation with anti-p125 FAK 2A7 were probed with anti-p125 FAK C-20. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the pattern of immunoblots detected with polyclonal anti-p125 FAK C-20 was almost identical to the pattern that was obtained with anti-Tyr(P) PY20, indicating that the decrease in p125 FAK band resulted from a decrease in the amount of p125 FAK protein itself and not from tyrosine de-phosphorylation of the protein. To further clarify the reason for the decrease in p125 FAK, changes in the amount of p125 FAK in whole cell lysates, cell extracts, and in insoluble fractions were investigated by direct immunoblotting with anti-p125 FAK C-20. As shown in Fig. 1 D, decreased p125 FAK levels induced by monocytic cell treatment was observed in whole cell lysates. In addition, the pattern of p125 FAK levels in cell extracts was identical to that in whole cell lysates, and no p125 FAK was detected in the insoluble fractions under the same detection conditions (data not shown). From these results, we assumed that the decrease in the amount of p125 FAK induced by monocytic cell seeding resulted from a decrease in p125 FAK protein and not from a decrease in solubility of the protein. However, obvious candidates for the degradation products of p125 FAK could not be observed. The decrease in p125 FAK was observed not only in THP-1-treated HUVEC but also in U937-treated HUVEC (Fig.1 C, lanes 4 and 5), although no change was detected in HUVEC treated with HL-60 and MOLT-16 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6–9). We investigated whether levels of proteins in IL-1β-activated HUVEC other than p125 FAK were reduced by THP-1 seeding or not. Talin present at focal contacts (8Burridge K. Connell L. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) such as is p125 FAK, VCAM-1 expressed on the cell surface of cytokine-activated endothelial cells (9Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Luhowskyj S. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1989; 59: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), and α-catenin co-localized at the sites of intercellular junctions with cadherin and β-catenin (10Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), were probed with their respective antibodies on the same transferred membrane. As shown in Fig. 2, no changes in the amount of VCAM-1 and α-catenin were observed in whole cell lysates of HUVEC co-cultured with THP-1 cells. In the case of talin, a slight decrease was observed, and a possible degradation fragment of approximately 200 kDa was identified. However, the extent of the decrease in talin was far less than that observed in p125 FAK . In U937-treated HUVEC, patterns for the probed proteins were almost the same as those observed in HUVEC treated with THP-1 cells (Fig. 2). VCAM-1 and α-catenin were not detected in whole cell lysates obtained from 2 × 106 THP-1 cells alone, although talin was faintly detectable (lane 4). In subsequent experiments we included α-catenin as a control to show that equal amounts of HUVEC protein were included in each sample of our assays. To further characterize the decrease in the amount of p125 FAK, the kinetics of the changes in p125 FAK after addition of THP-1 cells were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3, the decrease in p125 FAK was detected from 5 min after the addition of THP-1 cells (lane 5) and reached a maximum 15–30 min later (lanes 6 and 7) in IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC. Although the amount of p125 FAK did not return to initial levels, a tendency for recovery of p125 FAK was observed (lane 10) 4 h from THP-1 cell seeding. Interestingly, the p125 FAK degradation was not observed in unstimulated HUVEC (lanes 1–3). To investigate whether THP-1 treatment induces changes in the cytoskeletal structure of HUVEC, the HUVEC were stimulated with or without IL-1β for 5 h and were subsequently overlayered with THP-1 cells. The cells were fixed, stained with rhodamine phalloidin, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Well organized actin stress fibers were observed in both unstimulated (Fig.4 A) and IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC (Fig. 4 E) before seeding of THP-1 cells. The well developed stress fibers were also observed in unstimulated HUVEC which were overlayered with THP-1 cells (Fig. 4, B–D). In contrast, THP-1 seeding markedly reduced the number, thickness, and length of actin stress fibers in HUVEC preactivated with IL-1β (Fig.4, F–H). The changes were observed from 30 min after seeding THP-1 cells and continued for at least 2 h. The decrease in the amount of p125 FAK induced by THP-1 cells was observed in IL-1β-treated HUVEC but not in unstimulated HUVEC. Therefore, we investigated further whether THP-1 cells could induce the decrease in p125 FAK in HUVEC stimulated with inflammatory stimuli other than IL-1β. HUVEC were stimulated with TNF-α for 5 h and were then co-cultured with THP-1 for 30 min. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-p125 FAK C-20. As shown in Fig.5 A, decrease in the amount of p125 FAK after addition of THP-1 was observed not only in IL-1β-activated HUVEC (lanes 2–5) but also in TNF-α-activated HUVEC (lanes 7–10) in a manner dependent on the concentration of the cytokines added. We simultaneously investigated the binding of THP-1 cells to HUVEC activated with these inflammatory stimuli. 51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells were added to activated HUVEC and incubated for 30 min. As shown in Fig.5 B, it was observed that IL-1β and TNF-α treatment of HUVEC augmented THP-1 binding to HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a correlation between decrease in p125 FAK and binding of THP-1 cells to cytokine-activated HUVEC. It is well known that IL-1β and TNF-α induce the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on the surface of endothelial cells (9Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R.

Therefore, we investigated whether pretreating THP-1 cells with a blocking antibody to the counter-receptors for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or E-selectin could inhibit the decrease in p125 FAK or not. THP-1 cells have been reported to express β2 integrin, a β subunit of the β2 integrin family, α4 integrin, an α subunit of very late antigen-4, and sialyl Lex (13Prieto J. Eklund A. Patarroyo M. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 156: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). β2 integrins, very late antigen-4, and sialyl Lex are known to interact with ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, respectively (14Marlin S.D.

After washing three times with medium, the antibody-pretreated THP-1 cells were seeded over IL-1β-activated HUVEC. As shown in Fig.6 A, pretreatment of THP-1 cells with a mixture of anti-α4, anti-β2, and anti-sialyl Lex inhibited the decrease in p125 FAK in IL-1β-activated HUVEC (lane 6), whereas treatment with either of these mAbs alone could not inhibit the decrease in p125 FAK (lanes 3–5). Fig. 6 B shows the result of quantification of the density of the detected blots in Fig.6 A. In the case of cell adhesion assays, only treatment with a mixture of the three mAbs similarly inhibited the adherence of THP-1 cells to activated HUVEC (Fig. 6 C, lane 6). Focal contacts are regions of the cell that come in direct contact with the extracellular matrix, providing anchorage sites for actin stress fibers and forming a link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton (19Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). The p125 FAK molecule is a tyrosine kinase co-localized in focal contacts with several other molecules, such as talin and tensin (20Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B.

Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that binding of THP-1 cells to IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC induces a decrease in the amount of the p125 FAK molecule in HUVEC. It has been reported that inhibition of the function of p125 FAK by p41/43 FRNK (pp125 FAK -related non-kinase) blocked the formation of focal contacts, indicating a functional relation between p125 FAK and the formation of focal contacts (25Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Moreover, the loss of p125 FAK has been reported to be a prerequisite for cell detachment (26Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, it was considered that the decrease in p125 FAK in HUVEC indicates a decrease in the function of focal contacts, resulting in decreased strength of attachment of the endothelial cell to the extracellular matrix. The decrease in the adhesiveness of endothelial cells would enable monocytes to migrate beneath the endothelial cells more easily. A decrease in the density of actin fibers induced by THP-1 was also observed in HUVEC in parallel with the decrease in p125 FAK . It has been well documented that the formation of actin stress fibers parallels the formation of focal adhesion and is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK (27Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Integrity of the actin cytoskeleton has also been reported to be required for the increased phosphorylation of p125 FAK in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli (23Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 30Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be postulated that the decrease in actin stress fibers is closely associated with the decrease in p125 FAK . It is unclear why the p125 FAK protein level drops so rapidly. Recently, it was reported that p125 FAK is cleaved by calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, in platelets (31Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the decrease in p125 FAK could be prevented by calpeptin, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of calpain, or a cysteine protease inhibitor E-64. However, pretreatment of HUVEC by these inhibitors at a concentration of up to 50 μm could not affect the decrease in p125 FAK (data not shown). In addition, little change was observed in the amount of talin which interacts with p125 FAK (32Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and is cleaved by calpain preferentially (33Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). From these results, it is unlikely that calpain is responsible for the decrease in p125 FAK . The molecular mechanisms of the decrease in p125 FAK are still inconclusive, even though we have also tried to inhibit the decrease in p125 FAK by other protease inhibitors. The decrease in p125 FAK in IL-1β-stimulated HUVEC was induced not only by monocytic THP-1 cells but also by monoblastic U937 cells. Furthermore, the decrease induced by THP-1 was also observed in HUVEC grown on collagen type I or fibronectin (data not shown), indicating that the decrease in p125 FAK was independent of the extracellular matrix on which the HUVEC were grown. These results indicate that the decrease in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p125 FAK might be a commonly observed event in cytokine-activated HUVEC. The molecules participating in the interactions between THP-1 cells and HUVEC remain to be clarified. The candidate molecule that triggers the decrease in p125 FAK is considered to be an adhesion molecule present on THP-1 cells rather than a newly secreted soluble factor induced by interaction of THP-1 cells with activated HUVEC because the cell-free culture supernatant obtained after co-culture of THP-1 cells with IL-1β-activated HUVEC did not induce a decrease in p125 FAK levels (data not shown). With regard to the counter-receptor(s) on the surface of HUVEC responsible for the transduction of the p125 FAK -modifying signal, although the decrease in the amount of p125 FAK was partially blocked by a mixture of neutralizing mAbs against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin pathways, a direct role for these three adhesion molecules in the transmission of a regulatory signal has yet to be established. It is possible that adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, the expression of which is augmented by inflammatory cytokines, enable THP-1 cells to bind tightly to HUVEC, resulting in the effective transduction of the p125 FAK reducing signal induced by other molecule(s) into HUVEC.

Biophys. 1967; 120: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TC II-R functions as a noncovalent homodimer with a molecular mass of 124 kDa in tissue membranes (1Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and its dimerization occurs not in the ER, where it is a monomer, but rather in the plasma membrane (3Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the dimerization of TC II-R is a membrane fluidity-driven event requiring a highly ordered rigid bilayer (4Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial Caco-2 cells, TC II-R is predominantly present in basolateral membranes (5Bose S. Seetharam S. Dahms N.M. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3538-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), where it functions in the delivery of Cbl to be utilized as coenzymes (6Bose S. Komorowski R.

Treatment of the basolateral surface of Caco-2 cells with TC II-R antiserum in vitro or circulating TC II-R antibody in vivo results in a failure of TC II-Cbl uptake, causing intracellular Cbl deficiency (6Bose S.

These studies have suggested that plasma membrane delivery of TC II-R is extremely important for cells to obtain their Cbl from the circulation to maintain their normal metabolic, differentiation, and proliferation status. Despite the importance of plasma membrane expression of TC II-R in the tissue transport of Cbl, no information is available regarding its intracellular trafficking and plasma membrane expression. Recent studies have shown that formation of intracellular inter- or intrachain disulfide bonds and their final rearrangement by thiol-disulfide exchange reaction is one of the co/post-translational modifications of some proteins (7Koivu J. Myllyla R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6159-6164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The correct formation of intrachain and, in the case of oligomeric proteins, interchain disulfide bonds is crucial for the proper assembly of secretory and plasma membrane proteins, which in turn determines their stability, intracellular transport, maturation, and function (9Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Segal M.S. Bye J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Cell.

Inhibition of disulfide bond formation by DTT treatment has been shown to affect secretion of albumin and H1 subunit of asialoglycoprotein receptor from fibroblasts (12Wikstrom L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14412-14416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of gp80 (clusterin, apolipoprotein J) in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (13Losch A. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11543-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the secretion of non-disulfide bond-containing proteins such as α1-antitrypsin (14Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in HepG2 cells or of a 20-kDa peptide derived from osteoponin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (13Losch A. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11543-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is not affected. These studies have proposed that the retention of proteins in the ER following treatment with DTT is due to a failure of these proteins to form disulfide bonds, which then fold improperly. As a consequence, these misfolded proteins fail to achieve a conformation essential for their function as well as their exit from the ER for further processing and targeting (15Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Human TC II-R contains 10 half-cysteines (16Seligman P.A. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1766-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent immunoblot studies of placental plasma membrane proteins under nonreducing and reducing conditions (1Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that TC II-R dimers contain intramolecular disulfide bonds that, upon reduction, increase the apparent molecular mass of the dimer by 20 kDa. Taken together, these results have suggested that some if not all of the SH groups of TC II-R monomer may be involved in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, which remain intact during its transport to and dimerization in the plasma membranes. Furthermore, the increase in apparent molecular mass of the reduced TC II-R dimer may be related to its attainment of an extended or a more linear structure. However, it is not known whether the TC II-R monomers contain intrachain disulfide bonds that, when reduced, form extended structures and whether such a modification has any effect on their ligand binding, turnover, and trafficking to the basolateral membranes. The current studies have addressed these issues in vitro using pure TC II-R and in vivousing human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells as a model system. The results of this study show that TC II-R monomers contain four intramolecular disulfide bonds that are required for activity and two free SH groups that have no role in ligand binding. Sulfhydryl group modification of either isolated TC II-R monomer or that expressed in Caco-2 cells by SH-modifying agents demonstrated a more linear extended form of an inactive receptor with a molecular mass of 72 kDa. The extended 72-kDa form of TC II-R, like the native 62-kDa form, turned over rapidly in cells with a t½ of 7.5 h. In addition, it was able to exit ER and transit through the Golgi as revealed by the sialylation of both its N- andO-linked sugars. However, the 72-kDa form of TC II-R was unable to undergo transport from the trans-Golgi to its destination in the basolateral membranes. The following chemicals were purchased as indicated: [57Co]CN-Cbl (15 μCi/μg) and carrier-free Na125I (17.4 Ci/mg) (Amersham Corp.); [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) and [3H]NEM (60 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products); 125I-protein A (>30 Ci/μg) (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA);N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, methyl methanethiosulfonate, dithiothreitol, protein A-Sepharose, and sialidase from Clostridium perifringens (from Sigma); 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), sulfosuccin imidobiotin and disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce); Millicell-HA culture plate inserts (Millipore); cellulose nitrate membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Streptomyces plicatus, Peptide-N-glycosidase fromFlavobacterium meningosepticum, and O-glycanase from Diplococcus pneumonia (Boehringer Mannheim). All chemicals purchased were used as such except that iodoacetamide was recrystallized in water. Pure TC II-R (specific activity, 14–15 nmol of ligand binding/mg of protein) was purified from human placenta, and its antiserum was prepared as described earlier (1Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antiserum to bovine CI-MPR was a gift from Dr. Nancy M. Dahms (Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee). Partially purified human TC II used for ligand binding was prepared from human plasma according to Lindemans et al. (17Lindemans J. Van Kappel J. Abels J. Scan. J. Lab. Clin. Invest. 1986; 46: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Human TC II was a gift from Charles A. Hall (Nutrition Assessment laboratory, Albany, NY). Pure TC II (5 μg) or streptavidin (50 μg) was iodinated with 0.5 mCi of Na125I and IODO-GEN as recommended by the manufacturer. The iodinated proteins were separated from free iodine on a Sephadex G-25 column using 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 140 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of 125I-TC II and125I-streptavidin was between 70 and 80 μCi/μg. Pure TC II-R (5 μg) was treated with 130 mm of iodoacetamide (IAM) or NEM or methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) for 1 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 4 m urea or 2-mercaptoethanol (40 mm). The receptor was first incubated with 4 murea (15 min) or 2-mercaptoethanol (1 h in the dark) prior to the addition of the SH-modifying agent. In some experiments, the receptor was first treated with urea for 15 min followed by 2-mercaptoethanol treatment for 1 h and finally treated with the SH reagent. All samples (1.5 ml) were dialyzed for 12 h against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm PMSF. The dialyzed samples were assayed for TC II-[57Co]Cbl (1.5 pmol) binding by the DEAE-Sephadex method of Seligman and Allen (16Seligman P.A. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1766-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TC II-R that was reduced and treated with each of the SH-modifying agents was treated with DTT (200 mm), dialyzed, and assayed for the ligand binding as stated above. In some experiments, TC II-R reduced in the presence of urea and treated with IAM, NEM, or MMTS was cross-linked with125I-TC II-Cbl (200,000 dpm/2 pmol Cbl binding capacity) in the presence and absence of excess (20-fold) unlabeled TC II-Cbl. Reduced and SH group-modified TC II-R (2 μg) was incubated with and without cold TC II-Cbl for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then incubated with 125I-TC II-Cbl for 2 h at room temperature, the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate (4 mm) was added, and they were incubated for an additional 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine (0.1 mm). The reaction mixture was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Pure TC II-R (50 μg), unreduced or reduced in the presence or absence of urea (4 m) in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 mm EDTA was incubated with DTNB (10 μg) for 1 h at 22 °C. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 412 nm, and the spectrophotometric titrations of thiol groups were calculated based on the known extinction coefficient of DTNB (13,600 mol−1/cm−1) according to Habeeb (18Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Titration of pure TC II-R (5 μg) was carried out using [3H]NEM (760,000 dpm/100 mm) under reducing and nonreducing conditions and in the absence and the presence of urea as described above for DTNB titration. The samples were dialyzed and counted for the bound radioactivity. Pure native, reduced, and SH-modified TC II-R (0.2–2 μg of protein), Caco-2 cell homogenate (50 μg), or Triton X-100 (1%) extract of total Caco-2 cell membrane (200 μg), and labeled TC II-R immunoprecipitated from NEM treated and untreated cells were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%) according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). In some experiments separated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting to detect either the monomer or the dimer form of TC II-R as described before (4Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The bands were visualized by autoradiography at −70 °C using X-Omat plates. The bands were quantified by the AMBIS radioimaging system, and the image density was found to be in the linear range (3Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells (passages 76–80) were grown in DMEM (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Confluent monolayers were subcultured every 7 days by treatment with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. In some experiments, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells on plastic tissue culture 75-cm2 flasks and were harvested 3–12 days after plating. For the ligand uptake studies, cells were grown as epithelial layers by high density seeding (1.5 × 106cells/filter) onto nitrocellulose membrane filter inserts (Millicell-HA, 30-mm diameter, 0.45 μm pore size). The formation and integrity of monolayers were assessed by the development of significant transepithelial resistance of 250–300 ohms/cm2 over the resistance of filter alone. The filter grown cells that were treated with NEM were also measured for transepithelial resistance, which was found to be similar to that of cells not treated with NEM. All resistance readings were measured with a Millicell-ERS Voltohmeter (Millipore Corp.). Filter grown Caco-2 cells were incubated with NEM (10−12 to 10−6m) for 16 h, and the cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 140 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm PMSF. Untreated and NEM-treated cell homogenates were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Using another set of filters similarly treated with NEM, the basolateral binding of the ligand, TC II-[57Co]Cbl (500 fmol), was determined as described earlier (6Bose S. Komorowski R. Seetharam S. Gilfix B. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4195-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total TC II-R activity was determined in these cells by the DEAE-Sephadex method using Triton X-100 (1%) extract of the harvested cell homogenates prepared using 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm PMSF. Postconfluent Caco-2 cells were first incubated with NEM (10−6m) for 8 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing [3H]NEM (4 × 106 dpm/T-75 flask, 10−6m), and the cells were incubated for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, homogenized in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm PMSF (TBS). The homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the pelleted membrane was rehomogenized in the same buffer and extracted with Triton X-100 (1%). The cellular homogenate, total membranes, cytosol, and the immunoprecipitated fraction obtained using Triton X-100 extract of the total membranes and antiserum to TC II-R or CI-MPR were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with EN3HANCE and dried, and the bands were visualized by fluorography. In some experiments, the cells were incubated for 8 h with NEM (10−6m), and then [35S]methionine (200 μCi/flask) was added and cells were incubated for an additional 8 h. Prior to labeling, the cells were incubated with methionine-free DMEM for 30 min. Further processing, extraction, and immunoprecipitation of labeled TC II-R was carried out as above. Cells were first incubated with or without NEM (10−6m) for 8 h and then with methionine-free medium for 30 min. The medium was removed, and fresh medium containing [35S]methionine (200 μCi/flask) was added and incubated for 1 h in the presence and absence of NEM (10−6m). The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with medium maintained at 4 °C and incubated with fresh medium in the absence and presence of NEM (10−6m) but containing methionine (20 mm) for 0–16 h. Cells were harvested and extracted with Triton X-100, and the radioactivity was immunoprecipitated with TC II-R antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated material was treated with SDS, and the liberated radioactivity was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and the bands were visualized by fluorography. Biotinylation of the basolateral surface of Caco-2 cells incubated with NEM (10−12 to 10−6m) was carried out by adding 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), sulfosuccin imidobiotin (0.5 mg/ml) to the basolateral compartments of filter-grown monolayers (12-day growth) and was performed a total of three times for 30 min each at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2. The cells were then washed six times in PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, MgCl2 and 50 mm glycine (5 min each) at 4 °C. The cells were then harvested and extracted with PBS containing Triton X-100 (1%). The extract was immunoprecipitated with TC II-R or CI-MPR antiserum (25 μl) and protein A-Sepharose (100 μl of 1:1 suspension in PBS). The washed immunopellet was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%), the bands were transferred to Nitrocellulose membranes and probed with 125I-streptavidin (3 × 107 dpm/blot), and the bands were visualized by autoradiography as described above. In some experiments, filter-grown Caco-2 cells incubated first with NEM (10−6m) for 16 h were washed with DMEM and then incubated for 15 min with DMEM containing cycloheximide (200 μg/ml) and then chased for 0–60 min with the same medium but in the absence of NEM. Basolateral surfaces of cells that were not incubated with either NEM or cycloheximide or with both were biotinylated and processed for SDS-PAGE and detection for biotinylated TC II-R as before. To study the effects of NEM and other SH-reagents on the basolateral expression of de novo synthesized TC II-R, filter-grown Caco-2 cells were metabolically labeled and processed as follows; NEM-treated (10−6 for 16 h) cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/filter) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with DMEM and chased with NEM-free DMEM containing nonradioactive methionine (10 mm) for 0–2 h. At each time interval, the cells were washed with ice-cold DMEM, followed by treatment of the basolateral surface with TC II-R antiserum (25 μl) for 45 min at 5 °C. The cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline to remove the excess antiserum, harvested, and extracted with Tris-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 (1%). The extract was treated with protein A-Sepharose (150 μl of 1:1 suspension), and the radioactivity precipitated was released using SDS-sample buffer. The samples were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE as described before. In some experiments, filter-grown cells were first treated with MMTS (10−6m) for 16 h and then pulsed for 1 h with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/filter) at 37 °C. The cells were then chased with MMTS-free DMEM containing nonradioactive methionine (10 mm) and DTT (10−4m) for 0–120 min. At each time interval, the basolateral cell surface was treated with TC II-R antiserum as above. Following the separation of [35S]TC II-R present in the basolateral surface by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose, the immune supernatant (representing intracellular labeled TC II-R) was reimmunoprecipitated with TC II-R antiserum and protein A-Sepharose as before. The intracellular and the basolateral labeled TC II-R immunprecipitated was subjected to SDS-PAGE, the bands were visualized by fluorography, and the image density was quantified by the AMBIS radioimaging system. Protein in all samples was determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). In some experiments, [35S]TC II-R (10,000–15,000 dpm) obtained from NEM-treated and untreated cells was digested with Endo H or PNGase F or with sialidase followed by treatment with O-glycosidase as described earlier (1Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,21Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam S. Dahms N.M. Seetharam B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TC II-R reduced and treated with the sulfhydryl-modifying agents, NEM, IAM, or MMTS (TableI), was assayed for TC II-[57Co]Cbl binding by the DEAE-Sephadex method (16Seligman P.A. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1766-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method, which uses charge-based separation of receptor bound and free ligand, revealed >90% loss of ligand binding activity only when these reagents were added following the reduction of TC II-R in the presence of 4 m urea. Treatment with urea alone or with urea and the SH reagents had no effect on ligand binding by TC II-R. In the absence of urea but following reduction, all three reagents inhibited ligand binding by about 74%. Nearly 85% of the activity lost was regained following treatment of the MMTS-modified TC II-R with DTT, while treatment with DTT of TC II-R alkylated with IAM or NEM had no effect (Table I). To confirm that loss of ligand binding as assessed by the DEAE-Sephadex method was not due to an artifact of an altered charge on the modified TC II-R molecule, we carried out chemical cross-linking of the reduced and SH-modified TC II-R with125I-TC II-Cbl (Fig. 1).125I-TC II-Cbl was able to bind only to the native untreated (UT) receptor in the absence of excess unlabeled TC II-Cbl but not in its presence. The size of the 105-kDa band detected was consistent with the size of the TC II-R·TC II-Cbl complex (62 plus 43 kDa). No cross-linked product was noted using reduced TC II-R that was treated with SH-modifying agents, NEM, IAM, or MMTS.Table IEffect of SH modification on TC II-R activityTC II-R treated withSH-modifying agentNEMIAMMMTSpmol ligand bound/μg TC II-RNothing14.1 ± 0.6014.5 ± 0.5013.8 ± 0.60SH-reagent14.3 ± 0.5014.2 ± 0.6014.0 ± 0.30Urea14.0 ± 0.4014.2 ± 0.5014.0 ± 0.60Urea + SH reagent13.0 ± 0.7013.4 ± 0.6013.5 ± 0.702-ME + SH reagent3.7 ± 0.203.5 ± 0.403.5 ± 0.30Urea + 2-ME + SH reagent1.3 ± 0.081.2 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.02Urea + 2-ME + SH reagent + DTT1.3 ± 0.021.3 ± 0.0112.5 ± 0.40The values reported are mean ± S.D. of six separate assays under each condition using each of the SH-modifying agents.

Other details of the conditions are provided under “Experimental Procedures.” To quantify the number of free and disulfide-bonded SH groups of TC II-R, pure TC II-R was titrated with DTNB and [3H]NEM (Table II). When either of these two reagents was added to TC II-R, no SH groups were revealed, and no ligand binding was lost. However, in the presence of 4 murea, both reagents revealed the presence of two free SH groups, and modification of these two free SH groups did not result in loss of ligand binding. When the receptor was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and then modified, six SH groups were revealed with 75% loss of ligand binding. These results suggested that at least three disulfide bonds are accessible to the reducing agent, reduction of which resulted in nearly 75% loss of ligand binding. When TC II-R was reduced in the presence of 4 m urea and then treated with DTNB or [3H]NEM, the loss of binding was complete with the modification of 10 SH groups (Table II). Taken together, these results suggested that the two free and the two SH groups that form one of the disulfide bonds are buried within the molecule. While the modification of the free buried SH groups had no effect on the ligand binding activity, the disruption of disulfide bonds by reduction altered the folding of TC II-R such that it assumed a more linear conformation as revealed by mobility changes on nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The consequence of disruption of all the disulfide bonds was complete loss of ligand binding.Table IITitration of total and free SH groups of TC II-RConditionsDTNB[3H]NEMLigand boundSH groups/molpmol/μg0014.1 ± 0.3With 2-ME6 ± 0.106 ± 0.163.6 ± 0.4With 2-ME + urea10 ± 0.4010 ± 0.501.1 ± 0.1With urea2 ± 0.022 ± 0.0114.4 ± 0.5Results shown are mean ± S.D. of six titrations under all conditions used.

This hypersensitive site was shown to be macrophage differentiation-dependent. Demethylation of CpG sequences within the enhancer is correlated with lysozyme expression in mature macrophages. Binding of the GABP heterotetrameric transcription factor to the enhancer core element (MLDE), only seenin vivo on the demethylated MLDE element in macrophages, is inhibited by DNA methylation. Here, we analyzed the DNA sequences required for demethylation. In electrophoretic mobility shift experiments we found that in addition to the complete methylated MLDE the hemimethylated form of the lower strand inhibits GABP binding as well. Therefore, GABP is unlikely to be the mediator of demethylation. In addition, we show by stable DNA transfections of methylated mouse lysozyme enhancer sequences that MLDE-flanking sequences are required for demethylation. We narrowed down these DNA elements to two short regions of 163 and 79 base pairs on either side of the MLDE, each of which is sufficient to mediate demethylation of the GABP site.

The mouse genome contains two lysozyme genes, a Paneth cell (P-lysozyme) 1The abbreviations used are: P-lysozyme, Paneth cell lysozyme; M-lysozyme, macrophage-specific lysozyme; kb, kilobase(s); HS, DNase I-hypersensitive; MLDE, M-lysozyme downstream enhancer (core); GABP, GA-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: P-lysozyme, Paneth cell lysozyme; M-lysozyme, macrophage-specific lysozyme; kb, kilobase(s); HS, DNase I-hypersensitive; MLDE, M-lysozyme downstream enhancer (core); GABP, GA-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. and a macrophage-specific (M-lysozyme) gene generated by a gene duplication event (1Cross M. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The M- and P-lysozyme genes are arranged in tandem with the coding regions separated by 5 kb (Fig. 1). Analysis of the M-lysozyme gene domain by DNase I digestion identified multiple hypersensitive (HS) sites in the 5′ and 3′ M-lysozyme gene-flanking regions in macrophage and myeloid precursor cell lines (Fig.1) (2Möllers B. Klages S. Wedel A. Cross M. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Only a single site in the 3′-flanking region (HS3) was dependent on the differentiation state of the cell line and correlated with M-lysozyme gene expression (2Möllers B. Klages S. Wedel A. Cross M. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transfection analysis of the flanking regions identified a single enhancer downstream of the M-gene which overlapped the HS3 site and is limited to the subregion HS3.2 (2Möllers B. Klages S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analysis of the HS3 region methylation state in M-lysozyme-expressing and nonexpressing cells demonstrated a correlation between undermethylation of this region with both the presence of the HS3 site and expression of the M-lysozyme gene. Further fine mapping identified a central core enhancer (MLDE), which is bound by a heterotetrameric GABP complex (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that GABP binding to the MLDE is methylation-sensitive (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, very likely, macrophage-specific demethylation of the single CpG dinucleotide within the MLDE is a mechanism to confer tissue-specific enhancer activity.Figure 1Mouse M- and P- lysozyme genes. The mouse lysozyme genes are located on a genomic region (solid line) about 24 kb in length.

Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recent achievements in demethylating DNA in vitro (9Weiss A. Keshet I. Razin A. Cedar H. Cell. 1996; 86: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed an involvement of RNA and that tissue-specific proteins are required for the specificity of the reaction.Here, we wanted to analyze the mechanisms mediating macrophage-specific demethylation of the single CpG site within the mouse lysozyme enhancer core MLDE. We identified two short DNA regions of 163 and 79 bp which are required and sufficient for demethylation. The two fragments are overlapping, but the sequence in common is not sufficient for demethylation.DISCUSSIONMany examples have been identified linking sequence-specific DNA demethylation with differentiation of a particular tissue or cell type (for review, see Refs. 5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar and 6Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In these cases, it has been shown that the differentiation-dependent expression of a tissue-specific gene is correlated with the demethylation of flanking sequences. Such a demethylation is usually restricted to a specific region or at least to specific genes. For example, expression-linked demethylation has been seen for the genes coding for chicken vitellogenin, human dihydrofolate reductase, mouse collagen IV, rat α-actin, mouse κ chain, human estrogen receptor, human galectin-1, or mouse pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit, to name only a few (7Paroush Z.

Such a correlation has been found for the mouse M-lysozyme gene as well. The M-lysozyme gene is inactive in non-macrophage cells and shows a methylated CpG dinucleotide within the single HpaII recognition sequence of the downstream enhancer (3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that during the differentiation of the multipotent FTCP-A4 cell line toward macrophages the enhancer loses its methyl groups (3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human lysozyme gene has been found to be demethylated depending on the differentiation as seen inex vivo cultures of hematopoetic progenitor cells, whereas the gene coding for myeloperoxidase showed unaltered demethylation (23Lubbert M. Brugger W. Mertelsmann R. Kanz L. Blood. 1996; 87: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other myeloid-specific demethylation events have been shown as well to correlate with transcriptional activity, such as the c-fms gene and the regulatory region of the tumor necrosis factor-α gene (24Felgner J. Kreipe H. Heidorn K. Jaquet K. Heuss R. Zschunke F. Radzun H.J. Parwaresch M.R. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 420-425PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takei S. Fernandez D. Redford A. Toyoda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Many of the published examples could not distinguish between a role for the demethylation being required for transcriptional activity or a possible demethylation-inducing function mediated by transcription. In some cases, methylation-dependent repressor binding or inhibition of transcription factor binding could be demonstrated (5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar,26Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 27Jost J.P. Saluz H.P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6150-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For the mouse lysozyme gene, it was shown that within the core part of the downstream enhancer the heterotetrameric transcription factor GABP is required for full enhancer activity (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that the methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide within the enhancer core region inhibits in vitro DNA binding of GABP (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A similar sensitivity in methylated DNA binding was demonstrated for GABP and other ETS proteins in the context of binding sites that differ from the mouse lysozyme GABP binding site (30Yokomori N. Kobayashi R. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Gaston K. Fried M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 157: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Desmet C. Debacker O. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Brasseur F. Boon T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This suggests that demethylation of this enhancer is a prerequisite for enhancer activity and therefore, for transcription. Here we show that the cis-element-dependent demethylation can be observed independent of the type of the neighboring DNA or promoter context. The 224-bp fragment HS3.2 can be stably transfected either fused to a eukaryotic reporter gene or to a prokaryotic vector and will be demethylated in both cases. Therefore, the lysozyme downstream enhancer confers at least two functions. One function is to mediate the demethylation during differentiation, and another function is to activate gene transcription by the bound enhancer factors. A similar dual activity has been demonstrated for the α-actin promoter and the κ enhancer (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Our transfection data suggest that the MLDE fragment within the downstream enhancer is not sufficient to mediate demethylation. This fragment harbors the single HpaII site and binds the heterotetrameric GABP factor in the absence of methylation. Here we have shown that even a single methyl group on the lower strand is sufficient to inhibit GABP binding, whereas the hemimethylated upper strand does not interfere with binding. Since GABP binding is impaired even by hemimethylated DNA, this factor cannot be the cause for demethylation. This is in contrast to the mechanism observed in the context of Sp1 binding (15Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Sp1 is able to bind methylated DNA and after replication prevents the maintenance methylase from modifying the newly synthesized DNA strand. Such a Sp1-like activity could have been envisioned to be utilized by an unknown factor that has been found to bind to the GABP response element even in the case of a fully methylated DNA (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If this factor would indeed play such a role, this function would not be sufficient for demethylation, since we have shown that the methylated MLDE fragment is not demethylated (Fig. 6).Within the group of fragments mediating demethylation, there seems to be a bias in demethylation efficiency: all of the fragments extending up to the position 224 (Fig. 7; i.e. fragments HS3/6, HS3.2, 82–224, 146–224) mediate 90–100% demethylation. In contrast, fragments with a downstream deletion (Fig. 7;i.e. fragments 1–181, 1–163) mediate demethylation for only 70–80% of the molecules. Nevertheless, two different sets of fragments, overlapping in the GABP site only, confer demethylation. Computer analysis of the sequences flanking the GABP site did not reveal any consensus in common, which otherwise might have been an indication for trans-acting proteins required for demethylation. In addition, in vitro footprinting showed only one protected region in addition to the GABP site (Fig. 3 C).One of the minimal regions required and sufficient for demethylation is only 78 bp in length (HS3.2(146–224)) (Fig. 7). None of the sequences analyzed for conferring demethylation in the other model systems could be delineated to such a small fragment. For both the α-actin promoter and the κ enhancer, DNA fragments of 800 bp to more than 1000 bp in length were required for demethylation (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,8Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Despite the complexity of the κ enhancer it could be shown that the absence of a single enhancer factor (nuclear factor-κB) leads to the failure of this fragment to undergo selective demethylation (33Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previous results on in vitro demethylation of hemimethylated DNA by chicken embryonic extracts suggested a glycosylase activity (34Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,35Jost J.P. Siegmann M. Sun L. Leung R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9734-9739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ras-induced overall demethylation in mouse embryonal P19 cells could be followed in vitro as well (36Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to embryonic cells and tissues, demethylation specific for differentiation and for particular sites may utilize a different mechanism. Recent achievements with in vitro demethylation showed that RNA is involved in sequence-specific demethylation (9Weiss A. Keshet I. Razin A. Cedar H. Cell. 1996; 86: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these authors showed that the tissue specificity of the demethylation reaction involves proteins as well.Taken together, these and our results demonstrate that the demethylation activity is mediated via enhancer elements and may be organized in a manner similar to that of the enhancer elements; that is, specific modules within the enhancer regions are either sufficient by themselves to mediate demethylation or have to act in combination with other modules. The mouse genome contains two lysozyme genes, a Paneth cell (P-lysozyme) 1The abbreviations used are: P-lysozyme, Paneth cell lysozyme; M-lysozyme, macrophage-specific lysozyme; kb, kilobase(s); HS, DNase I-hypersensitive; MLDE, M-lysozyme downstream enhancer (core); GABP, GA-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: P-lysozyme, Paneth cell lysozyme; M-lysozyme, macrophage-specific lysozyme; kb, kilobase(s); HS, DNase I-hypersensitive; MLDE, M-lysozyme downstream enhancer (core); GABP, GA-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. and a macrophage-specific (M-lysozyme) gene generated by a gene duplication event (1Cross M. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The M- and P-lysozyme genes are arranged in tandem with the coding regions separated by 5 kb (Fig. 1). Analysis of the M-lysozyme gene domain by DNase I digestion identified multiple hypersensitive (HS) sites in the 5′ and 3′ M-lysozyme gene-flanking regions in macrophage and myeloid precursor cell lines (Fig.1) (2Möllers B. Klages S. Wedel A. Cross M. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Only a single site in the 3′-flanking region (HS3) was dependent on the differentiation state of the cell line and correlated with M-lysozyme gene expression (2Möllers B. Klages S. Wedel A. Cross M. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transfection analysis of the flanking regions identified a single enhancer downstream of the M-gene which overlapped the HS3 site and is limited to the subregion HS3.2 (2Möllers B. Klages S. Wedel A. Cross M. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analysis of the HS3 region methylation state in M-lysozyme-expressing and nonexpressing cells demonstrated a correlation between undermethylation of this region with both the presence of the HS3 site and expression of the M-lysozyme gene. Further fine mapping identified a central core enhancer (MLDE), which is bound by a heterotetrameric GABP complex (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that GABP binding to the MLDE is methylation-sensitive (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, very likely, macrophage-specific demethylation of the single CpG dinucleotide within the MLDE is a mechanism to confer tissue-specific enhancer activity. In other systems, methylation of CpG dinucleotides has been correlated with transcriptional inactivity as well (for review, see Refs. 5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar and6Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In two cases, DNA transfections have identified quite complex DNA regions required for tissue-specific demethylation (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recent achievements in demethylating DNA in vitro (9Weiss A. Keshet I. Razin A. Cedar H. Cell. 1996; 86: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed an involvement of RNA and that tissue-specific proteins are required for the specificity of the reaction. Here, we wanted to analyze the mechanisms mediating macrophage-specific demethylation of the single CpG site within the mouse lysozyme enhancer core MLDE. We identified two short DNA regions of 163 and 79 bp which are required and sufficient for demethylation. The two fragments are overlapping, but the sequence in common is not sufficient for demethylation. DISCUSSIONMany examples have been identified linking sequence-specific DNA demethylation with differentiation of a particular tissue or cell type (for review, see Refs. 5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar and 6Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In these cases, it has been shown that the differentiation-dependent expression of a tissue-specific gene is correlated with the demethylation of flanking sequences. Such a demethylation is usually restricted to a specific region or at least to specific genes. For example, expression-linked demethylation has been seen for the genes coding for chicken vitellogenin, human dihydrofolate reductase, mouse collagen IV, rat α-actin, mouse κ chain, human estrogen receptor, human galectin-1, or mouse pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit, to name only a few (7Paroush Z.

Such a correlation has been found for the mouse M-lysozyme gene as well. The M-lysozyme gene is inactive in non-macrophage cells and shows a methylated CpG dinucleotide within the single HpaII recognition sequence of the downstream enhancer (3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, these authors showed that the tissue specificity of the demethylation reaction involves proteins as well.Taken together, these and our results demonstrate that the demethylation activity is mediated via enhancer elements and may be organized in a manner similar to that of the enhancer elements; that is, specific modules within the enhancer regions are either sufficient by themselves to mediate demethylation or have to act in combination with other modules. Many examples have been identified linking sequence-specific DNA demethylation with differentiation of a particular tissue or cell type (for review, see Refs. 5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar and 6Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In these cases, it has been shown that the differentiation-dependent expression of a tissue-specific gene is correlated with the demethylation of flanking sequences. Such a demethylation is usually restricted to a specific region or at least to specific genes. For example, expression-linked demethylation has been seen for the genes coding for chicken vitellogenin, human dihydrofolate reductase, mouse collagen IV, rat α-actin, mouse κ chain, human estrogen receptor, human galectin-1, or mouse pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit, to name only a few (7Paroush Z.

Dahl H.M. Gould J. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other genes, not expressed in this particular tissue, remain methylated. Such a correlation has been found for the mouse M-lysozyme gene as well. The M-lysozyme gene is inactive in non-macrophage cells and shows a methylated CpG dinucleotide within the single HpaII recognition sequence of the downstream enhancer (3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that during the differentiation of the multipotent FTCP-A4 cell line toward macrophages the enhancer loses its methyl groups (3Klages S. Möllers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human lysozyme gene has been found to be demethylated depending on the differentiation as seen inex vivo cultures of hematopoetic progenitor cells, whereas the gene coding for myeloperoxidase showed unaltered demethylation (23Lubbert M. Brugger W. Mertelsmann R. Kanz L. Blood. 1996; 87: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other myeloid-specific demethylation events have been shown as well to correlate with transcriptional activity, such as the c-fms gene and the regulatory region of the tumor necrosis factor-α gene (24Felgner J. Kreipe H. Heidorn K. Jaquet K. Heuss R. Zschunke F. Radzun H.J. Parwaresch M.R. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 420-425PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takei S. Fernandez D. Redford A. Toyoda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Many of the published examples could not distinguish between a role for the demethylation being required for transcriptional activity or a possible demethylation-inducing function mediated by transcription. In some cases, methylation-dependent repressor binding or inhibition of transcription factor binding could be demonstrated (5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar,26Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 27Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. Pawlak A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5771-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Saluz H.P. Feavers I.M. Jiricny J. Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6150-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For the mouse lysozyme gene, it was shown that within the core part of the downstream enhancer the heterotetrameric transcription factor GABP is required for full enhancer activity (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that the methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide within the enhancer core region inhibits in vitro DNA binding of GABP (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A similar sensitivity in methylated DNA binding was demonstrated for GABP and other ETS proteins in the context of binding sites that differ from the mouse lysozyme GABP binding site (30Yokomori N. Kobayashi R. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Gaston K. Fried M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 157: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Desmet C. Debacker O. Faraoni I. Lurquin C. Brasseur F. Boon T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This suggests that demethylation of this enhancer is a prerequisite for enhancer activity and therefore, for transcription. Here we show that the cis-element-dependent demethylation can be observed independent of the type of the neighboring DNA or promoter context. The 224-bp fragment HS3.2 can be stably transfected either fused to a eukaryotic reporter gene or to a prokaryotic vector and will be demethylated in both cases. Therefore, the lysozyme downstream enhancer confers at least two functions. One function is to mediate the demethylation during differentiation, and another function is to activate gene transcription by the bound enhancer factors. A similar dual activity has been demonstrated for the α-actin promoter and the κ enhancer (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our transfection data suggest that the MLDE fragment within the downstream enhancer is not sufficient to mediate demethylation. This fragment harbors the single HpaII site and binds the heterotetrameric GABP factor in the absence of methylation. Here we have shown that even a single methyl group on the lower strand is sufficient to inhibit GABP binding, whereas the hemimethylated upper strand does not interfere with binding. Since GABP binding is impaired even by hemimethylated DNA, this factor cannot be the cause for demethylation. This is in contrast to the mechanism observed in the context of Sp1 binding (15Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Sp1 is able to bind methylated DNA and after replication prevents the maintenance methylase from modifying the newly synthesized DNA strand. Such a Sp1-like activity could have been envisioned to be utilized by an unknown factor that has been found to bind to the GABP response element even in the case of a fully methylated DNA (4Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If this factor would indeed play such a role, this function would not be sufficient for demethylation, since we have shown that the methylated MLDE fragment is not demethylated (Fig. 6). Within the group of fragments mediating demethylation, there seems to be a bias in demethylation efficiency: all of the fragments extending up to the position 224 (Fig. 7; i.e. fragments HS3/6, HS3.2, 82–224, 146–224) mediate 90–100% demethylation. In contrast, fragments with a downstream deletion (Fig. 7;i.e. fragments 1–181, 1–163) mediate demethylation for only 70–80% of the molecules. Nevertheless, two different sets of fragments, overlapping in the GABP site only, confer demethylation. Computer analysis of the sequences flanking the GABP site did not reveal any consensus in common, which otherwise might have been an indication for trans-acting proteins required for demethylation. In addition, in vitro footprinting showed only one protected region in addition to the GABP site (Fig. 3 C). One of the minimal regions required and sufficient for demethylation is only 78 bp in length (HS3.2(146–224)) (Fig. 7). None of the sequences analyzed for conferring demethylation in the other model systems could be delineated to such a small fragment. For both the α-actin promoter and the κ enhancer, DNA fragments of 800 bp to more than 1000 bp in length were required for demethylation (7Paroush Z. Keshet I. Yisraeli J. Cedar H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,8Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Despite the complexity of the κ enhancer it could be shown that the absence of a single enhancer factor (nuclear factor-κB) leads to the failure of this fragment to undergo selective demethylation (33Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previous results on in vitro demethylation of hemimethylated DNA by chicken embryonic extracts suggested a glycosylase activity (34Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,35Jost J.P. Siegmann M. Sun L. Leung R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9734-9739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ras-induced overall demethylation in mouse embryonal P19 cells could be followed in vitro as well (36Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to embryonic cells and tissues, demethylation specific for differentiation and for particular sites may utilize a different mechanism. Recent achievements with in vitro demethylation showed that RNA is involved in sequence-specific demethylation (9Weiss A. Keshet I. Razin A. Cedar H. Cell. 1996; 86: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these authors showed that the tissue specificity of the demethylation reaction involves proteins as well. Taken together, these and our results demonstrate that the demethylation activity is mediated via enhancer elements and may be organized in a manner similar to that of the enhancer elements; that is, specific modules within the enhancer regions are either sufficient by themselves to mediate demethylation or have to act in combination with other modules.

https://openalex.org/W2122027285,"In cells exposed to brefeldin A (BFA), enzymes of the Golgi apparatus are redistributed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde membrane flow, where they may cause modifications on resident ER proteins. We have used a truncated form of the rough ER-specific type I transmembrane glycoprotein ribophorin I as a probe to detect Golgi glycosyltransferases relocated to the ER in a BFA-dependent fashion. This polypeptide (RI<sub>332</sub>) comprises the 332 amino-terminal amino acids of ribophorin I and behaves like a luminal ER protein when expressed in HeLa cells. Upon treatment of the cells with BFA, RI<sub>332</sub>becomes quantitatively <i>O</i>-glycosylated by Golgi glycosyltransferases that are transported back to the ER. Here we demonstrate that pretreatment of the cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, abrogates this modification and that mevalonate, the product formed in the step inhibited by the drug, is able to counteract the effect of lovastatin. We also show by immunofluorescence using mannosidase II as a Golgi marker that the BFA-induced retrograde transport of Golgi enzymes is blocked by lovastatin, although electron microscopy indicates that BFA causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus into swollen vesicles and tubules. Our observations support the role of a prenylated protein, such as the geranylgeranylated small G protein Rab6, in the retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, since lovastatin acts by inhibiting its prenylation."
