https://openalex.org/W2032320245,"Antibody prepared against a group of keratins purified from human stratum corneum was used to identify cells containing keratins by immunofluorescence. In sectioned tissue and in culture, keratinocytes of skin and other stratified squamous epithelia-whether human, rabbit of mouse-stained strongly, indicating homologous amino acid sequences in the keratins of these species. In all cases, the antibody revealed a dense cytoplasmic network of discrete fibers probably consisting of aggregated (tono-) filaments. The pattern of staining was not affected by cytochalasin B or colcemid. No keratins were detected in cultured cells of mesenchymal origin (3T3, NIL, BHK, human diploid fibroblasts) or in connective tissues, indicating that the 100 A filaments of fibroblasts are not related to the keratins. Keratinocytes at all stages of differentiation, including basal cells, stained brightly and therefore contained abundant keratins."

https://openalex.org/W1989744507,"Amino acid starvation is shown to decrease the fidelity of translation in E. coli. When proteins are analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, missense errors are detected as an unusual heterogeneity in their isoelectric points, while premature termination of protein synthesis can be recognized by a decreased relative rate of synthesis of higher molecular weight proteins and by the accumulation of a complex group of new small polypeptides. The types of translational errors observed are amino acid-specific. For example, starvation of a rel− strain for histidine produces severe isoelectric point heterogeneity with little evidence of premature termination, while starvation for leucine has little effect on the isoelectric points, but produces a drastic decrease in the average molecular weight of the newly synthesized protein. These differences suggest codon-specific errors in reading the genetic code. In these rel− cells, the effect of amino acid starvation on the rates of synthesis of complete individual proteins is both protein- and amino acid-specific. For example, ribosomal protein L7/ 12, which lacks histidine, is made at a higher level during histidine starvation than during isoleucine or leucine starvation. This suggests that in rel− cells, the modulation of gene expression caused by the lack of a particular amino acid is, at least in part, a function of the abundance of that amino acid in particular proteins-that is, the response of rel− cells to starvation is consistent with the theory that the inhibition of protein synthesis and the accompanying increase in error frequency both result from low levels of the correct substrate. In marked contrast, virtually no starvation-induced translational errors are detected in a rel+ strain, and the response is not amino acid-specific. Various data strongly imply that in this rel+ strain, essentially all the changes caused by starvation are due to the accumulation of ppGpp, which independently reduces protein synthesis, thereby suppressing all the direct effects of amino acid limitation seen in rel− strains (where ppGpp does not accumulate upon starvation). A model is presented which describes how ppGpp might suppress the direct effects of starvation and avoid the loss of translational fidelity. In addition, the direct and specific effects of ppGpp on gene expression are examined independently of amino acid starvation."

https://openalex.org/W1985019798,"This article reports a study of the activities and performance of institutional review boards to protect human research subjects. Researchers and institutional review board members were generally supportive of the review system, although substantial criticisms were also heard. Institutional review boards had some direct impact on half of the proposals reviewed by requiring either modification of or additional information about proposed research. The data, however, raise questions about the effectiveness of some review board actions, for example, with regard to informed consent. Some policy implications of the study are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1527150217,"As an approach to the study of the relationship between the structure of sterols and their capacity to function in the lipid leaflet of membranes, various sterols were examined for their ability to support the growth of anaerobic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A marked dependence on precise structural features was observed in growth-response and morphology. Of the chemical groups which distinguish ergosterol, the main sterol of S. cerevisiae, the hydroxyl group at C-3 was obligatory, and the other groups were found to be of the following relative importance: 24beta-methyl-delta22-grouping greater than 24beta-methyl group greater than delta5,7-diene system = delta5-bond approximately or equal to no double bond. Methyl groups at C-4 and C-14 were inconsistent with activity. Consequently, the data strongly suggest that the normal biosynthetic processes removal of methyl groups from the nucleus and introduction of one in the side chain are of functional significance. A double bond between C-17 and C-20 joining the steroidal side chain to the nucleus had no deleterious effect on the growth process but only if C-22 was trans-oriented to C-13. In the cis-case no growth at all proceeded. This means the natural sterol probably acts functionally in the form of its preferred conformer in which C-22 is to the right (right-handed) in the usual view. Since the placing of a substituent (OH or CH3) in the molecule at C-20 in such a way that it appears on the front side in the right-handed conformer completely destroyed activity, the sterol apparently presents its front face to protein or phospholipid when complexing occurs."

The procedure is described in detail. Its use allows the documentation by immunofluorescence microscopy of the three-dimensional display and organization of microfilament bundles, microtubules and tonofilaments in some well characterized tissue culture cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2025942395,"The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi metabolizes allopurinol by a sequential conversion to allopurinol mononucleotide and aminopurinol mononucleotide. The latter is incorporated into RNA. This transformation of a widely used innocuous agent, allopurinol, into a toxic adenine analog appears to account for the antiprotozoan effect of allopurinol. These unique enzymatic activities appear to occur only in T. cruzi and the pathogenic lesihaminae. Allopurinol may serve as a model for the synthesis of similar antiprotozoan agents."
https://openalex.org/W1568534357,"Thioesterases I and II of Escherichia coli hydrolyze the thioester linkages between fatty acid and CoA or acyl carrier protein (ACP). Previous workers had shown that chemically synthesized acyl-ACP substrates were hydrolyzed about 20-fold more slowly than the analogous CoA thioesters, and had suggested that the slower rate might be the result of modifications of the protein moiety which had occurred during the chemical synthesis. We have prepared a series of acyl-ACP substrates using acyl-ACP synthetase, a recently discovered enzyme which ligates long chain fatty acids to ACP. We have found that these preparations of native acyl-ACP are hydrolyzed much more slowly by both thioesterases than the analogous acyl-CoA or chemically synthesized acyl-ACP thioesters. The Michaelis constants (Km) of both thioesterases for native palmitoyl-ACP are 100 to 200 PM, a value over lo-fold higher than those reported for palmitoyl-CoA. The V,,, values of both enzymes for native palmitoyl-ACP are much lower than the values measured for palmitoyl-CoA. In the chemical procedure for acylating ACP, the amino groups are acetylated. This modification appears responsible for the differing rates of hydrolysis of native acyl-ACP and the substrates made chemically. Acetylation of our native palmitoyl-ACP increases the rate of hydrolysis of this substrate by both thioesterases. This modification of ACP is known to destabilize the tertiary structure of ACP under ionic conditions similar to those utilized in our assays. The greater rate of thioesterase cleavage of the chemically synthesized acyl-ACP over the native acyl-ACP can therefore be attributed to denaturation of the protein moiety of the former thioester."

https://openalex.org/W1505467882,"A homogenate of mechanically broken, freshly grown Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 cells catalyzes the transfer of mannosylphosphate units from guanosine diphosphate mannose to reduced alpha1 leads to 2-[3H]mannotetraose to yield reduced mannosylphosphoryl [3H]-mannotetraose. The product is analogous in structure to the phosphorylated mannan side chains, which suggests that the enzymic activity is involved in mannoprotein biosynthesis in the intact cell. The mannosylphosphate transferase activity, localized in a membrane fraction obtained by differential centrifugation at 100,000 x g, was solubilized by Triton X-155 and purified 250-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by ion exchange and gell filtration chromatographies. The enzyme requires MN2+ OR Co2+ ions for activity and is stimulated by various detergents. The mnn2 and mnn3 mannan mutants of S. cerevisiae possess normal levels of mannosylphosphate transferase activity, whereas the mnn4 mutant cells contain very low, if any, activity. This is consistent with a previous conclusion that the mnn4 mutation affects the mannosylphosphate transferase activity, whereas the mnn2 and mnn3 strains possess phosphate-deficient mannans because they are unable to synthesize the appropriate side chain precursors. A new mannan mutant class with the mnn4 chemotype was isolated, but the mutation proved to be recessive and nonallelic with the mnn4 locus. This new locus is designated mnn6."

https://openalex.org/W1491397307,"[3H]Pyridoxal-P can be covalently incorporated into Escherichia coli B mutant strain AC70R1 ADP-glucose synthase by reduction with NaBH4. Two distinct lysine residues can be modified by the allosteric activator pyridoxal-P. Incorporation of [3H]pyridoxal-P in the presence of substrate ADP-glucose + MgCl2 prevents pyridoxylation of an ADP-glucose-protected site and allows modification of the allosteric activator site. Incorporation of [3H]pyridoxal-P in the presence of allosteric effectors fructose-P2, 5'-AMP, or hexanediol-1,6-P2, protects against pyridoxylation of the allosteric activator site, and allows modification of the ADP-glucose-protected site. Incorporation of pyridoxal-P into the allosteric activator site results in modified enzyme of high activity form, even in the absence of fructose-P2. This modified enzyme, when assayed in the absence of fructose-P2, exhibits activation kinetics similar to nonpyridoxylated enzyme assayed in the presence of fructose-P2 and is still inhibited by 5'-AMP. These data suggest that the allosteric activator site of pyridoxylation is the fructose-P2 binding site, and is distinct from the inhibitor 5'-AMP binding site. Incorporation of pyridoxal-P into the ADP-glucose-protected site results in a decrease in enzyme activity. This pyridoxylated lysine could be involved with the binding of thesubstrates ADP-glucose, alpha-glucose-1-P, or PPi, or participate in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2163523869,"Abstract Several beta replacement and alpha,beta elimination reactions catalyzed by tryptophanase from Escherichia coli are shown to proceed stereospecifically with retention of configuration. These conversions include synthesis of tryptophan from (2S,3R)- and (2s,3s)-[3(-3H)]serine in the presence of indole, deamination of these serines in D2O to pyruvate and ammonia, and cleavage of (2S,3R)-and (2S,3S)-[3(-3H)]tryptophan in D2O to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia. A coupled reaction with lactate dehydrogenase was used to trap the stereospecifically labeled [3-H,2H,3H]pryuvates as lactate, which was oxidized to acetate for chirality analysis of the methyl group. During deamination of tryptophan there is significant intramolecular transfer of the alpha proton of the amino acid to C-3 of indole. To determine the exposed face of the cofactor.substrate complex on the enzyme surface and to analyze its conformational orientation, sodium boro[3H]hydride was used to reduce tryptophanase-bound alaninepyridoxal phosphate Schiff's base. Degradation of the resulting pyridoxylalanine to (2S)-[2(-3H)]alanine and (4'S)-[4'(-3H)]pyridoxamine demonstrates that reduction occurs from the exposed si face at C-4' of the complex and that the ketimine double bond is trans."

https://openalex.org/W93240333,"Escherichia coli B, grown under aerobic conditions, contains at least three distinct superoxide dismutases, which can be visualized on polyacrylamide gel electropherograms of crude soluble extracts of the sonically disrupted cells. Of these, the slowest migrating and the fastest migrating, respectively, have previously been isolated and characterized as manganese-containing and iron-containing enzymes. The enzyme form with medium electrophoretic mobility has now been purified to homogeneity. Its molecular weight is approximately 37,000 and it contains 0.8 atoms of iron/molecule and only negligible amounts of manganese. Like other iron-containing superoxide dismutases and unlike the corresponding manganienzymes, it is inactivated by EDTA plus H2O2. Its specific activity is comparable to that of the other superoxide dismutases of E. coli. Two types of subunits could be distinguished upon electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. One of these migrated identically with the subunit obtained from the manganisuperoxide dismutase, while the other similarly appeared identical with the subunit from the ferrisuperoxide dismutase. This newly isolated enzyme thus appears to be a hybrid of the other two forms. In support of this conclusion, we observed that ultrafiltration or storage of the new superoxide dismutase gave rise to the mangani- and ferrienzymes on disc gel electrophoresis or isoelectric focussing."

https://openalex.org/W1589445219,"A new approach to studying the arrangement of subunits in the multienzyme complex tryptophan synthase is reported. Comparative studies of limited tryptic proteolysis of the alpha2beta2 complex and of the separate beta2 and alpha subunits show that subunit association inhibits two types of proteolysis which occur with the separate subunits: (i) cleavage of the beta2 subunit to two fragments with consequent loss of activity and (ii) complete degradation of the alpha subunit with loss of activity. Trypsin treatment of the alpha2beta complex does, however, result in at least one cleavage of the alpha subunit and yields an active alpha'2beta2 complex. The alpha'2beta2 complex can be resolved into an active beta2 subunit and an active alpha derivative termed alpha'. These two species can reassociate into the active alpha'2beta2 complex. alpha' derivative can be separated into a large fragment of Mr approximately 20,000 to 23,000 and a small peptide by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1494624428,"The reversible, noncovalent binding of inorganic phosphate to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase at pH 8 has been examined by equilibrium dialysis at two temperatures and two ionic strengths. Binding occurs with a stoichiometry of two phosphate ions per dimeric enzyme molecule and a single dissociation constant that is not very sensitive to temperature or ionic strength. These results contradict published evidence for anti-cooperative binding of inorganic phosphate to alkaline phosphatase. Reasons are presented for believing that the apparent anti-cooperativity reported by other workers is artifactual."
https://openalex.org/W1569798732,"3-Dehydroquinate synthase was purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. It was found to be a single polypeptide chain of Mr = approximately 57,000. Reaction mixtures of pure enzyme and the substrate, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate, were incubated for short times and treated with NaB3H4. The resulting 3-deoxyheptonic acid 7-phosphate was degraded with sodium periodate, and formic acid representing C-5 of the substrate was isolated. The presence of 3H in the formate corresponding to 15% of the enzyme was interpreted as indicating a 5-dehydro derivative of the substrate as an intermediate of the reaction. Quinic acid, resulting from reduction of 3-dehydroquinate with NaB3H4, was also isolated and degraded with periodate. The formate from C-4 of the quinate was unlabeled, indicating that 3,4-bisdehydroquinate is not an intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1516908060,"The purification of the Escherichia coli dnaB protein by affinity chromatography on nucleotides bound to agarose is described. The dnaB protein, which contains an associated ribonucleoside triphosphatase activity (Wickner, S., Wright, M., and Hurwitz, J. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 783-787) binds to immobilized ATP, ADP, and UDP, but not to AMP. The type of linkage of ATP to agarose influences the adsorption, elution, and purification of the enzyme. Optimal purification is achieved using ATP bound to agarose via its oxidized ribose moiety. By this means, the dnaB protein can be obtained at least 95% electrophoretically pure after only three purification steps. The enzyme can be eluted from immobilized nucleoside-5'-di- and -triphosphates by ATP, ADP, and pyrophosphate, but not by AMP or orthophosphate. ADP and pyrophosphate, as well as the substrate ATP in high concentration are at the same time inhibitors of the ribonucleoside triphosphatase. The dnaB complementing and ribonucleoside triphosphatase activities could not be separated from each other by affinity chromatography, supporting the finding of others that they both reside on the same protein complex, namely a dnaB multimer. The results indicate that the dnaB protein binds to immobilized nucleotides by means of its ribonucleoside triphosphatase, and that at least the pyrophosphate moiety is essential for adsorption as well as elution of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1484214496,"Abstract The phosphorylation state of thioredoxin was compared in intact cells and in crude extracts. In crude extracts, the extent of phosphorylation was 0.70 to 0.80 mol of phosphate per mol of thioredoxin, with approximately equal amounts of thioredoxin phosphorylated either on cysteinyl32 (formula: see text) or on cysteinyl35 (formula: see text). By comparison, the extent of thioredoxin phosphorylation in intact cells was nearly 1.0 with phosphate present almost exclusively on cysteine32. Nonphosphorylated thioredoxin was present as the reduced thiol form (formula: see text). These findings imply that (formula: see text) is the relevant in vivo species and that a mechanism is operative in crude extracts for transfer of phosphate from cysteine32 to cysteine35."
https://openalex.org/W2053862711,Perifusion experiments have shown that there is a discharge of inorganic phosphate into the medium when insulin secretion from isolated islets is stimulated by glucose. Histochemical and microprobe examination of resting pancreatic islets in the electron microscope shows a specific accumulation of inorganic phosphate adjacent to the plasmalemma and nucleolus of the B (beta) cells. This phossphate is lost from the cells during secretory stimulation of islets with high concentrations of glucose.

https://openalex.org/W1514455324,"The restriction enzyme from a restriction and modification-deficient strain of Escherichia coli K mutated in the modification gene (hsdM) has been purified using an in vitro complementation assay with a mutant restriction enzyme from a strain lacking only restriction. The restriction enzyme from the hsdM mutant lacks all of the activities that are associated with the wild type enzyme: binding of unmodified DNA to filters, cleavage, or methylation of unmodified DNA and ATP hydrolysis. It is shown that the enzyme from this hsdM mutant cannot bind S-adenosylmethionine, an allosteric effector in the restriction reaction. In the absence of enzyme activation by S-adenosylmethionine, no binding to unmodified DNA takes place. A comparison with other mutant restriction enzymes allows us to outline the biochemical role of the subunits of the E. coli K restriction endonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W101086970,"Poly(A) synthesis and degradation have been examined in Escherichia coli cells made permeable to nucleotides by treatment with toluene. Although newly synthesized poly(A) is normally rapidly degraded in this system, extraction of the soluble portion of the cell effectively eliminates this process without affecting poly(A) synthesis. Poly(A) synthesis in this system displays many properties associated with poly(A) synthesis by purified poly(A) polymerase in vitro including a lag in polymerization, stimulation by increased ionic strength, and a low Mg2+ optimum. As with the purified enzyme, this system uses both ADP and ATP as substrates, requires conversion of ATP to ADP, and is strongly inhibited by dADP, orthophosphate, and pyrophosphate. In contrast to the purified poly(A) polymerase, the permeable cell system displays some properties suggestive of in vivo poly(A) metabolism. Thus, the permeable cells require an endogenous RNA primer for activity, the poly(A) product remains with the cells, and the reaction is greatly stimulated by polyamines. This system should prove extremely useful for studies of poly(A) metabolism in E. coli. A surprising feature of these studies was the finding that mutant strains deficient in polynucleotide phosphorylase were unable to synthesize poly(A). The possible roles of polynucleotide phosphorylase and poly(A) in E. coli are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1527852344,"The metabolism of Zn2+ in Escherichia coli infected with T4D bacteriophage and various T4D mutants has been examined. E. coli B infected with T4D, and all T4D mutants except T4D 12-, took up zinc ions at a rate identical to that of uninfected cells. E. coli B infected with T4D 12- had a markedly decreased rate of zinc uptake. The incorporation of zinc into proteins of infected cells has also been studied. T4D phage infection was found to shut off the synthesis of all bacterial host zinc metalloproteins while allowing the formation of viral-induced zinc proteins. The amount of zinc incorporated into viral proteins was affected by the absence of various T4D gene products. Cells infected with T4D 12-, and to a much less extent those infected with T4D 29-, incorporated the least amount of zinc into proteins, while cells infected with T4D 11- and T4D 51- incorporated increased amounts of zinc into the zinc metalloproteins. In cells infected with T4D 11- and 51- most of the zinc protein was found to be the product of gene 12. The marked effect of infection of E. coli with T4D 12- on both zinc uptake and zinc incorporation into protein supports the conclusion that T4D gene 12 protein is a zinc metalloprotein. Additionally, these observations have indicated that this metalloprotein interacts with host cell membrane."
