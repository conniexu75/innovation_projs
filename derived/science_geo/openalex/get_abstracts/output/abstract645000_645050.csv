https://openalex.org/W2998238740,"Background Breast cancer is the primary cause of cancer death among women globally, responsible for about 425,000 deaths in 2010. This study assessed the awareness, knowledge and practices of breast self-examination as a method of prevention and early diagnosis of breast cancer among reproductive aged women in Akatsi South district in Volta region of Ghana. Methods This study was a cross-sectional study involving 385 women between the ages of 15–49 years. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire and variables included socio-demographic characteristics, breast cancer knowledge, breast self-examination knowledge and practice. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present the data and chi square test of significance was used to determine association between socio-demographic variable and practice of breast self-examination. Results The mean age of the women was 24.54±7.19. Only 3.1% of women had no formal education and 58.9% were single. Although 88.3% of the respondents were aware of breast cancer, 64.9% of the respondents had good or sufficient knowledge of breast cancer and only 94(37.6%) practice BSE. Over 50% of the respondents did not know how to perform BSE. There was a significant association between knowledge on breast cancer and practice of BSE (χ2 = 36.218 p = 0.000). The higher the age of a participant, the lower practice of breast self-examination and this was significant (χ2 = 11.324, p = 0.003). Conclusion Breast self-examination is a key strategy to early detection of breast cancer and subsequently critical for effective treatment and cure of the disease. The findings in this study have shown significant low levels of awareness and practice of breast self-examination among women in Akatsi South district of the Volta region. This pattern may be similar to other rural communities across the region. The need to create awareness and to educate women, especially rural women, on importance of breast self-examination as preventive measure for breast cancer is paramount."
https://openalex.org/W2998050414,"Feral pigeons, common wood pigeons and Eurasian collared doves are the most common representatives of the Columbidae family in Switzerland and are mostly present in highly populated, urban areas. Pigeons may carry various members of the obligate intracellular Chlamydiaceae family, particularly Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, a known zoonotic agent, and C. avium. The objective of the study was to identify the infection rates of common free-roaming pigeons for different Chlamydia species with the overall aim to assess the risk pigeons pose to public health. In this study, 431 pigeons (323 feral pigeons, 34 domestic pigeons, 39 Eurasian collared doves, 35 common wood pigeons) from several geographic locations in Switzerland were investigated for the presence of Chlamydiaceae. Samples consisted of pooled choanal-cloacal swabs (n = 174), liver samples (n = 52), and paired swab and liver samples from 205 pigeons (n = 410). All 636 samples were screened using a Chlamydiaceae family-specific 23S rRNA real-time PCR (qPCR). Subsequent species identification was performed by DNA-microarray assay, sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene fragment and a C. psittaci specific qPCR. In total, 73 of the 431 pigeons tested positive for Chlamydiaceae, of which 68 were positive for C. psittaci, four were C. avium-positive and one pigeon was co-infected with C. avium and C. psittaci. The highest infection rates were detected in feral (64/323) and domestic pigeons (5/34). Common wood pigeons (2/35) and Eurasian collared doves (2/39) revealed lower infection rates. Additionally, multilocus sequence typing of twelve selected C. psittaci-positive samples revealed closely related sequence types (ST) between and within different Swiss cities. Furthermore, liver and corresponding swab samples from the same bird were colonized by the same ST. Considering the high infection rates of C. psittaci in domestic and feral pigeons, close or frequent contact to these birds poses a human health risk."
https://openalex.org/W2998727606,"This paper reports the diversity of fungi associated with substrates collected at a shallow hydrothermal vent field at Kueishan Island, Taiwan, using both culture-based and metabarcoding methods. Culture of fungi from yellow sediment (with visible sulfur granules), black sediment (no visible sulfur granules), the vent crab Xenograpsus testudinatus, seawater and, animal egg samples resulted in a total of 94 isolates. Species identification based on the internal transcribed spacer regions of the rDNA revealed that the yellow sediment samples had the highest species richness with 25 species, followed by the black sediment (23) and the crab (13). The Ascomycota was dominant over the Basidiomycota; the dominant orders were Agaricales, Capnodiales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, Polyporales and Xylariales. Hortaea werneckii was the only common fungus isolated from the crab, seawater, yellow and black sediment samples. The metabarcoding analysis amplifying a small fragment of the rDNA (from 18S to 5.8S) recovered 7–27 species from the black sediment and 12–27 species from the yellow sediment samples and all species belonged to the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. In the yellow sediments, the dominant order was Pleosporales and this order was also dominant in the black sediment together with Sporidiobolales. Based on the results from both methods, 54 and 49 species were found in the black and yellow sediments, respectively. Overall, a higher proportion of Ascomycota (~70%) over Basidiomycota was recovered in the yellow sediment and the two phyla were equally abundant in the black sediment. The top five dominant fungal orders in descending order based on species richness were Pleosporales>Eurotiales>Polyporales>Hypocreales>Capnodiales in the black sediment samples, and Polyporales>Pleosporales>Eurotiales>Capnodiales>Hypocreales in the yellow sediment samples. This study is the first to observe a high diversity of fungi associated with various substrates at a marine shallow water hydrothermal vent ecosystem. While some fungi found in this study were terrestrial species and their airborne spores might have been deposited into the marine sediment, several pathogenic fungi of animals, including Acremonium spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Malassezia spp., Hortaea werneckii, Parengyodontium album, and Westerdykella dispersa, were recovered suggesting that these fungi may be able to cause diseases of marine animals."
https://openalex.org/W2997762956,"Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a prion disease affecting several cervid species. Among them, white-tailed deer (WTD) are of relevance due to their value in farming and game hunting. The exact events involved in CWD transmission in captive and wild animals are still unclear. An unexplored mechanism of CWD spread involves transmissions through germplasm, such as semen. Surprisingly, the presence and load of CWD prions in semen and male sexual tissues from WTD has not been explored. Here, we described the detection of CWD prions in semen and sexual tissues of WTD bucks utilizing the Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) technology. Samples were obtained post-mortem from farmed pre-clinical, CWD positive WTD bucks possessing polymorphisms at position 96 of the PRNP gene. Our results show that overall CWD detection in these samples had a sensitivity of 59.3%, with a specificity of 97.2%. The data indicate that the presence of CWD prions in male sexual organs and fluids is prevalent in late stage, pre-clinical, CWD-infected WTD (80%-100% of the animals depending on the sample type analyzed). Our findings reveal the presence of CWD prions in semen and sexual tissues of prion infected WTD bucks. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether sexual contact and/or artificial inseminations are plausible means of CWD transmission in susceptible animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2997697448,"With the acceleration of global urbanization and climate change, dengue fever is spreading worldwide. Different levels of dengue fever have also occurred in China, especially in southern China, causing enormous economic losses. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for dengue, and the most popular dengue vaccine does not exhibit good curative effects. Therefore, we developed a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) that gathered climate factors (mean temperature, relative humidity and precipitation) and Baidu search data during 2011-2015 in Guangzhou city to improve the accuracy of dengue fever prediction. Firstly, the time series dengue fever data were decomposed into seasonal, trend and remainder components by the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL). Secondly, the time lag of variables was determined in cross-correlation analysis and the order of autocorrelation was estimated using autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). Finally, the GAMM was built and evaluated by comparing it with Generalized Additive Mode (GAM). Experimental results indicated that the GAMM (R2: 0.95 and RMSE: 34.1) has a superior prediction capability than GAM (R2: 0.86 and RMSE: 121.9). The study could help the government agencies and hospitals respond early to dengue fever outbreak."

Findings from 3,071 faculty participants (70% female, 69 countries) over three time points (5–6 month lags) showed greater self-efficacy at baseline to correspond with lower procrastination and burnout, and procrastination to be positively related to burnout (intercepts). Growth analyses additionally revealed stronger relations between increases in self-efficacy, procrastination, and burnout over time (slopes). Supplemental cross-lagged analyses provided causal evidence of burnout as an antecedent of self-efficacy and procrastination, underscoring intervention and policy efforts to address overwork and exhaustion in post-secondary faculty."
https://openalex.org/W2996803268,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is an important clinical concern in patients, and is often associated with significant disease burden and metastatic infections. There is an increasing evidence of heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) associated treatment failure. In this study, we aim to understand the molecular mechanism of teicoplanin resistant MRSA (TR-MRSA) and hVISA. A total of 482 MRSA isolates were investigated for these phenotypes. Of the tested isolates, 1% were identified as TR-MRSA, and 12% identified as hVISA. A highly diverse amino acid substitution was observed in tcaRAB, vraSR, and graSR genes in TR-MRSA and hVISA strains. Interestingly, 65% of hVISA strains had a D148Q mutation in the graR gene. However, none of the markers were reliable in differentiating hVISA from TR-MRSA. Significant pbp2 upregulation was noted in three TR-MRSA strains, which had teicoplanin MICs of 16 or 32 μg/ml, whilst significant pbp4 downregulation was not noted in these strains. In our study, multiple mutations were identified in the candidate genes, suggesting a complex evolutionary pathway involved in the development of TR-MRSA and hVISA strains."
https://openalex.org/W2998437594,"The present work reports the enzymatic valorisation of the protein fraction of scotta, a dairy by-product representing the exhausted liquid residue of ricotta production. Scotta was subjected to ultra-filtration with membrane cut-offs from 500 to 4 kDa and the obtained protein-enriched fractions were used for the optimization of enzyme-based digestions aimed at producing potentially bioactive peptides. Nine different commercial proteases were tested and the best digestion conditions were selected based on protein yield, fraction bioactivity and foreseen scale up processing costs. Scale up of the 3% Pancreatin or 5% Papain processes was performed up to 2 L (37°C or 60°C respectively, 1 h incubation), and the digestion efficiency increased with the reaction volume as well as antioxidant activity (up to 60 gBSA eq/L and to 1.7 gAA eq/L). Retentate 1 digested fractions also showed, for the first time in dairy-based peptides, anti-tyrosinase activity, up to 0.14 gKA eq/L. Digested proteins were sub-fractionated by means of physical membrane separations and 30–10 kDa fraction from Papain treatment showed the highest antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities. The peptide sequence of the most bioactive fractions was achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2997249220,"Introduction Multimorbidity in advanced age and the need for drug treatment may lead to polypharmacy, while pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes may increase the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). Objective The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of subjects using potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) in a cohort of older and predominantly healthy adults in relation to polypharmacy and morbidity. Methods Cross-sectional data were available from 1,382 study participants (median age 69 years, IQR 67–71, 51.3% females) of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). PIM was classified according to the EU(7)-PIM and German PRISCUS (representing a subset of the former) list. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant use of at least five drugs. A morbidity index (MI) largely based on the Charlson Index was applied to evaluate the morbidity burden. Results Overall, 24.1% of the participants were affected by polypharmacy. On average, men used 2 (IQR 1–4) and women 3 drugs (IQR 1–5). According to PRISCUS and EU(7)-PIM, 5.9% and 22.6% of participants received at least one PIM, while use was significantly more prevalent in females (25.5%) compared to males (19.6%) considering EU(7)-PIM (p = 0.01). In addition, morbidity in males receiving PIM according to EU(7)-PIM was higher (median MI 1, IQR 1–3) compared to males without PIM use (median MI 1, IQR 0–2, p<0.001). Conclusion PIM use occurred more frequently in women than in men, while it was associated with higher morbidity in males. As expected, EU(7)-PIM identifies more subjects as PIM users than the PRISCUS list but further studies are needed to investigate the differential impact of both lists on ADEs and outcome. Key points We found PIM use to be associated with a higher number of regular medications and with increased morbidity. Additionally, we detected a higher prevalence of PIM use in females compared to males, suggesting that women and people needing intensive drug treatment are patient groups, who are particularly affected by PIM use."
https://openalex.org/W2997112748,"To report demographic characteristics of a contemporary population of dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma and assess the relationship between demographic characteristics, site distribution, and phylogenetic breed clusters.Retrospective case series.A search of the Veterinary Medical Database was performed for dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma as a new diagnosis. Entries were reviewed for the sex, neuter status, age at diagnosis, breed, affected limb, and tumor location. The reported breed for purebred dogs was used to categorize each dog into one of five phylogenetic groups based on microsatellite analysis.744 client-owned dogs were included in the study. Study dogs were represented by a male-to-female ratio of 0.95:1.0, the majority of which (80.9%) were neutered. Most dogs were diagnosed between 7-10 years of age. The majority (77.8%) of dogs were large or giant-breed dogs. Purebred dogs comprised 80.4% of the population. The most common purebred breed affected by OS was the Rottweiler (17.1%). The most common phylogenetic group represented was Mastiff-Terrier (M-T, 26.3%). OS was more commonly located in the forelimb (64.2%) versus the hindlimb (35.8%), and the humerus was the most common site (20.9%). The distribution of age groups and tumor locations were significantly different between phylogenetic clusters. The distribution of age groups and neuter status were significantly different between size groups.The demographic data of canine appendicular OS are similar to previous reports. The data on phylogenetic associations can guide future studies aimed at evaluating the genomic mutations that contribute to OS development and its biological behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2998183009,"Accumulating evidence indicates that there is an interaction between the gut microbiota and endometriotic lesions. The new formation of these lesions is associated with stem cell recruitment, angiogenesis and inflammation, which may affect the composition of the gut microbiota. To test this hypothesis, we herein induced endometriotic lesions by transplantation of uterine tissue fragments from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ donor mice into the peritoneal cavity of GFP- C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Sham-transplanted animals served as controls. Fecal pellets of the animals were collected 3 days before as well as 7 and 21 days after the induction of endometriosis to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota by means of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The transplantation of uterine tissue fragments resulted in the establishment of endometriotic lesions in all analyzed mice. These lesions exhibited a typical histomorphology with endometrial glands surrounded by a vascularized stroma. Due to their bright GFP signal, they could be easily differentiated from the surrounding GFP- host tissue. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were successfully PCR-amplified from the DNA extracts of all obtained mice fecal samples. However, no significant effect of endometriosis induction on the composition of the bacterial microbiota was detected with our experimental setup. Our findings allow careful speculation that endometriosis in mice does not induce pronounced dysbiosis during the acute phase of lesion formation."
https://openalex.org/W2998541771,"Aim 
To explore experiences of health services and unmet care needs by people with late-stage Parkinson’s in England.


Method 
Ten participants, at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5, were interviewed using semi-structured open-ended questions. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis.


Findings 
Participants reported that whilst under the treatment of specialist hospitals, the majority of care provision had shifted into the community, often because hospital-based services were felt to be difficult to access and have limited benefit to them. When using health-care services, participants frequently experienced having to ‘fit-in’ to service structures that did not always accommodate their complex needs. Despite high levels of disability, participants expressed their desire to maintain their identity, normality of interests and activities in their lives, including remaining in their own homes. This was facilitated by bespoke care and equipment, and positive relationships with care providers. Knowledge on disease management was a key factor in their perceived ability to remain in control. Family caregivers had a central role in facilitating care at home. There was uncertainty about and little planning for the future, and moving to a residential nursing home was perceived an undesirable but potentially necessary option for future care.


Conclusion 
Unmet care needs identified by people with late stage Parkinson’s in England include greater flexibility of healthcare structures and bespoke service provision, to accommodate their individual complex needs. Support in their own homes and positive relationships with healthcare providers help People with Parkinson’s (PwP) to maintain a degree of normality and identity, and provision of information help them maintain some control. There is a need for more informed discussions on future care planning for this specific population."
https://openalex.org/W2997817424,"The pathogenesis of canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves complex interactions between mucosal immunity and the intestinal microbiota. Glucocorticoids are commonly administered to reduce mucosal inflammation and gastrointestinal signs. The study objective was to evaluate the effects of diet and oral prednisone on the spatial distribution of mucosal bacteria in IBD dogs. Eight dogs diagnosed with IBD were treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone. The mucosal microbiota from endoscopic biopsies of IBD dogs and healthy controls (HC; n = 15 dogs) was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting the 16S rRNA genes of total bacteria and bacterial species relevant in canine/human IBD. Apicaljunction protein (AJP) expression using immunohistochemistry investigated the effect of medical therapy on intestinal barrier integrity. All IBD dogs had a reduction in GI signs following diet and prednisone therapy compared with baseline CIBDAI scores (P < 0.05). The mucosal microbiota of HC and diseased dogs was most abundant in free and adherent mucus. Only Lactobacilli were increased (P < 0.05) in the adherent mucus of IBD dogs compared to HC. The spatial distribution of mucosal bacteria was significantly different (P < 0.05) in IBD dogs following prednisone therapy, with higher numbers of Bifidobacteria and Streptococci detected across all mucosal compartments and increased numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and Streptococcus spp. present within adherent mucus. Differences in intestinal AJPs were detected with expression of occludin increased (P < 0.05) in IBD dogs versus HC. The expressions of occludin and E-cadherin were increased but zonulin decreased (P < 0.05 for each) in IBD dogs following prednisone therapy. In conclusion, the spatial distribution of mucosal bacteria differs between IBD and HC dogs, and in response to diet and glucocorticoid administration. Medical therapy was associated with beneficial changes in microbial community structure and enhanced mucosal epithelial AJP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2998384770,"During the transition to menopause, women experience a variety of physical and psychological symptoms that are directly or indirectly linked to changes in hormone secretion. Establishing animal models with intact ovaries is essential for understanding these interactions and finding new therapeutic targets. In this study, we assessed the endocrine profile, as well as the estrous cycle, in the 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-induced follicular depletion rat model in 10-day intervals over 1 month to accurately establish the best period for studies of the transition period. Twenty-eight-day-old female rats were injected daily with VCD or oil s.c. for 15 days and euthanized in the diestrus phase approximately 70, 80, 90 and 100 days after the onset of treatment. The percentage of rats showing irregular cycles and the plasma level of FSH increased only in the 100-day VCD group. Plasma anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and progesterone were lower in all VCD groups compared to control groups, while estradiol remained unchanged or higher. As in control groups, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) progressively decreased in the 70-90-day VCD groups; however, it was followed by a sharp increase only in the 100-day VCD group. No changes were found in plasma corticosterone, prolactin, thyroid hormones or luteinizing hormone. Based on the estrous cycle and endocrine profile, we conclude that 1) the time window from 70 to 100 days is suitable to study a perimenopause-like state in this model, and 2) regular cycles with low progesterone and AMH and normal FSH can be used as markers of the early/mid-transition period, whereas irregular cycles associated with higher FSH and DHT can be used as markers of the late transition period to estropause."
https://openalex.org/W2996886720,"Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy is characterized by progressive changes of both neurons and glia, also referred to as epileptogenesis. No curative treatment options, apart from surgery, are available. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a potential upstream mechanism in epileptogenesis and may serve as a novel therapeutic target. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate epilepsy-related DNAm, gene expression (GE) and their relationship, in neurons and glia.We used the intracortical kainic acid injection model to elicit status epilepticus. At 24 hours post injection, hippocampi from eight kainic acid- (KA) and eight saline-injected (SH) mice were extracted and shock frozen. Separation into neurons and glial nuclei was performed by flow cytometry. Changes in DNAm and gene expression were measured with reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and mRNA-sequencing (mRNAseq). Statistical analyses were performed in R with the edgeR package.We observed fulminant DNAm- and GE changes in both neurons and glia at 24 hours after initiation of status epilepticus. The vast majority of these changes were specific for either neurons or glia. At several epilepsy-related genes, like HDAC11, SPP1, GAL, DRD1 and SV2C, significant differential methylation and differential gene expression coincided.We found neuron- and glia-specific changes in DNAm and gene expression in early epileptogenesis. We detected single genetic loci in several epilepsy-related genes, where DNAm and GE changes coincide, worth further investigation. Further, our results may serve as an information source for neuronal and glial alterations in both DNAm and GE in early epileptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2997748192,"Dysbiosis of skin microbiota is associated with several inflammatory skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa. There is a surge of interest by clinicians and the lay public to explore targeted bacteriotherapy to treat these dermatologic conditions. To date, skin microbiota transplantation studies have focused on moving single, enriched strains of bacteria to target sites rather than a whole community. In this prospective pilot study, we examined the feasibility of transferring unenriched skin microbiota communities between two anatomical sites of the same host. We enrolled four healthy volunteers (median age: 28 [range: 24, 36] years; 2 [50%] female) who underwent collection and transfer of skin microbiota from the forearm to the back unidirectionally. Using culture methods and 16S rRNA V1-V3 deep sequencing, we compared baseline and mixed (""transplant"") communities, at T = 0 and T = 24 hours. Our ability to detect movement from one site to the other relied on the inherent diversity of the microenvironment of the antecubital fossa relative to the less diverse back. Comparing bacterial species present in the arm and mixed (""transplant"") communities that were absent from the baseline back, we saw evidence of transfer of a partial DNA signature; our methods limit conclusions regarding the viability of transferred organisms. We conclude that unenriched transfer of whole cutaneous microbiota is challenging, but our simple technique, intended to move viable skin organisms from one site to another, is worthy of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2998522195,"Douchi is a type of traditional Chinese flavoring food that has been used for thousands of years and is produced by multispecies solid-state fermentation. However, the correlation between the flavor, the microbiota, and the functional core microbiota in Aspergillus-type douchi fermentation remains unclear. In this study, Illumina MiSeq sequencing and chromatography were used to investigate the bacterial community and flavor components in Aspergillus-type douchi fermentation. The dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and the dominant genera were Weissella, Bacillus, Anaerosalibacter, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus. A total of 58 flavor components were detected during fermentation, including two alcohols, 14 esters, five pyrazines, three alkanes, four aldehydes, three phenols, six acids, and five other compounds. Bidirectional orthogonal partial least square modeling showed that Corynebacterium_1, Lactococcus, Atopostipes, Peptostreptococcus, norank_o__AKYG1722, Truepera, Gulosibacter, norank_f__Actinomycetaceae, and unclassified_f__Rhodobacteraceae are the functional core microbiota responsible for the formation of the flavor components during douchi fermentation. This is the first study to investigate the functional core microbiota in douchi fermentation using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and chromatographic techniques. Our findings extend our understanding of the relationships between flavor, the microbiota, and the functional core microbiota during Aspergillus-type douchi fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2998225987,"Microbial ingredients such as Candida utilis yeast are known to be functional protein sources with immunomodulating effects whereas soybean meal causes soybean meal-induced enteritis in the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Inflammatory or immunomodulatory stimuli at the local level in the intestine may alter the plasma proteome profile of Atlantic salmon. These deviations can be helpful indicators for fish health and, therefore potential tools in the diagnosis of fish diseases. The present work aimed to identify local intestinal tissue responses and changes in plasma protein profiles of Atlantic salmon fed inactive dry Candida utilis yeast biomass, soybean meal, or combination of soybean meal based diet with various inclusion levels of Candida utilis. A fishmeal based diet was used as control diet. Inclusion of Candida utilis yeast to a fishmeal based diet did not alter the morphology, immune cell population or gene expression of the distal intestine. Lower levels of Candida utilis combined with soybean meal modulated immune cell populations in the distal intestine and reduced the severity of soybean meal-induced enteritis, while higher inclusion levels of Candida utilis were less effective. Changes in the plasma proteomic profile revealed differences between the diets but did not indicate any specific proteins that could be a marker for health or disease. The results suggest that Candida utilis does not alter intestinal morphology or induce major changes in plasma proteome, and thus could be a high-quality alternative protein source with potential functional properties in diets for Atlantic salmon."
https://openalex.org/W2997162182,"Host seeking in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles coluzzii, relies on specific and generic host-derived odorants. Previous analyses indicate that the behavioral response of these species depends differentially on the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other constituents in human breath for activation and attraction. In this study, we use a flight tube assay and electrophysiological analysis to assess the role of acetone, a major component of exhaled human breath, in modulating the behavioral and sensory neuronal response of these mosquito species, in the presence and absence of CO2. When presented alone at ecologically relevant concentrations, acetone increases attraction in Ae. aegypti, but not in An. coluzzii. Moreover, in combination with CO2, human breath-equivalents of acetone ranging between 0.1 and 10 ppm reproduces a behavioral response similar to that observed to human breath in host-seeking Ae. aegypti, but not in An. coluzzii. Acetone does, however, reduce attraction to CO2 in An. coluzzii, when presented at a higher concentration of 10 ppm. We identify the capitate peg A neuron of the maxillary palp of both species as a dual detector of CO2 and acetone. The sensory response to acetone, or binary blends of acetone and CO2, reflects the observed behavioral output in both Ae. aegypti and An. coluzzii. We conclude that host recognition is contextual and dependent on a combination of ecologically relevant odorants at naturally occurring concentrations that are encoded, in this case, by differences in the temporal structure of the neuronal response. This information should be considered when designing synthetic blends for that optimally attract mosquitoes for monitoring and control."
https://openalex.org/W2998116587,"‘Asthma’ is a complex disease that encapsulates a heterogeneous group of phenotypes and endotypes. Research to understand these phenotypes has previously been based on longitudinal wheeze patterns or hypothesis-driven observational criteria. The aim of this study was to use data-driven machine learning to identify asthma and wheeze phenotypes in children based on symptom and symptom history data, and, to further characterize these phenotypes. The study population included an asthma-rich population of twins in Sweden aged 9–15 years (n = 752). Latent class analysis using current and historical clinical symptom data generated asthma and wheeze phenotypes. Characterization was then performed with regression analyses using diagnostic data: lung function and immunological biomarkers, parent-reported medication use and risk-factors. The latent class analysis identified four asthma/wheeze phenotypes: early transient wheeze (15%); current wheeze/asthma (5%); mild asthma (9%), moderate asthma (10%) and a healthy phenotype (61%). All wheeze and asthma phenotypes were associated with reduced lung function and risk of hayfever compared to healthy. Children with mild and moderate asthma phenotypes were also more likely to have eczema, allergic sensitization and a family history of asthma. Furthermore, those with moderate asthma phenotype had a higher eosinophil concentration (β 0.21, 95%CI 0.12, 0.30) compared to healthy and used short-term relievers at a higher rate than children with mild asthma phenotype (RR 2.4, 95%CI 1.2–4.9). In conclusion, using a data driven approach we identified four wheeze/asthma phenotypes which were validated with further characterization as unique from one another and which can be adapted for use by the clinician or researcher."
https://openalex.org/W2997100285,"Antibody therapies for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) hold promise but have been limited by the inability of these proteins to migrate efficiently across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Central nervous system (CNS) gene transfer by vectors like adeno-associated virus (AAV) overcome this barrier by allowing the bodies' own cells to produce the therapeutic protein, but previous studies using this method to target amyloid-β have shown success only with truncated single chain antibodies (Abs) lacking an Fc domain. The Fc region mediates effector function and enhances antigen clearance from the brain by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated reverse transcytosis and is therefore desirable to include for such treatments. Here, we show that single chain Abs fused to an Fc domain retaining FcRn binding, but lacking Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding, termed a silent scFv-IgG, can be expressed and released into the CNS following gene transfer with AAV. While expression of canonical IgG in the brain led to signs of neurotoxicity, this modified Ab was efficiently secreted from neuronal cells and retained target specificity. Steady state levels in the brain exceeded peak levels obtained by intravenous injection of IgG. AAV-mediated expression of this scFv-IgG reduced cortical and hippocampal plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of progressive β-amyloid plaque accumulation.

With the implementation of European Union (EU) Regulation 536/2014 on clinical trials and cost and time-optimization, the nature of consultations and the bodies they are carried out might be to some extent affected. Accordingly, we sought to gain an updated perspective on the current role and current practices of ethics consultations nationwide in both clinical and research settings. Methods The study was carried forth by a three-step mixed-method approach: i) review of policies/regulations for ethics committee (EC) nationwide; ii) a structured survey on ethics consultation activity completed by each EC during 2016; iii) incorporated into the third part, a qualitative assessment with a selected sample of 8 key-informants for a semi-structured interview, discussing EC history, the ethics consultation function, and the professional experience of consultants. Results Review of the policies/regulations promoted by ECs showed that 72,6% (n = 69) of all the ECs (N = 95) being actually capable of providing ethics consultation service by policy. 71 ECs (74.7%) responded to the survey on ethics consultation requests; among them, 48 (67.6%) provided ethics consultations of which 23 (23/48) actually received requests for this service in the year 2016. Many ECs did not have a structured database in place to provide precise figures of requests received in the last year nor of their contents. Conclusion To date, ethics consultation in clinical and research practice is largely underappreciated and not well understood by users. The consultants themselves lack a comprehensive vision of work carried out in their field, and bioethics training programs to keep them updated. Despite clinical ethics consultation services should not necessarily be mandatory, following the recent EU Regulation on clinical trials, institutional ethics consultation bodies should be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2997459880,"Purpose To quantify vessel tortuosity and fractal dimension of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) of the macula in different stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and following panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods 75 eyes of 75 subjects were divided into five groups; healthy controls, diabetes with no clinical DR, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and patients who received PRP for PDR (PDR+PRP).For vessel tortuosity, SCP slabs from 3x3 mm macular OCTA scans were processed using imageJ (NIH, USA), where large perifoveal vessels were traced and their length was measured with tortuosity calculated as the ratio between the actual length and the straight Euclidean length. For fractal dimension, SCP slabs were processed and imported to Fractalyse (ThéMA, France), where box-counting analyses produced fractal dimension values. Results We found a significant difference in vessel tortuosity and fractal dimension between the five groups (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001both). NPDR and PDR had significantly more tortuous vessels and lower fractal dimension compared to healthy controls (Tukey HSD: p = 0.02, 0.015,0.015 and <0.001, respectively). Fractal dimension was also significantly lower in NPDR and PDR compared to eyes with no clinical DR (p <0.001 both), and in PDR compared to NPDR (p = 0.014). Following PRP, vessel tortuosity was significantly lower and fractal dimension was higher in PDR+PRP compared to PDR (p = 0.001 and 0.031, respectively). Conclusions We used macular OCTA scans to demonstrate significantly higher perifoveal large vessel tortuosity, and lower fractal dimension in NPDR and PDR compared to healthy controls. Vessel tortuosity shows more dramatic normalization than fractal dimension and could be explored as a sensitive marker for successful PRP."

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) improved early kidney graft function in a porcine model of donation after brain death and was associated with improved long-term cardiac outcome after myocardial ischaemia. This randomised, double-blinded trial evaluated the effect of RIC on kidney graft outcome in the first year, and examined the predictive value of a new measure of initial kidney graft function, i.e. the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine post-transplantation (tCr50).A total of 225 patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation were randomised to RIC or a sham procedure performed prior to kidney reperfusion. Up to four repetitive cycles of five minutes of leg ischaemia and five minutes of reperfusion were given. GFR, plasma creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured at three and twelve months and estimated GFR was calculated using four different equations. Other secondary outcomes were identified from patient files.RIC did not affect GFR or other outcomes when compared to the sham procedure at three or twelve months. tCr50 correlated with one year graft function (p<0.0001 for both mGFR and eGFR estimates). In contrast, DGF i.e. ""need of dialysis the first week"" did not correlate significantly with one year GFR.RIC during deceased donor kidney transplantation did not improve one year outcome. However, tCr50 may be a relevant marker for studies aiming to improve graft onset.www.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01395719."

To address this problem, we assessed the distribution of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) among HIV infected adults on ART in Eastern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2017 to February 2018. Socio-demographic, behavioral and health related factors, and clinical data were collected using questionnaire and checklist. Plasma samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs seromarkers using ELISA. Data were double entered into EpiData 3.1, cleaned, exported to and analyzed using STATA 13. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis were conducted and statistical significance was decided at p≤0.05. A total of 901 participants were included and the prevalence of HBsAg was found to be 11.7% [95%CI (10, 14)]. Among the co-infected, 47.6% were also positive for anti-HBc, of which 58% were on an ART containing tenofovir (TDF). Among those screened for the three seromarkers, 38.1% were negative for all and 21% were positive only for anti-HBc (IAHBc). Being single, history of genital discharge and taking ART with TDF combination were significantly associated with HBV co-infection (p≤0.05). There is high burden HBV co-infection among individuals on ART. The unmet need of HBV screening prior to ART initiation leaves many co-infected individuals without appropriate management including therapy, close monitoring or vaccination when indicated, impacting disease prevention."

Sinusoidal hemophagocytosis is occasionally observed on liver biopsy in patients who do not have clinical suspicion of HLH. We aimed at comparing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with signs of hemophagocytosis on liver biopsy meeting and not meeting the HLH diagnostic criteria.We reviewed the clinical, laboratory features and outcomes of all adult patients consecutively admitted in our center between 08/2011 and 08/2017 presenting with liver histology showing sinusoidal hemophagocytosis and of critically ill patients presenting with severe liver disease in whom hemophagocytosis was histologically confirmed. The characteristics of patients fulfilling and not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of HLH were compared.We identified 12 cases (58% male, median age 61, 75% with a chronic underlying disease) with liver histology showing sinusoidal hemophagocytosis. All had at least some of the clinical features typically associated with HLH. Six were critical ill patients. In 4 cases with insufficient laboratory and clinical criteria, liver biopsy allowed to confirm the HLH diagnosis. Six patients died, of which four met the diagnostic criteria for HLH. Two patients with chronic liver disease died despite not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of HLH.Hemophagocytosis on liver biopsy may contribute to confirming a diagnosis of HLH in suspected cases with indeterminate clinical and laboratory findings. Sinusoidal hemophagocytosis in patients with cirrhosis was associated with bad outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2997136878,"Background Globally, low birthweight (LBW) infants (<2,500 grams) contribute up to 80% of neonatal mortality. In Bangladesh, approximately 62% of all births occur at home and therefore, weighing newborns immediately after birth is not feasible. Thus, estimates of birthweight in Bangladesh are mostly obtained based on maternal perception of the newborn’s birth size. Little is known about how birthweight is perceived in rural communities, and whether families associate birthweight with newborn’s health status. Our objective was to explore families’ perceptions of newborn’s birthweight, preventive practices to LBW, and care practices for a LBW newborn in rural Bangladesh. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in two rural settings of Bangladesh, including 32 in-depth interviews (11 with pregnant women, 12 with recently delivered women, 4 with husbands whose wives were pregnant or had a recent birth, 5 with mothers-in-law whose daughters-in-law were pregnant or had a recent birth), 2 focus group discussions with husbands and 4 key-informant interviews with community health workers. We used thematic analysis to analyse the data. Results Most participants did not consider birthweight a priority for assessing a newborn’s health status. Recognition of different categories of birthweight was subjective and often included several physical descriptors including birth size of the newborn. LBW was not considered as a criterion of a newborn’s illness unless the newborn appeared unwell. Maternal poor nutrition, inadequate diet in pregnancy, anaemia, illnesses during pregnancy, short stature, twin births and influence of supernatural spirit were identified as the major causes of LBW. Women’s preventive practices to LBW or small newborns were predominantly constrained by a lack of awareness of birthweight and fear of caesarean section. As an effort to avoid caesarean section during birth, several women tended to perform potentially harmful practices in order to give birth to a LBW or small size newborn; such as avoiding nutritious food and decreasing food intake in pregnancy. Common practices to treat a LBW or small newborn who appeared ill included breastfeeding, feeding animal milk, feeding sugary water, feeding formula, oil massage, keeping the small newborn warm and seeking care from formal and informal care providers including a spiritual leader. Maternal lack of decision-making power, financial constraint, home birth and superstition were the major challenges to caring for a LBW newborn. Conclusion Birthweight was not well-understood in the rural community, which highlighted substantial challenges to the prevention and care practices of LBW newborns. Community-level health education is needed to promote awareness related to the recognition of birthweight in rural settings."

To explore whether M. tuberculosis could also infect individuals by ingestion, male BALBc mice were fed 2 x 106 CFUs of M. tuberculosis Beijing or phosphate-buffered saline as a negative control, over a 28-day experiment. While eight negative control mice remained disease-free, M. tuberculosis was identified in the lymph nodes and lungs of 8/14 mice and in the spleens of 4/14 mice by microscopy, PCR-based detection and culture. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the identity of the inoculum and the tissue isolates. In these genetically identical mice, the dissemination of M. tuberculosis correlated with the results of the culture detection of four intestinal bacteria. These observations indicate that ingested M. tuberculosis mycobacteria can translocate, notably provoking lymphatic tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2997686353,"Five out of six people receive at least one antibiotic prescription per year. However, the ever-expanding use of antibiotics in medicine, agriculture, and food production has accelerated the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, in turn, made the development of novel antibiotics based on new molecular targets a priority in medicinal chemistry. One way of possibly combatting resistant bacterial infections is by inhibiting the copper transporters in prokaryotic cells. Copper is a key element within all living cells, but it can be toxic in excess. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have developed distinct copper regulation systems to prevent its toxicity. Therefore, selectively targeting the prokaryotic copper regulation system might be an initial step in developing next-generation antibiotics. One such system is the Gram-negative bacterial CusCFBA efflux system. CusB is a key protein in this system and was previously reported to play an important role in opening the channel for efflux via significant structural changes upon copper binding while also controlling the assembly and disassembly process of the entire channel. In this study, we aimed to develop novel peptide copper channel blockers, designed by in silico calculations based on the structure of CusB. Using a combination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and various biochemical methods, we found a lead peptide that promotes copper-induced cell toxicity. Targeting copper transport in bacteria has not yet been pursued as an antibiotic mechanism of action. Thus, our study lays the foundation for discovering novel antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2998012294,"Transgender rights and discrimination against transgender people are growing public policy issues. Theorizing from social, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology suggests that beyond attitudes, discrimination against transgender people may derive from folk theories about what gender is and where it comes from. Transgender identity is met with hostility, in part, because it poses a challenge to the lay view that gender is determined at birth, and based on observable physical and behavioral characteristics. Here, in two pre-registered studies (N = 1323), we asked American adults to indicate the gender of a transgender target who either altered their biology through surgical interventions or altered their outward appearance: to what extent is it their birth-assigned gender or their self-identified gender? Responses correlate strongly with affect toward transgender people, measured by feeling thermometers, yet predict views on transgender people’s right to use their preferred bathrooms above and beyond feelings. Compared to male participants, female participants judge the person’s gender more in line with the self-identified gender than the birth-assigned gender. This is consistent with social and psychological theories that posit high status (e.g., men) and low status (e.g., women) members of social classification systems view group hierarchies in more and less essentialist ways respectively. Gender differences in gender category beliefs decrease with religiosity and conservatism, and are smaller in higher age groups. These results suggest that folk theories of gender, or beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined have a unique role in how transgender people are viewed and treated. Moreover, as evident by the demographic variability of gender category beliefs, folk theories are shaped by social and cultural forces and are amenable to interventions. They offer an alternative pathway to measure policy support and possibly change attitude toward transgender people."
https://openalex.org/W2997066345,"Trust between developers influences the success of open source software (OSS) projects. Although existing research recognizes the importance of trust, there is a lack of an effective and scalable computational method to measure trust in an OSS community. Consequently, OSS project members must rely on subjective inferences based on fragile and incomplete information for trust-related decision making. We propose an automated approach to assist a developer in identifying the trustworthiness of another developer. Our two-fold approach, first, computes direct trust between developer pairs who have interacted previously by analyzing their interactions via natural language processing. Second, we infer indirect trust between developers who have not interacted previously by constructing a community-wide developer network and propagating trust in the network. A large-scale evaluation of our approach on a GitHub dataset consisting of 24,315 developers shows that contributions from trusted developers are more likely to be accepted to a project compared to contributions from developers who are distrusted or lacking trust from project members. Further, we develop a pull request classifier that exploits trust metrics to effectively predict the likelihood of a pull request being accepted to a project, demonstrating the practical utility of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W2997337579,"Objective To investigate the association between maternal antenatal and/or postnatal psychosocial risk factors (including depression, psychological distress, alcohol abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV) and infant lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in a low- and middle-income-country (LMIC). Study design Pregnant women (n = 1137) enrolled in a South African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS) were longitudinally assessed for psychosocial risk factors including depression, psychological distress, alcohol abuse and/or intimate partner violence (IPV). Infants were followed from birth until one year of age for the development of LRTI by active surveillance. Two outcomes were evaluated: any LRTI, and severe and/or hospitalised LRTI. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between individual maternal psychosocial risk factors and LRTI outcomes. Analyses stratified by age were also performed to determine which age groups related to infant LRTI were linked with maternal psychosocial risk factors. Results There were 606 LRTI episodes in 369 infants in the first year (crude incidence rate = 0.53 episodes per person-year, 95%CI: 0.50; 0.56); 31% (n = 186) of episodes were severe or hospitalised events. Maternal psychosocial risk factors were associated with LRTI and severe LRTI, particularly postnatal and long-term maternal psychological distress, antenatal maternal alcohol consumption, and postnatal maternal IPV. Age stratified analyses found that antenatal maternal alcohol consumption was associated with early infant LRTI, while antenatal maternal depression was linked with infant severe LRTI between 3 and 6 months of age, and postnatal maternal IPV was associated with early LRTI and severe forms of LRTI. Conclusion The associations between maternal psychosocial risk factors and infant LRTI highlight the potential value of screening for maternal psychosocial risk factors in clinical settings and developing targeted interventions. Such interventions may not only improve maternal well-being, but also help reduce the burden of infant LRTI in LMIC settings."

However; there is limited evidence regarding the incidence of mortality among admitted HIV patients in Ethiopia.To determine the incidence of mortality and its predictors among admitted HIV/AIDS patients in selected tertiary care hospitals in Ethiopia.A prospective cohort study involving 136 admitted HIV/AIDS patients from April 1 to August 31, 2018 was conducted in selected tertiary care hospitals in Ethiopia. Data were collected on socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and drug related variables. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to compare survival experience of the patients and identify independent predictors of mortality. Hazard ratio was used as a measure of strength of association and p-value of <0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance.Of 136 patients, 80 (58.8%) were females. The overall in-hospital incidence of mortality was 2.83 per 1000 person-years. The incidences of mortality due to AIDS and non-AIDS related admissions were 6.1 [3.95, 8.67] and 5.3 [3.35, 8.23] per 1000 person-years respectively. The mean ± SD survival times among patients with AIDS and non-AIDS related illnesses were 32 ± 3.1 and 34 ± 3.3 days respectively (log rank p = 0.599). Being on non-invasive ventilation (AHR: 2.99, 95%CI; [1.24, 7.28]; p = 0.015) and having baseline body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 (AHR: 2.6, 95%CI; [1.03, 6.45]; p = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality.The study found high incidence of in-hospital mortality among admitted HIV/AIDS patients in Ethiopian tertiary care hospitals. Being on non-invasive ventilation and body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 were found to be independent predictors of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2997971025,"The heterogeneous distribution of soil salinity across the rhizosphere can moderate salt injury and improve sorghum growth. However, the essential molecular mechanisms used by sorghum to adapt to such environmental conditions remain uncharacterized. The present study evaluated physiological parameters such as the photosynthetic rate, antioxidative enzyme activities, leaf Na+ and K+ contents, and osmolyte contents and investigated gene expression patterns via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis under various conditions of nonuniformly distributed salt. Totals of 5691 and 2047 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the leaves and roots, respectively, were identified by RNA-seq under nonuniform (NaCl-free and 200 mmol·L-1 NaCl) and uniform (100 mmol·L-1 and 100 mmol·L-1 NaCl) salinity conditions. The expression of genes related to photosynthesis, Na+ compartmentalization, phytohormone metabolism, antioxidative enzymes, and transcription factors (TFs) was enhanced in leaves under nonuniform salinity stress compared with uniform salinity stress. Similarly, the expression of the majority of aquaporins and essential mineral transporters was upregulated in the NaCl-free root side in the nonuniform salinity treatment, whereas abscisic acid (ABA)-related and salt stress-responsive TF transcripts were more abundant in the high-saline root side in the nonuniform salinity treatment. In contrast, the expression of the DEGs identified in the nonuniform salinity treatment remained virtually unaffected and was even downregulated in the uniform salinity treatment. The transcriptome findings might be supportive of the increased photosynthetic rate, reduced Na+ levels, increased antioxidative capability in the leaves and, consequently, the growth recovery of sorghum under nonuniform salinity stress as well as the inhibited sorghum growth under uniform salinity conditions. The increased expression of salt resistance genes activated in response to the nonuniform salinity distribution implied that the cross-talk between the nonsaline and high-saline sides of the roots exposed to nonuniform salt stress is potentially regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2998336141,"Background and aims Using mathematical modeling to illustrate and predict how different heroin source-forms: “black tar” (BTH) and powder heroin (PH) can affect HIV transmission in the context of contrasting injecting practices. By quantifying HIV risk by these two heroin source-types we show how each affects the incidence and prevalence of HIV over time. From 1997 to 2010 PH reaching the United States was manufactured overwhelmingly by Colombian suppliers and distributed in the eastern states of the United States. Recently Mexican cartels that supply the western U.S. states have started to produce PH too, replacing Colombian distribution to the east. This raises the possibility that BTH in the western U.S. may be replaced by PH in the future. Design We used an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of use of different heroin formulations in high- and low-risk populations of persons who inject drugs (PWID) who use different types of syringes (high vs. low dead space) and injecting practices. We obtained model parameters from peer-reviewed publications and ethnographic research. Results Heating of BTH, additional syringe rinsing, and subcutaneous injection can substantially decrease the risk of HIV transmission. Simulation analysis shows that HIV transmission risk may be strongly affected by the type of heroin used. We reproduced historic differences in HIV prevalence and incidence. The protective effect of BTH is much stronger in high-risk compared with low-risk populations. Simulation of future outbreaks show that when PH replaces BTH we expect a long-term overall increase in HIV prevalence. In a population of PWID with mixed low- and high-risk clusters we find that local HIV outbreaks can occur even when the overall prevalence and incidence are low. The results are dependent on evidence-supported assumptions. Conclusions The results support harm-reduction measures focused on a reduction in syringe sharing and promoting protective measures of syringe rinsing and drug solution heating."
https://openalex.org/W2998654447,"Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) refers to techniques that analyze fluctuations in the fluorescence emitted by fluorophores diffusing in a small volume and can be used to distinguish between populations of molecules that exhibit differences in brightness or diffusion. For example, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) resolves species through their diffusion by analyzing correlations in the fluorescence over time; photon counting histograms (PCH) and related methods based on moment analysis resolve species through their brightness by analyzing fluctuations in the photon counts. Here we introduce correlated photon counting histograms (cPCH), which uses both types of information to simultaneously resolve fluorescent species by their brightness and diffusion. We define the cPCH distribution by the probability to detect both a particular number of photons at the current time and another number at a later time. FCS and moment analysis are special cases of the moments of the cPCH distribution, and PCH is obtained by summing over the photon counts in either channel. cPCH is inherently a dual channel technique, and the expressions we develop apply to the dual colour case. Using simulations, we demonstrate that two species differing in both their diffusion and brightness can be better resolved with cPCH than with either FCS or PCH. Further, we show that cPCH can be extended both to longer dwell times to improve the signal-to-noise and to the analysis of images. By better exploiting the information available in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, cPCH will be an enabling methodology for quantitative biology."

The algorithm proposed as well as other popular algorithms in the field, such as the traditional GPR algorithm, and GPR algorithms optimized using the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC-GPR) or genetic algorithm (GA-GPR), were used to predict the wheel diameter of a DF11 train in a section of a railway during a period of major repairs. The results predicted by FSA-GPR was compared with other three algorithms as well as the real measured data from RMSE, MAE, R2 and Residual value. And the comparisons showed that the predictions obtained from the GPR optimized using FSA algorithm were more accurate than those based on the others. Therefore, this algorithm can be incorporated into the vehicle-mounted speed measurement module to automatically update the value of wheel diameter, thereby substantially reducing the manual work entailed therein and improving the effectiveness of measuring the speed and position of the train."
https://openalex.org/W2997022161,"Actor-related affordance judgments are decisions about potential actions that arise from environmental as well as bodily and cognitive conditions. The system can be challenged by sudden changes to otherwise rather stable actor references e.g. due to accidental bodily injuries or due to brain damage and resulting motor and cognitive constraints. The current study investigated adaptation to suddenly artificially altered body properties and its reversibility in healthy young versus older adults. Participants were asked to judge whether they would be able to fit their hand through a given horizontal opening (Aperture Task). Body alterations were induced by equipping participants with one hand splint for 24 hours that enlarged the hand in width and height. Participants were tested before and directly after putting the splint on as well as after a habituation period of 24 hours. To assess reversibility, participants were tested again directly after removing the splint and one day later. Judgment accuracy values and detection theory measures were reported. Both, young and older adults judged more conservatively when body properties were altered compared to initial judgments for normal body properties. Especially older adults showed major difficulties in such quick adaptation. Older adults’ judgment accuracy as well as perceptual sensitivity were significantly lowered when body properties were suddenly altered. Importantly, lowered judgment performance occurred for both, the splinted as well as the non-splinted hand in older adults. Only after 24 hours of habituation, older adults tended to regain initial performance levels showing adaptive behavior to the altered condition. Removing the hand splint for one day was sufficient to reverse these adaptive effects. Our study results suggest that aging slows down adaptation to sudden bodily alterations affecting actor-related affordance judgments. We propose that these altered processes may go along with uncertainty and a heightened concern about potential consequences of misjudgments. Clearly, future studies are needed to further elucidate the underlying processes of adaptation in affordance judgments. These may reveal major implications for the aging society and its associated problems with an increased risk of falling or stroke related bodily constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2997065374,"Urban landscapes can present ecological challenges for wildlife species, yet many species survive, and even thrive, near dense human populations. Coyotes (Canis latrans), for example, have expanded their geographic range across North America and, as a result of their adaptability and behavioral flexibility, are now a common occupant of many urban areas in the United States. We investigated the spatial ecology of 27 coyotes fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry collars radio-collared in the Cuyahoga Valley, Ohio. Our objectives were to quantify coyote space use, evaluate resource selection, and investigate coyote movement and activity patterns. To measure space use, we estimated home range (95%) and core area (50%) size of coyotes using the adaptive local convex hull (a-LoCoH) method. We found the mean (± SE) home range size of resident coyotes (4.7 ± 1.8 km2) was significantly smaller than ranges of transient coyotes (67.7 ± 89.6 km2). Similarly, mean (± SE) core area size of resident coyotes (0.9 ± 0.6 km2) was significantly smaller than core areas of transient coyotes (11.9 ± 16.7 km2). Home range and core area size of both resident and transient coyotes did not vary by sex, age, or season. For all coyotes, use of natural land cover was significantly greater than use of altered and developed land. When coyotes were using altered and developed land, GPS fixes were most common at night. Coyote movement patterns differed with respect to status, time period, and season; peaking during nighttime hours. A better understanding of coyote space use and movement within anthropogenic landscapes aids management of people, parks, and wildlife by providing the data necessary for research-based management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2997084639,"The carboxypeptidase T (CPT) from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris has an active site structure and 3D organization similar to pancreatic carboxypeptidases A and B (CPA and CPB), but differs in broader substrate specificity. The crystal structures of CPT complexes with the transition state analogs N-sulfamoyl-L-leucine and N-sulfamoyl-L-glutamate (SLeu and SGlu) were determined and compared with previously determined structures of CPT complexes with N-sulfamoyl-L-arginine and N-sulfamoyl-L-phenylalanine (SArg and SPhe). The conformations of residues Tyr255 and Glu270, the distances between these residues and the corresponding ligand groups, and the Zn-S gap between the zinc ion and the sulfur atom in the ligand's sulfamoyl group that simulates a distance between the zinc ion and the tetrahedral sp3-hybridized carbon atom of the converted peptide bond, vary depending on the nature of the side chain in the substrate's C-terminus. The increasing affinity of CPT with the transition state analogs in the order SGlu, SArg, SPhe, SLeu correlates well with a decreasing Zn-S gap in these complexes and the increasing efficiency of CPT-catalyzed hydrolysis of the corresponding tripeptide substrates (ZAAL > ZAAF > ZAAR > ZAAE). Thus, the side chain of the ligand that interacts with the primary specificity pocket of CPT, determines the geometry of the transition complex, the relative orientation of the bond to be cleaved by the catalytic groups of the active site and the catalytic properties of the enzyme. In the case of CPB, the relative orientation of the catalytic amino acid residues, as well as the distance between Glu270 and SArg/SPhe, is much less dependent on the nature of the corresponding side chain of the substrate. The influence of the nature of the substrate side chain on the structural organization of the transition state determines catalytic activity and broad substrate specificity of the carboxypeptidase T."

Since humans in negative affective states demonstrate greater responses to negatively-valenced stimuli, we investigated putative affect-related bias in mice by monitoring their response to unexpected, task-irrelevant stimuli of different valence. Thirty-one C57BL/6J and 31 DBA/2J females were individually trained to return to their home-cage in a runway. Mice then underwent an affective manipulation acutely inducing a negative (NegAff) or a comparatively less negative (CompLessNeg) affective state before immediately being tested in the runway with either an ‘attractive’ (familiar food) or ‘threatening’ (flashing light) stimulus. Mice were subsequently trained and tested again (same affective manipulation) with the alternative stimulus. As predicted, mice were slower to approach the light and spent more time with the food. DBA/2J mice were slower than C57BL/6J overall. Contrary to predictions, NegAff mice tended to approach both stimuli more readily than CompLessNeg mice, especially the light, and even more so for DBA/2Js. Although the stimuli successfully differentiated the response of mice to unexpected, task-irrelevant stimuli, further refinement may be required to disentangle the effects of affect manipulation and arousal on the response to valenced stimuli. The results also highlight the significant importance of considering strain differences when developing cognitive tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2997529194,"The objective of this study was to assess the attitude and behaviour of Dutch ENT surgeons and ENT residents towards Evidence Based Medicine.Evidence Based Medicine is the cornerstone of modern clinical care. It is considered of crucial importance for optimal patient care and health care quality. Practicing it requires positive attitude and behaviour. Little is known about the attitude and behaviour towards Evidence Based Medicine in otorhinolaryngology.We performed a web-based questionnaire among 607 Dutch Ear- Nose & Throat surgeons of whom 106 residents (cross-sectional study). The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts; (1) personal characteristics, (2) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine attitude (McColl questionnaire, scale 0-100%) and (3) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine behaviour (barriers and information seeking behaviour). Data were collected between March 26th 2018 and June 1st 2018.The median score on the overall McColl questionnaire was 50 (IQR 35). The main barriers respondents experienced were time related. Limited time in the outpatient clinic was considered a more important barrier for residents to practice EBM compared to ENT surgeons. Respondents' gut feeling and their own preference were identified as the main contributing factors in clinical decision making.In conclusion Dutch ENT surgeons have a moderate attitude on the McColl questionnaire. The main barriers to practice Evidence Based Medicine they experience are time related."
https://openalex.org/W2997533571,"Human impacts on natural resources increasingly necessitate understanding of the demographic rates driving wildlife population trends. Breeding productivity in many avian species is the demographic parameter that primarily influences population fluctuations. Nest density is a vital component of breeding productivity despite the fact that it is most often inferred exclusively from nest success. Unfortunately, locating every nest in a given area to determine nest density is often not feasible and can be biased by measurement error. The availability of a nest to be detected and the probability it will be detected during nest searching are two prominent sources of measurement error. A time-to-event nest density estimator has been developed that, unlike standard distance sampling methods, accounts for availability and can use nest data from outside structured surveys routinely collected to assess nest success. Its application is currently limited to Anseriformes, so we evaluated the general applicability of the time-to-event estimator in the order Passeriformes. To do this, we compared estimates of nest detection rate and nest density from the time-to-event estimator to distance sampling methods for 42 Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) nests monitored in 2015. The time-to-event estimator produced similar but more precise nest detection and density estimates than distance sampling methods."
https://openalex.org/W2998195704,"Due to the current poaching crisis in Africa, increasing numbers of white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) require opioid immobilisation for medical interventions or management procedures. Alarmingly, the results of both blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry regularly indicate severe hypoxaemia. Yet, the recovery of the animals is uneventful. Thus, neither of the techniques seems to represent the real oxygenation level. We hypothesized that unusual haemoglobin characteristics of this species interfere with the techniques developed and calibrated for the use in human patients.Haemoglobin was isolated from blood samples of four adult, white rhinoceroses. Oxygen dissociation curves at pH 7.2 and 7.4 (37°C) were determined based on the absorbance change of haemoglobin in the Soret-region (around 420 nm). Absorbance spectra of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin extending into the infrared region were measured.Oxygen dissociation curves of rhinoceros haemoglobin showed the typical high oxygen affinity (p50 of 2.75 ± 0.07 and 2.00 ± 0.04 kPa for pH 7.2 and 7.4, respectively) under near-physiological conditions with respect to pH, temperature and DPG. The infrared absorbance spectra of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin showed only marginal deviations from standard human spectra, possibly due to the presence of a few percent of methaemoglobin in vitro.Our data enables the development of a rhinoceros-specific blood gas analysis algorithm, which allows for species-specific calculation of SaO2 levels in anaesthetized animals. The inconspicuous absorbance spectra do not contribute to the systematic underestimation of SpO2 by pulse-oximetry."
https://openalex.org/W2998361571,"Large urban trees have many benefits. However, falling branches pose a serious hazard to both people and infrastructure. In several tree species, aerial roots grow down from branches to the ground. These roots are capable of thickening to support the branches, lessening the risk of tree failure. Unfortunately, in urban environments most aerial roots die before reaching the ground. Here, we report a new method for encouraging aerial roots to reach the ground, developed by the second-year botany class at UNSW Sydney. Our class tested three experimental treatments on aerial roots of Ficus rubiginosa Desf. ex Vent. (Port Jackson Fig)-PVC pipes filled with sphagnum moss, PVC pipes filled with potting mix, and PVC pipes filled with sphagnum moss and topped with funnels to catch extra rainwater. All three treatments significantly improved aerial root growth, with 26 of the 30 (87%) treatment roots reaching the ground after one year compared to 0 of the 10 control roots. Our method was successful for roots up to 3 m above the ground, suggesting the potential growth rate of aerial roots is substantial when conditions are favourable. Our novel approach is an attractive and cost-effective alternative to slings and other artificial supports. This project is an example of using undergraduate practical classes to teach science while simultaneously addressing important real-world problems."
https://openalex.org/W2997046837,"Chronic irritating cough in patients with allergic disorders may reflect behavioral or reflex response that is inappropriately matched to the stimulus present in the respiratory tract. Such dysregulated response is likely caused by sensory nerve damage driven by allergic mediators leading to cough hypersensitivity. Some indirect findings suggest that even acid-sensitive, capsaicin-insensitive A-δ fibers called ""cough receptors"" that are likely responsible for protective reflex cough may be modulated through immune driven inflammation. The aim of this study was to find out whether protective reflex cough is altered during acute allergic airway inflammation in rabbits sensitized to ovalbumin. In order to evaluate the effect of such inflammation exclusively on protective reflex cough, C-fiber mediated cough was silenced using general anesthesia. Cough provocation using citric acid inhalation and mechanical stimulation of trachea was realized in 16 ovalbumin (OVA) sensitized, anesthetized and tracheotomised rabbits 24h after OVA (OVA group, n = 9) or saline challenge (control group, n = 7). Number of coughs provoked by citric acid inhalation did not differ between OVA and control group (12,2 ±6,1 vs. 17,9 ± 6,9; p = 0.5). Allergic airway inflammation induced significant modulation of cough threshold (CT) to mechanical stimulus. Mechanically induced cough reflex in OVA group was either up-regulated (subgroup named ""responders"" CT: 50 msec (50-50); n = 5 p = 0.003) or down-regulated (subgroup named ""non responders"", CT: 1200 msec (1200-1200); n = 4 p = 0.001) when compared to control group (CT: 150 msec (75-525)). These results advocate that allergen may induce longer lasting changes of reflex cough pathway, leading to its up- or down-regulation. These findings may be of interest as they suggest that effective therapies for chronic cough in allergic patients should target sensitized component of both, reflex and behavioral cough."
https://openalex.org/W2997312394,"Quantifying ecosystem-level processes that drive community structure and function is key to the development of effective environmental restoration and management programs. To assess the effects of large-scale aquatic vegetation loss on fish and invertebrate communities in Florida estuaries, we quantified and compared the food webs of two adjacent spring-fed rivers that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. We constructed a food web model using field-based estimates of community absolute biomass and trophic interactions of a highly productive vegetated river, and modeled long-term simulations of vascular plant decline coupled with seasonal production of filamentous macroalgae. We then compared ecosystem model predictions to observed community structure of the second river that has undergone extensive vegetative habitat loss, including extirpation of several vascular plant species. Alternative models incorporating bottom-up regulation (decreased primary production resulting from plant loss) versus coupled top-down effects (compensatory predator search efficiency) were ranked by total absolute error of model predictions compared to the empirical community observations. Our best model for predicting community responses to vascular plant loss incorporated coupled effects of decreased primary production (bottom-up), increased prey search efficiency of large-bodied fishes at low vascular plant density (top-down), and decreased prey search efficiency of small-bodied fishes with increased biomass of filamentous macroalgae (bottom-up). The results of this study indicate that the loss of vascular plants from the coastal river ecosystem may alter the food web structure and result in a net decline in the biomass of fishes. These results are highly relevant to ongoing landscape-level restoration programs intended to improve aesthetics and ecosystem function of coastal spring-fed rivers by highlighting how the structure of these communities can be regulated both by resource availability and consumption. Restoration programs will need to acknowledge and incorporate both to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W2997558502,"The establishment of diatom communities depends on environmental factors such as the type of substrate and geographic conditions that influence the dispersal processes of these organisms. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the similarity between diatom communities associated with the macroalgae Prasiola crispa (Lightfoot) Kützing in relation to spatial distance from six sampled sites located in the South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica. The diatom flora associated with Prasiola crispa was represented by 23 species distributed in 15 genera. Pinnularia australoschoenfelderi Zidarova, Kopalová & Van de Vijver, Luticola austroatlantica Van de Vijver, Kopalová, S.A.Spaulding & Esposito, Luticola amoena Van der Vijver, Kopalová, Zidarova & Levkov, Pinnularia austroshetlandica (Carlson) Cleve-Euler and Psammothidium papilio (D.E. Kellogg et al.) Kopalová & Zidarova were the most abundant species in our samples, together they represented 68% of the total number of individuals collected. There was great similarity and abundance of the diatom communites among the sampled points, which resulted in the absence of a linear relationship pattern with distance between sampling points. We conclude that distance was not a factor of differentiation of Antarctic diatom communities associated with terrestrial green macroalgae. This suggests that Antarctic environments may have unique characteristics with homogeneous abiotic factors, at least in relation to this substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2997289657,"To determine the intersession reliability of the Readiness Evaluation during Simulated Dismounted Operations (REDOp), a novel ecologically-based assessment for injured Service Members, provide minimal detectable change values, and normative reference range values. To evaluate the ability to differentiate performance limitations between able-bodied and injured individuals using the REDOp.Repeated measures design and between group comparison.Outpatient rehabilitative care setting.Service Members who were able-bodied (n = 32) or sustained a traumatic lower extremity injury (n = 22).During the REDOp, individuals walked over variable terrain as speed and incline progressively increased; they engaged targets; and carried military gear.Endurance measured using total distance traveled; walking stability measured using range of full-body angular momentum; and shooting accuracy, precision, reaction time and acquisition time.Intersession reliability analyses were conducted on a sub-group of 18 able-bodied Service Members. Interclass correlation coefficient values were calculated for distance traveled (0.91), range of angular momentum about three axes (0.78-0.93), shooting accuracy (0.61), precision (0.47), reaction time (0.21), and acquisition time (0.77). Service Members with lower extremity injury demonstrated significantly less distance traveled with a median distance of 0.89 km compared to 2.73 km for the able-bodied group (p < 0.001). Service Members with lower extremity injury demonstrated significantly less stability in the frontal and sagittal planes than the able-bodied group (p < 0.001). The primary performance limiter was endurance followed by pain for both groups. There was no evidence of ceiling effects.The REDOp is a highly reliable, military-relevant assessment that can be used to measure performance and identify deficits across the domains of activity tolerance, gait stability, and shooting performance."
