https://openalex.org/W2805663744,"Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders."

However, most malignancies do not have an expendable normal tissue counterpart, and whether the success of CAR T cells can be extrapolated beyond B cell neoplasms will depend on the ability to develop strategies to mitigate toxicity to normal cells. The majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients relapse despite intensive therapy. AML cell surface antigens are shared with normal myeloid progenitors (Levine et al., 2015Levine J.H.

While strategies to produce transient CAR T cells are being explored in clinical trials to avoid long-term myeloablation while targeting AML (e.g., #NCT03126864, #NCT02159495), this negates a fundamental strength of this therapy—namely, its long-term anti-tumor immune surveillance. Therefore, in the absence of a truly AML-specific antigen, novel approaches are required to definitively target AML while sparing normal hematopoiesis. Here, we propose a new paradigm for antigen-specific immunotherapy against myeloid neoplasms in which potent antigen-directed therapy can be administered without causing prolonged myeloid aplasia. We use gene-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to regenerate an antigen-negative myeloid system that is resistant to antigen-targeting therapy. CD33 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (siglec) family. CD33 is expressed on all normal myeloid cells downstream of the common myeloid progenitor and is used as both a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for AML (Laszlo et al., 2014Laszlo G.S. Estey E.H. Walter R.B. The past and future of CD33 as therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.Blood Rev. 2014; 28: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We show here that CD33 knockout (KO) HSPC can generate functional hematopoiesis that is resistant to CD33-targeted AML therapy in two relevant preclinical models and provide evidence for the clinical feasibility and efficacy of combining allogeneic transplantation of CD33 KO HSPCs with CD33 CAR T therapy to treat patients with otherwise incurable AML. We disrupted the CD33 gene in primary human CD34+ cells using truncated guide RNAs (gRNAs) (Fu et al., 2014Fu Y. Sander J.D. Reyon D. Cascio V.M. Joung J.K. Improving CRISPR-Cas nuclease specificity using truncated guide RNAs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar), which have been reported to increase specificity of gene editing. We found that truncated gRNAs increased the efficacy of CD33 KO compared to their full-length counterparts (Figure 1A). Initially, we achieved around 40% KO in primary CD34+ cells (Figure 1B), of which a large proportion of mutations consisted of a single adenine (A) nucleotide insertion (Figure 1C). We further enhanced editing by adding a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) template containing the A insertion, leading to dose-dependent increase in frequency of KO (Figure 1D). Subsequent experiments were performed via transfection of Cas9 protein complexed with a truncated gRNA targeting CD33 and the ssODN template to generate CD33 KO HSPCs, while control HSPCs were treated with Cas9 and a gRNA targeting the irrelevant gene EMX1 (Figure 1E). In vitro differentiated CD33 KO HSPCs had markedly reduced levels of surface CD33 protein expression (27% ± 4%) compared to controls (92% ± 3%) (Figure 1F) without impairment of growth or differentiation (Figures 1G–1J). High frequency of mutations in the CD33 gene was confirmed by tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) and next-generation sequencing (Figures 1K and 1L). We injected NOD/SCID/IL2rγnull (NSG) mice with control (Cas9/EMX1-gRNA) or CD33 KO (Cas9/CD33-gRNA/ssODN) HSPCs and followed human cell engraftment in the peripheral blood over time (Figure 2A). We found that human monocytes in the peripheral blood of mice engrafted with CD33 KO HSPC had the expected diminished expression of CD33 that was sustained over time (Figure 2B). Total human CD33+ cells were significantly decreased in the CD33 KO HSPC-engrafted mice compared to controls, while numbers of total human CD45+ cells, as well as myeloid subsets (CD11b+ and CD14+ cells), were identical between the two groups (Figure 2C). Bone marrow analysis confirmed similar levels of human engraftment and differentiation between control and CD33 KO HSPC-engrafted mice, while decreased expression of CD33 was observed in myeloid cells. Levels of the most primitive (CD34+38−) and more mature (CD34+38+) human HSPCs in the marrow were not significantly different between the two groups (Figure 2D). To document that CD33 KO HSPCs retain long-term repopulating function, we harvested bone marrow cells from mice engrafted with control or CD33 KO HSPCs after 16 weeks and transferred these cells into secondary recipients. Bone marrow analysis of the secondary recipients after 12 additional weeks showed sustained human engraftment, while CD33 expression remained diminished in CD33 KO HSPC recipients (Figure 2E), and PCR confirmed the presence of mutations in CD33 at similar levels to the initial infusion product (Figure 2F). These results indicate that CD33 KO occurred in cells capable of long-term and serial engraftment. We next performed several studies to probe the function of CD33 KO myeloid cells. Human cells in the marrow of mice engrafted with CD33 KO HSPCs were morphologically normal, and absence of CD33 was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Figure 3A). We interrogated the ability of in vitro differentiated CD33 KO myeloid cells to perform phagocytosis, generate reactive oxygen species, and secrete inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (Figures 3B–3D). We used HSPCs that had approximately 50% CD33 KO and gated on the CD33+ and CD33− cells separately, using the CD33+ cells as an internal control while also comparing to control HSPCs. We also performed these studies on cells sorted for CD33+/− expression to exclude any non-cell autonomous function of CD33 (Figure S1). We found no significant difference in any of our studies when comparing the function of CD33− myeloid cells to control cells that were uniformly CD33+.Figure S1CD33-Negative Human Cells Show No Functional Defects Compared to CD33-Positive Controls, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–D) CD33 KO CD33+ cells were differentiated in vitro with SCF, TPO, Flt3L, IL-3, IL-6 and GM-CSF for 7 days after which cells were sorted based on CD33 expression, and functional assays were performed as in Figure 3 (n = 5/group, 2 independent experiments).(A) CD33- cells can perform phagocytosis of E. coli bioparticles to the same degree as CD33+ cells.(B) ROS production at basal and after PMA stimulation is almost identical between CD33- and CD33+ cells.(C) Intracellular cytokine production is similar between CD33+ and CD33- cells after LPS stimulation.(D) Cytokine/chemokine secretion was measured in the supernatant before and after LPS stimulation for 24 hours.

We also performed high-dimensional functional profiling of control and CD33 KO HSPCs using mass cytometry (Behbehani et al., 2015Behbehani G.K. Samusik N. Bjornson Z.B. Fantl W.J. Medeiros B.C.

Other than the expected differences in CD33 expression, we found no differences in the differentiation profile between control and CD33 KO cells by SPADE analysis (Figure S2A). Cells were exposed to relevant ex vivo perturbations (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulator factor [GM-CSF], G-CSF, interferon [IFN]α, IFNγ, interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, lipopolysaccharide [LPS], phorbol myristate acetate [PMA]/ionomycin, thrombopoietin [TPO]) and activation of intracellular signaling pathways in relevant hematopoietic subpopulations was quantified. Remarkably, control and CD33 KO cells responded identically to external stimuli, and within the CD33 KO cell population, both the CD33+ and CD33− cells responded to the same degree (Figures 3E, S2B, and S2C). To exclude a major impact of CD33 loss on downstream gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of CD33 KO myeloid cells and controls, which showed a highly concordant gene expression profile. Paired analysis of matched control and CD33 KO samples showed that CD33 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene (Figure 3F). Finally, we performed studies in mice engrafted with CD33 KO or control human hematopoiesis to evaluate their functional properties in vivo. To model gram-negative sepsis, we injected mice with lipopolysaccharide, which induced high levels of human inflammatory cytokines in the serum with no difference detected between control and CD33 KO (Figure 3G). We also challenged the mice with G-CSF, which induced an equivalent increase of human neutrophils (CD66b+) and monocytes (CD14+) in the peripheral circulation, while in the CD33 KO HSPC-engrafted mice, both CD33+ and CD33− myeloid cells increased to the same degree (Figure 3H). These observations confirmed our hypothesis that human myeloid cells would tolerate loss of CD33. For additional evidence that CD33 may be redundant in human health, we examined several databases of naturally occurring homozygous loss-of-function mutations in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016Lek M.

Genet. 2015; 47: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We found 51 individuals reported to have homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CD33 gene (Table S1), the majority (86%) of which consisted of a deletion of four base pairs in exon 3 (rs201074739), resulting in a frameshift mutation in all protein-coding transcripts of CD33. In the Iceland cohort (Sulem et al., 2015Sulem P. Helgason H. Oddson A. Stefansson H. Gudjonsson S.A. Zink F. Hjartarson E. Sigurdsson G.T. Jonasdottir A. Jonasdottir A. et al.Identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), four of these individuals were reported to have reached 64 to 93 years of age. To evaluate whether our CRISPR/Cas9-based CD33 KO system would cause any off-target mutagenesis, we performed cytogenetic analysis of multiple control/CD33 KO primary samples for gross chromosomal rearrangements, which were not detected (Figure S3A). We further analyzed six donor samples by PCR and found that all showed evidence of deletion of the 14-kb fragment between CD33 and SIGLEC22P, a pseudogene that has 100% homology with CD33 at the gRNA binding site (Figure S3B). These two genes are directly adjacent to each other, with no known genetic element in the intervening sequence. We then performed targeted deep sequencing of the top 10 predicted off-target sites in primary CD34+ cells after CD33 KO in comparison with control cells from the same donor (Figure S3C). In all samples, the on-target site, CD33, had high levels of mutations (86% ± 4%), and SIGLEC22P harbored a similar extent of mutations as the target gene (85% ± 9%). Only one additional site, SIGLEC6, was found to have low-frequency mutations (0.41%–1.72%) in three of the five donors evaluated. As a more comprehensive screen for all potential off-target mutation sites in a genome-wide unbiased manner, we performed circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq) (Tsai et al., 2017Tsai S.Q. Nguyen N.T. Malagon-Lopez J. Topkar V.V. Aryee M.J. Joung J.K. CIRCLE-seq: a highly sensitive in vitro screen for genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease off-targets.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) on genomic DNA from human primary cells and identified 95 sites cleaved by the Cas9/CD33-gRNA complex in vitro (Figures S3D and S3E). We then performed targeted deep sequencing in primary CD34+ cells in 16 sites that had a high read count on CIRCLE-seq and/or had a three-or-less nucleotide mismatch to the on-target sequence. Most of the sites had no detectable mutations in primary cells. We next turned to a non-human primate (NHP) model to rigorously evaluate the long-term effects and functional consequences of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CD33 KO on HSPCs. CD33 was expressed uniformly on over 95% of neutrophils from both rhesus macaques (RMs) and humans, but expression on monocytes was more heterogeneous in RMs (Figure S4A); thus, we focused on the neutrophil population for further studies. Of note, following in vitro expansion in the presence of myeloid cytokines for 10 days, virtually all human CD34+ cells expressed CD33, in contrast to only 20%–30% of cultured RM CD34+ cells (Figure S4B), highlighting some species-specific differences in CD33 expression. We identified gRNA sequences targeting sites in exons 2 or 3 of the RM CD33 gene that showed activity in vitro in primary RM CD34+ cells. As levels of CD33 KO in RM CD34+ cells were not as robust as in human cells, we used two methods to increase the frequency of mutations: first, we used two gRNAs in combination, and second, we added a ssODN template analogous to that used in the human studies (Figures S4C and S4D). Both approaches were utilized in in vivo studies. We performed apheresis collection and purification of CD34+ HSPCs in two monkeys, ZL38 and ZL33. Autologous CD34+ HPSCs were electroporated with the CD33-targeting gRNAs/Cas9 protein complexes and ssODNs homologous to the targeted exons and reinfused into the donor following myeloablative total body irradiation (Figure 4A). Figure 4B summarizes transplantation parameters for ZL38 and ZL33. Following autologous transplantation of CD33 KO HSPCs, both RMs engrafted promptly without transplantation-related complications. The pattern and rate of recovery of blood counts, including neutrophils and monocytes, was similar in these two animals compared to three historical controls (Wu et al., 2014Wu C. Li B. Lu R. Koelle S.J. Yang Y. Jares A. Krouse A.E. Metzger M. Liang F.

Furthermore, we found similar morphology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in the marrow between ZL38/ZL33 and a control RM that underwent autologous transplantation with lentivirally transduced CD34+ cells (Figure S5E).Figure S5Hematologic Recovery following Infusion of CRISPR/Cas9 CD33-Edited Autologous CD34+ Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A–D) Absolute total number of neutrophils (A), platelets (B), lymphocytes (C), and monocytes (D) were determined in the peripheral blood of macaques at the indicated time points after autologous transplantation.

ZL38 received cells exposed to gRNAs targeting both exon 2 and exon 3, while ZL33 received cells exposed to the exon-2-targeting gRNA only. An aliquot of the HSPC infusion product showed 17% and 36% homozygous KO colony-forming units (CFUs) in ZL38 and ZL33, respectively (Figure 4C). We were able to detect clear populations of CD33-negative neutrophils in the blood of both animals by flow cytometry following engraftment (Figure 4D). The levels were highest at 2–4 weeks following transplantation and then decreased, plateauing by 6 months post transplantation at levels of 3%–6% in both animals, with no further significant decrease by 12 and 17 months post transplantation in ZL38 and ZL33, respectively. This pattern suggests more efficient editing of short-term progenitors than long-term HSPCs. To confirm editing at the CD33 target sequences, we tracked the edited allelic fractions over time using targeted deep sequencing to identify the specific indels introduced by CRISPR/Cas9. In ZL38, two gRNAs were used, and the target sites of each were sequenced individually. The frequencies of indels in the infusion product were 12% and 7% for exons 2 and 3, respectively, and highest levels were observed at 1 month in vivo, then plateaued at a level of about 1% for each exon over time (Figure 4E). The most frequent indel at both exon 2 and exon 3 targets was an A insertion at the Cas9 cut site, presumably resulting from recombination with the ssODN template. Large deletions of the area between exon 2 and exon 3 were detected in approximately 2% of the alleles, and Sanger sequencing confirmed that this fragment represented fusions between sequences upstream of the exon 2 cut site and downstream of the exon 3 cut site (Figure 4F). The frequency of the deletion between the two gRNA cut sites of the CD33 gene was quantified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Similar to flow cytometry or deep sequencing data, the CD33 deletion frequency dropped early during the post-transplantation period, and a deletion rate of 2%–4% persisted long term (Figure 4G). ZL33 was treated with a single gRNA and exhibited the same pattern of higher initial engraftment with edited cells followed by stabilization at a level of approximately 4%, again with the A insertion most prominent (Figure 4H). We analyzed indel frequency in CFUs grown from the marrow of ZL33 at 4.5 months post transplant and observed 5% homozygous and 3% heterozygous mutations within the range observed in circulating cells at the same time point (Figure 4I). We sorted neutrophils based on CD33 expression. As expected, the frequency of indels in purified CD33-negative neutrophils was significantly higher than in the bulk neutrophil population, and CD33-positive neutrophils had the fewest indels (Figures S6A and S6B). We performed studies to assess maturation and differentiation of CD33 KO HSPCs in ZL33. First, we examined the distribution of CD33 mutations across purified cells from various hematopoietic lineages in the blood. All showed similar CD33 indel frequencies, suggesting that CD33 KO HSPCs maintain their ability to differentiate to all lineages (Figure S6C). We analyzed CD33 mutations in CD34+ cells, CD34− cells, and granulocytes from marrow aspirates and compared to CD33 mutations in circulating neutrophils and found indel frequencies to be similar between progenitors and mature cells in the marrow or in the circulation (Figure 4H), suggesting normal myeloid maturation and release (Figure S6D). In summary, CD33 KO HSPCs successfully engrafted and maintained long-term stable repopulation capacity without evidence of perturbation with respect to hematopoieti"
https://openalex.org/W2807587036,"The emergence and diversification of cell types is a leading factor in animal evolution. So far, systematic characterization of the gene regulatory programs associated with cell type specificity was limited to few cell types and few species. Here, we perform whole-organism single-cell transcriptomics to map adult and larval cell types in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, a non-bilaterian animal with complex tissue-level body-plan organization. We uncover eight broad cell classes in Nematostella, including neurons, cnidocytes, and digestive cells. Each class comprises different subtypes defined by the expression of multiple specific markers. In particular, we characterize a surprisingly diverse repertoire of neurons, which comparative analysis suggests are the result of lineage-specific diversification. By integrating transcription factor expression, chromatin profiling, and sequence motif analysis, we identify the regulatory codes that underlie Nematostella cell-specific expression. Our study reveals cnidarian cell type complexity and provides insights into the evolution of animal cell-specific genomic regulation."

Radial glial (RG) cells, located in the ventricular zone (VZ), constitute the major subtype of neurogenic cortical progenitors (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Radial glial cell heterogeneity--the source of diverse progeny in the CNS.Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; 83: 2-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). They undergo multiple cycles of regenerative, mostly asymmetric, cell divisions, leading to the generation of diverse types of neurons while maintaining a pool of progenitors (Miyata et al., 2004Miyata T.

In humans, RG cells go through an increased number of such cycles when compared with non human-primate or mouse (Geschwind and Rakic, 2013Geschwind D.H. Rakic P.

Timing of neurogenesis is likely linked to species-specific properties intrinsic to RG cells, as it is conserved during in vitro corticogenesis from human, non-human primate, or mouse pluripotent stem cells (Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013Espuny-Camacho I.

Species differences in cortical neurogenic output are also linked to the expansion of specific classes of progenitors in the primate and human cortex, in particular the “outer” radial glial (oRG) cells, located in the outer-subventricular zone (oSVZ) (Fietz et al., 2010Fietz S.A.

Cortex. 2011; 21: 1674-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The oRG cells emerge from RG cells later in embryogenesis, and their progeny tend to undergo multiple rounds of divisions, thus providing an additional key mechanism of increased neuronal output. Many highly conserved signaling pathways are required for the control of cortical neurogenesis (Tiberi et al., 2012bTiberi L. Vanderhaeghen P. van den Ameele J. Cortical neurogenesis and morphogens: diversity of cues, sources and functions.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which display species-specific properties that likely contribute to divergence of cortical neurogenesis (Boyd et al., 2015Boyd J.L.

Comparative analyses of mammalian genomes led to the identification of many human-specific signatures of divergence, which might underlie some aspects of human brain evolution (Enard, 2016Enard W.

Molecular evolution of FOXP2, a gene involved in speech and language.Nature. 2002; 418: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Another important driver of evolution is the emergence of novel genes (Ohno, 1999Ohno S. Gene duplication and the uniqueness of vertebrate genomes circa 1970-1999.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Gene duplication (Kaessmann, 2010Kaessmann H. Origins, evolution, and phenotypic impact of new genes.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) is one of the primary forces by which novel gene function can arise, where an “ancestral” gene is duplicated into related “paralog” genes (Dennis and Eichler, 2016Dennis M.Y.

Particularly interesting are hominid-specific duplicated (HS) genes, which arose from segmental DNA-mediated gene duplications specifically in the hominid and/or human genomes (Fortna et al., 2004Fortna A.

Most of them have emerged recently in the human lineage after its separation from the common ancestor to great apes, during the period of rapid expansion of the cerebral cortex. They could inherently lead to considerable gene diversification and modification and thereby may have contributed to the rapid emergence of human-specific neural traits. The role of the vast majority of the HS genes remains unknown, and many could be non-functional or redundant with their ancestral form. Recent segmental duplications are enriched for gene families with potential roles in neural development (Fortna et al., 2004Fortna A. Kim Y. MacLaren E. Marshall K. Hahn G. Meltesen L. Brenton M.

These provide the first examples of HS gene duplications that may be linked to human cortex evolution, but it remains unclear how many and which HS genes are actually involved in human corticogenesis. One of the roadblocks in identifying candidate HS genes is the difficulty in distinguishing the expression of mRNA expressed from the ancestral gene or the HS paralogs, as their degree of conservation is usually extremely high (Sudmant et al., 2010Sudmant P.H. Kitzman J.O. Antonacci F. Alkan C. Malig M. Tsalenko A. Sampas N. Bruhn L. Shendure J. Eichler E.E. 1000 Genomes ProjectDiversity of human copy number variation and multicopy genes.Science. 2010; 330: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Here, we used tailored RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis aimed at specific and sensitive detection of HS gene expression and thus identified a specific repertoire of dozens of HS duplicated genes that display robust and dynamic expression during human fetal corticogenesis. Among them we discovered NOTCH2NL, human-specific paralogs of the NOTCH2 receptor, which stood out for their ability to promote cortical progenitor maintenance. Functional analyses revealed that NOTCH2NL can expand human cortical progenitors and increase their neuronal output at the clonal level through cell-autonomous activation of the Notch pathway. Previous work has identified dozens of HS gene families containing genes duplicated in the hominid and human lineage (Dennis et al., 2017Dennis M.Y. Harshman L. Nelson B.J. Penn O. Cantsilieris S.

This is due to the difficulty to determine their expression level with conventional methods, given the high sequence similarity between HS paralogs of the same family. We first sought to determine, for each HS gene family, whether and how ancestral and paralog genes are expressed in the human developing cortex. We performed deep sequencing of RNA extracted from human fetal cortex at key stages of cortical neurogenesis (from 7 to 21 gestational weeks [GW]). For the later-stage samples, we performed microdissection to discriminate specific regions of the cortex (frontal to occipital). For the parietal area, we further microdissected the cortical plate (CP) and underlying domains of the cortical wall (non-CP, containing mostly oSVZ and VZ germinal zones) to isolate compartments enriched in neural progenitors versus postmitotic neurons. To maximize the sensitivity and specificity of HS gene detection, we selected the libraries for cDNA fragments of 350–700 bp and sequenced them with a 2 × 151 bp paired-ends protocol (Figure S1A). Since HS duplications are recent evolutionary events, paralogs within each family are highly similar, potentially confusing the mapping of reads originating from individual paralogs and estimates of their levels of expression (Figure S1B). Standard annotations on reference genomes are also discordant for HS genes. We therefore manually curated gene structures for these genes whenever possible (Table S1) and developed a computational pipeline correcting the expression estimates of closely related paralogs for mapping errors (Figures S1C and S1D; STAR Methods). We focused on gene duplications previously described in the human genome (Sudmant et al., 2010Sudmant P.H. Kitzman J.O. Antonacci F. Alkan C. Malig M. Tsalenko A. Sampas N. Bruhn L. Shendure J. Eichler E.E. 1000 Genomes ProjectDiversity of human copy number variation and multicopy genes.Science. 2010; 330: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) followed by homology searches at the genomic and transcript levels (Table S2). The distribution of gene expression values for HS genes was similar to that of all genes in the human reference genome (Figure 1A). We selected HS genes based on their absolute levels of expression above a defined threshold, 5 fragments per kilobase million (FPKM), corresponding to the minimal level of a set of 60 well-defined marker genes of corticogenesis (Figure 1A). We then selected the gene families where at least two paralogs, typically the ancestor and at least one HS paralog, were expressed above the threshold (Figure 1B). This selection led to a short list of 68 genes distributed among 24 gene families, displaying robust and dynamic expression during human corticogenesis (Figure 1B; Table S2). About half of the genes were preferentially expressed in progenitors and/or early stages, and fewer of them in neuronal compartment and/or late stages of corticogenesis (Figure 1C). Analysis of predicted coding sequences revealed that 51 HS genes (including 18 potential ancestor genes and 35 potentially unique to hominid and human genomes) display an open reading frame (ORF) that was overall conserved but distinct between paralogs of the same family. For 17 HS genes, no reliable ORF could be detected, indicating potential pseudogenization or function as non-coding RNA (Table S2). Among the HS genes that have been studied so far in the context of cortical development, the screen identified SRGAP2 family genes, but neither ARHGAP11 nor TBC1D3 as the expression of ARHGAP11B was below"
https://openalex.org/W2805679331,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) mainly caused by F. graminearum, always brings serious damage to wheat production worldwide. In this study, we found that strain LM2303 had strong antagonist activity against F. graminearum and significantly reduced disease severity of FHB with the control efficiency of 72.3% under field conditions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the B. velezensis clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control. The results also provide scientific reference and comparison for other biocontrol strains."
https://openalex.org/W2805090279,"Numerous well-defined classes of retinal ganglion cells innervate the thalamus to guide image-forming vision, yet the rules governing their convergence and divergence remain unknown. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mouse thalamus, we observed a functional arrangement of retinal ganglion cell axonal boutons in which coarse-scale retinotopic ordering gives way to fine-scale organization based on shared preferences for other visual features. Specifically, at the ∼6 μm scale, clusters of boutons from different axons often showed similar preferences for either one or multiple features, including axis and direction of motion, spatial frequency, and changes in luminance. Conversely, individual axons could “de-multiplex” information channels by participating in multiple, functionally distinct bouton clusters. Finally, ultrastructural analyses demonstrated that retinal axonal boutons in a local cluster often target the same dendritic domain. These data suggest that functionally specific convergence and divergence of retinal axons may impart diverse, robust, and often novel feature selectivity to visual thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2806597393,"Associative N fixation (ANF), the process by which dinitrogen gas is converted to ammonia by bacteria in casual association with plants, has not been well-studied in temperate ecosystems. We examined the ANF potential of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a North American prairie grass whose productivity is often unresponsive to N fertilizer addition, via separate short-term 15N2 incubations of rhizosphere soils and excised roots four times during the growing season. Measurements occurred along N fertilization gradients at two sites with contrasting soil fertility (Wisconsin, USA Mollisols and Michigan, USA Alfisols). In general, we found that ANF potentials declined with long-term N addition, corresponding with increased soil N availability. Although we hypothesized that ANF potential would track plant N demand through the growing season, the highest root fixation rates occurred after plants senesced, suggesting that root diazotrophs exploit carbon (C) released during senescence, as C is translocated from aboveground tissues to roots for wintertime storage. Measured ANF potentials, coupled with mass balance calculations, suggest that ANF appears to be an important source of N to unfertilized switchgrass, and, by extension, to temperate grasslands in general."
https://openalex.org/W2805976575,"Influenza A virus commonly circulating in swine (IAV-S) is characterized by large genetic and antigenic diversity and, thus, improvements in different aspects of IAV-S surveillance are needed to achieve desirable goals of surveillance such as to establish the capacity to forecast with the greatest accuracy the number of influenza cases likely to arise. Advancements in modeling approaches provide the opportunity to use different models for surveillance. However, in order to make improvements in surveillance, it is necessary to assess the predictive ability of such models. This study compares the sensitivity and predictive accuracy of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) model, and the random forest (RF) model with respect to the frequency of influenza A virus (IAV) in Ontario swine. Diagnostic data on IAV submissions in Ontario swine between 2007 and 2015 were obtained from the Animal Health Laboratory (University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada). Each modeling approach was examined for predictive accuracy, evaluated by the root mean square error, the normalized root mean square error, and the model's ability to anticipate increases and decreases in disease frequency. Likewise, we verified the magnitude of improvement offered by the ARIMA, GLARMA and RF models over a seasonal-naïve method. Using the diagnostic submissions, the occurrence of seasonality and the long-term trend in IAV infections were also investigated. The RF model had the smallest root mean square error in the prospective analysis and tended to predict increases in the number of diagnostic submissions and positive virological submissions at weekly and monthly intervals with a higher degree of sensitivity than the ARIMA and GLARMA models. The number of weekly positive virological submissions is significantly higher in the fall calendar season compared to the summer calendar season. Positive counts at weekly and monthly intervals demonstrated a significant increasing trend. Overall, this study shows that the RF model offers enhanced prediction ability over the ARIMA and GLARMA time series models for predicting the frequency of IAV infections in diagnostic submissions."
https://openalex.org/W2805366847,"Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is an important “orphan” cereal and the most widely grown of all the millet species worldwide. It is also the sixth most important cereal in the world after wheat, rice, maize, barley, and sorghum, being largely grown and used in West Africa as well as in India and Pakistan. The present study was carried out in the frame of a program designed to increase benefits and reduce potential health problems deriving from the consumption of pearl millet. The specific goal was to provide a database of information on the variability existing in pearl millet germplasm as to the amounts of phytate, the most relevant antinutrient compound, and the goitrogenic compounds C-glycosylflavones (C-GFs) accumulated in the grain.Results we obtained clearly show that, as indicated by the range in values, a substantial variability subsists across the investigated pearl millet inbred lines as regards the grain level of phytic acid phosphate, while the amount of C-GFs shows a very high variation. Suitable potential parents to be used in breeding programs can be therefore chosen from the surveyed material in order to create new germplasm with increased nutritional quality and food safety. Moreover, we report novel molecular data showing which genes are more relevant for phytic acid biosynthesis in the seeds as well as a preliminary analysis of a pearl millet orthologous gene for C-GFs biosynthesis. These results open the way to dissect the genetic determinants controlling key seed nutritional phenotypes and to the characterization of their impact on grain nutritional value in pearl millet."
https://openalex.org/W2805799921,"Over the past decade, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) has been increasingly utilized in respiratory failure in patients. This study presents our institution´s experience focusing on the life span of ECMO systems reflecting the performance of a particular system. A retrospective review of our ECMO database identified 461 adult patients undergoing vvECMO (2010–2017). Patients that required more than one system and survived the first exchange >24 hours (n = 139) were included. Life span until the first exchange and exchange criteria were analyzed for all systems (PLS, Cardiohelp HLS-set, both Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Rastatt, Germany; Deltastream/Hilite7000LT, iLA-activve, Xenios/NovaLung, Heilbronn, Germany; ECC.O5, LivaNova, Mirandola, Italy). At our ECMO center, the frequency of a system exchange was 30%. The median (IQR) life span was 9 (6–12) days. There was no difference regarding the different systems (p = 0.145 and p = 0.108, respectively). However, the Deltastream systems were exchanged more frequently due to elective technical complications (e. g. worsened gas transfer, development of coagulation disorder, increased bleedings complications) compared to the other exchanged systems (p = 0.013). In summary, the used ECMO systems are safe and effective for acute respiratory failure. There is no evidence for the usage of a specific system. Only the increased predictability of an imminent exchange preferred the usage of a Deltastream system. However, the decision to use a particular system should not depend solely on the possible criteria for an exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2806773540,"Background Due to the surrounding bone, the human inner ear is relatively inaccessible and difficult to reach for cellular and molecular analyses. However, these types of investigations are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of several inner ear disorders. Moreover, the fluid from the inner ear cannot be sampled for micro-chemical analyses from healthy individuals in vivo. Therefore, in the present paper, we studied patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) undergoing trans-labyrinthine surgery (TLS). Our primary aim was to identify perilymph proteins in patients with VS on an individual level. Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter. Methods and findings Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition. Conclusions The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes."

We retrospectively analyzed 687 NSCLC specimens (476 adenocarcinoma and 211 squamous cell carcinoma) using tissue microarray. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using Dako 22C3 pharmDx assay and PDL1 mRNA was measured using RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). The overall prevalence of PD-L1 protein expression was 25.2% in tumor cells and PDL1 mRNA expression was 11.9%. There was a strong positive correlation between PD-L1 IHC and RISH results (Spearman’s rho = 0.6, p<0.001). In adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 protein and mRNA expressions significantly correlated with poorly differentiated histologic subtype (p<0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). PD-L1 expression was also associated with genetic alteration in adenocarcinoma. High PD-L1 expression level was associated with EGFR-naïve and KRAS-mutant subgroup (p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). With a 1% cut-off value, PD-L1 protein expression showed a short overall survival duration in early stage adenocarcinoma with marginal significance (p = 0.05, Hazard ratio = 1.947). Our study revealed that PD-L1 expression varied with histologic subtype and genomic alteration status in lung adenocarcinoma, and activation of the PD-L1 pathway may be a poor prognostic factor especially in early stage lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, PDL1 RISH showed promising results in predicting PD-L1 protein expression in NSCLC."

We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario and examine trends in the incidence of non-disseminated and disseminated LD. LD surveillance data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) from 2005–2014 were mapped to symptoms according to syndrome groups (erythema migrans (EM), flu-like, cardiac, neurologic or arthritic) and disease stages (early localized, early disseminated or late disseminated). During the study period, 1,230 cases due to Borrelia burgdoferi were reported in Ontario with annual incidence rates ranging from 0.32 (2006) to 2.16 (2013) cases per 100,000 population. Seventy percent of cases had EM and the proportion of cases with EM increased over time. Other clinical manifestations included flu-like (75%), arthritic (42%), neurologic (41%) and cardiac (6%) symptoms. Early localized disease (n = 415) manifested with EM (87%) and flu-like (57%) symptoms; early disseminated disease (n = 216) manifested with neurologic (94%), cardiac (10%) and EM (63%) symptoms; and late disseminated disease (n = 475) manifested with EM (62%), neurologic (55%), cardiac (9%), and arthritic symptoms (i.e., arthralgia (93%) and arthritis (7%)). Early localized and early disseminated cases (88% each) occurred primarily from May through September, compared to late disseminated cases (81%). The proportion of cases reported to public health within 30 days of illness onset increased during the study period, while the proportion of cases reported within 1–3 months and >3 months decreased. Geographical variations characterized by higher incidence of early localized disease and earlier public health notification (within 30 days of illness onset) occurred in regions with established or recently established LD risk areas, while later public health notification (>3 months after illness onset) was reported more frequently in regions with recently established or no identified risk areas. This is the first study to describe the clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario, Canada. The observed geographical variations in the epidemiology of LD in Ontario reinforce the need for regionally focused public health strategies aimed at increasing awareness, promoting earlier recognition and reporting, and encouraging greater uptake of preventive measures."

https://openalex.org/W2805053797,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) still is a major worldwide health problem, with 10.4 million new cases in 2016. Only 5–15% of people infected with M. tuberculosis develop TB disease while others remain latently infected (LTBI) during their lifetime. Thus, the absence of tests able to distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis is one of the major limits of currently available diagnostic tools. Methods A total of 215 patients were included in the study as active TB cases (n = 73), LTBI subjects (n = 88) and healthy persons (n = 54). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from each patient and the LIOSpot® TB anti-human IL-2 ELISpot assay was performed to test their proliferative response to M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10 and Ala-DH. Statistical analysis was performed to define the sensitivity and the specificity of the LIOSpot® TB kit for each antigen used and to set the best cut off value that enables discrimination between subjects with active TB or latent TB infection. Results Comparing the LIOSpot® TB results for each tested antigen between uninfected and infected subjects and between people with latent infection and active TB disease, the differences were significant for each antigen (p< 0.0001) but the ROC analysis demonstrated a high accuracy for the Ala-DH test only, with a cut off value of 12.5 SFC per million PBMCs and the Ala-DH ROC curve conferred a 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity to the test. For the ESAT-6 antigen, with a best cut off value of 71.25 SFC per million PBMCs, a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 36% was obtained. Finally, the best cut off value for CFP-10 was 231.25 SFC per million PBMCs, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 54%. Thus, as for IGRA assays such as Quantiferon and T-Spot TB tests, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are unable to distinguish LTBI from active TB when IL-2 is measured. On the contrary, the IL-2 production induced by Ala-DH, measured by LIOSpot® TB kit, shows high sensitivity and specificity for active TB disease. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the LIOSpot® TB test is a highly useful diagnostic tool to discriminate between latent TB infection and active tuberculosis in adults patients."
https://openalex.org/W2805112009,"In this study, we report a detailed experimental, binding free energy calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation investigation of the interactions of carboxylic-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-f-MWCNTs) with porcine trypsin (pTry). The enzyme exhibits decreased thermostability at 330K in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. Furthermore, the activity of pTry also decreases in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. The restricted diffusion of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme was observed in the experiment. The MD simulation analysis suggested that this could be because of the blocking of the S1 pocket of pTry, which plays a vital role in the substrate selectivity. The intrinsic fluorescence of pTry is quenched with increase in the COOH-f-MWCNTs concentration. Circular dichroism (CD) and UV–visible absorption spectroscopies indicate the ability of COOH-f-MWCNTs to experience conformational change in the native structure of the enzyme. The binding free energy calculations also show that electrostatics, π-cation, and π-π stacking interactions play important roles in the binding of the carboxylated CNTs with pTry. The MD simulation results demonstrated that the carboxylated CNTs adsorb to the enzyme stronger than the CNT without the–COOH groups. Our observations can provide an example of the nanoscale toxicity of COOH-f-MWCNTs for proteins, which is a critical issue for in vivo application of COOH-f-MWCNTs."

The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is a devastating rice insect pest due to its ability to rapidly overcome plant resistance and the lack of sufficient resistance resources. BR4831 (a rice breeding line derived from the pyramiding of two BPH resistance genes, Bph14 and Bph15, into the elite rice variety Huang-Hua-Zhan, HHZ) and two single-gene introgression lines (HF106, carrying Bph14, and C602, carrying Bph15, in the elite rice cultivar 9311) were evaluated for their resistance to BPH using a standard seed box screening test coupled with field tests. The related resistance types were determined using laboratory assays. The seed box test and laboratory biological assays showed that BR4831 exhibited strong antibiotic resistance, and the behavioral assay showed that this line also exhibited strong antixenotic resistance, while both HF106 and C602 exhibited only weak antibiosis and no antixenotic resistance. Field tests showed significantly improved resistance in BR4831 compared to that of its recipient parent HHZ and slightly increased resistance in HF106 and C602 in comparison with their recipient parent 9311. These results demonstrate that the rice line BR4831, with pyramided resistance genes, exhibits higher resistance than the monogenic lines HF106 and C602 and highlight the benefits of combining the seed box seedling test, field tests and laboratory assays to thoroughly analyze plant resistance types."

The Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) programme provides the most comprehensive and objective measurement of general practitioner activity in Australia. Using BEACH data, this study compared general practice encounters for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and type II diabetes during a 10-year period between 2006 and 2016. Analysis revealed more frequent encounters for depression compared to anxiety, and a higher representation of women in encounters for bipolar disorder compared to men. The relationship between number of encounters and patient age was strongly associated with the life course and mortality characteristics associated with each disorder. The findings highlight specific challenges associated with access to primary care for people with serious mental illness, and suggest areas of focus to improve the ability of these patients to access and navigate the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2805829106,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are important DNA lesions induced by endogenous crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, as well as ionizing radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and abortive action of some enzymes. Due to their very bulky nature, they are expected to interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. DPCs are highly genotoxic and the ability of cells to deal with them is relevant for many chemotherapeutic interventions. However, interactions of DNA polymerases with DPCs have been poorly studied due to the lack of a convenient experimental model. We have used NaBH4-induced trapping of E. coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I, Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase, Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases β, κ and λ, and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4-5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2805878472,"Background Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is minimal invasive techniques to reconstruct the vertebral height and prevent further collapse of the fractured vertebrae by injecting polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral body. However, recompression of polymethylmethacrylate augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggressive local kyphotic was observed frequently after VP or KP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Methods A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential risk factors associated with polymethylmethacrylate distribution for recompression. Results One hundred and six (37.7%) patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period. The polymethylmethacrylate distributed in the middle of vertebral body showed significant differences between two groups. In non-recompression group, the polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body were closer to endplates than that in the recompression group (upper: t = 31.41, p<0.001; lower: t = 12.19, p<0.001). The higher percentage of the height of polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body indicates the lower risk of recompression (odds ratio [OR]<0.01, p<0.001). The recompression group and non-recompression group showed significant difference in “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern (polymethylmethacrylate contacted to the both upper/lower endplates) (χ2 = 66.23, p<0.001). The vertebra with a “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern has lower risk of recompression (OR = 0.09, p<0.001). Conclusions Either more polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body or “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern had a significantly less incidence of recompression. The findings indicated that the control of polymethylmethacrylate distribution during surgery may reduce the risks of recompression after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty."
https://openalex.org/W2805943116,"Background Syphilis in pregnancy is an under-recognized public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for over 60% of the global burden of syphilis. If left untreated, more than half of maternal syphilis cases will result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth and fetal loss, neonatal death, prematurity or low birth weight, and neonatal infections. Achieving universal coverage of antenatal syphilis screening and treatment has been the focus of the global campaign for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. However, little is known about the availability of antenatal syphilis screening and treatment across sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to estimate the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’ for antenatal syphilis screening and treatment by analyzing health facility surveys and household surveys conducted from 2010 to 2015 in 12 sub-Saharan African countries. Methods In this secondary data analysis, we linked indicators of health facility readiness to provide antenatal syphilis detection and treatment from Service Provision Assessments (SPAs) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessments (SARAs) to indicators of ANC use from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to compute estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’. Results Based on data from 5,593 health facilities that reported offering antenatal care (ANC) services, the availability of syphilis detection and treatment in ANC facilities ranged from 2% to 83%. The availability of syphilis detection and treatment was substantially lower in ANC facilities in West Africa compared to the other sub-regions. Levels of ANC attendance were high (median 94.9%), but only 27% of ANC attendees initiated care at less than 4 months gestation. We estimated that about one in twelve pregnant women received ANC early (<4 months) at a facility ready to provide syphilis detection and treatment (median 8%, range 7–32%). The largest implementation bottleneck identified was low health facility readiness, followed by timeliness of the first ANC visit. Conclusions While access was fairly high, the low levels of likelihood of antenatal syphilis detection and treatment identified reinforce the need to improve the availability of syphilis rapid diagnostic tests and treatment and the timeliness of antenatal care-seeking across sub-Saharan Africa."

We randomised 120 HIV-negative women 1:1 to intermittent use (three rings with a ring-free week in between rings) or continuous use (four rings without ring-free weeks). Women underwent an interview, counselling, and a speculum examination, and were tested for pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV) by Nugent scoring, yeasts and trichomonads on wet mount, and sexually transmitted infections.Only one woman withdrew early. Deliberate ring removals were rare, but spontaneous ring expulsions occurred during 14% of ring use periods. There were no incident pregnancies, serious adverse events, serious social harms, or early discontinuations for safety reasons. Systemic side effects were uncommon, and local side effects were not significantly differently distributed between groups except for lower abdominal pain (P = 0.013). The incidence of vaginal yeasts during ring use was high: 22% of intermittent users and 27% of continuous users had incident vaginal yeasts at one or multiple ring removal visits (P = 0.666), and symptomatic vaginal yeast cases were more common in the continuous than intermittent users (P = 0.031). In contrast, mean Nugent scores improved over time in both groups.Intermittent and continuous NuvaRing® use were safe in Rwandan women and improved Nugent scores over time. However, attention should be paid to ring expulsions and to a potential increased risk of vaginal candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2806684969,"The pear (genus Pyrus) is one of the most ancient and widely cultivated tree fruit crops in temperate climates. The Mount Etna area claims a large number of pear varieties differentiated due to a long history of cultivation and environmental variability, making this area particularly suitable for genetic studies. Ninety-five pear individuals were genotyped using the simple sequence repeat (SSR) methodology interrogating both the nuclear (nDNA) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) to combine an investigation of maternal inheritance of chloroplast SSRs (cpSSRs) with the high informativity of nuclear SSRs (nSSRs). The germplasm was selected ad hoc to include wild genotypes, local varieties, and national and international cultivated varieties. The objectives of this study were as follows: (i) estimate the level of differentiation within local varieties; (ii) elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between the cultivated genotypes and wild accessions; and (iii) estimate the potential genetic flow and the relationship among the germplasms in our analysis. Eight nSSRs detected a total of 136 alleles with an average minor allelic frequency and observed heterozygosity of 0.29 and 0.65, respectively, whereas cpSSRs allowed identification of eight haplotypes (S4 Table). These results shed light on the genetic relatedness between Italian varieties and wild genotypes. Among the wild species, compared with P. amygdaliformis, few P. pyraster genotypes exhibited higher genetic similarity to local pear varieties. Our analysis revealed the presence of genetic stratification with a ‘wild’ subpopulation characterizing the genetic makeup of wild species and the international cultivated varieties exhibiting the predominance of the ‘cultivated’ subpopulation."
https://openalex.org/W2807126090,"Objective The present study aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV)-treated patients, and identify baseline NS5A or NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). Methods Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed. Results Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%). Conclusions Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure. These results might indicate that the coexisting baseline RASs influence the therapeutic effects of SOF/LDV."
https://openalex.org/W2806142340,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear, but an imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is known to play a critical role in AD progression. A promising preventative approach is to enhance the normal Aβ clearance activity of brain phagocytes such as microglia. In mice, the intraperitoneal injection of Toll-like receptor 4 agonist was shown to enhance Aβ clearance and exhibit a preventative effect on AD-related pathology. Our previous clinical study demonstrated that orally administered Pantoea agglomerans-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPSp) exhibited an LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering effect in human volunteers with hyperlipidemia, a known risk factor for AD. In vitro studies have shown that LPSp treatment increases Aβ phagocytosis by microglial cells; however it is still unclear whether orally administered LPSp exhibits a preventive effect on AD progression. We show here that in senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed a high-fat diet, oral administration of LPSp at 0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight·day for 18 weeks significantly improved glucose metabolism and lipid profiles. The LPSp treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and oxidative-burst activity in the peripheral blood. Moreover, LPSp significantly reduced brain Aβ burden and memory impairment as seen in the water maze test, although we could not confirm a significant enhancement of Aβ phagocytosis in microglia isolated from the brains after treatment. Taken together, our results show that LPSp holds promise as a preventative therapy for AD or AD-related diseases induced by impairment of metabolic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2806468983,"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear restorer-of-fertility gene (Rf), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession 'Fukkoku-ouba' that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet Rfs, Rf1 and Rf2. Only the Rf2 marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the Rf1 locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to Rf1, leading to the assumption that the Rf1 locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another Rf. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring 'Fukkoku-ouba' rf1 gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells. In contrast, 'Fukkoku-ouba' rf1 transcript abundance was highly reduced compared to that of the restoring Rf1. Consistently, changes in protein complexes containing CMS-associated mitochondrial protein in anthers were very minor. Accordingly, we concluded that 'Fukkoku-ouba' rf1 is a hypomorph that acts as a non-restoring allele but has the potential to support another Rf, i.e. it is a modifier candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2807651168,"Genes coding for nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) control resistance against intracellular (cell-penetrating) pathogens. However, evidence for a role of genes coding for proteins with LRR domains in resistance against extracellular (apoplastic) fungal pathogens is limited. Here, the distribution of genes coding for proteins with eLRR domains but lacking kinase domains was determined for the Brassica napus genome. Predictions of signal peptide and transmembrane regions divided these genes into 184 coding for receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and 121 coding for secreted proteins (SPs). Together with previously annotated NLRs, a total of 720 LRR genes were found. Leptosphaeria maculans-induced expression during a compatible interaction with cultivar Topas differed between RLP, SP and NLR gene families; NLR genes were induced relatively late, during the necrotrophic phase of pathogen colonization. Seven RLP, one SP and two NLR genes were found in Rlm1 and Rlm3/Rlm4/Rlm7/Rlm9 loci for resistance against L. maculans on chromosome A07 of B. napus. One NLR gene at the Rlm9 locus was positively selected, as was the RLP gene on chromosome A10 with LepR3 and Rlm2 alleles conferring resistance against L. maculans races with corresponding effectors AvrLm1 and AvrLm2, respectively. Known loci for resistance against L. maculans (extracellular hemi-biotrophic fungus), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (necrotrophic fungus) and Plasmodiophora brassicae (intracellular, obligate biotrophic protist) were examined for presence of RLPs, SPs and NLRs in these regions. Whereas loci for resistance against P. brassicae were enriched for NLRs, no such signature was observed for the other pathogens. These findings demonstrate involvement of (i) NLR genes in resistance against the intracellular pathogen P. brassicae and a putative NLR gene in Rlm9-mediated resistance against the extracellular pathogen L. maculans."
https://openalex.org/W2805511854,"Kidney immune cells play important roles in pathogenesis of many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and transplant rejection. While studying murine kidney T cells, we serendipitously identified a kidney mononuclear phagocytic cell (MPC) subset characterized by intermediate surface expression of CD45 and CD11b. These CD45intCD11bint MPCs were further identified as F4/80+MHCII+CX3CR1+Ly6C- cells, comprising ~17% of total CD45+ cells in normal mouse kidney (P < 0.01) and virtually absent from all other organs examined except the heart. Systemic clodronate treatment had more significant depletive effect on the CD45intCD11bint population (77.3%±5.9%, P = 0.03) than on CD45highCD11b+ population (14.8%±16.6%, P = 0.49). In addition, CD45intCD11bint MPCs had higher phagocytic function in the normal kidney (35.6%±3.3% vs. 24.1%±2.2%, P = 0.04), but lower phagocytic capacity in post-ischemic kidney (54.9%±1.0% vs. 67.8%±1.9%, P < 0.01) compared to the CD45highCD11b+ population. Moreover, the CD45intCD11bint population had higher intracellular production of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (58.4%±5.2% vs. 27.3%±0.9%, P < 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and lower production of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (7.2%±1.3% vs. 14.9%±2.2%, P = 0.02) following kidney IRI, suggesting a functional role under inflammatory conditions. The CD45intCD11bint cells increased early after IRI, and then abruptly decreased 48h later, whereas CD45highCD11b+ cells steadily increased after IRI before declining at 72h (P = 0.03). We also identified the CD45intCD11bint MPC subtype in human kidney. We conclude that CD45intCD11bint F4/80+MHCII+CX3CR1+Ly6C-population represent a unique subset of MPCs found in both mouse and human kidneys. Future studies will further characterize their role in kidney health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2807571782,"This study was designed to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) restriction on the deleterious effects of high fat diets on mineral metabolism. Twenty-four rats were allotted to 3 groups (n = 8 each) that were fed different diets for 7 months. Rats in group 1 were fed normal fat-normal P (0.6%) diet (NF-NP), rats in group 2 were fed high fat- normal P diet (HF-NP) and rats in group 3 were fed high fat-low P (0.2%) diet (HF-LP). Blood, urine and tissues were collected at the end of the experiments. When compared with the control group (NF-NP), rats fed HF diets showed increases in body weight, and in plasma concentrations of triglycerides and leptin, and decreased plasma calcitriol concentrations. In rats fed HF-NP plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was higher (279.6±39.4 pg/ml vs 160.6±25.0 pg/ml, p = 0.018) and renal klotho (ratio klotho/GAPDH) was lower (0.75±0.06 vs 1.06±0.08, p<0.01) than in rats fed NF-NP. Phosphorus restriction did not normalize plasma FGF23 or renal klotho; in fact, rats fed HF-LP, that only ingested an average of 22.9 mg/day of P, had higher FGF23 (214.7±32.4 pg/ml) concentrations than rats fed NF-NP (160.6±25.0 pg/ml), that ingested and average of 74.4 mg/day of P over a 7 month period. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that severe P restriction over a prolonged period of time (7 months) does not normalize the increase in circulating FGF23 induced by HF diets. These data indicate that the deleterious effects of high fat diet on the FGF23/klotho axis are not eliminated by reduced P intake."
https://openalex.org/W2806740274,"We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-μm thick) obtained from a 20-28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate ""synaptic plasticity"" by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2807104305,"The lactose operon repressor protein LacI has long served as a paradigm of the bacterial transcription factors. However, the mechanisms whereby LacI rapidly locates its cognate binding site on the bacterial chromosome are still elusive. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging approaches are well suited for the study of these mechanisms but rely on a functionally compatible fluorescence labeling of LacI. Particularly attractive for protein fluorescence labeling are synthetic fluorophores due to their small size and favorable photophysical characteristics. Synthetic fluorophores are often conjugated to natively occurring cysteine residues using maleimide chemistry. For a site-specific and functionally compatible labeling with maleimide fluorophores, the target protein often needs to be redesigned to remove unwanted native cysteines and to introduce cysteines at locations better suited for fluorophore attachment. Biochemical screens can then be employed to probe for the functional activity of the redesigned protein both before and after dye labeling. Here, we report a mutagenesis-based redesign of LacI to enable a functionally compatible labeling with maleimide fluorophores. To provide an easily accessible labeling site in LacI, we introduced a single cysteine residue at position 28 in the DNA-binding headpiece of LacI and replaced two native cysteines with alanines where derivatization with bulky substituents is known to compromise the protein’s activity. We find that the redesigned LacI retains a robust activity in vitro and in vivo, provided that the third native cysteine at position 281 is retained in LacI. In a total internal reflection microscopy assay, we observed individual Cy3-labeled LacI molecules bound to immobilized DNA harboring the cognate O1 operator sequence, indicating that the dye-labeled LacI is functionally active. We have thus been able to generate a functional fluorescently labeled LacI that can be used to unravel mechanistic details of LacI target search at the single molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2805977491,"This paper presents a formulation for selecting the stage ratios and number of stages in a multistage transmission with a given desired total transmission ratio in a manner that maximizes efficiency, maximizes acceleration, or minimizes the mass of the transmission. The formulation is used to highlight several implications for gear train design, including the fact that minimizing rotational inertia and mass are competing objectives with respect to optimal selection of stage ratios, and that both rotational inertia and mass can often be minimized by increasing the total number of stages beyond a minimum realizable number. Additionally, a multistage transmission will generally provide maximum acceleration when the stage ratios increase monotonically from the motor to the load. The transmission will have minimum mass when the stage ratios decrease monotonically. The transmission will also provide maximum efficiency when the corresponding stages employ constant stage ratios. This paper aims to use this optimization formulation to elucidate tradeoffs between various common objectives in gear train design (efficiency, acceleration, and mass)."
https://openalex.org/W2805424855,"There is increasing evidence for predictive coding theories of psychosis, which state that hallucinations arise from abnormal perceptual priors or biases. However, psychological processes that foster abnormal priors/biases in patients suffering hallucinations have been largely unexplored. The widely recognized relationship between affective disorders and psychosis suggests a role for mood and emotion.Thirty-six patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a representative condition associated with psychosis of neurological origin, and 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were enrolled. After an experimental mood induction, the participants underwent the pareidolia test, in which visual hallucination-like illusions were evoked and measured.In DLB patients, the number of pareidolic illusions was doubled under negative mood compared to that under neutral mood. In AD patients, there was no significant difference in the number of pareidolic responses between negative and neutral mood conditions. A signal detection theory analysis demonstrated that the observed affective modulation of pareidolic illusions was mediated through heightened perceptual bias, not sensory deterioration.The current findings demonstrated that abnormal perceptual priors in psychotic false perception have an affective nature, which we suggest are a type of cognitive feeling that arises in association with perception and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2806889329,"Objective Reliable detection of HIV minority resistant variants (MRVs) requires bioinformatics analysis with specific algorithms to obtain good quality alignments. The aim of this study was to analyze ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) data using different analysis pipelines. Methods HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase sequences from antiretroviral-naïve patients were obtained using GS-Junior® (Roche) and MiSeq® (Illumina) platforms. MRVs were defined as variants harbouring resistance-mutation present at a frequency of 1%–20%. Reads were analyzed using different alignment algorithms: Amplicon Variant Analyzer®, Geneious® compared to SmartGene® NGS HIV-1 module. Results 101 protease and 51 RT MRVs identified in 139 protease and 124 RT sequences generated with a GS-Junior® platform were analyzed using AVA® and SmartGene® software. The correlation coefficients for the MRVs were R2 = 0.974 for protease and R2 = 0.972 for RT. Discordances (n = 13 in protease and n = 15 in RT) mainly concerned low-level MRVs (i.e., with frequencies of 1%–2%, n = 18/28) and they were located in homopolymeric regions (n = 10/15). Geneious® and SmartGene® software were used to analyze 143 protease, 45 RT and 26 integrase MRVs identified in 172 protease, 69 RT, and 72 integrase sequences generated with a MiSeq® platform. The correlation coefficients for the MRVs were R2 = 0.987 for protease, R2 = 0.995 for RT and R2 = 0.993 for integrase. Discordances (n = 9 in protease, n = 3 in RT, and n = 3 in integrase) mainly concerned low-level MRVs (n = 13/15). Conclusion We found an excellent correlation between the various UDS analysis pipelines that we tested. However, our results indicate that specific attention should be paid to low-level MRVs, for which the use of two different analysis pipelines and visual inspection of sequences alignments might be beneficial. Thus, our results argue for use of a 2% threshold for MRV detection, rather than the 1% threshold, to minimize misalignments and time-consuming sight reading steps essential to ensure accurate results for MRV frequencies below 2%."
https://openalex.org/W2806117304,"Background 
Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transport of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) to mucosal surfaces is thought to promote gut integrity and immunity to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), an invasive pathogen in mice. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we assessed intestinal barrier function and both oral and systemic S. Typhimurium virulence in pIgR knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice.


Methods 
In uninfected animals, we harvested jejunal segments for Ussing chamber analyses of transepithelial resistance (TER); mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) for bacterial culture; and serum and stool for IgA. Separately, we infected mice either orally or intravenously (IV) with S. Typhimurium to compare colonization, tissue dynamics, and inflammation between KOs and WTs.


Results 
Uninfected KOs displayed decreased TER and dramatically increased serum IgA and decreased fecal IgA vs. WT; however, KO mLNs yielded fewer bacterial counts. Remarkably, WTs challenged orally with S. Typhimurium exhibited increased splenomegaly, tissue colonization, and pro-inflammatory cytokines vs. pIgR KOs, which showed increased survival following either oral or IV infection.


Conclusions 
Absence of pIgR compromises gut integrity but does not exacerbate bacterial translocation nor S. Typhimurium infection. These findings raise the possibility that immune adaptation to increased gut permeability and elevated serum IgA in the setting of SIgA deficiency provides compensatory protection against invasive gut pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2806199555,"Background & aims Many individuals are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide, and this virus is commonly controlled by treatments with interferon (IFN)-alpha and nucleoside analogues (NA). However, the complete elimination of HBV by these treatments is difficult and, thus, the development of new treatments is needed. Host immune responses are closely involved in the elimination of HBV, suggesting the usefulness of immunotherapy. In the present study, we attempted to identify novel cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes that are useful for immunotherapy against HBV. Methods CTL epitopes were predicted using computer software. Immune responses to each peptide were evaluated by IFN-γ ELISPOT and cytotoxic assays. The relationships between the immune responses to these newly identified CTL epitopes and the clinical backgrounds of patients and administration of NA were analyzed. Peptides were administered to mice as vaccines and peptide-specific T-cell induction was measured in vivo. Results Positive reactions to 10 synthesized peptides were detected in 3 or more patients using the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against 2 of these peptides was observed in the cytotoxic assay. Some peptides that correlated with serum ALT, HBsAg, and HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) levels were identified. Immune reactions against some peptides were enhanced by the administration of NA. Regarding their effects as a vaccine, peptide-specific T-cells were induced by four peptides in vivo. Conclusions Novel HBV epitopes that correlated with HBsAg and HBcrAg levels were identified. These newly identified epitopes may be useful in the analysis of immune responses to HBV and development of immunotherapy against HBV."

This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p<0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding Coxiella burnetii (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p<0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to Coxiella burnetii to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to C. burnetii and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2805601365,"Bacillus subtilis, as a model spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium, has been extensively used for spore germination research. Within this field, nutrient-dependent germination with specific germinant receptors (GerA, responding to L-alanine or L-valine; GerB and GerK, acting together to start spore germination process in response to AGFK) has been the most studied. There are three different variants of the GerAA subunit (299T/302S, 299A/302P, 299A/302S) of the GerA germination receptor present in B. subtilis subs. subtilis laboratory strains. According to our research, the 299A/302P one, unlike the others, interferes with the spore's ability to germinate in L-alanine as assessed by the measurement of DPA release upon stimulation with the germinant. Multiple genetic manipulations described in this work followed by spore germination tests, together with secondary structure predictions led us to the following conclusions. First, position 302 of GerAA protein is crucial in terms of GerA germination receptor functionality; a proline residue at this position renders the GerA receptor non-functional, most probably due to a change in the protein secondary structure. Second, the 302P GerAA variant has most probably an impaired affinity to other components of GerA receptor. Together, these may explain the loss of GerA receptor's function. Analysis of the GerAA protein should get us closer to understanding the mechanism of GerA receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2806590137,"Successful breast conserving cancer surgeries come along with tumor free resection margins and account for cosmetic outcome. Positive margins increase the likelihood of tumor recurrence. Intra-operative fluorescence molecular imaging (IFMI) aims to focus surgery on malignant tissue thus substantially lowering the presence of positive margins as compared with standard techniques of breast conservation (ST). A goal of this paper is to assess the incremental number of surgeries and costs of IFMI vs. ST.We developed a decision analytical model and applied it for an early evaluation approach. Given uncertainty we considered that IFMI might reduce the proportion of positive margins found by ST from all to none and this proportion is assumed to be reduced to 10% for the base case. Inputs included data from the literature and a range of effect estimates. For the costs of IFMI, respective cost components were added to those of ST.The base case reduction lowered number of surgeries (mean [95% confidence interval]) by 0.22 [0.15; 0.30] and changed costs (mean [95% confidence interval]) by €-663 [€-1,584; €50]. A tornado diagram identified the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) costs, the proportion of positive margins of ST, the staff time saving factor and the duration of frozen section analysis (FSA) as important determinants of this cost.These early results indicate that IFMI may be more effective than ST and through the reduction of positive margins it is possible to save follow-up surgeries-indicating further health risk-and to save costs through this margin reduction and the avoidance of FSA."
https://openalex.org/W2807310240,"In Bos taurus the universality of the reference genome is biased towards genetic variation represented by only two related individuals representing the same Hereford breed. Therefore, results of genetic analyses based on this reference may not be reliable. The 1000 Bull Genomes resource allows for identification of breed-specific polymorphisms and for the construction of breed-specific reference genomes. Whole-genome sequences or 936 bulls allowed us to construct seven breed specific reference genomes of Bos taurus for Angus, Brown Swiss, Fleckvieh, Hereford, Jersey, Limousin and Simmental. In order to identify breed-specific variants all detected SNPs were filtered within-breed to satisfy criteria of the number of missing genotypes not higher than 7% and the alternative allele frequency equal to unity. The highest number of breed-specific SNPs was identified for Jersey (130,070) and the lowest-for the Simmental breed (197). Such breed-specific polymorphisms were annotated to coding regions overlapping with 78 genes in Angus, 140 in Brown Swiss, 132 in Fleckvieh, 100 in Hereford, 643 in Jersey, 10 in Limousin and no genes in Simmental. For most of the breeds, the majority of breed-specific variants from coding regions was synonymous. However, most of Fleckvieh-specific and Hereford-specific polymorphisms were missense mutations. Since the identified variants are characteristic for the analysed breeds, they form the basis of phenotypic differences observed between them, which result from different breeding programmes. Breed-specific reference genomes can enhance the accuracy of SNP driven inferences such as Genome-wide Association Studies or SNP genotype imputation."
https://openalex.org/W2805527642,"The query-template alignment of proteins is one of the most critical steps of template-based modeling methods used to predict the 3D structure of a query protein. This alignment can be interpreted as a temporal classification or structured prediction task and first order Conditional Random Fields have been proposed for protein alignment and proven to be rather successful. Some other popular structured prediction problems, such as speech or image classification, have gained from the use of higher order Conditional Random Fields due to the well known higher order correlations that exist between their labels and features. In this paper, we propose and describe the use of higher order Conditional Random Fields for query-template protein alignment. The experiments carried out on different public datasets validate our proposal, especially on distantly-related protein pairs which are the most difficult to align."
https://openalex.org/W2807641429,"It has been observed that the number of phonemes in languages in use today tends to decrease with increasing distance from Africa. A previous formal model has recently reproduced the observed cline, but under two strong assumptions. Here we tackle the question of whether an alternative explanation for the worldwide phonemic cline is possible, by using alternative assumptions. The answer is affirmative. We show this by formalizing a proposal, following Atkinson, that this pattern may be due to a repeated bottleneck effect and phonemic loss. In our simulations, low-density populations lose phonemes during the Out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans. Our results reproduce the observed global cline for the number of phonemes. In addition, we also detect a cline of phonemic diversity and reproduce it using our simulation model. We suggest how future work could determine whether the previous model or the new one (or even a combination of them) is valid. Simulations also show that the clines can still be present even 300 kyr after the Out-of-Africa dispersal, which is contrary to some previous claims which were not supported by numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2806186573,"Herbivores can modify the rate of shrub and treeline advance. Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests."
https://openalex.org/W2807513961,"To study sodium homeostasis, we performed a genome-wide screen for deletion strains that show resistance to NaCl. We identified 34 NaCl-resistant strains. Among them, the largest group that consists of 10 genes related to membrane trafficking and 7 out of 10 genes are ESCRT proteins which are involved in cargo transportation into luminal vesicles within the multivesicular body. All of the ESCRT related mutants which showed sodium resistance also showed defects in vacuole fusion. To further understand the role of the ESCRT pathway in various ion homeostasis, we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various cation salts other than NaCl, including KCl, LiCl, CaCl2, CoCl2, MgCl2, NiSO4 and MnCl2. While these ESCRT mutants showed resistance to LiCl, CoCl2 and MgCl2, they showed sensitivity to KCl, CaCl2, NiSO4 and MnCl2. Then we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various drugs which are known to inhibit the growth of fission yeast cells. While these ESCRT mutants were more or equally sensitive to most of the drugs tested as compared to the wild-type cells, they showed resistance to some drugs such as tamoxifen, fluorouracil and amiodarone. These results suggest that the ESCRT pathway plays important roles in drug/ion resistance of fission yeast."
