https://openalex.org/W2132484323,"The mechanisms underpinning soil carbon stability are complicated. The future response of soil carbon to climate change is uncertain but crucial, given that the carbon pool in soils is three times greater than that of the atmosphere. In a Perspective, Michael Schmidt and an international team of collaborators discuss how our understanding of soil carbon cycling has been changing. Rather than being mostly a function of molecular structure, as has been assumed, soil organic carbon stability is an ecosystem property. This means that it arises from complex interactions among many biotic and abiotic factors that are not fully understood. This fact must be more rigorously addressed in a new generation of experiments and soil carbon models, say Schmidt et al., if we are to improve our attempts to understand this vital component of the Earth system. Globally, soil organic matter (SOM) contains more than three times as much carbon as either the atmosphere or terrestrial vegetation. Yet it remains largely unknown why some SOM persists for millennia whereas other SOM decomposes readily—and this limits our ability to predict how soils will respond to climate change. Recent analytical and experimental advances have demonstrated that molecular structure alone does not control SOM stability: in fact, environmental and biological controls predominate. Here we propose ways to include this understanding in a new generation of experiments and soil carbon models, thereby improving predictions of the SOM response to global warming."

On the one hand, a classical oscillator has a well-defined amplitude of motion; a quantum oscillator, on the other hand, has a lowest-energy state, or ground state, with a finite-amplitude uncertainty corresponding to zero-point motion. On the macroscopic scale of our everyday experience, owing to interactions with its highly fluctuating thermal environment a mechanical oscillator is filled with many energy quanta and its quantum nature is all but hidden. Recently, in experiments performed at temperatures of a few hundredths of a kelvin, engineered nanomechanical resonators coupled to electrical circuits have been measured to be oscillating in their quantum ground state. These experiments, in addition to providing a glimpse into the underlying quantum behaviour of mesoscopic systems consisting of billions of atoms, represent the initial steps towards the use of mechanical devices as tools for quantum metrology or as a means of coupling hybrid quantum systems. Here we report the development of a coupled, nanoscale optical and mechanical resonator formed in a silicon microchip, in which radiation pressure from a laser is used to cool the mechanical motion down to its quantum ground state (reaching an average phonon occupancy number of 0.85 ± 0.08). This cooling is realized at an environmental temperature of 20 K, roughly one thousand times larger than in previous experiments and paves the way for optical control of mesoscale mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime."
https://openalex.org/W1998142996,"Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) by environmental xenobiotic toxic chemicals, for instance 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin), has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as embryogenesis, transformation, tumorigenesis and inflammation. But the identity of an endogenous ligand activating the AHR under physiological conditions in the absence of environmental toxic chemicals is still unknown. Here we identify the tryptophan (Trp) catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) as an endogenous ligand of the human AHR that is constitutively generated by human tumour cells via tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), a liver- and neuron-derived Trp-degrading enzyme not yet implicated in cancer biology. TDO-derived Kyn suppresses antitumour immune responses and promotes tumour-cell survival and motility through the AHR in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. The TDO–AHR pathway is active in human brain tumours and is associated with malignant progression and poor survival. Because Kyn is produced during cancer progression and inflammation in the local microenvironment in amounts sufficient for activating the human AHR, these results provide evidence for a previously unidentified pathophysiological function of the AHR with profound implications for cancer and immune biology. The tryptophan catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) and tryptophan degradation by indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenases have previously been implicated in suppressing an antitumour immune response. Michael Platten and colleagues now identify tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) as the enzyme expressed in gliomas and other cancers that converts tryptophan to Kyn. Kyn is an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), acting directly on glioma cells to promote tumorigenesis. TDO expression in cancer cells also suppresses an AHR-mediated immune response. In human glioblastomas, the expression of TDO and AHR-regulated genes are associated with more advanced stages and poorer clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2094523515,"Graphene is a new material showing high promise in optoelectronics, photonics, and energy-harvesting applications. However, the underlying physical mechanism of optoelectronic response has not been established. Here, we report on the intrinsic optoelectronic response of high-quality dual-gated monolayer and bilayer graphene p-n junction devices. Local laser excitation at the p-n interface leads to striking six-fold photovoltage patterns as a function of bottom- and top-gate voltages. These patterns, together with the measured spatial and density dependence of the photoresponse, provide strong evidence that non-local hot-carrier transport, rather than the photovoltaic effect, dominates the intrinsic photoresponse in graphene. This novel regime, which features a long-lived and spatially distributed hot carrier population, may open the doorway for optoelectronic technologies exploiting efficient energy transport at the nanoscale."

https://openalex.org/W2000725203,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease and the leading genetic cause of infant mortality; it results from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped, but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient. Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection. Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2037567991,"Brain-machine interfaces use neuronal activity recorded from the brain to establish direct communication with external actuators, such as prosthetic arms. It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W2062097745,"Oxidative stress and enhanced lipid peroxidation are linked to many chronic inflammatory diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in Western societies, but its aetiology remains largely unknown. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a common lipid peroxidation product that accumulates in many pathophysiological processes, including AMD. Here we identify complement factor H (CFH) as a major MDA-binding protein that can block both the uptake of MDA-modified proteins by macrophages and MDA-induced proinflammatory effects in vivo in mice. The CFH polymorphism H402, which is strongly associated with AMD, markedly reduces the ability of CFH to bind MDA, indicating a causal link to disease aetiology. Our findings provide important mechanistic insights into innate immune responses to oxidative stress, which may be exploited in the prevention of and therapy for AMD and other chronic inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1982655352,"High cholesterol levels greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. About 50 per cent of cholesterol is eliminated from the body by its conversion into bile acids. However, bile acids released from the bile duct are constantly recycled, being reabsorbed in the intestine by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, also known as SLC10A2). It has been shown in animal models that plasma cholesterol levels are considerably lowered by specific inhibitors of ASBT, and ASBT is thus a target for hypercholesterolaemia drugs. Here we report the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of ASBT from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) at 2.2 Å. ASBT(NM) contains two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices. A core domain of six helices harbours two sodium ions, and the remaining four helices pack in a row to form a flat, 'panel'-like domain. Overall, the architecture of the protein is remarkably similar to the sodium/proton antiporter NhaA, despite having no detectable sequence homology. The ASBT(NM) structure was captured with the substrate taurocholate present, bound between the core and panel domains in a large, inward-facing, hydrophobic cavity. Residues near this cavity have been shown to affect the binding of specific inhibitors of human ASBT. The position of the taurocholate molecule, together with the molecular architecture, suggests the rudiments of a possible transport mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1984449009,"It is commonly believed that race is perceived through another's facial features, such as skin color. In the present research, we demonstrate that cues to social status that often surround a face systematically change the perception of its race. Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along White-Black morph continua and that were presented with high-status or low-status attire. Low-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1). When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants' hand movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue) before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception. Together, the findings show how stereotypes interact with physical cues to shape person categorization, and suggest that social and contextual factors guide the perception of race."
https://openalex.org/W2139584915,"Pathological fasting hypoglycemia in humans is usually explained by excessive circulating insulin or insulin-like molecules or by inborn errors of metabolism impairing liver glucose production. We studied three unrelated children with unexplained, recurrent, and severe fasting hypoglycemia and asymmetrical growth. All were found to carry the same de novo mutation, p.Glu17Lys, in the serine/threonine kinase AKT2, in two cases as heterozygotes and in one case in mosaic form. In heterologous cells, the mutant AKT2 was constitutively recruited to the plasma membrane, leading to insulin-independent activation of downstream signaling. Thus, systemic metabolic disease can result from constitutive, cell-autonomous activation of signaling pathways normally controlled by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2043603340,"Fukuyama muscular dystrophy is caused by the insertion of a mobile genetic element, the SVA retrotransposon, into the non-coding region of the fukutin gene. Tatsushi Toda and colleagues show that this insertion truncates the fukutin transcript as a result of an abnormal splicing event, a situation known as pathogenic exon trapping. Fukutin function is restored by treatment of dystrophy mouse model cells or human patient cells with antisense oligonucleotides that prevent the abnormal splicing. The results have implications for other diseases that show SVA exon trapping. Fukuyama muscular dystrophy (FCMD; MIM253800), one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in Japan, was the first human disease found to result from ancestral insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon into a causative gene1,2,3. In FCMD, the SVA insertion occurs in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the fukutin gene. The pathogenic mechanism for FCMD is unknown, and no effective clinical treatments exist. Here we show that aberrant messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, induced by SVA exon-trapping, underlies the molecular pathogenesis of FCMD. Quantitative mRNA analysis pinpointed a region that was missing from transcripts in patients with FCMD. This region spans part of the 3′ end of the fukutin coding region, a proximal part of the 3′ UTR and the SVA insertion. Correspondingly, fukutin mRNA transcripts in patients with FCMD and SVA knock-in model mice were shorter than the expected length. Sequence analysis revealed an abnormal splicing event, provoked by a strong acceptor site in SVA and a rare alternative donor site in fukutin exon 10. The resulting product truncates the fukutin carboxy (C) terminus and adds 129 amino acids encoded by the SVA. Introduction of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the splice acceptor, the predicted exonic splicing enhancer and the intronic splicing enhancer prevented pathogenic exon-trapping by SVA in cells of patients with FCMD and model mice, rescuing normal fukutin mRNA expression and protein production. AON treatment also restored fukutin functions, including O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) and laminin binding by α-DG. Moreover, we observe exon-trapping in other SVA insertions associated with disease (hypercholesterolemia4, neutral lipid storage disease5) and human-specific SVA insertion in a novel gene. Thus, although splicing into SVA is known6,7,8, we have discovered in human disease a role for SVA-mediated exon-trapping and demonstrated the promise of splicing modulation therapy as the first radical clinical treatment for FCMD and other SVA-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024333151,"Turbulence is a well-studied phenomenon in disciplines ranging from meteorology to cardiology, but astrophysical turbulence — acting over physical scales spanning 1015 orders of magnitude — stretches current theories to their limits. Until now, insight into interstellar turbulence has been limited by our inability to image the small-scale structure associated with turbulent motions. This paper presents the first direct images of turbulence in interstellar gas. Using radio-continuum images of a patch of the Galactic plane, observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, Gaensler et al. report that the gradient of the Stokes vector (Q,U) provides an image of magnetized turbulence in diffuse ionized gas, seen as a complex filamentary web of discontinuities in gas density and magnetic field. The turbulence in the warm ionized medium has a relatively low sonic Mach number of approximately Mach 2. The interstellar medium of the Milky Way is multiphase1, magnetized2 and turbulent3. Turbulence in the interstellar medium produces a global cascade of random gas motions, spanning scales ranging from 100 parsecs to 1,000 kilometres (ref. 4). Fundamental parameters of interstellar turbulence such as the sonic Mach number (the speed of sound) have been difficult to determine, because observations have lacked the sensitivity and resolution to image the small-scale structure associated with turbulent motion5,6,7. Observations of linear polarization and Faraday rotation in radio emission from the Milky Way have identified unusual polarized structures that often have no counterparts in the total radiation intensity or at other wavelengths8,9,10,11,12, and whose physical significance has been unclear13,14,15. Here we report that the gradient of the Stokes vector (Q, U), where Q and U are parameters describing the polarization state of radiation, provides an image of magnetized turbulence in diffuse, ionized gas, manifested as a complex filamentary web of discontinuities in gas density and magnetic field. Through comparison with simulations, we demonstrate that turbulence in the warm, ionized medium has a relatively low sonic Mach number, Ms ≲ 2. The development of statistical tools for the analysis of polarization gradients will allow accurate determinations of the Mach number, Reynolds number and magnetic field strength in interstellar turbulence over a wide range of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976987687,"Left ventricular mass (LVM) is a highly heritable trait and an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. So far, genome-wide association studies have not identified the genetic factors that underlie LVM variation, and the regulatory mechanisms for blood-pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy remain poorly understood. Unbiased systems genetics approaches in the rat now provide a powerful complementary tool to genome-wide association studies, and we applied integrative genomics to dissect a highly replicated, blood-pressure-independent LVM locus on rat chromosome 3p. Here we identified endonuclease G (Endog), which previously was implicated in apoptosis but not hypertrophy, as the gene at the locus, and we found a loss-of-function mutation in Endog that is associated with increased LVM and impaired cardiac function. Inhibition of Endog in cultured cardiomyocytes resulted in an increase in cell size and hypertrophic biomarkers in the absence of pro-hypertrophic stimulation. Genome-wide network analysis unexpectedly implicated ENDOG in fundamental mitochondrial processes that are unrelated to apoptosis. We showed direct regulation of ENDOG by ERR-α and PGC1α (which are master regulators of mitochondrial and cardiac function), interaction of ENDOG with the mitochondrial genome and ENDOG-mediated regulation of mitochondrial mass. At baseline, the Endog-deleted mouse heart had depleted mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which were associated with enlarged and steatotic cardiomyocytes. Our study has further established the link between mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and heart disease and has uncovered a role for Endog in maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy."

https://openalex.org/W2045030736,"To understand and eventually predict the effects of changing redox conditions and oxidant levels on the physiology of an organism, it is essential to gain knowledge about its redoxome: the proteins whose activities are controlled by the oxidation status of their cysteine thiols. Here, we applied the quantitative redox proteomic method OxICAT to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determined the in vivo thiol oxidation status of almost 300 different yeast proteins distributed among various cellular compartments. We found that a substantial number of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins are partially oxidized during exponential growth. Our results suggest that prevailing redox conditions constantly control central cellular pathways by fine-tuning oxidation status and hence activity of these proteins. Treatment with sublethal H(2)O(2) concentrations caused a subset of 41 proteins to undergo substantial thiol modifications, thereby affecting a variety of different cellular pathways, many of which are directly or indirectly involved in increasing oxidative stress resistance. Classification of the identified protein thiols according to their steady-state oxidation levels and sensitivity to peroxide treatment revealed that redox sensitivity of protein thiols does not predict peroxide sensitivity. Our studies provide experimental evidence that the ability of protein thiols to react to changing peroxide levels is likely governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, making predicting thiol modifications challenging and de novo identification of peroxide sensitive protein thiols indispensable."
https://openalex.org/W2152390135,"The EGF receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in the development and progression of many tumors. Although monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR have been approved for the treatment of cancer in combination with chemotherapy, there are limitations in their clinical efficacy, necessitating the search for robust targeting molecules that can be equipped with new effector functions or show a new mechanism of action. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) may provide the targeting component for such novel reagents. Previously, four DARPins were selected against EGFR with (sub)nanomolar affinity. As any targeting module should preferably be able to inhibit EGFR-mediated signaling, their effect on A431 cells overexpressing EGFR was examined: three of them were shown to inhibit proliferation by inducing G1 arrest, as seen for the Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody cetuximab. To understand this inhibitory mechanism, we mapped the epitopes of the DARPins using yeast surface display. The epitopes for the biologically active DARPins overlapped with the EGF-binding site, whereas the fourth DARPin bound to a different domain, explaining the lack of a biological effect. To optimize the biological activity of the DARPins, we combined two DARPins binding to different epitopes with a flexible linker or with a leucine zipper, leading to a homodimer. The latter DARPin was able to reduce surface EGFR by inhibiting receptor recycling, leading to a dramatic decrease in cell viability. These results indicate that multispecific EGFR-specific DARPins are superior to cetuximab and may form the basis of new opportunities in tumor targeting and tumor therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2051124098,"Protein kinase B (Akt) plays important roles in regulation of cell growth and survival, but while many aspects of its mechanism of action are known, there are potentially additional regulatory events that remain to be discovered. Here we detected a 36-kDa protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with protein kinase Bβ (Akt2) in OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. The protein was identified to be glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, and the interaction of Akt2 and GAPDH was verified by reverse immunoprecipitation. Our further study showed that Akt2 may suppress GAPDH-mediated apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of GAPDH increased ovarian cancer cell apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2), which was inhibited by Akt2 overexpression and restored by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin or Akt2 siRNA. Akt2 phosphorylated Thr-237 of GAPDH and decreased its nuclear translocation, an essential step for GAPDH-mediated apoptosis. The interaction between Akt2 and GAPDH may be important in ovarian cancer as immunohistochemical analysis of 10 normal and 30 cancerous ovarian tissues revealed that decreased nuclear expression of GAPDH correlated with activation (phosphorylation) of Akt2. In conclusion, our study suggests that activated Akt2 may increase ovarian cancer cell survival via inhibition of GAPDH-induced apoptosis. This effect of Akt2 is partly mediated by its phosphorylation of GAPDH at Thr-237, which results in the inhibition of GAPDH nuclear translocation."

First, it acts as a soluble receptor recognizing these proteins in the cytosol. Subsequently, at the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery, PEX5 promotes their translocation across the organelle membrane.

Two important ones regard the formation and disruption of the PEX5-cargo protein interaction in the cytosol and at the docking/translocation machinery, respectively. Here, we provide data on the interaction of PEX5 with catalase, a homotetrameric enzyme in its native state. We found that PEX5 interacts with monomeric catalase yielding a stable protein complex; no such complex was detected with tetrameric catalase.

By a still ill-defined process, this interaction ultimately leads to the insertion of PEX5 into the DTM with the concomitant translocation of the cargo protein into the peroxisomal matrix (11Alencastre I.S.

Interestingly, in vitro import experiments suggest that ATP hydrolysis is not needed at any of these steps, suggesting that the complete transport of a cargo protein from the cytosol into the peroxisomal matrix is driven by thermodynamically favored protein-protein interactions at the DTM (14Miyata N.

Despite all the advances made in recent years, there are still many aspects of this protein import pathway that remain unclear. A particularly important one regards the quaternary structure of the PEX5-cargo protein complex formed in the cytosol. In principle, a protein complex comprising a single PEX5 molecule and a cargo protein should be sufficient to ensure the correct targeting of that protein to the peroxisomal matrix. This is probably the case for all peroxisomal monomeric proteins (e.g. the sterol carrier protein 2 (23Shiozawa K. Konarev P.V. Neufeld C. Wilmanns M. Svergun D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25334-25342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), for some oligomeric enzymes in which the peroxisomal targeting signals become hidden upon oligomerization (24Faber K.N. van Dijk R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), together with the fact that several peroxisomal oligomeric proteins may expose multiple PTS1 sequences at their surface, could suggest that these cargo proteins are transported to the organelle by more than one PEX5 molecule. Such a scenario was in fact the central premise of one hypothetical model proposed a few years ago aimed at describing the process of protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane (35Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand how these proteins are sorted to the peroxisome, we started to characterize the interaction of their monomeric and oligomeric versions with PEX5. Here, we describe the results obtained with catalase, one of the most abundant peroxisomal matrix proteins and probably one of the most frequent clients of the DTM (36Ghosh D. Berg J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3973-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Leighton F. Coloma L. Koenig C. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Poole B.

Catalase is a heme-containing homo-tetrameric protein in its native state (four subunits of 60 kDa), with each subunit possessing a noncanonical PTS1 at its C terminus (KANL) (39Maté M.J. Zamocky M.

We selected catalase for this initial study because there are data suggesting that both its monomeric and tetrameric versions are substrates for the peroxisomal protein import machinery (27Tanaka N.

However, whether the peroxisomal import machinery, PEX5 in particular, displays any preference for monomeric or tetrameric catalase was unknown. Here, we show that mammalian PEX5 binds monomeric catalase (hereafter referred to as mCat) in a much stronger manner than it binds tetrameric catalase (tCat). Actually, we were unable to detect stable PEX5-tCat complexes. Importantly, PEX5 binding to mCat blocks its tetramerization with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. The interaction of PEX5 with mCat was found to involve the PTS1-binding C-terminal half of PEX5 as well as a domain(s) present in its N-terminal half. Finally, we provide data suggesting that the PEX5-mCat interaction is disrupted by the N-terminal domain of PEX14, a central component of the DTM. The implications of these findings on the mechanism of protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane are discussed. The recombinant large isoform of human PEX5 (50Braverman N. Dodt G.

The following truncated versions of human PEX5 were also produced: PEX5ΔN110 (amino acid residues 111–639 of PEX5), PEX5ΔN147 (amino acid residues 148–639 of PEX5), PEX5ΔN196 (amino acid residues 197–639 of PEX5), PEX5ΔN267 (amino acid residues 268–639 of PEX5), and PEX5ΔN290 (amino acid residues 291–639 of PEX5). The cDNAs encoding these proteins were obtained by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1 and the pQE30-PEX5 construct as template. The amplified DNA fragments were then digested with NdeI and SalI and cloned into the NdeI/SalI digested pET-28c vector (Novagene). The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to replace tryptophan and phenylalanine/tyrosine residues in diaromatic motifs of PEX5 by alanines (see primers in supplemental Table 1). The three proteins obtained in this way are as follows: PEX5ΔN267-M7 and PEX5-M7, proteins with a mutated 7th diaromatic motif, and PEX5-M6,7, a protein possessing both the 6th and 7th diaromatic mutated. All plasmids were sequence-verified. The cDNA encoding mouse PEX5 was amplified from a commercially available clone (clone MMM1013-7510385, Open Biosystems) using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1, digested with NdeI and SalI, and cloned into the NdeI/SalI digested pET-28c vector. Purification of all PEX5 proteins was done as described previously (54Costa-Rodrigues J. Carvalho A.F. Fransen M. Hambruch E. Schliebs W. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

The cDNA encoding full-length human catalase (clone IMAGE ID 5551309, Open Biosystems) was amplified by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1. This DNA was digested with XbaI and KpnI and cloned into the XbaI/KpnI-digested pGEM-4 vector (Promega), originating pGEM-4-Cat. This plasmid was used as template to produce two other plasmids, one encoding a catalase lacking its four last C-terminal amino acid residues (CatΔKANL) and the other encoding a catalase in which these four residues were replaced by ED (CatED). These plasmids were obtained using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primer pairs described in supplemental Table 1. 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized using the TnT® T7 QuickCoupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S] methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the standard conditions of the manufacturer. Unless otherwise indicated, protein synthesis was allowed to proceed for 55 min and was then blocked with 0.5 mm of cycloheximide (final concentration). Chase incubations were done at 30 °C for the specified periods of time. Chase reactions performed in the presence of recombinant proteins typically contained 6 μl of the translation mixture in a final volume of 10 μl. Proteins were incubated in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT for 5 min at room temperature. After addition of 1 μl of 0.17% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50% (w/v) sucrose, the samples were loaded into Tris nondenaturating discontinuous 8% polyacrylamide gels (56Sullivan D.T. Carroll W.T.

The gels were run at 250 V at 4 °C for 1 h (unless indicated otherwise), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, stained with Ponceau S, and exposed to an x-ray film. 35S-Labeled proteins (50 μl of in vitro transcription/translation reactions) or mixtures containing recombinant proteins and 35S-labeled proteins were diluted to 250 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, 1 mm DTT and injected into a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare; loop volume 200 μl) running with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with the following globular proteins: ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Fractions of 500 μl were collected and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and one-third of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, stained with Ponceau S, and exposed to an x-ray film. Soluble mouse liver peroxisomal matrix proteins were obtained by sonicating purified peroxisomes (prepared as in Ref. 57Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E.

Two hundred micrograms of soluble proteins, supplemented or not with 300 μg of recombinant mouse PEX5, were injected into the size-exclusion column, as above. Aliquots of 25 μl from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with antibodies directed to catalase (catalog number RDI-CATALASEabr; Research Diagnostics, Inc) and L-bifunctional protein (58Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of PEX5 in rat liver cytosol (0.75 μm) was calculated from the following data: total amount of PEX5 in liver, 4 ng/μg of total peroxisomal protein; percentage of PEX5 in cytosol, 85% (59Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); peroxisomes, 2.5% (w/w) of total liver protein; protein content of liver, 260 mg/g (60Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); 1 g of liver corresponds to 0.94 ml of which 44.4% is cytosol (61Weibel E.R. Stäubli W. Gnägi H.R. Hess F.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The weighted average molecular mass of monomeric rat liver peroxisomal proteins was estimated from the densitometric analysis of a Coomassie-stained SDS gel loaded with a highly pure peroxisomal preparation (57Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Peak areas were divided by the corresponding apparent molecular masses and expressed as percentage of total moles. The weighted average of these values is 49 kDa. For newly synthesized peroxisomal proteins, this value may be slightly underestimated because protein maturation processes that occur in the matrix of the organelle (e.g. the cleavage of the 75-kDa acyl-CoA oxidase into the 53- and 22-kDa subunits (62Miyazawa S. Hayashi H. Hijikata M. Ishii N. Furuta S. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8131-8137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were not taken into account. Mole percentage for catalase (13 mol %) was calculated considering the mass percentage of the protein in rat liver peroxisomes, 15% (63Leighton F. Poole B. Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the weighted average molecular mass of rat liver peroxisomal proteins (49 kDa), the theoretical molecular mass of catalase (60 kDa), and the mass percentage of matrix proteins in total rat liver peroxisomes, 92% (57Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The amount of total peroxisomal matrix proteins in nanomoles/g of rat liver was calculated from the above referred data. A value of 122 nmol/g of liver was obtained. Because “all the major protein components of the peroxisome have the same rate of turnover” (half-life of 1.3–1.5 days (37Leighton F. Coloma L. Koenig C. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Poole B. Leighton F. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)), one can estimate the rate of total peroxisomal matrix protein synthesis (k) as 30 pmol/min/g of liver. The rate of synthesis for a particular protein is k times its mole fraction in the peroxisomal matrix. For catalase (0.13 mol fraction), this corresponds to 3.9 pmol/min/g of liver, a value similar to the one reported previously (3.87 pmol/min/g of liver (63Leighton F. Poole B. Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). The steady-state concentration of newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol ([P]cyt) can be estimated by the following expression: [P]cyt = k × 1.443 × t½, where [P]cyt is in pmol/g of liver; k is the rate of total peroxisomal matrix protein synthesis in pmol/min/g of liver, and t½ is the cytosolic half-life of the protein in min (47Lazarow P.B. de Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). According to Lazarow and co-workers (46Lazarow P.B. de Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 64Lazarow P.B. Robbi M. Fujiki Y. Wong L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), several peroxisomal proteins display cytosolic half-lives of about 7 min (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 64Lazarow P.B. Robbi M. Fujiki Y. Wong L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two outliers were noted by those authors as follows: one was catalase, a protein presenting a cytosolic half-life of 14 min; the other was urate oxidase, a protein that after 4 min of chase was already completely found in peroxisomes, an observation suggesting that its cytosolic half-life is 2 min or less. We assume that all peroxisomal matrix proteins present a similar kinetic behavior, i.e. that on average their cytosolic half-lives are 7–8 min. The total concentration of newly synthesized peroxisomal proteins in the cytosol is thus 0.73–0.83 μm, with mCat contributing with 0.19 μm. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro transcription/translation system has been one of the most powerful tools for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying protein sorting pathways. We reasoned that this system might also be of use to study the first step of the catalase peroxisomal import pathway, namely when and how catalase interacts with cytosolic PEX5.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease and characterized by dysregulation of lymphocyte function, transcription factor and cytokine expression, and antigen presentation. Reduced IL-2 expression is a hallmark of SLE T lymphocytes and results in decreased numbers of regulatory T lymphocytes which play an important role in preventing autoimmunity. Reduced IL-2 expression was linked to overproduction of the transcription regulatory factor cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM)α in SLE T lymphocytes and subsequent CREMα binding to a CRE site within the IL2 promoter (-180 CRE). In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of CREMα-mediated IL2 silencing in T lymphocytes from SLE patients through a gene-wide histone deacetylase 1-directed deacetylation of histone H3K18 and DNA methyltransferase 3a-directed cytosine phosphate guanosine (CpG)-DNA hypermethylation. For the first time, we provide direct evidence that CREMα mediates silencing of the IL2 gene in SLE T cells though histone deacetylation and CpG-DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2020603912,"N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a ubiquitous cellular protein that is up-regulated under a multitude of stress and growth-regulatory conditions. Although the exact cellular functions of this protein have not been elucidated, mutations in this gene or aberrant expression of this protein have been linked to both tumor suppressive and oncogenic phenotypes. Previous reports have demonstrated that NDRG1 is strongly up-regulated by chemical iron chelators and hypoxia, yet its regulation by the free radical nitric oxide ((•)NO) has never been demonstrated. Herein, we examine the chemical biology that confers NDRG1 responsiveness at the mRNA and protein levels to (•)NO. We demonstrate that the interaction of (•)NO with the chelatable iron pool (CIP) and the appearance of dinitrosyliron complexes (DNIC) are key determinants. Using HCC 1806 triple negative breast cancer cells, we find that NDRG1 is up-regulated by physiological (•)NO concentrations in a dose- and time-dependant manner. Tumor cell migration was suppressed by NDRG1 expression and we excluded the involvement of HIF-1α, sGC, N-Myc, and c-Myc as upstream regulatory targets of (•)NO. Augmenting the chelatable iron pool abolished (•)NO-mediated NDRG1 expression and the associated phenotypic effects. These data, in summary, reveal a link between (•)NO, chelatable iron, and regulation of NDRG1 expression and signaling in tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2054781174,"Cyclotides are heat-stable macrocyclic peptides from plants that display a wide range of biological activities. They can be divided into two subfamilies: Möbius or bracelet, based on the presence or absence of a cis-proline residue in loop 5, respectively. Currently, over 150 cyclotides have been discovered, but only four linear variants of the Möbius subfamily have been hitherto isolated. In this study, we report the discovery of two novel cyclotides, hedyotide B1 and hedyotide B2, from the aerial parts of Hedyotis biflora. Hedyotide B1 has a cyclic cystine knot structure typical of cyclotides. Interestingly, hedyotide B2 possesses a linear backbone and is the first linear representative of the bracelet subfamily. Disulfide mapping of hedyotide B2 by a top-down MS/MS approach showed that it shares the same knotted disulfide arrangement as conventional cyclotides. Its unfolding pathway also showed that the penetrating disulfide bond Cys III-VI is the most stable disulfide linkage. Cloning of the gene encoding hedyotide B2 revealed a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at the conserved Asn residue position, which is essential for an end-to-end backbone ligation. Biophysical characterization showed that hedyotide B2 was more susceptible to exopeptidase degradation as compared with hedyotide B1. Hedyotide B2 was also inactive against all four tested bacterial strains, whereas hedyotide B1 was bactericidal to Escherichia coli and Streptococcus salivarius at low micromolar concentration. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the structures, functions, and biosynthetic processing of cyclotides and uncyclotides in plants."

Here we describe the consequences of single amino acid mutations, including those implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes, at the DNMT3A·DNMT3A homotetramer and DNMT3A·DNMT3L heterotetramer interfaces. A model for the DNMT3A homotetramer was developed via computational interface scanning and tested using light scattering and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Distinct oligomeric states were functionally characterized using fluorescence anisotropy and steady-state kinetics. Replacement of residues that result in DNMT3A dimers, including those identified in AML patients, show minor changes in methylation activity but lose the capacity for processive catalysis on multisite DNA substrates, unlike the highly processive wild-type enzyme.

DNA methyl transferase acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine poly-deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic fluorescein. The recent crystal structure of the catalytic domain of DNMT3A with the catalytically inactive DNMT3L shows a DNMT3L·DNMT3A·DNMT3A·DNMT3L heterotetramer complex (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The complex shows specific contacts at the DNMT3A homodimer interface (dimer interface), and dimerization brings two enzyme active sites separated by approximately one helical turn, in B-form DNA (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Still unclear is the physical basis of the DNMT3A homotetramer that is observed in gel filtration experiments in the absence of DNMT3L. Several lines of evidence suggest that the DNMT3A homotetramer is formed by DNMT3A monomers assuming the position occupied by DNMT3L in the heterotetramer crystal structure (tetramer interface) (13Kareta M.S. Botello Z.M. Ennis J.J. Chou C. Chédin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2009; 390: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the disruption of tetramerization and loss of activity with the Phe-728 → Ala DNMT3A mutant led to the proposal that tetramerization is essential for methylation (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, homotetramerization does not provide additional DNA binding surfaces, nor does it bring more active sites into contact with the substrate, and it is not clear why tetramerization should be essential for catalysis. Recent studies have demonstrated that more aggressive forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are correlated with mutations in DNMT3A (15Walter M.J. Ding L. Shen D.

Patients with DNMT3A mutations have altered methylation patterns without a decrease in global DNA methylation levels (16Ley T.J. Ding L. Walter M.J. McLellan M.D. Lamprecht T. Larson D.E. Kandoth C.

We hypothesized that DNMT3A is functional in the homodimeric form, and mutations at the tetramer interface disrupt the ability of regulatory proteins to bind to the DNMT3A homodimer, resulting in aberrant methylation patterning. We sought to evaluate the functional significance of DNMT3A oligomerization at the tetramer interface and understand how the regulatory protein DNMT3L modulates DNMT3A function. A homotetramer DNMT3A model was developed for the design of side-chain mutations that disrupt tetramerization while minimizing changes in catalysis. Mutations at five individual residues are shown by light scattering and electrophoretic mobility assays to disrupt homotetramerization. Four mutants are dimeric on DNA and have activity comparable to the wild-type homotetramer but with altered catalytic properties. Homotetramers carry out multiple cycles of methylation on the same piece of DNA (processive catalysis), whereas disruption of the tetramer interface results in faster product release, resulting in non-processive catalysis. Dimeric mutants are able to bind DNMT3L to form heterotetramers, decreasing the rate of product release, and thus restoring processive catalysis. Here we demonstrate the functional consequence of DNMT3A oligomerization and offer insights into the control of this critical epigenetic regulator. The catalytic domain of DNMT3A and full-length DNMT3L were purified as stated in Holz-Schietinger et al. (8Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29091-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and M.HhaI was purified as stated in Matje et al. (18Matje D.M. Coughlin D.F. Connolly B.A. Dahlquist F.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

Briefly, protein expression occurred in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) for hDNMT3L, M.HhaI, and wild-type DNMT3A catalytic domain and their mutants were expressed in T7Iq cells, induction occurred at 0.6 A600 at room temperate for 5 h with 1 mm IPTG. DNMT3A and M.HhaI were purified from BioRex and nickel affinity columns, DNMT3L was purified from nickel affinity and chitin columns, and all were purified to >95%. EcoRV was prepared as described in Hiller et al. (20Hiller D.A. Fogg J.M. Martin A.M. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. Perona J.J.

The catalytic domain of DNMT3A has similar kinetic parameters as the full-length enzyme, including kcat, KmDNA, KmAdoMet, processivity, and DNMT3L activation (8Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. J. Biol.

Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Both the homo- and DNMT3L hetero-oligomerization interfaces are located on the catalytic domain. DNMT3A chain A of the PDB file 2QRV (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) was kept rigid, whereas the backbone of chain D was aligned to the backbone of DNMT3L chain B using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). Chain D was then dragged into a random orientation ∼10 Å away from the tetramer interface of chain A. The complex was submitted to the RosettaDock Server (21Lyskov S. Gray J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W233-W238Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) to generate the initial tetramer interface model. After visual inspection, the best scoring models were re-submitted until all iterations repeatedly converged on a common model. This model was submitted to the Rosetta computational alanine scanning server (22Kortemme T. Kim D.E. Baker D. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : pl2Google Scholar, 23Kortemme T. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The side chains of residues Arg-771, Glu-733, and Arg-720 were manually optimized by choosing backbone-dependent rotamer conformations that gave the highest scores using the computational alanine-scanning protocol. The DNA used as substrates include duplex poly(dI-dC) (∼1000 bp, Sigma-Aldrich), plasmid pCpGL (24Klug M. Rehli M. Epigenetics. 2006; 1: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (non-CpG substrate), and fluorescent DNA with fluorescein (6-FAM) on the 5′-end of the top strand, GCbox30 (5′/6-FAM/TGGATATCTAGGGGCGCTATGATATCT-3′) duplex and were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, HPLC-purified. The recognition site for DNMT3A is underlined. Protein samples were passed through Bio-Rad P6 resin pre-equilibrated with light scattering buffer (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.8, with 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% azide), then 100 μl of this sample (∼30 μm of monomeric enzyme) was injected into an analytical size-exclusion silica gel chromatography column (300-Å pore size, Wyatt Technologies) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The sample was run through a Waters 996 diode array measuring A260 and A280, optilab T-rEx differential refractometer (Wyatt), and triple-angle light-scattering detector miniDaWN TREOS (Wyatt). Molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA 5.3.4 software using a dn/dc value of 0.185. Standard error was reported from at least two separate samples. DNMT3A wild-type, mutants (150 nm or varied as indicated), or size control standards (M.HhaI and EcoRV, 150 nm) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 200 nm duplex 5′ 6-FAM GCbox30 that contains a single-site central CG site (DNMT3A) along with two sites for EcoRV and one site for M.HhaI binding. For DNMT3L supershifting, DNMT3L was preincubated for 30 min with DNMT3A before the addition of DNA. Binding occurred in reaction buffer with 5 μm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Samples were run on native 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-Boric acid EDTA, pH 7.8, at 250 V for 35 min, visualized for fluorescein using a Typhoon scanner, and data were analyzed using ImageJ (25Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophoton. Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). DNMT3A methylation assays measured the amount of tritiated methyl groups transferred from cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the DNA by the enzyme. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in reaction buffer (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 20 mm NaCl at pH 7.8). Enzyme was at 150 nm total, which is 27 nm active enzyme (previously determined in Purdy et al. (19Purdy M.M. Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 498: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). DNA was the multiple site substrate poly(dI-dC), used at saturation for kcat, KmAdoMet, and DNMT3L activation. AdoMet was used at saturation for kcat, KmDNA, DNMT3L activation, and processivity. Processivity assays and DNMT3L activation assays were carried out as described in Holz-Schietinger et al. (8Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29091-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, processivity assays involve three separate reactions; positive control (20 μm base-pairs (bp) substrate), experiment (substrate followed at 20 min by chase DNA (pCpGL) at 20-fold excess over substrate concentration), and negative control (chase and substrate at the start of reaction). Varying DNMT3L 0.25- to 4-fold the concentration of DNMT3A was used to test DNMT3L activation. DNMT3A and DNMT3L were preincubated in reaction buffer with AdoMet for 1 h at 37 °C before starting the reaction with DNA. A 1:1 ratio with a 1-hour preincubation (with AdoMet) was used for all DNMT3L assays. All reactions were quenched by addition of 0.1% SDS. Samples were spotted onto Whatman DE81 filters then washed, dried, and counted as described previously. For Km values data were fit to Michaelis-Menten equation, kcat, and processivity data were fit to either linear regression or a fit to a nonlinear regression using Prism v5 (GraphPad). The fold stimulation was calculated by dividing the amount of product formed by DNMT3A with DNMT3L by product formed by DNMT3A without DNMT3L. Error bars are standard error from three reactions. Bar charts of kinetic values compared mutants to wild-type using one-way analysis of variance to determine p value using Prism. M.HhaI kchem and Kd assays carried out as described in Matje et al.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). koff values were determined with enzyme (250 nm) and 5′ 6-FAM-labeled GCbox30 duplex DNA at 20 nm, reaching maximum anisotropy, followed by adding in chase DNA (unlabeled GCbox30) at 100× concentration of labeled DNA. The decrease in anisotropy was measured with time on a PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer using Fl Winlab software. Data were fit to a one-phase exponential decay (Y = span e−kt + plateau) using GraphPad, from two independent experiments. A DNMT3A homotetramer model (Fig. 1, A–C) was generated for experimental evaluation by aligning the Cα backbone of a DNMT3A monomer to the DNMT3L position in the 2QRV (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) crystal structure (root mean square deviation = 1.4 Å; supplemental Fig. S1A). This rough model was refined over several 1000 model iterations with the RosettaDock server (18Matje D.M. Coughlin D.F. Connolly B.A. Dahlquist F.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to optimize side-chain interactions at the tetramer interface. After numerous simulations converged upon the same model (Fig. 1A), the refined complex was submitted to the (22Kortemme T. Kim D.E. Baker D. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : pl2Google Scholar, 23Kortemme T. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14116-14121Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) to obtain approximations for the energetic contributions of individual residues to the stabilization of this interface (ΔΔG). A summary of the homotetramer model and the contributions to tetramer stability are shown in Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S3, and supplemental Table S4. Computational alanine screening details an aromatic core at the center of the interface providing the highest energetic contribution to tetramerization, with several salt bridges surrounding the core also having significant contributions. One residue with a high ΔΔG score, Phe-732, has previously been shown to stabilize the DNMT3A homotetramer (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Mutation to alanine results in a large reduction in methylation activity, which was interpreted to demonstrate that tetramerization is required for catalysis by DNMT3A. However, Phe-732 resides at a structurally well conserved region of the catalytic domain. Although the DNMT3A catalytic domain (Δ1–611) has just 13% sequence identity to the well characterized homolog M.HhaI, the tertiary structures show a remarkably small backbone root mean square deviation of 2.3 Å across 220 residues of the catalytic domains (supplemental Fig. S1B). Sequence alignments of DNMT3A with monomeric bacterial C5 DNA methyltransferases reveal four conserved residues along the DNMT3A tetramer interface (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S1) among otherwise highly divergent sequences. Of special interest is conservation of the LFF motif found at the hinge of the catalytic loop in both enzymes that includes Phe-732 (Fig. 1D). To determine whether this conserved residue might be directly involved in catalysis in a monomeric DNA methyltransferase, we removed the side chains of the homologous residues in M.HhaI. Phe-101 and Phe-102 in the M.HhaI cognate·ternary complex (27Shieh F.K. Youngblood B. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 516-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are nearly isomorphous with Phe-731 and Phe-732 in the DNMT3A complex (supplemental Fig. S2A). The purified F101A and F102A M.HhaI mutants showed respective decreases in kcat of 8.3- and 13.4-fold from the wild-type enzyme (supplemental Table S2). Preparations of these mutants were also found to be significantly less stable than the wild-type enzyme preparations (data not shown). Analogously, the F732A mutation in DNMT3A likely impacts critical structural elements within DNMT3A as well as tetramerization, leaving unanswered whether dimeric DNMT3A forms retain activity. Six residues with varying ΔΔG scores and weak conservation to bacterial homologs were investigated for their contribution to tetramerization, including two residues correlated with AML and MDS syndromes (Arg-771 and Arg-729) (supplemental Table S1). Two conserved residues, Arg-736 and Phe-732, were also mutated to alanine for comparison. We found that mutation of residues with ΔΔG values of >1.0 (the combined score from the residue of the outer and inner monomers (supplemental Table S3)) resulted in the formation of homodimers on DNA, whereas residues with ΔΔG values of <1.0 remained tetramers on DNA. The correlation between the computed ΔΔG values and our experimental results (below) supports the use of the Rosetta modeling and scoring algorithms to generate the DNMT3A tetramer model. We combined size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering to evaluate the oligomeric state of wild-type DNMT3A and interface mutants. Light scattering shows our preparations of wild-type DNMT3A catalytic domain to have a weight-average molecular mass of 127 kDa in solution, in agreement with four 36-kDa monomers forming a tetramer (Fig. 2A) (9Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, the broad, tailing peak suggests the tetrameric form is in equilibrium with both the dimeric and monomeric enzyme forms on the column. A cofactor product, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, did not affect the form of the enzyme (supplemental Fig. S4B). Surprisingly, all alanine mutations at the interface disrupted the oligomeric state of the enzyme observed by gel filtration and multiangle light scattering (Fig. 2A, supplemental Table S3, and supplemental Fig. S4). Three of the mutants had weight-average molecular masses slightly larger than the theoretical dimer mass (H739A, D768A, and R736A). Four mutants (F732A, R771A, E733A, and R729A) have approximate molecular masses close to the theoretical mass of a DNMT3A monomer (Fig. 2A). These monomeric mutants have very little tailing in their elution profiles and elute from the column slower than dimers and tetramers. We also investigated if binding to DNA changes the oligomeric state of wild-type and mutant enzymes. Gel filtration of the wild-type DNMT3A catalytic domain·DNA complex was attempted but resulted in large aggregates with equimolar and 2-fold excess DNA concentrations (supplemental Fig. S4B) at the micromolar concentrations needed for detectable multiangle scattering. As a control, M.HhaI was tested with and without DNA, showing distinct peaks corresponding to monomeric bound or free states, respectively (supplemental Fig. S4A). To resolve the oligomeric states of DNMT3A with DNA at concentrations closer to cellular conditions and in vitro assay conditions, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays using a 30-bp, fluorescently labeled deoxyoligonucleotide (GCbox30) were performed. The GCbox30 contains binding sites for two well behaved proteins; a central GCGC site bound by the monomeric M.HhaI (37 kDa) and two GATATC sites bound by the homodimeric EcoRV endonuclease (29 kDa) (28Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) at either end (Fig. 2B). At equimolar concentrations of protein and DNA, one or two EcoRV dimers bind to the DNA, resulting in standards for dimers and tetramers, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5A), whereas M.HhaI on DNA represents the monomer standard. The GCbox30 has a single central CG site that is the major recognition site of DNMT3A (29Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the formation of discrete bands when wild-type and mutant DNMT3A enzymes are incubated with GCbox30. Wild-type enzyme bound to DNA as a tetramer, and smearing in the higher molecular mass region and titrating enzyme concentration from 40 to 360 nm did not change this pattern (supplemental Fig. S5B). H739A, D768A, and R736A formed tetramers or larger aggregate forms on the DNA but were dimeric by light scattering. Five mutants (R771A, E733A, R729A, F732A, and Y735A) shift the DNA closest to the dimer size standard (EcoRV dimer: 58 kDa, DNMT3A dimer: 68 kDa). Fig. 2D shows that titration of the E733A and R771A mutant enzyme concentrations down to 40 nm in the presence of 200 nm CpG sites resulted in only the presence of dimeric enzyme bound to the DNA (see also supplemental Fig. S5C). These results clearly show that DNA facilitates the dimerization of DNMT3A mutants that are monomeric in the absence of DNA even at 200-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 2A). When enzyme was present at higher concentrations than DNA, bands indicative of tetramers became observable from tetramerization of the enzyme or via multiple dimers binding to a single DNA substrate (Fig. 2D). The oligomeric states of the tetramer interface mutants are summarized in Fig. 2E. DNMT3A mutants were examined for changes in their steady-state kinetic parameters by monitoring the transfer of tritiated methyl groups from cofactor AdoMet onto DNA. kcat, KmDNA, KmAdoMet, and processivity values were obtained for all the mutants and compared with wild-type enzyme (supplemental Table S5). kcat values were obtained at saturating DNA and AdoMet concentrations after determining the respective Km values. In agreement with previous data (8Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29091-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), wild-type DNMT3A shows curvature in the plot of product formed over time (Fig. 3A). This is due to the slow product-release step of this processive enzyme on this multisite DNA substrate, where the enzyme partitions between migrating along the DNA to continue carrying out catalysis and dissociation from the DNA into solution (30Svedruzi Z.M. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14977-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This same curvature was seen for the H739A and D768A mutants that did not disrupt tetramer formation, and these mutants differed < 10% in their kcat values from the wild-type value of 3.2 h−1 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S6). The other mutant that appeared tetrameric by gel shift, R736A, had a 5-fold decrease in kcat. However, Arg-736 was homologous to the previously investigated Arg-106 in M.HhaI that had a 2.5-fold decrease in kcat when mutated to alanine (supplemental Fig. S2B) (31Sharma V. Youngblood B.

There are a total of 15 Ephs that are classified into A and B subfamilies according to their sequence homology; the former has nine members and the latter six, although not all are expressed in a given species (2Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar).

There are nine Efns divided into A and B subfamilies according to the way they anchor to the cell surface. The Efna subfamily has six members that are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins; the Efnb subfamily has three members that are transmembrane proteins. Interactions between Ephs and Efns are promiscuous. One Eph can interact with multiple Efns and vice versa. In general, Epha members preferentially interact with Efna members and Ephb members with Efnb members (2Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev.

Ephs are receptor tyrosine kinases that can initiate signal transduction upon ligand binding. However, it is known that although Efns are ligands, they can also transduce signals into cells (2Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flanagan J.G.

As a result, the interaction between Eph and Efns results in bi-directional signaling. Because Ephs and Efns are cell surface molecules, they will normally be activated locally by their binding partners expressed on opposing cells during physical contact. As a result, the major functions of Eph and Efn are related to pattern formation; however, additional functions not related to pattern formation have been recently observed. Most reported functions of Ephs occur in the central nervous system where they are expressed in neurons and control axon and dendrite positioning (2Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). They are essential in the development of neuronal connections, circuit plasticity, and repair. However, they are also involved in a variety of other processes. Some Ephs and Efns are expressed in endothelial cells and are vital in angiogenesis during normal embryonic development as well as in tumorigenesis (4Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J.

We have shown that Efnb1, Efnb2, and Efnb3 initiate signaling through their Eph receptors and can costimulate peripheral T cells in terms of enhancing cytokine production and proliferation in vitro (25Yu G.

We further demonstrated that one of these Efnb receptors, Ephb6, although lacking kinase activity, can transmit signals into T cells (28Luo H. Yu G. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that its null mutation leads to compromised T cells responses in vitro and in vivo (29Luo H. Yu G. Tremblay J. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1762-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, Ephb6 null mutants have normal thymus structure and thymocyte development (29Luo H. Yu G. Tremblay J. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1762-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), probably due to complementary functions of other Eph family members. To reveal the roles of these highly redundant Eph/Efn family members in thymocyte development and T cell immune responses in vivo and in vitro, we generated Efnb1/Efnb2 double gene knock-out (dKO) mice with T cell-specific deletion of these two genes. Results obtained from these mice showed that Efnb1 and Efnb2 are involved in proper thymocyte development and peripheral T cell function. A PCR fragment amplified with a primer set (5′-CTGAATAAGGGCTGCGAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCAAATGGCTTAACCCAAGA-3′) based on the Efnb1 genomic sequence was used as a probe to isolate a genomic BAC DNA clone 4M20 from the 129/sv mouse BAC genomic library RPCI-22. A genomic BAC DNA clone 85F06PCR fragment based on the EFN2 sequence was similarly amplified with the primer set (5′-GCTGC TCTTC AGTCA GTCAG C-3′ and 5′-TACCA GTCAT CACAT CGCAG-3′). The targeting vectors were constructed by recombination and routine cloning methods using a 12-kb Efnb1 genomic fragment from clone 4M20 for Efnb1 and a 12-kb Efnb2 genomic fragment from clone 85F06 for Efnb2 (illustrated in Fig. 1, A and E). The final targeting fragments for Efnb1 and Efnb2 were excised from its cloning vector backbone by NotI and electroporated into ES cells. After G418 selection, the FRT-flanked Neo/TK cassette was eliminated by subsequent transient transfection of the ES cells with a Flippase expression vector. The targeting scheme is shown in Fig. 1A. These genetic engineering steps in ES cells resulted in two net insertions for the EFNB1 constructs as follows: a 118-bp LoxP-containing sequence (5′-AGTACGGGCC CAAGCTGGCC GCCCTAGGGG CGCGCCTGCA GATAACTTCG TATAATGTAT GCTATACGAA GTTATGATAT CAAGCTTATC GATACCGTCG AAGCTTGCTA GCGGTACC-3′) at position 26061 (based on the sequence of AL671478.9 of the GenBankTM), and a 151-bp LoxP- plus FRT-containing sequence (5′-GGCCGCCCTA GGGGCGCGCC TGCAGATAAC TTCGATAATG TATGCTATAC GAAGTTATGG ATCGAAGTTC CTATTTCTAA AAAGTATAGG AACTTCTTAA GGCCACCGCG GCCGAACGCT AGAGCTTGTC GACGGTACCT AACTTCCTAG G-3′) at position 28713, 756 bp upstream and 1285 bp downstream of the Efnb1 Exon 1, respectively. Similarly for Efnb2, the genetic engineering steps in ES cells resulted in two net insertions as follows: a 71-bp LoxP-containing sequence (5′-TCGACCTCGA CGGTATCGAT AAGCTTGATA TCATAACTTC GTATAGCATA CATTATACGA AGTTATCGTT T-3′) at position 186685 (based on the sequence of AC090007.8 in the GenBankTM), and a 102-bp LoxP plus FRT-containing sequence (5′-GCGTTAATTA AGAAGTTCCT ATACTTTTTA GAGAATAGGA ACTTCGATCC ATAACTTCGT ATAGCATACA TTATACGAAG TTATCTGCAG GCGCGCCCCT AG-3′) at position 188802, 923 bp upstream and 930 bp downstream of Efnb2 Exon 1, respectively.FIGURE 1Generation of mice with T cell-specific Efnb1f/f and Efnb2f/f null mutation. A and E, schemes of Efnb1f/f and Efnb2f/f mouse generation. The schemes of genetic manipulation to generate floxed Efnb1 (A) and Efnb2 (E) mice are illustrated. Bold lines represent left and right arms of genomic sequences used in gene targeting. Empty squares represent exons (E) or thymidine kinase gene/neomycin-resistant gene cassettes (TK/Neo). LoxP and FRT sites are represented by large and small arrowheads, respectively. The solid box represents a genomic region from which probes were produced for Southern blot analysis. B and F, Southern blot analysis of tail DNA of Efnb1- and Efnb2-targeted mice. For Efnb1-targeted mice (B), tail DNA was digested with AseI and ScaI and analyzed by Southern blotting. The 11.6-kb band was derived from the wild type allele, and the 7.3-kb band was from the mutated allele. For Efnb2-targeted mice (F), the tail DNA was digested with PacI and analyzed by Southern blotting. The 15.5-kb band was derived from the wild type allele, and the 8.1-kb band was from the mutated allele. C and G, T cell-specific deletion of Efnb1 and Efnb2 in Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f and Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f mice according to PCR. Efnb1f/f mice and Efnb2f/f mice were crossed with transgenic mice harboring Cre recombinase driven by the proximal LCK promoter. In the upper panel, the tail and thymocyte DNA of the mice was analyzed with PCR using primer pairs 1 and 2 as described in supplemental material. For Efnb1f/f mice, primer pair 1 detected a 271-bp fragment derived from the undeleted allele, although primer pair 2 detected a 492-bp fragment derived from the allele with Efnb1 exon 1 deleted. For Efnb2f/f mice, primer pair 1 detected a 459-bp fragment derived from the undeleted allele, whereas primer pair 2 detected a 291-bp fragment derived from the allele with the Efnb2 exon 1 deleted. In the lower panel, total RNA was extracted from Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f (C) or Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f (G) thymocytes, spleen T cells, and spleen B cells. Their Efnb1 and Efnb2 mRNA was analyzed by RT/qPCR using β-actin as an internal control. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of the ratios of Efnb1/β-actin (C) and Efnb2/β-actin (G) signals. D and H, deletion of Efnb1 and Efnb2 expression in Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f and Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f thymocytes and spleen T cells according to flow cytometry. Thymocytes at different differentiation stages (DN2–4, DP, CD4SP, and CD8SP) and spleen CD4 and CD8 cells were gated and were analyzed for Efnb1 expression (E) or Efnb2 expression (H) by flow cytometry. The dotted line, isotypic control Ab; the dashed line, control WT cells stained with anti-Efnb1 or anti-Efnb2 Abs; the solid line, Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f and Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f cells stained with anti-Efnb1 or anti-Efnb2 Abs, respectively. The percentage of Efnb1- or Efnb2-positive cells after the deduction of the background signal (isotypic Ab control) is shown. All the experiments in this figure were repeated two or more times, and data from representative ones are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeric male mice were mated with C57BL/6 females to establish mutated Efnb1 and Efnb2 allele germ line transmission. Southern blotting with a probe corresponding to the 3′ sequences outside the targeting region, as shown in Fig. 1A (black square), was used to screen and confirm the gene targeting and the successful removal of the Neo-TK selection marker in Efnb1 ES cells and eventually in mouse tail DNA. The targeted allele showed a 7.3-kb AseI/ScaI fragment, whereas the WT allele showed an 11.6-kb fragment (Fig. 1B). Southern blotting with a probe corresponding to the 5′ sequences outside the targeting region, as illustrated in Fig. 1E (black square), was used to screen and confirm the gene targeting and the successful removal of the Neo-TK selection marker in Efnb2 ES cells and eventually in mouse tail DNA. The targeted allele showed an 8.1-kb PacI/PacI fragment in tail DNA (Fig. 1F), although a WT allele showed a 15.5-kb fragment. PCR was used for routine genotyping of the targeted allele(s). The following PCR conditions were used for Efnb1: 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 34 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Primers 5′-GTCTC CACTG CCCAT AGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTC CCAGT CCAGTC ACTA-3′ (reverse) amplified a 271-bp fragment from the targeted allele and a 133-bp fragment from the WT allele. PCR conditions for Efnb2 were similar except the annealing temperature was reduced from 58 to 52 °C. Primers 5′-TAGCC ATCCC TTGGA ATACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGGC GCGCC CCTT TCGAAG-3′ (reverse) amplified a 456-bp fragment from the targeted allele and a 355-bp fragment from the WT allele. Mice with targeted Efnb1 allele(s) were named Efnb1f/f (loxP insertions in both alleles) or Efnb1f (loxP insertion in one allele). Mice with targeted Efnb2 allele(s) were named Efnb2f/f (loxP insertion in both alleles). These two lines were backcrossed with C57BL/6 for more than 10 generations and then mated with Lck promoter-driven Cre recombinase transgenic mice in the C57BL/6 background (strain B6.Cg-Tg (Lck-Cre) 540Jxm/J®, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to obtain T cell-specific Efnb1 and Efnb2 gene knock-out mice (Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f) and Efnb2 gene knock-out mice (Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f). Because Efnb1 is an X-linked gene, Lck-Cre-Efnb1f in males is equivalent to Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f in females in that the Efnb1 gene is completely null-mutated. For the convenience of description, Lck-Cre-Efnb1f males and Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f females are collectively referred to as Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f mice. PCR was used to confirm the T cell-specific deletion of Efnb1 using two different primer pairs. Primer pair 1 (forward, 5′-GTCTC CACTG CCCAT AGCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCTC CCAGT CCAGT CACTA-3′) was used to detect a 271-bp fragment derived from an allele with undeleted Exon 1. Primer pair 2 (forward, 5′-GTCTC CACTG CCCAT AGCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACCCT TACAT CGAAG AACTG GGCA-3′) was used to detect a 492-bp fragment derived from an allele with Exon 1 deleted. Similarly, T cell-specific deletion of Efnb2 was confirmed using two different primer pairs. Primer pair 1 (forward, 5′-TAGCC ATCCC TTGGA ATACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTGGC GCGCC CCTTT CGAAG-3′) was used to detect a 456-bp fragment derived from an allele(s) with undeleted Exon 1. Primer pair 2 (forward, 5′-CTAAG GCTCT CAGCC TCGTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTGGC GCGCC CCTTT CGAAG-3′) was used to detect a 291-bp fragment derived from an allele(s) with Exon 1 deleted. The PCR conditions used were same as described above for routine genotyping. Efnb1, Efnb2, T-bet, and RORγt mRNA levels were measured by RT/qPCR. Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed with Superscript IITM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers used are listed in supplemental Table IA. qPCR conditions for the reactions was as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. β-Actin or GAPDH mRNA levels were used as internal controls, and data were expressed as signal ratios of test gene mRNA/control gene mRNA. Single cell suspensions from the thymus, spleen, or lymph nodes were prepared and stained for flow cytometry as described in our previous publications (25Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J.

For intracellular antigen staining, cells were first stained with Abs against cell surface antigens, fixed with Cytofix/CytopermTM solution (BD Biosciences), and then stained with mAbs against intracellular antigens. Antibodies for flow cytometry are shown in supplemental Table IB. The following synthetic peptides were purchased from Sigma Genosys: gp(33–41), KAVYNFATC (LCMV-GP, H-2Db); np(396–404), FQPQNGQFI (LCMV-NP, H-2Db); gp(276–286), SGVENPGGYCL (LCMV-GP, H-2Db); and gp(61–80), GLNGPDIYKGVYQFKSVEFD (LCMV-GP, I-Ab). PE-gp(33–41), PE-np(396–404), and PE-gp(276–286) H-2Db tetrameric complexes were synthesized in-house and used at 1:100 dilution as described previously (30Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M. Science. 1996; 274: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). These MHC tetramers were used to detect LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells. Briefly, splenocytes were first stained with PE-gp(33–41), PE-np(396–404), or PE-gp(276–286) tetramers for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by staining with FITC rat anti-mouse CD8α and APC-rat anti-mouse CD62L mAbs at 4 °C for another 20 min. 7-Aminoactinomycin D was used for exclusion of dead cells. After washing, cells were fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in 0.2 ml of PBS and sacrificed 90 min later for thymocyte analysis. Another group of mice was injected with BrdU daily for 4 days and then sacrificed for spleen T cell analysis. Thymocytes or spleen cells were then isolated and stained with Abs against cell surface markers. They were subsequently permeabilized and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU Ab using a BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight- to 10-week-old C57BL/6(CD45.2+)×C57B6.SJL(CD45.1+) F1 mice were irradiated at 1100 rads. Twenty four hours later, they received 4 × 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow cells from C57/B6.SJL and dKO mice in a 1:1 ratio. Efnb1f/f/Efnb2f/f mouse bone marrow was used as a control. Thymocytes and spleen cells of the recipients were analyzed by flow cytometry 8–10 weeks following the bone marrow transplantation (BMTx). Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from pooled splenocytes and lymph node cells using the naive CD4+ T cells isolation kit (R&D Systems). Purity of the naive CD4+ cells was routinely greater than 95%. Purified naive T cells (0.25 × 106 cells/well) were mixed with T cell-depleted irradiated (3000 rads) C57BL/6 feeder splenocytes (1.25 × 106 cells/well) and cultured in 96-well plates under Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg polarization conditions, as described in our earlier publication (31Zhang J. Wang X. Fahmi H. Wojcik S. Fikes J. Yu Y. Wu J. Luo H. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and then analyzed by flow cytometry. LCMV-WE was obtained from Dr. R. M. Zinkernagel (Zurich, Switzerland). Viral stock was propagated in vitro, and viral titers were determined by the focus-forming assay as described previously (32Lacasse P. Denis J. Lapointe R. Leclerc D. Lamarre A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mice were infected by the i.v. route with 200 focus-forming units of LCMV-WE. Mice were sacrificed 8 days post-infection to collect spleens for primary immune response analysis or 1 month later for memory immune response analysis. To evaluate viral clearance, mice were bled at days 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 23, and 28 post-infection, and LCMV titers in whole blood were measured by the focus-forming assay. One million splenocytes from LCMV-infected mice were seeded in single wells of 96-well round-bottomed plates. Cells were maintained in 5% RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml mrIL-2, 10 μg/ml brefeldin A, 10 μm gp(33–41) or gp(61–80) peptide. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8α or CD4 mAbs and 7-aminoactinomycin D. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained with allophycocyanin-rat anti-mouse TNF-α and FITC-rat anti-mouse IFN-γ mAbs. Frequency of IFN-γ and TNF-α-secreting T cells was determined by flow cytometry. Eight days following LCMV infection, splenocytes were tested for cytotoxic activity in a standard 51Cr release assay as described previously (32Lacasse P. Denis J. Lapointe R. Leclerc D. Lamarre A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). dKO or control spleen T cells were purified with the EasySepTM T cell enrichment kit from Stemcell Technologies (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). These cells as well as total thymocytes were reacted with or without IL-6 (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min for the detection of STAT3 phosphorylation. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture, Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. STAT3 was detected by blotting with rabbit anti-mouse phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) monoclonal antibody (clone D3A7, Cell Signaling Technology) followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with rabbit anti-mouse STAT3 mAb (clone 79D7, Cell Signaling Technology) for total STAT3 expression. The signals were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Efnb1 and Efnb2 null mutation caused embryonic lethality (4Wang H.U. Chen Z.F.

To study the function of these genes in the T cell compartment, we generated conditional KO mice with LoxP sites flanking Exon 1 of Efnb1 or Efnb2 (Fig. 1, A, B, E, and F). These mice (Efnb1f/f and Efnbf/f) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by a proximal Lck promoter. As shown in the upper panels of Fig. 1, C and G, in the presence of the Lck-promoter Cre transgene, Exon 1 of Efnb1 or Efnb2 was deleted in thymocytes but was maintained in the genome of tail tissue in Lck-Cre-Efnb1f/f and Lck-Cre-Efnb2f/f mice.

https://openalex.org/W2167882935,"Using mass spectrometric analysis we found that oncogenic transcription factor FOXM1 that is overexpressed in a majority of human cancers interacts with multifunctional protein NPM, which is also overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrated that NPM forms a complex with FOXM1 and also identified the regions responsible for their interaction. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the interaction between FOXM1 and NPM in cancer and immortal cells. Furthermore, knockdown of NPM in immortal and cancer cells led to significant down-regulation of FOXM1 similar to its levels in normal cells, suggesting that NPM might modulate FOXM1 level. In addition, in OCI/AML3 leukemia cells where mutant NPM is localized in the cytoplasm we found that typically nuclear FOXM1 was predominantly co-localized with NPM in the cytoplasm, while NPM knockdown led to the disappearance of FOXM1 from the cytoplasm, suggesting that NPM may also determine intracellular localization of FOXM1. Knockdown of FOXM1 or NPM in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells inhibited anchorage-dependent and independent growth in cell culture, and tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, over-expression of FOXM1 reversed the effect of NPM knockdown in vitro. Our data suggest that in cancer cells NPM interacts with FOXM1 and their interaction is required for sustaining the level and localization of FOXM1. Targeting the interaction between FOXM1 and NPM by peptides or small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2064566052,"α(1)-Antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor secreted by hepatocytes. A variant of α(1)-antitrypsin with an E342K (Z) mutation (ATZ) has propensity to form polymers, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded by both ER-associated degradation and autophagy, and causes hepatocyte loss. Constant features in hepatocytes of PiZZ individuals and in PiZ transgenic mice expressing ATZ are the formation of membrane-limited globular inclusions containing ATZ and mitochondrial damage. Expression of ATZ in the liver does not induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), a protective mechanism aimed to maintain ER homeostasis in the face of an increased load of proteins. Here we found that in hepatoma cells the ER E3 ligase HRD1 functioned to degrade most of the ATZ before globular inclusions are formed. Activation of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branch of the UPR by expression of spliced ATF6(1-373) decreased intracellular accumulation of ATZ and the formation of globular inclusions by a pathway that required HRD1 and the proteasome. Expression of ATF6(1-373) in ATZ-expressing hepatoma cells did not induce autophagy and increased the level of the proapoptotic factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) but did not lead to apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Expression of ATF6(1-373) did not cause inhibition of protein synthesis and prevented mitochondrial damage induced by ATZ expression. It was concluded that activation of the ATF6 pathway of the UPR limits ATZ-dependent cell toxicity by selectively promoting ER-associated degradation of ATZ and is thereby a potential target to prevent hepatocyte loss in addition to autophagy-enhancing drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2054237760,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is essential for controlling parasite burden and survival in a model of systemic Toxoplasma gondii infection. Peroral T. gondii infection induces small intestine necrosis and death in susceptible hosts, and in many aspects resembles inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Considering the critical role of MIF in the pathogenesis of IBD, we hypothesized that MIF participates in the inflammatory response induced by oral infection with T. gondii.Mif deficient (Mif(-/-)) and wild-type mice in the C57Bl/6 background were orally infected with T. gondii strain ME49. Mif(-/-) mice had reduced lethality, ileal inflammation and tissue damage despite of an increased intestinal parasite load compared to wt mice. Lack of MIF caused a reduction of TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-23 and an increased expression of IL-22 in ileal mucosa. Moreover, suppressed pro-inflammatory responses at the ileal mucosa observed in Mif(-/-) mice was not due to upregulation of IL-4, IL-10 or TGF-β. MIF also affected the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) but not MMP-2 in the intestine of infected mice. Signs of systemic inflammation including the increased concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and liver damage were less pronounced in Mif(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.In conclusion, our data suggested that in susceptible hosts MIF controls T. gondii infection with the cost of increasing local and systemic inflammation, tissue damage and death."
https://openalex.org/W2009876395,"Tagetitoxin (Tgt) inhibits multisubunit chloroplast, bacterial, and some eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RNAPs). A crystallographic structure of Tgt bound to bacterial RNAP apoenzyme shows that Tgt binds near the active site but does not explain why Tgt acts only at certain sites. To understand the Tgt mechanism, we constructed a structural model of Tgt bound to the transcription elongation complex. In this model, Tgt interacts with the β' subunit trigger loop (TL), stabilizing it in an inactive conformation. We show that (i) substitutions of the Arg residue of TL contacted by Tgt confer resistance to inhibitor; (ii) Tgt inhibits RNAP translocation, which requires TL movements; and (iii) paused complexes and a ""slow"" enzyme, in which the TL likely folds into an altered conformation, are resistant to Tgt. Our studies highlight the role of TL as a target through which accessory proteins and antibiotics can alter the elongation complex dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2014461782,"Activation of transcription factor NF-κB and inflammasome-directed caspase-1 cleavage of IL-1β are key processes in the inflammatory response to pathogen or host-derived signals. Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are restricted to Old World monkeys, apes, and humans and have previously been shown to impair inflammasome assembly and/or NF-κB p65 transcriptional activity in transfected epithelial cells. However, the biological role of POP2 and the molecular basis for its observed functions are not well understood. In this report we demonstrate that POP2 regulates TNFα and IL-1β responses in human monocytic THP-1 cells and in stable transfectants of mouse J774A.1 macrophages. Deletion analysis of POP2 revealed that the first α-helix (residues 1-19) is necessary and sufficient for both inflammasome and NF-κB inhibitory functions. Further, key acidic residues Glu(6), Asp(8), and Glu(16), believed critical for Pyrin/Pyrin domain interaction, are important for inflammasome inhibition. Moreover, these mutations did not reduce the effect of POP2 upon NF-κB, indicating that the inflammasome and NF-κB inhibitory properties of POP2 can be uncoupled mechanistically. Collectively, these data demonstrate that POP2 acts as a regulator of inflammatory signals and exerts its two known functions through distinct modalities employed by its first α-helix."
https://openalex.org/W1998639145,"The thiazolidedione (TZD) class of drugs is clinically approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The therapeutic actions of TZDs are mediated via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Despite their widespread use, concern exists regarding the safety of currently used TZDs. This has prompted the development of selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), compounds that promote glucose homeostasis but with reduced side effects due to partial PPARγ agonism. However, this also results in partial agonism with respect to PPARγ target genes promoting glucose homeostasis. Using a gene expression-based screening approach we identified N-acetylfarnesylcysteine (AFC) as both a full and partial agonist depending on the PPARγ target gene (differential SPPARM). AFC activated PPARγ as effectively as rosiglitazone with regard to Adrp, Angptl4, and AdipoQ, but was a partial agonist of aP2, a PPARγ target gene associated with increased adiposity. Induction of adipogenesis by AFC was also attenuated compared with rosiglitazone. Reporter, ligand binding assays, and dynamic modeling demonstrate that AFC binds and activates PPARγ in a unique manner compared with other PPARγ ligands. Importantly, treatment of mice with AFC improved glucose tolerance similar to rosiglitazone, but AFC did not promote weight gain to the same extent. Finally, AFC had effects on adipose tissue remodeling similar to those of rosiglitazone and had enhanced antiinflammatory effects. In conclusion, we describe a new approach for the identification of differential SPPARMs and have identified AFC as a novel class of PPARγ ligand with both full and partial agonist activity in vitro and in vivo.

The first generation TZD, troglitazone, was voluntarily taken off the market due to rare but severe hepatotoxicity (15Watkins P.B. Whitcomb R.W. N. Engl. J.

Current TZDs, although maintaining a better toxicity profile than troglitazone, are still associated with increased weight gain/adiposity, anemia, increased rate of bone fracture, and liver injury (4Yki-Järvinen H.

The deleterious effects of PPARγ ligands have prompted the development of selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs). These are ligands that selectively modulate PPARγ activity (18Balint B.L. Nagy L. Endocr. Metab. Immune Disord. Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: pe9PubMed Google Scholar). Ideally, SPPARMS promote the glucose-lowering effects of PPARγ but lack the undesirable effects such as increased adiposity by acting as partial agonists of PPARγ. To date, identification of new SPPARMs is based on structural modeling, in vitro binding assays, or luciferase-based reporter assays. Although these screens identify compounds that may bind and/or activate PPARγ, many of the SPPARMS developed do not show differential specificity. Hence, there is partial induction of most PPARγ target genes and not only those associated with deleterious effects. Therefore, a screening approach to identify differential SPPARMs, compounds that promote partial and full activity of PPARγ depending on target genes, would be beneficial. We describe here a gene expression-based screening approach to identify SPPARMs based on their ability to regulate PPARγ target genes differentially. Using this approach, we have identified a novel SPPARM, N-acetylfarnesylcysteine (AFC), that promotes glucose tolerance, has enhanced antiinflammatory effects and reduced adipogenic activity compared with classic TZDs. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were obtained from ATCC. PPARγ knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFPPARγKO) were obtained from Dr. Evan Rosen (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston MA) (11Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). MEFPPARγKO were transformed with retrovirus-expressing empty vector or PPARγ and selected using puromycin as described previously (20Drori S. Girnun G.D. Tou L. Szwaya J.D. Mueller E. Xia K. Kia X. Shivdasani R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with compounds as indicated, RNA was isolated, and RT-PCR was performed. All chemicals including the LOPAC library were obtained from Sigma or Alexis Biopharmaceuticals. Tnf-α was purchased from R&D Systems. Cell culture media and supplements came from Cellgro (Mediatech), and FBS was from HyClone. 3T3-L1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and grown overnight. The following day cells were treated with a 20 μm concentration of each compound for 24 h and RNA isolated using 96-well Turbo RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green reagent (Applied BioSystems). RNA was isolated from cells or tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA reverse transcribed as described previously (20Drori S. Girnun G.D. Tou L. Szwaya J.D. Mueller E. Xia K. Kia X.

Expression was normalized to β-actin. 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to a differentiation protocol as described previously in the absence or presence of AFC or rosiglitazone (20Drori S. Girnun G.D.

The level differentiation was by monitoring lipid accumulation as detected by Oil Red staining. Western blotting for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated PPARγ was performed as described previously by Hauser et al. (21Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In brief, protein lysates from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (described above) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting for PPARγ was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (H100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylation of the CDK5 site on PPARγ at serine 273 was performed as previously described (22Choi J.H. Banks A.S. Estall J.L. Kajimura S. Boström P. Laznik D. Ruas J.L. Chalmers M.J. Kamenecka T.M. Blüher M. Griffin P.R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2010; 466: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts expressing PPARγ were pretreated with rosiglitazone, MRL24, or AFC with the indicated doses and then incubated with TNF-α. Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer, and phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser-273 was analyzed with phospho-specific antibody against PPARγ Ser-273. Total PPARγ was analyzed with anti-PPARγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blotting for serine 112 (or 82 of PPARγ1)-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated PPARγ was performed as described previously by Hauser et al. (21Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for PPARγ was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (H100). 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with plasmids containing the PPARγ ligand binding domain fused to Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-PPARγ-LBD, Gal4-PPARγ-LBDQP) and UAS-TATA-luciferase (23Sarraf P.

Following transfection the cells were treated overnight with either 250 nm rosiglitazone, 100 μm AFC or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (20Drori S. Girnun G.D. Tou L. Szwaya J.D. Mueller E. Xia K. Kia X. Shivdasani R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged PPARγ-LBD fusion construct (a gift from Dr. John Schwabe, Medical Research Council, UK) was expressed in E. coli as described previously (24Itoh T. Fairall L. Amin K. Inaba Y. Szanto A. Balint B.L. Nagy L. Yamamoto K. Schwabe J.W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In brief, protein expression was initiated by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested, and pellets were isolated and lysed. The lysate was sonicated, and supernatant was added to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen) for purification according the manufacturer's directions. The presence of His-tagged PPARγ-LBD protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. For the ligand binding assay, 100 μg of protein was incubated with 10 nm [3H]rosiglitazone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled AFC for 3 h at 4 °C in ligand binding buffer (23Sarraf P.

After incubation the beads were washed to remove the unbound ligand and binding quantitated using liquid scintillation counting. We also performed a ligand binding assay using labeled AFC. Unlabeled rosiglitazone was used at various concentrations in the presence of 35S-labeled AFC (Signum Biosciences). The binding isotherms were analyzed for both ligands, and Kd values were determined using the one-site binding competition model as implemented in the SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). All animal work was conducted in accordance with the Animal Care Facility at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Male C57BL/6J (4 weeks old) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and fed a high fat diet (60 kcal% fat, D12492, Research diet) to develop diet-induced obesity (DIO) and hyperglycemia. The blood glucose levels were checked before the start of drug treatment. Animals were administered dimethyl sulfoxide, rosiglitazone, and AFC by intraperitoneal injection daily. After 2 weeks, fasting glucose and glucose tolerance tests were performed. In brief, mice were fasted overnight and tail vein blood used to measure blood glucose levels. For the glucose tolerance test, blood glucose was measured as indicated after intraperitoneal glucose administration (1 g/kg body weight). White adipose tissue was harvested at the terminal point of the experiment for histology or frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. For histological analysis paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of white adipose tissue were stained with hematoxylin & eosin to observe changes in adipose tissue morphology. Counting of adipocytes was performed blinded by a pathologist (Dr. Twaddel). We used a small library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC, Sigma) to screen for molecules with differential PPARγ activating abilities. The advantage of this library is that it contains characterized pharmacologically active compounds for which structure and mechanisms have been annotated (see Sigma-Aldrich Web site). Additional compounds that alter signal transduction pathways known to regulate PPARγ were also included (27Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Burgermeister E. Seger R. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Burns K.A.

We performed real-time PCR analysis of well characterized PPARγ target genes Angptl4, Adrp, and aP2 as readouts of PPARγ activation (30Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 31Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

Acta. 2005; 1728: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the specific targets associated with effects of PPARγ are not fully understood, Angptl4 and Adrp are associated with antidiabetic effects of PPARγ (32Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 34Phillips S.A. Choe C.C. Ciaraldi T.P.

In contrast, the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 plays an important role in adiposity associated with PPARγ activation (31Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). We compared changes in gene expression to rosiglitazone with a focus on similar induction of Angptl4 and Adrp and partial induction of aP2. A number of compounds induced Angptl4 and Adrp but not aP2. Although aP2 was induced by cAMP and glucocorticoid-related compounds in the library (which are known to promote adipogenesis) (35Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar), they did not induce Angptl4 or Adrp as effectively as rosiglitazone (data not shown). However, one compound, AFC, appeared to have differential selectivity toward activation of PPARγ (Fig. 1A). Angptl4 and Adrp were induced to a similar level by rosiglitazone and AFC (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). In contrast, aP2 was induced more robustly by rosiglitazone than AFC (supplemental Fig. S1C). Next, we confirmed the results of the screen and performed a dose response for AFC and rosiglitazone to evaluate the apparent selective partial agonism by AFC. There was a dose-dependent increase in PPARγ target genes Angplt4 and Adrp by both AFC and rosiglitazone (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, at all the doses that had a similar effect on Adrp and Angplt4, rosiglitazone was much more effective at inducing aP2 than AFC (Fig. 1D). For example, at the highest dose of each AFC and rosiglitazone (150 μm and 250 nm, respectively), Angptl4 and Adrp were induced similarly. However, rosiglitazone treatment led to a 7-fold greater induction of aP2 than AFC, demonstrating a partial agonism of AFC to activate PPARγ with respect to aP2. Recent studies have also shown that the insulin-sensitizing effects of PPARγ are also mediated in part by induction of the adipokine adiponectin (AdipoQ) (30Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). AdipoQ was induced to a similar level by rosiglitazone and AFC (supplemental Fig. S1D). This further supports that AFC is a selective partial ligand for aP2 but is a full agonist on other PPARγ target genes. The ability of AFC to induce several PPARγ target genes suggests that AFC functions by activating PPARγ. To confirm this, we treated PPARγ knock-out MEFs (MEFPPARγKO) and MEFPPARγKO ectopically expressing PPARγ (MEFPPARγKO-PPARγ) with AFC. AFC treatment did not induce Adrp or AdipoQ expression in MEFPPARγKO (Fig. 2, A and B). In the absence of PPARγ, Angptl4 and aP2 were not detected irrespective of treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). However, in the MEFPPARγKO-PPARγ cells, AFC treatment led to an induction of all four genes (Fig. 2, A–D), demonstrating that AFC is inducing these genes in a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. Next, we subjected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to a differentiation protocol using a hormonal mixture in the presence and absence of rosiglitazone or AFC. Compared with rosiglitazone, AFC was less effective at promoting adipogenesis (Fig. 2E). We then examined the expression of PPARγ target genes from the differentiated adipocytes. Although Adrp and Angptl4 were equally induced by rosiglitazone and AFC (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B); unlike rosiglitazone, AFC did not induce aP2 expression (supplemental Fig. S2C). This further demonstrates that AFC differentially activates PPARγ. AFC has a structure similar to several lipid-derived molecules that are known to be PPARγ ligands (36Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, 37Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). The ability of AFC to interact with and activate PPARγ as a ligand was tested using a chimeric reporter plasmid containing a Gal4-DNA binding domain fused to the LBD of PPARγ. We also used a PPARγ-LBD with a glutamine to proline mutation at amino acid 286 as a negative control. This mutation renders PPARγ unable to bind ligands and activate gene expression (23Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). AFC induced the activity of the Gal4-PPARγ fusion construct ∼ 3-fold (Fig. 3A). In contrast, neither rosiglitazone nor AFC was able to activate the Gal4-PPARγ-LBDQP mutant construct (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3A), demonstrating a direct effect of AFC on the LBD of PPARγ. Although AFC activated the Gal4-PPARγ-LBD less than rosiglitazone (supplemental Fig. S3A), these data strongly suggest that AFC is interacting with the LBD of PPARγ. Next, we performed ligand binding assays to confirm that AFC interacts directly with PPARγ. As shown in Fig. 3B, AFC was able to displace rosiglitazone from the LBD of PPARγ with a Kd of 11 ± 3 μm. We also determined whether unlabeled rosiglitazone could displace radiolabeled 35S-labeled AFC from PPARγ (supplemental Fig. S3B). Increasing concentrations of rosiglitazone effectively displaced AFC from PPARγ with a Kd for rosiglitazone of 20 nm. This is in line with the reported Kd for rosiglitazone (23Sarraf P. Mueller E.

Next, we performed molecular dynamics simulation of AFC bound to PPARγ. The modeling predicts that the carboxylate moiety of AFC molecule makes hydrogen bonds to Tyr-473 and His-449. These two residues interact similarly with a majority of the known PPARγ ligands. In addition, the model predicts that the acetyl group of AFC forms a novel interaction with the backbone nitrogen of His-466 (Fig. 3C). This is a unique interaction that has not been observed for other PPARγ ligands. AFC is most well known for its ability to inhibit Ras/Rho-GTPase signaling by competing for farnesyl binding domains and inhibiting carboxymethylation of GTPases because it mimics the C-terminal farnesylcysteine group of Ras-GTPase (40Volker C.

Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because GTPase signaling inhibits PPARγ activity we wanted to determine whether AFC was activating PPARγ by virtue of its ability to inhibit GTPase signaling. We treated 3T3-L1 cells with different compounds known to inhibit GTPase processing. Farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors work upstream of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase by inhibiting the farnesylation or geranylgeranylation of C-terminal CAAX-containing proteins (41Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Neither farnesyl transferase inhibitors nor geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors induced Angptl4 or aP2 in the 3T3-L1 cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). We also used S-adenosylhomocysteine, an inhibitor of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase that is structurally distinct from AFC. We did not observe a change in the expression of PPARγ target genes (supplemental Fig. S4A). Additionally, two compounds in the LOPAC library mevastatin and pravastatin, known to inhibit isoprenylation of GTPases, did not alter PPARγ target gene expression (data not shown). Therefore, it does not appear that inhibition of GTPase processing by AFC is mediating its effects on PPARγ. We then wanted to determine whether AFC alters other signal transduction pathways regulating PPARγ function. Phosphorylation of PPARγ in its N terminus by several MAPKs reduces the activity of PPARγ (21Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Previous studies show that AFC decreases MAPK signaling (40Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the effect of AFC on PPARγ was a result of decreasing the phosphorylation of PPARγ. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with rosiglitazone, or AFC and the phosphorylation status of PPARγ was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of PPARγ in differentiation adipocytes was not altered following treatment with AFC (supplemental Fig. S4B, upper band). Therefore, it is unlikely that AFC is increasing PPARγ activity by reducing the phosphorylation of PPARγ. Interestingly, AFC decreased nonphosphorylated PPARγ, in a fashion similar to rosiglitazone. The reduction in unphosphorylated PPARγ protein by PPARγ ligands is a general property of PPARγ ligands (21Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

In the conventional view of the catalytic cycle, based upon studies of P450s in vitro, substrate binding to the Fe(III) resting state facilitates the first 1-electron reduction of the heme. However, the resting state of P450s in vivo has not been examined. In the present study, whole cell difference spectroscopy of bacterial (CYP101A1 and CYP176A1, i.e. P450cam and P450cin) and mammalian (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) P450s expressed within intact Escherichia coli revealed that both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of the enzyme are present in the absence of substrates. The relevance of this finding was supported by similar observations of Fe(II) P450 heme in intact rat hepatocytes. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the bacterial forms in intact cells showed that a proportion of the P450 in cells was in an EPR-silent form in the native state consistent with the presence of Fe(II) P450. Coexpression of suitable cognate electron donors increased the degree of endogenous reduction to over 80%. A significant proportion of intracellular P450 remained in the Fe(II) form after vigorous aeration of cells. The addition of substrates increased the proportion of Fe(II) heme, suggesting a kinetic gate to heme reduction in the absence of substrate. In summary, these observations suggest that the resting state of P450s should be regarded as a mixture of Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms in both aerobic and oxygen-limited conditions.

The heme-thiolate enzymes in the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily carry out an unequalled variety of functions by virtue of the chemistry effected at the heme center and the evolutionary versatility of the P450 fold. More than 12,000 different forms are currently known (48Nelson D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the vast majority of which are believed to share a common catalytic mechanism. Most P450s act as monooxygenases, requiring one or more redox partners to transfer electrons from a pyridine-containing coenzyme. Monooxygenation consumes 1 equivalent each of molecular oxygen and NAD(P)H, with the production of 1 equivalent of water in the typical reaction. By this general reaction, a number of common (aliphatic and aromatic C-hydroxylation, heteroatom dealkylation and oxidation) and uncommon (group migration, C–C bond cleavage, ring expansion and contraction, phenolic coupling) reactions are mediated (1Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 2Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 5Luthra A. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem.

Bischoff R. Bruins A.P. Permentier H.P. Curr. Drug Metab. 2011; 12: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the first step is substrate binding to the oxidized ferric heme resting form of the enzyme, with conversion of the iron from low to high spin and concurrent loss of a water ligand (step 1). Results from the prototypical bacterial form, CYP101A1 (P450cam), suggest that substrate binding potentiates the subsequent single electron transfer from the cognate redox partner to the heme (step 2). This generates the ferrous form, and rapid coordination of dioxygen follows (step 3), setting in motion steps 4–8. Uncoupling side reactions, i.e. the consumption of electrons and oxygen without substrate oxidation, can occur at three steps (Fig. 1). The observation that substrate binding to the ferric form accelerates delivery of the first electron has led to the proposal that the cycle is thermodynamically gated at the first reduction step in the absence of substrate (4Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 8Backes W.L. Sligar S.G. Schenkman J.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to protect the cell from the release of damaging reactive oxygen species. This conventional view of the catalytic cycle, although drawn primarily from experiments with soluble P450s that are easily studied, such as CYP101A1, has also been applied to other systems (9Das A. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 13778-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, evidence has steadily accumulated that contradicts aspects of this model. In particular, for P450s involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics that typically show relatively poor affinity for their substrates, reduction of the ferric P450 appears to proceed to a greater or lesser extent in the absence of a substrate (10Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). First electron transfer is not necessarily accelerated by substrate binding and depends to some degree on the environment of the enzyme (10Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Additionally, substrate binding to these forms does not necessarily induce the displacement of the water ligand to the heme, leading to a spin state shift. The resting state of P450s is typically portrayed as the ferric form in representations and descriptions of the P450 catalytic cycle (5Luthra A. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 507: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Kumar D. Altun A. Shaikh S. Thiel W. Faraday Discuss. 2011; 148: 373-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nouri-Nigjeh E.

Rev. 2010; 110: 949-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no experimental evidence exists that addresses the in vivo oxidation state of P450s. However, the reduction of P450s in vitro in the absence of substrate suggests that P450s may exist in both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms within the cell. The heme chromophore provides a convenient reporter of the redox state of the enzyme within the cell. The peak at ∼450 nm in the ferrous-CO versus ferrous difference spectrum differentiates P450s and a small number of other heme-thiolate proteins from other hemoproteins (15Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1375-1376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral characterization of P450s has typically been performed on P450s after extraction from the normal intracellular environment. However, sensitive methodology for quantifying P450s within intact bacterial cells (16Otey C.R. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 230.

Screen. 2008; 13: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) now provides a system for investigating the physiological redox state of P450s in whole cells. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that P450s are partially reduced in their resting state within the intact cell and to explore the role of substrate and cellular redox state in regulating the redox state of the heme in P450s from both bacterial and mammalian sources. Culture media were obtained from BD Biosciences (North Ryde, Australia).

Starter cultures prepared from single isolated colonies were used to inoculate 100-μl cultures in 96-well flat-bottomed microplates or 1-ml cultures in 24-well plates. Cultures were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and arabinose at 5 h to initiate expression, and then microplates were sealed (microaerobic cultures) with Breathe-Easy gas-permeable membranes (Diversified Biotech, Boston, MA) or covered with the microplate lid (aerobic cultures) and incubated at 25 °C for a further 67 h before harvest unless stated otherwise. The P450 contents of bacterial cells were quantified by Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectroscopy as described previously (17Johnston W.A. Huang W. De Voss J.J. Hayes M.A. Gillam E.M. J. Biomol. Screen. 2008; 13: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were resuspended in 0.5 volume of whole cell assay buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm D-glucose, pH 7.4) prior to spectral analysis. Unless otherwise stated, spectral measurements were performed on resuspensions that had been left unstirred for 30–60 min. For measurement of total P450 concentrations, freshly prepared sodium dithionite was added to 10 mg/ml, and cells were incubated for 90 min without agitation to reduce the total P450 pool (dithionite reducing treatment). Dithionite was omitted for measurement of endogenously reduced P450. Following a 5-s mix to resuspend cells, a baseline spectrum was recorded at 2 nm intervals from 400–500 nm in a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader. Resuspensions were then gassed with CO for 5 min at 1 atm prior to measurement of Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectra. Other conditions were as indicated in the results for individual experiments. Cryopreserved rat hepatocytes were thawed according to procedures recommended by the supplier and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 750 mm NaCl; 2.5 × 106 cells/ml). Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectra were obtained on undiluted resuspensions as described above. For ligand binding spectra, 10 μm nBIC, cineole, or D-camphor was added to bacterial cultures prepared as described above. Difference spectra were obtained with reference to baseline spectra recorded on the same samples prior to the addition of ligand. For some experiments, cells were either reduced by the addition of 10 mg/ml freshly prepared sodium dithionite in whole cell assay buffer (reducing treatment) or oxidized by vigorous agitation in air in a VorTemp mixer for 10 min at 1000 rpm in the presence of 10 mg/ml freshly prepared sodium dithionite (oxidizing treatment). Difference spectroscopy was performed on purified bacterial P450s and isolated bacterial membranes containing recombinant P450s to investigate the presence of endogenous ligands. Bacterial membranes containing recombinant human P450s were prepared using established methods (22Gillam E.M. Baba T. Kim B.R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Ligand binding spectra were obtained using purified CYP101A1 (9 μm), purified CYP176A1 (10 μm), or bacterial membranes containing 0.5 μm recombinant human P450s, incubated with and without a 5-fold dilution of E. coli cell lysate, that had been prepared from a 10-ml culture of E. coli transformed with the empty expression vector pCW, lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker BioSpin ELEXSYS E580 EPR spectrometer fitted with a super high Q-cavity. Magnetic field and microwave frequency calibration were achieved with a Bruker BioSpin ER 036M teslameter and a Bruker BioSpin microwave frequency counter, respectively. Temperatures (8.00 ± 0.02 K) were controlled using a flow-through cryostat (ESR910) in conjunction with an Oxford ITC503 temperature controller. Spectrometer tuning, signal averaging, and subsequent spectral comparisons were performed with the Xepr (version 2.6) software from Bruker BioSpin. Microaerobic cultures of cells expressing CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 were prepared as described above and harvested at 72 h. Half of each culture was added immediately to a Wilmad 707-SQ EPR sample tube and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (“native” sample). An identical aliquot was incubated with sodium dithionite (10 mg/ml final concentration) in a microplate and subjected to a 10-min agitation at 1000 rpm in a VorTemp microplate shaker in air prior to freezing in the sample tube (“oxidized” sample). All samples were briefly degassed with argon to remove dissolved oxygen and oxygen present above the frozen sample, to avoid resonances from triplet state oxygen and poor baselines. Identical sample tubes were used to measure the EPR spectra of the native and oxidized whole cell environments, and the sample tubes were placed into an identical position in the liquid helium flow-through quartz assembly within the super high Q-cavity. This was judged by the lack of change in microwave frequency and detector current between sample changes. Background EPR spectra of E. coli cells lacking any P450 were also recorded and subtracted from the experimental EPR spectra of CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 in whole cells to remove signals from other paramagnetic centers (e.g. Cu(II), Mn(II), and high spin rhombic Fe(III)) not associated with P450s. Computer simulation of the EPR spectra was performed using the XSophe-Sophe-XeprView computer simulation software suite (version 1.1.4) running on a PC utilizing Mandriva 2009.1 as the Linux operating system (27Hanson G.R. Gates K.E. Noble C.J. Griffin M. Mitchell A. Benson S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Of the bacterial (CYP101A1 and CYP176A1) and human (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2A13, and CYP3A4) P450s tested in whole cells, all but CYP3A4 showed a significant absorbance peak at 450 nm Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectrum in the absence of exogenous reductant (Fig. 2), indicating naturally present, CO-binding, ferrous P450 (subsequently referred to as endogenously reduced P450). Dithionite reducing treatment increased the peak size to different extents depending upon the P450 form under examination. The dithionite-reducible P450 peak was assumed to represent the total amount of P450 in the cell. The ratio of the peak size observed in the absence to that in the presence of dithionite (reducing treatment) represents the proportion of total P450 that is endogenously reduced within the intact bacterial cell. Coexpression of the cognate electron donors (hCPR for human P450s; putidaredoxin plus putidaredoxin reductase for CYP101A1; or cindoxin plus endogenous E. coli FdR for CYP176A1) in bi- or tricistronic cultures with the respective P450s consistently increased the proportion of endogenously reduced P450 detected by Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectroscopy (Fig. 3). However, this increase was only statistically significant for those forms that were not already mostly endogenously reduced in the monocistronic system (CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP176A1, where the reduction percentage increased from <40% to >80%; Fig. 3). All P450s could be considered predominantly reduced (>80%) in the presence of their cognate redox partners. Coexpression of appropriate redox partners had little effect on total P450 expression levels for the recombinant human forms. However, the yields of the more highly expressed bacterial P450s were significantly decreased (Fig. 3). To characterize better the different redox states of the P450 in whole cells, we exploited a serendipitous observation that vigorous aeration of cells in the presence of dithionite decreased the amount of P450 detected by Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectra (supplemental Fig. S1). We speculate that this results from oxidation of the Fe(II) heme by hydrogen peroxide generated intracellularly as aerobic decomposition of dithionite to generate hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated in solution (28Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dixon M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CYP101A1 cultures treated in this manner (oxidizing treatment) showed an increase in the amplitude of type I ligand binding spectra elicited by the addition of camphor, characteristic of the Fe(III) form, confirming conversion of endogenous Fe(II) P450 to the Fe(III) form by aeration in the presence of dithionite (supplemental Fig. S1). A quantitative assessment of these data is precluded by the fact that the addition of d-camphor for the type I measurement will potentiate reduction of the P450 and turnover of the d-camphor in whole cells. Alkylisocyanides bind to both Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms of P450s, producing visible absorption spectra characteristic of the redox state of the heme. Binding spectra were obtained with nBIC using intact E. coli cells expressing CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 at high concentrations that were (i) reduced with sodium dithionite, (ii) oxidized by vigorous shaking in the presence of sodium dithionite (see above), or (iii) measured after the addition of nBIC alone (native samples) (Fig. 4). Although only a small peak was observed at ∼430 nm in the oxidized samples, characteristic absorbance peaks at ∼455 nm (both enzymes) and ∼430 nm (CYP176A1) were observed in spectra obtained from the reduced and native samples, indicating binding of nBIC to the Fe(II) form (30Tomita T.

The ratio of these peaks differed between the native and reduced spectra for the same P450 form, which is consistent with the pH effect previously observed (30Tomita T. Ogo S. Egawa T. Shimada H.

Chem. 1994; 98: 13300-13307Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No type I ligand binding spectrum could be detected that were indicative of any endogenous ligands in the E. coli cell lysate capable of provoking a low to high spin state change in purified CYP101A1, purified CYP176A1, or any of the recombinant human P450s studied here. Low temperature (8 K) EPR spectra of purified CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 (Fig. 5, A and B) were measured prior to attempting similar measurements on whole cells. Both enzymes displayed resonances (Fig. 5) attributable to low spin Fe(III) species. X-ray crystallographic structures of the resting CYP101A1 have revealed a ruffled porphyrin ring coordinated axially to a cysteine and an aqua ligand, which is hydrogen-bonded in a cluster of another five water molecules in the substrate-binding pocket (32Ebel R.E.

Changing the buffer to HEPES, a non-coordinating buffer, produces a more complicated EPR spectrum (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B) showing a mixture of high spin (geff = 7.77, 3.91, 2.01) and three low spin Fe(III) species. Subtle changes to the low spin Fe(III) resonances (supplemental Fig. S3B) were observed upon the addition of KCl or Tris buffer, which reflect modifications to the water cluster at the active site. In contrast, the EPR spectrum of CYP176A1 shows a single low spin Fe(III) P450 species with g values: g1 = 2.4157, g2 = 2.2450, and g3 = 1.9196 (Fig. 5B, supplemental Fig. S4) (27Hanson G.R. Gates K.E. Noble C.J. Griffin M. Mitchell A. Benson S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Monocistronic cultures of CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 were divided in two with one aliquot snap-frozen immediately and the other identical aliquot subjected to the oxidizing treatment noted above before freezing. A smaller proportion of species B and larger line widths for the native enzyme, species A, were seen in EPR spectra for CYP101A1 from whole cells when compared with the purified enzyme (Fig. 5A). A similar comparison of the EPR spectra for CYP176A1 (Fig. 5B) reveals a small proportion of a second species (low field resonance) in whole cells. A comparison of the EPR spectra for CYP101A1 and CYP176A1 in native and oxidized environments (Fig. 5, A and B) showed a clear increase in the intensity of the resonances in cells subjected to the oxidizing treatment. The lower intensity of the Fe(III) P450 resonances in the native whole cells can be explained by the presence of either low spin (S = 0) Fe(II) hemes that are EPR-silent or high spin (S = 2, D > hν) Fe(II) hemes that are also generally EPR-silent at X-band frequencies. There were no high spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) resonances (g‖ eff = 2.0, g⊥ eff = 6.0) in the whole cell EPR spectra (results not shown), confirming the absence of endogenous ligands. In the current study, Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectra were typically measured on resting cell resuspensions equilibrated in air for at least 30 min (prior to CO binding) and then subjected to a brief 5-s agitation immediately prior to measurement. Such resuspensions are functionally anaerobic due to the consumption of oxygen via bacterial respiration. Measured pO2 values for such stagnant resuspensions dropped to <0.1% air saturation within 3 min after aeration to 100% air saturation, measured with a Clark type polarographic electrode. No pulse in pO2 was observed by very brief agitations in air for resuspension as above. This premise was further verified by incubating CYP176A1 (previously equilibrated in air) under an argon atmosphere for up to 1 h before recording Fe(II)-CO versus Fe(II) difference spectra. The amount of endogenously reduced CYP176A1 did not change significantly when oxygen was totally excluded prior to measurement, although there was a very slight trend toward an increase in endogenously reduced P450 (55 ± 4% endogenously reduced P450 after 60 min under argon when compared with 47 ± 9% prior to argon incubation; mean ± S.D., n = 3; 72-h microaerobic cultures). We tested whether the observation of endogenously reduced P450 was an artifact of low oxygen tension in bacterial cult"

ERAD-L is N-glycan-dependent and is characterized by ER mannosidase (Mns1p) and ER mannosidase-like protein (Mnl1p), which generate Man7GlcNAc2 (d1) N-glycans with non-reducing α1,6-mannosyl residues. Glycoproteins bearing this motif bind Yos9p and are dislocated into the cytoplasm and then deglycosylated by peptide N-glycanase (Png1p) to yield free oligosaccharides (fOS). Here, we examined yeast fOS metabolism as a function of cell growth in order to obtain quantitative and mechanistic insights into ERAD. We demonstrate that both Png1p-dependent generation of Man7–10GlcNAc2 fOS and vacuolar α-mannosidase (Ams1p)-dependent fOS demannosylation to yield Man1GlcNAc2 are strikingly up-regulated during post-diauxic growth which occurs when the culture medium is depleted of glucose. Gene deletions in the ams1Δ background revealed that, as anticipated, Mns1p and Mnl1p are required for efficient generation of the Man7GlcNAc2 (d1) fOS, but for the first time, we demonstrate that small amounts of this fOS are generated in an Mnl1p-independent, Mns1p-dependent pathway and that a Man8GlcNAc2 fOS that is known to bind Yos9p is generated in an Mnl1p-dependent, Mns1p-independent manner. This latter observation adds mechanistic insight into a recently described Mnl1p-dependent, Mns1p-independent ERAD pathway. Finally, we show that 50% of fOS generation is independent of ERAD-L, and because our data indicate that ERAD-M and ERAD-C contribute little to fOS levels, other important processes underlie fOS generation in S. cerevisiae.

In the case of the disposal of glycoproteins whose misfolded domains are in the lumen of the ER (ERAD-L), prolonged folding reactions favor N-glycan demannosylation leading to the generation of a glycan signal for degradation. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initial experiments demonstrated that ER mannosidase I (Mns1p), through the generation of a specific Man8GlcNAc2 N-glycan (M8(d1,d3); see Fig. 1A), and the Mns1p homolog, Mnl1p (previously known as Htm1p), were required for ERAD of certain substrates (3Jakob C.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and because the latter protein was thought to have no hydrolytic activity, it was proposed to act as a lectin that could target ERAD substrates carrying M8(d1,d3)-N-glycans to the degradation machinery (3Jakob C.A.

More recently, the combined actions of Mns1p and Mnl1p are thought to generate a Man7GlcNAc2 N-glycan whose structure possesses a terminal non-reducing α1,6-linked mannose residue (M7(d1); see Fig. 1A) (5Quan E.M.

However, this structure, also possessing an exposed α1,6-linked mannose residue (6Clerc S. Hirsch C. Oggier D.M. Deprez P. Jakob C. Sommer T. Aebi M. J.

Many components of the degradation machinery required for disposal of ERAD-L substrates are common with those required for the degradation of ER membrane proteins with misfolded membrane domains (ERAD-M) and ER membrane proteins with misfolded cytoplasmic domains (ERAD-C) (15Carvalho P.

By contrast, whereas Doa10p is specific to the ERAD-C E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, the ER-associated degradation components, Der1p and Hrd1p, are common to both ERAD-L and -M E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (15Carvalho P.

Png1p-mediated deglycosylation of glycoproteins yields free oligosaccharides (fOS), and an examination of the quantities and structures of these compounds could potentially aid in the understanding of the mechanisms and relative importance of different yeast glycoprotein degradation pathways. Metabolic radiolabeling studies demonstrated that 70–80% of S. cerevisiae [3H]fOS are generated by Png1p (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chantret I. Moore S.E. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 210-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that Ams1p, the vacuolar mannosidase, degrades these compounds (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ams1Δ strain, although the major [3H]fOS is Mns1p-generated [3H]Man8GlcNAc2(d1,d3), small amounts of a [3H]Man7GlcNAc2-like structure, not detected on 3H-glycoproteins, are generated (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent quantitative and structural data on fOS at steady state in ams1Δ cells confirmed the preponderance of the M8(d1,d3) fOS and identified the Man7GlcNAc2 structure as M7(d1) (21Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12390-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the ams1Δmns1Δ deletion mutant, whereas [3H]Man9GlcNAc2 was found to be the predominant fOS, a [3H]Man8GlcNAc2 compound different from M8(d1,d3) was identified (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is presently unknown whether or not this compound corresponds to the M8(d1,d2), Yos9p-interacting structure thought to be required for the Mns1p-independent, Mnl1p-dependent ERAD-L pathway described above (Fig. 1) (6Clerc S. Hirsch C. Oggier D.M. Deprez P. Jakob C. Sommer T. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Hosomi A. Tanabe K. Hirayama H. Kim I. Rao H. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24324-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ensemble of these data is compatible with the idea that only a fraction of fOS manifest ERAD-L-associated trimming (Fig. 1A). It would appear that over one-half of Png1p-generated fOS have structures not attributable to ERAD-L, which points to important roles for ERAD-M and/or ERAD-C or other yeast glycoprotein catabolic processes. In some cases, ERAD involves retrieval of misfolded glycoproteins from the Golgi apparatus, and this is confirmed by the identification of fOS whose structures indicate modification by mannosyltransferases, such as Och1p (see Fig. 1B), known to reside in this compartment (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chantret I. Moore S.E. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 210-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12390-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Presently, it is not known whether or not the α1,6-linked mannose residue (termed the d4 mannose) transferred by Och1p can confer Yos9p binding activity to oligosaccharides (see Fig. 1B). Attempting to correlate fOS generation with ERAD processes is further complicated by the fact that whereas the latter processes are studied uniquely in rapidly dividing, exponential cultures, Png1p and Ams1p are up-regulated during post-diauxic growth after cells have depleted glucose from the growth medium. Peptide N-glycanase activity is difficult to detect in exponentially growing yeast and increases during post-diauxic growth (22Suzuki T. Park H. Kitajima K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21526-21530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Png1p abundance is higher in stationary cells than in exponentially growing cells (23Davidson G.S. Joe R.M. Roy S. Meirelles O. Allen C.P. Wilson M.R. Tapia P.H. Manzanilla E.E. Dodson A.E. Chakraborty S. Carter M. Young S. Edwards B. Sklar L. Werner-Washburne M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 988-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likewise, Ams1p-dependent p-nitrophenyl-Man hydrolyzing activity is low in exponential yeast cultures and increases during post-diauxic growth (24Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During metabolic radiolabeling studies, [3H]fOS demannosylation parallels the increase in expression of Ams1p-dependent p-nitrophenyl-mannose hydrolysis activity (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent studies on the steady state levels of fOS in S. cerevisiae demonstrate little increase in either the quantity or demannosylation of fOS even in stationary cells (21Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12390-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying fOS metabolism in S. cerevisiae, fOS derived from exponential, post-diauxic, and stationary phase wild type cells and various deletion mutants were quantitated and characterized by HPLC, glycosidase digestion, and mass spectrometry. For the first time, we show that Ams1p-dependent fOS demannosylation increases during post-diauxic growth and that the trisaccharide Man1GlcNAc2 is the limit digest product of fOS demannosylation in stationary yeast cultures. The trisaccharide level in stationary cells was largely Png1p-dependent, did not depend upon vacuolar acidification, could be maximally reduced by only one-half in cells deficient in ERAD-L and/or ERAD-M, and was unaffected in ERAD-C-deficient cells. During post-diauxic growth, fOS levels increase, and when fOS generation was examined in ams1Δ cells, a 7-fold increase in M7(d1) was noted during this period, whereas other fOS increased to a lesser extent. We show for the first time that although Mnl1p and Mns1p are required for efficient generation of the fOS M7(d1), Mnl1p promotes the appearance of the fOS M8(d1,d2) in the absence of Mns1p, and Mns1p can promote the formation of the M7(d1) fOS in the absence of Mnl1p. Accordingly, our data demonstrate that, in yeast, metabolism of Png1p-dependent fOS is regulated by complex growth-dependent processes. Our data confirm the N-glycan trimming pathways presented in Fig. 1A. Other data indicate Yos9p-dependent and Mns1p- and Mnl1p-independent fOS generation. Although a fOS possessing the Och1p-dependent d4 mannose residue as its sole terminal non-reducing α1,6-mannosyl motif was found to be highly regulated by Yos9p, our data cannot distinguish between lectin-dependent and lectin-independent roles for Yos9p during ERAD.

As indicated in Table 1, the single, double, or triple deletion mutants were created following a PCR-based targeted gene replacement strategy as described previously (25Petracek M.E. Longtine M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were then transformed using lithium acetate, and transformants were isolated after growth on solid selective medium. The disruption of the target gene was confirmed by PCR analysis with oligonucleotides flanking the region of insertion of the auxotrophic marker. For each deletion mutant, at least two independent clones were generated and analyzed. Culture of transformants was performed in liquid selective medium for at least 20 generations before seeding in YPG medium. Exponentially growing yeast were metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose as described previously (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were extracted as described previously (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 150–400 A600 units of cells (volume of cells recovered (ml) × A600) were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and transferred into 50-ml polypropylene tubes. The cell pellets were frozen and thawed before adding one volume of glass beads and one volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 4 mm MgCl2. In some experiments, 5 × 10−3 cpm of [2-3H]Man8GlcNAc2 was added to cell pellets as an internal standard. This radioactive compound was purified by HPLC after liberation, by mild acid hydrolysis, from dolichol-linked oligosaccharide obtained from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cells that were metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose as described previously (26Peric D. Durrant-Arico C. Delenda C. Dupré T. De Lonlay P. de Baulny H.O. Pelatan C. Bader-Meunier B. Danos O. Chantret I. Moore S.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5e11675Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted using six 30-s bursts on a Vortex mixer at 4 °C. MeOH and CHCl3 were added to yield a 3:2:1 mixture of CHCl3, MeOH, and buffer, respectively. The mixtures were vigorously shaken at room temperature. After centrifugation, the lower (CHCl3) and upper (methanolic) phases were removed and kept. The interphase proteins were re-extracted with the same volume of solvents, and the newly obtained phases were removed and pooled with the previous phases. Neutral fOS were recovered from the upper phase as described previously (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this phase was dried and dissolved in water, and after desalting on AG-1/AG-50 columns, the unbound neutral material was loaded onto charcoal columns. After washing these columns with water, the neutral fOS were eluted with 30% ethanol. For mass spectrometry, 5 liters of YPD were seeded at 0.1 A600/ml with either ams1Δ or ams1Δmns1Δ cells. After 24-h growth, the cells were harvested and extracted as described above in 10 batches. For analytical HPLC, fOS mixtures were derivatized with AP as described previously (27Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and derivatized fOS were separated from excess reagents on columns of Biogel P2 (28Moore S.E. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fOS-AP mixtures were resolved by HPLC using an amine-bonded silica column (LiChrospher Amino 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Sulpelco Inc.) and detected with a Jasco FP-2020 Plus fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength 310 nm, emission wavelength 380 nm) as described previously (29Chantret I. Fasseu M. Zaoui K. Le Bizec C. Yayé H.S. Dupré T. Moore S.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5e11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The isomers of Man8GlcNAc2 were separated using reverse phase HPLC as their Man8GlcNAc-AP derivatives as described previously (28Moore S.E. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A. saitoi α1,2-mannosidase incubations contained 0.5 milliunits of enzyme in a total volume of 20 μl of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Digestion was carried out for 2 days at 37 °C. H. pomatia β-mannosidase digestions were carried out for 16 h at 25 °C in 35 μl of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 30 milliunits of enzyme. Oligosaccharides were also treated with 0.4 units of jack bean α-mannosidase in 20 μl of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 16 h. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded in positive ion mode with a Shimadzu-Biotech AXIMA TOF2 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Biotech, Manchester, UK). Samples were prepared by spotting 0.5 μl of an aqueous solution of the glycans onto the target plate together with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg) in water (0.5 μl) and acetonitrile (0.5 μl)). The mixture was allowed to dry under ambient conditions, followed by recrystallization from ethanol. Negative ion electrospray spectra and collision-induced dissociation were obtained with a Waters Q-TOF (version 1) mass spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK) using Proxeon nanoelectrospray capillaries (Proxeon Biosystems (now part of Thermo-Fisher Scientific), Odense, Denmark) for sample introduction. Samples were dissolved in water/MeOH (1:1, v/v) containing 0.5 mm ammonium nitrate (the ammonium nitrate was to form stable [M + NO3]− ions to assist fragmentation). The mass spectrometer ion source was maintained at 120 °C, the voltage on the capillary was 1.1 kV, and fragmentation was performed by argon collisions in the collision cell, which was operated at a voltage appropriate to the glycan mass. Spectral acquisition and processing was performed with MassLynx version 4.0. First, we examined yeast fOS steady state levels during yeast growth because both Png1p and Ams1p, the enzymes responsible for the production and processing of fOS, respectively, are known to be regulated in a growth-dependent manner. Under standard laboratory conditions, a wild type yeast population doubles about every 90 min (exponential culture) until the glucose required for fermentation is consumed (30Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Microbiol Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). At this time (diauxic shift), there is an inflection in the growth curve, and thereafter, slow post-diauxic growth occurs, during which time yeast metabolizes non-fermentable carbon sources. When there is no further increase in cell number, the yeast culture is said to have reached the stationary phase, and under standard laboratory conditions, this occurs after about 6 days (30Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Microbiol Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Peptide N-glycanase activity is difficult to detect in exponentially growing yeast and increases during post-diauxic growth (22Suzuki T. Park H. Kitajima K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21526-21530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Likewise, during metabolic radiolabeling studies, [3H]fOS demannosylation parallels the increase in expression of Ams1p-dependent p-nitrophenyl-mannose hydrolysis activity (19Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is known to be growth-dependent (24Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, more recent studies on the steady state levels of fOS in S. cerevisiae demonstrate little demannosylation of fOS, even in stationary cells (21Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12390-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In order to explore these issues, fOS generation and processing were examined during the different growth phases of S. cerevisiae. In exponentially growing (5-h cultures) wild type yeast, several pools of oligosaccharide were detected. One pool comprised structures (Fig. 2A, top, peaks a–e) that were sensitive to an amyloglucosidase preparation from Rhizopus mold 3I. Chantret and S. E. H. Moore, unpublished data. and occurred in png1Δ (Fig. 2A, top, red trace) and ams1Δ (Fig. 2A, top, green trace) deletion mutants as well as in the wild type strain (Fig. 2A, top, blue trace). Although amyloglucosidase cleaves α1,3-, α1,4-, and α1,6-glucose residues, it is possible that peaks a–e do not correspond to oligomers of α-linked glucose but rather correspond to β-glucans previously described to occur in yeast (Glc3–15 (21Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12390-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) because the amyloglucosidase preparation used in our studies is probably contaminated with β-glucanase (31Kennedy L.D. Court C.B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Another oligosaccharide pool was noted in both wild type and ams1Δ cells but occurred in strikingly reduced amounts in the in png1Δ deletion mutant (Fig. 2A, top). The retention times of the predominant Png1p-dependent oligosaccharides correspond to [3H]Man9–7"
https://openalex.org/W2035356953,"The understanding of host-parasite systems in wildlife is of increasing interest in relation to the risk of emerging diseases in livestock and humans. In this respect, many efforts have been dedicated to controlling classical swine fever (CSF) in the European Wild Boar. But CSF eradication has not always been achieved even though vaccination has been implemented at a large-scale. Piglets have been assumed to be the main cause of CSF persistence in the wild since they appeared to be more often infected and less often immune than older animals. However, this assumption emerged from laboratory trials or cross-sectional surveys based on the hunting bags.In the present paper we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study in free-ranging wild boar piglets that experienced both CSF infection and vaccination under natural conditions. We used multi-state capture recapture models to estimate the immunization and infection rates, and their variations according to the periods with or without vaccination. According to the model prediction, 80% of the infected piglets did not survive more than two weeks, while the other 20% quickly recovered. The probability of becoming immune did not increase significantly during the summer vaccination sessions, and the proportion of immune piglets was not higher after the autumn vaccination.Given the high lethality of CSF in piglets highlighted in our study, we consider unlikely that piglets could maintain the chain of CSF virus transmission. Our study also revealed the low efficacy of vaccination in piglets in summer and autumn, possibly due to the low palatability of baits to that age class, but also to the competition between baits and alternative food sources. Based on this new information, we discuss the prospects for the improvement of CSF control and the interest of the capture-recapture approach for improving the understanding of wildlife diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2029659908,"Quiescent endothelial cells contain low concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2). However, its synthesis can be rapidly stimulated by a variety of inflammatory mediators. In this study, we provide evidence that PAI-2 interacts with proteasome and affects its activity in endothelial cells. To ensure that the PAI-2·proteasome complex is formed in vivo, both proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cells and identified with specific antibodies. The specificity of this interaction was evidenced after (a) transfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-2 and coimmunoprecipitation of both proteins with anti-PAI-2 antibodies and (b) silencing of the PAI-2 gene using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Subsequently, cellular distribution of the PAI-2·proteasome complexes was established by immunogold staining and electron microscopy analyses. As judged by confocal microscopy, both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but they also could be found in a dense perinuclear and nuclear location. PAI-2 was not polyubiquitinated, suggesting that it bound to proteasome not as the substrate but rather as its inhibitor. Consistently, increased PAI-2 expression (a) abrogated degradation of degron analyzed after cotransfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-PAI-2 and pd2EGFP-N1, (b) prevented degradation of p53, as evidenced both by confocal microscopy and Western immunoblotting, and (c) inhibited proteasome cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrate. This suggests that PAI-2, in endothelial cells induced with inflammatory stimuli, can inhibit proteasome and thus tilt the balance favoring proapoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2077285167,"Many studies have provided evidence for the existence of universal constraints on color categorization or naming in various languages, but the biological basis of these constraints is unknown. A recent study of the pattern of color categorization across numerous languages has suggested that these patterns tend to avoid straddling a region in color space at or near the border between the English composite categories of “warm” and “cool”. This fault line in color space represents a fundamental constraint on color naming. Here we report that the two-way categorization along the fault line is correlated with the sign of the L- versus M-cone contrast of a stimulus color. Moreover, we found that the sign of the L-M cone contrast also accounted for the two-way clustering of the spatially distributed neural responses in small regions of the macaque primary visual cortex, visualized with optical imaging. These small regions correspond to the hue maps, where our previous study found a spatially organized representation of stimulus hue. Altogether, these results establish a direct link between a universal constraint on color naming and the cone-specific information that is represented in the primate early visual system."
https://openalex.org/W2087450725,"Analysis of in vivo chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter of yeast led to the conclusion that remodeling removes nucleosomes from the promoter by disassembly rather than sliding away from the promoter. The catalytic activities required for nucleosome disassembly remain unknown. Transcriptional activation of the yeast PHO8 gene was found to depend on the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF, whereas activation of PHO5 was not. Here, we show that PHO8 gene circles formed in vivo lose nucleosomes upon PHO8 induction, indicative of nucleosome removal by disassembly. Our quantitative analysis of expression noise and chromatin-remodeling data indicates that the dynamics of continual nucleosome removal and reformation at the activated promoters of PHO5 and PHO8 are closely similar. In contrast to PHO5, however, activator-stimulated transcription of PHO8 appears to be limited mostly to the acceleration of promoter nucleosome disassembly with little or no acceleration of promoter transitions following nucleosome disassembly, accounting for the markedly lower expression level of PHO8.

Transcription therefore requires changes in the structure of nucleosomes that occupy essential promoter sequences. The isolation of enzymes that can break and reform histone-DNA interactions in an ATP-dependent manner provided a first answer to the question of how cells overcome nucleosomal inhibition (6Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of chromatin remodelers to couple ATP hydrolysis to the sliding of nucleosomes along the DNA (7Längst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Cairns B.R. White M.F. Workman J.L. Owen-Hughes T.

Although the activity of some remodelers appears to be limited to sliding, others, including SWI/SNF and its close relative RSC, were also found to catalyze the transition of mononucleosomes into a persistently altered state with increased DNA accessibility but without loss of histones (10Côté J.

Extensive structural analysis of in vivo chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which undergoes a major transition in chromatin structure upon PHO5 induction (17Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), suggested that remodeling results in loss of promoter nucleosomes. Loss was inferred from complementary quantitative results of limiting nuclease digestion analysis and topology measurements (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Conforming with the loss hypothesis, regions occupied by nucleosomes under repressing conditions sedimented like naked DNA in a density gradient after release from the activated promoter by restriction endonuclease digestion, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that fewer histones were bound to the activated promoter than the repressed one (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Chromatin circles formed in vivo were seen to lose nucleosomes under conditions that activate PHO5 when encompassing the PHO5 promoter, demonstrating the ability of the cell to catalyze nucleosome disassembly and suggesting that loss of promoter nucleosomes at the chromosomal PHO5 locus is due to disassembly rather than sliding of nucleosomes away from the promoter (20Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 667-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The SWI/SNF complex has been implicated in histone eviction from promoter elements in vivo (21Gkikopoulos T. Havas K.M. Dewar H. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4057-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Schwabish M.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6987-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whether SWI/SNF-dependent eviction occurred by disassembly or sliding of nucleosomes is unknown. Deletion of SNF2, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, was found to affect expression and promoter chromatin remodeling of PHO5 only marginally. Defects in PHO5 expression have been reported in the absence of other remodelers, but none of them alone proved to be essential for PHO5 activation (24Barbaric S. Luckenbach T. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Hörz W. Korber P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27610-27621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Ehrensberger A.H. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities that promote nucleosome disassembly in vivo remain to be determined. In contrast, activated expression of the PHO8 gene of yeast, although induced by the same signaling pathway and transcriptional activator as PHO5, has been shown to be dependent on SNF2 (27Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Münsterkötter M. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6407-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The structural nature of remodeled chromatin at the PHO8 promoter and the question of whether nucleosome loss occurs by disassembly rather than sliding are, therefore, of particular interest. It has been argued previously that loss of nucleosomes from the PHO8 promoter was due to disassembly rather than sliding because expression and chromatin remodeling of PHO8 were found to require the histone chaperone Asf1 (28Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which earlier had been implicated in replication-dependent nucleosome assembly (29Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This argument implicitly assumed that Asf1 facilitates nucleosome disassembly. However, independent evidence to support this assumption has not been presented, and subsequent biochemical tests failed to provide such evidence (16Lorch Y. Maier-Davis B. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3090-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed the question of whether nucleosomes are removed from the induced PHO8 promoter by disassembly rather than sliding. Our findings are consistent with removal of nucleosomes by disassembly, but not sliding. We observed that Snf2 was essential for disassembly of promoter nucleosomes at PHO8. Together with recent biochemical analyses, our findings support the notion that SWI/SNF catalyzes nucleosome disassembly in vivo. For a complete list of strains used in this study, see supplemental Table 1. The PHO8 gene, including 1500 bp upstream of the start codon and 710 bp downstream of the stop codon, was cloned by PCR and inserted into the NotI site of pM47.1 (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J.

Introduction of an NruI site in place of the EcoRI site most proximal to the 5′-end of the PHO8 open reading frame (ORF) yielded plasmid pM77.2. Deletion of a 2.93-kb NruI fragment from plasmid pM77.2, encompassing the PHO8 promoter and ORF, and its replacement with a 1.1-kb fragment bearing the URA3 gene generated plasmid pM78.5. The PHO8 gene circle plasmid pM79.44 was constructed in a way similar to that for the PHO5 gene circle plasmid (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol.

The PHO8 promoter circle plasmid pCM110.1 was derived from pM75.2 and pM82.1 by inserting the downstream RS element and LexA cluster into the SacI site 56 bp downstream of the start codon.

The pho4 deletion strain yM59.20 was generated by replacing PHO4 with URA3. Strain yM120.2 was generated from strain yM54.9 by replacing PHO4 with URA3 from plasmid pCM4.5. The PHO4 activation domain mutation strains were derived from strain yM120.2 as described previously (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PHO8 promoter circle strain yC104.34 was derived from strain yM52.2 by replacing pho8::URA3 with a pho8 promoter circle from plasmid pCM110.1. Strain yC192.1 was generated from yC104.34 by replacing PHO4 with URA3 using plasmid pCM4.5. Strain yE22.1 was generated by replacing the PHO5p:CFP cassette in strain yE2.1 with URA3. Exchanging LEU2 in the PHO80 locus of yE22.1 with HIS3 generated strain yC57.10. The PHO5 gene circle strain yC59.11 was then generated by replacing URA3 in yC57.10 with the PHO5 gene circle construct using plasmid pM70.1 (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and replacement of PHO4 with URA3 in yC59.11 gave strain yC87.2. PHO8 promoter and CFP ORF sequences were fused at the PHO8 start codon by overlapping PCR (31Ge L. Rudolph P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using plasmids pM75.2 (see above) and 14846 (Addgene) as templates. The PHO8p:CFP fusion was used to replace a 2.3-kb EcoRV-SalI fragment in pM75.2 bearing the PHO8 gene, including its promoter, except for the last 3′-terminal 238 bp of the ORF, generating plasmid pJL2.2. Plasmid pJL3.4, which bears the fusion between the PHO8 promoter and YFP ORF, was constructed analogously. YFP ORF sequences were amplified by PCR from plasmid 14840 (Addgene). The wild-type PHO5 gene was restored in strains yC56.11 and yC57.10 (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using plasmid pM50.1 (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) to generate strains yJL5.7 and yJL4.4, respectively. The PHO8 gene in these two strains was then replaced with URA3 using plasmid pM78.5 to generate strains yJL7.4 and yJL6.4. Strains yJL8.1 and yJL9.1 were then derived from yJL6.4 and yJL7.4 by homologous recombination with plasmids pJL2.2 and pJL3.4, respectively, replacing pho8::URA3 with PHO8p:CFP and PHO8p:YFP. Strain yJL12.1 was generated from strain yJL9.1 by knocking out PHO4 with URA3 using plasmid pCM4.5. The diploid strain yJL10.1 was generated by mating yJL8.1 and yJL9.1. An asf1::KanMX knock-out cassette was amplified from a heterozygous diploid (GSA-6 Heterodiploid Knock-out Collection, ATCC) using primers 5′-AATGCTGTTTTATTCCGTTCTTACA-3′ and 5′-GATTTTTATTCCAACATGTTCGTTC-3′. The appropriate band was purified and used to transform PHO8 and PHO5 gene circle strains yM53.78, yM54.9, and yC58.8, yC59.11, yC72.1, and yC87.2, respectively, creating strains CBY11.4, CBY12.1, and yC117.1, yC118.1, yC119.1, and yC120.1, respectively. A snf2::KanMX knock-out cassette was amplified from a heterozygous diploid (GSA-6 Heterodiploid Knock-out Collection, ATCC) using primers 5′-TTAATTCCAATACATTCGCCACTAT-3′ and 5′-CAAGAACAAGTTCACTATGATGACG-3′. The appropriate band was purified and used to transform PHO8 gene circle strains yM53.78, yM54.9, and yM59.20, creating strains CBY14.5, CBY15.5, and CBY16.1, respectively. The snf2::KanMX knock-out cassette was also used to transform PHO5 gene circle strains yM63.19 and yM19.2 (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), creating strains yC45.3 and yC44-1, respectively. A SNF2 expression plasmid, pSR127 (kindly supplied by Fred Winston, Harvard University), was used to transform strains CBY14.5, CBY15.5, and CBY16.1, creating strains CBY14.5P, CBY15.5P, and CBY16.1P, respectively. All yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method. Strains yM53.78 and yM54.9 were grown overnight in 500 ml of 2×SCR-L medium to a density of 3 × 107 cells/ml. Upon reaching this density, 50 ml of each culture was removed and placed into a new flask, to which 5 ml of 20% galactose was added to induce PHO8 gene circle formation. These smaller cultures were allowed to incubate for an extra 1.5 h in the presence of 2% galactose, after which topoisomers were isolated as described previously (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from the remaining 450-ml cultures as described previously (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 32Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Frozen nuclei pellets were resuspended in micrococcal nuclease (MNase; Sigma) buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and divided into 5 equal volumes to be digested with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 units of MNase for 20 min at 37 °C. Undigested (0 unit) samples were subsequently digested with either ApaLI and HaeIII (yM53.78) or EcoRV and XhoI (yM53.78 and yM54.9) to cut out a 941-bp or 930-bp fragment of the PHO5 or PHO8 promoter, respectively. MNase-digested samples and cut promoter fragments were run on a 1% agarose gel and prepared for Southern blotting. Blots were first probed with a 690-bp PHO8 probe spanning the four putative promoter nucleosome positions (27Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Münsterkötter M. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6407-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Primers used to generate the PHO8 promoter probe were P164 5′-TCAAGAATGGCACTATAAGTGTGG-3′ and P165 5′-GCTAATGCGCGTTCAAATAATGTC-3′. Blots were stripped and rehybridized with a 690-bp PHO5 probe spanning PHO5 promoter nucleosomes N-1 to N-4 (33Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Hörz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Primers used to generate the PHO5 promoter probe were P232 5′-GGTCCGCTCCTTCTAATAATCG-3′ and P15 5′-TGGTAATCTCGAATTTGCTTG-3′. The signal from the EcoRV/XhoI-digested PHO8 promoter (yM53.78) probed with P164/P165 was compared with the ApaLI/HaeIII-digested PHO5 promoter (yM53.78) probed with P232/P15 to normalize the signal intensity of the two different probes. MNase profiles for yM53.78 were used to generate a limiting value to compare the absolute number of nucleosomes on the PHO8- and PHO5-repressed promoters (PHO8 probe signal/PHO5 probe signal). To determine the number of nucleosomes remaining on the activated PHO8 promoter we first normalized the PHO8 promoter signal from yM53.78 and yM54.9 (using the EcoRV/XhoI-digested promoter samples from strains yM53.78 and yM54.9) prior to taking the yM53.78/yM54.9 signal ratio. Analysis of topoisomer distributions was performed as described previously (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 34Depew D.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). PHO8 and PHO5 gene and promoter circle strains all bore a mutated TATA box. Phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (5Mao C. Brown C.R. Griesenbeck J. Boeger H. PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17521Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PHO5 and PHO8 promoter-controlled YFP expression was measured in live haploid cells by flow cytometry (BD Influx, BD Biosciences). The YFP proteins were excited by an air-cooled Solid State “Sapphire” (Coherent), 200-mW, 488-nm laser. The level of expression for each strain was referenced to strain PHO5A (yE1.1) (PHO4 pho80Δ), which was always analyzed in parallel. The level of yE1.1 expression was set to 100%. Strain yE3.1 (pho4Δ pho80Δ) was employed as a negative control to measure the level of autofluorescence and set to 0% level of expression. The YFP fluorescence was collected in the 531/40-nm channel. For the expression analysis, cells were grown in SCD medium. Data from 100,000 cells were collected for each measurement; each sample was remeasured at least four times. No fewer than two independent cell cultures at two different cell density levels were evaluated for each strain. Data from flow cytometry measurements were exported into FSC3.0 files, and data analysis was carried out by FlowJo software (Tree Star). To ensure sufficient data quality, data were analyzed in FSC and SSC channels, and scatters were rejected. Outliers were identified visually in the YFP channel. These procedures reduced the number of cells by 20–25%. Further reduction in cell number by imposing more stringent selection criteria did not significantly change relative expression levels. CFP and YFP expression under control of the PHO8 promoter were measured in single diploid cells by quantitative fluorescence microscopy (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CFP and YFP fluorescence signals for individual cells were divided by the mean CFP and YFP signal, respectively, and plotted in a scatter plot. The intrinsic noise is given by the mean squared distance of points from the diagonal of the plot (coefficient of variation squared). The intrinsic noise was determined from four independent measurements of at least 250 cells each. The variability in intrinsic noise between samples was larger than observed previously for PHO5 (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), consistent with larger variations in expression and topology measurements, too (see below). Predictions of PHO8 expression noise were made using the previously described stochastic model of PHO5 gene expression (30Mao C. Brown C.R. Falkovskaia E. Dong S. Hrabeta-Robinson E. Wenger L. Boeger H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Adjustments are outlined under “Results.” Calculations were performed using Mathematica 7 (Wolfram Research). Transcription of PHO8 and PHO5 is activated upon sequence-specific binding of the transcriptional activator Pho4 at specific promoter elements (35Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Entry of Pho4 into the nucleus is inhibited by the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex Pho80/Pho85. Lack of inorganic phosphate in the medium results in inhibition of the Pho80/Pho85 kinase and translocation of Pho4 into the nucleus. Thus, cells that lack Pho80 activate PHO8 constitutively, whereas cells that lack Pho4 fail to activate PHO8 under inducing conditions. To approach steady-state conditions as closely as possible, induced PHO8 promoter chromatin was analyzed, unless indicated otherwise, in pho80Δ cells cultured in phosphate-containing media. The noninduced PHO8 promoter is believed to be occupied by four nucleosomes, three of which were proposed to be partially unfolded to account for elevated restriction enzyme accessibilities (36Barbari S. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed PHO8 and PHO5 promoter chromatin by limiting digestion analysis (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To this end, we partially digested nuclei from noninduced cells with increasing concentrations of MNase, which preferentially digests linker DNA. The amount of undigested promoter DNA was measured by hybridization with 32P-labeled PHO5 and PHO8 promoter DNA probes after gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting of isolated DNA (Fig. 1A). Both probes spanned a four-nucleosome-wide domain (Fig. 1A). The same domains were released from genomic DNA by restriction endonuclease digestion and run on the same gel as the MNase-digested DNA (data not shown). This allowed us to account for differences in probe activity. The ratio of undigested PHO8 and PHO5 promoter DNA reached a limiting value of 0.77 ± 0.1 (two independent experiments) at high enzyme concentrations (Fig. 1B). The low restriction enzyme accessibilities of sequences occupied by nucleosomes suggest that nucleosome positions are close to fully occupied at the repressed PHO5 promoter (17Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, the limiting value indicated that the noninduced PHO8 promoter is occupied, on average, by 0.77 × 4 = 3.1 nucleosomes that are equally resistant to MNase attack as nucleosomes at the PHO5 promoter. Notably, the length of DNA protected against MNase attack was identical for the nucleosomes of both promoters (Fig. 1A). The paucity of distinct digestion products shorter than the expected length of the nucleosome core particle argued against the existence of stable, partially unfolded nucleosomes. Differences in the cleavage frequencies of restriction endonucleases are likely to reflect differences in nucleosome occupancy rather than structure. The same conclusion was reached for activated PHO5 promoter chromatin (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Loss of nucleosomes from the induced PHO8 promoter was previously inferred from nuclease accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (28Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 36Barbari S. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the existence of stable partially unfolded nucleosomes may be, and has been (see above), invoked to explain elevated nuclease accessibility, and nucleosome-bound remodelers that encapsulate the nucleosome upon binding, such as RSC (37Chaban Y.

Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), may interfere with cross-linking of histones to DNA or the recognition of histone epitopes by antibodies. To clarify the structural nature of induced PHO8 promoter chromatin, we compared activated and repressed promoter chromatin at steady state by limiting digestion and topology analyses. For these experiments, we used strains in which the PHO8 gene or promoter was flanked by the recognition sequences for the site-specific R recombinase of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, which was expressed under control of the inducible GAL1 promoter (40Ansari A. Gartenberg M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The position of the upstream RS is indicated in Fig. 2A. The second RS element was inserted 250 bp downstream of the PHO8 stop codon for gene circles or 56 bp downstream of the PHO8 start codon for promoter circles. Recombination results in removal of the PHO8 gene in circular form from its chromosomal locus. To exclude topological effects due to transcription (18Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), strains furthermore bore a mutation in the PHO8 TATA box. The digestion of equal amounts of activated and repressed promoter chromatin with increasing concentrations of MNase showed that the ratio between activated and repressed promoter DNA reached a limiting value of 0.41 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2A, two independent experiments). Assuming that the repressed promoter bears three nucleosomes, on average, this result suggests that about 0.4 × 3 = 1.2"
https://openalex.org/W2091009324,"Diabetic neuropathy is the most common diabetic complication. The pathogenetic pathways include oxidative stress, advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation, protein kinase C, and NF-κB activation, as well as increased polyol flux. These metabolic perturbations affect neurons, Schwann cells, and vasa nervorum, which are held to be the primary cell types involved. We hypothesize that diabetes induces the appearance of abnormal bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) that fuse with neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice, leading to diabetic neuropathy. Neuronal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation in diabetes is known to generate free radical and oxidant-induced injury and poly(ADP-ribose) polymer formation, resulting in neuronal death and dysfunction, culminating in neuropathy. We further hypothesize that BM-specific PARP expression plays a determining role in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that bone marrow transplantation (BMT) of PARP-knockout (PARPKO) cells to wild-type mice protects against, whereas BMT of wild-type cells to PARPKO mice, which are normally ""neuropathy-resistant,"" confers susceptibility to, diabetic neuropathy. The pathogenetic process involving hyperglycemia, BMDCs, and BMDC-neuron fusion can be recapitulated in vitro. Incubation in high, but not low, glucose confers fusogenicity to BMDCs, which are characterized by proinsulin (PI) and TNF-α coexpression; coincubation of isolated DRG neurons with PI-BMDCs in high glucose leads to spontaneous fusion between the 2 cell types, while the presence of a PARP inhibitor or use of PARPKO BMDCs in the incubation protects against BMDC-neuron fusion. These complementary in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that BMDC-PARP expression promotes diabetic neuropathy via BMDC-neuron fusion."

To accurately analyze CD24 function and dissect its biological role in a defined genetic background, it is critical to tightly regulate its expression and be able to turn it on/off in a restricted environment and at a specific time. The tetracycline-induced expression system is most promising as it exhibits such regulation, lack of pleiotropic effects, and high and rapid induction levels. To evaluate the oncogenic and immunotherapeutic potential of CD24 by applying the Tet-On system, the human CD24 gene was cloned downstream to two tetracycline operator sequences, resulting in pCDNA4/TO-CD24, which was then transfected into tetracycline (Tet) repressor-expressing cells (293T-REx), allowing tight on/off regulation, thereby resulting in a very low background or leaky CD24 expression. Selected clones were chosen for further studies and characterized in vitro and in vivo, and several treatment modalities were examined. In addition, the role of CD24 in promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth was studied. The tetracycline-dependent system was successfully implemented. Tetracycline treatment induced CD24 expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, which was abrogated following treatment with anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). CD24-induced expression led to an increased proliferation rate that was inhibited by mAb treatment. In vivo, significantly larger tumors were developed in tetracycline-fed mice.

https://openalex.org/W2089086313,"The binding by HIV-1 gp120 to CD4 and a chemokine receptor activates the membrane fusion glycoprotein, gp41. The fusion function of gp41 involves the refolding of its core into a 6-helix bundle, which apposes the lipophilic termini (the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain) and the associated cell and viral membranes, leading to their fusion. In this study, we examined the functional role of the polar segment and membrane proximal external region (MPER), which link the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain, respectively, to the core domain and interact to form a terminal clasp adjacent to the core. Limited proteolysis indicated that the terminal clasp is destabilized by simultaneous I535A/V539G mutations within the polar segment and mutations within the MPER. The destabilizing effects of I535A/V539G correlated with defective cell-cell fusion, viral entry, and viral replication. By using lipophilic and cytoplasmic fluorescent dye transfer assays, we found that terminal clasp destabilization is linked to a block in the lipid mixing/hemifusion phase of the membrane fusion cascade. Because the biosynthesis of the prefusion gp120-gp41 complex did not appear to be affected by I535A/V539G, we infer that the hemifusion block is due to a specific effect on the trimer of hairpins conformation of gp41. By contrast, the decreased fusion function of the MPER mutants correlated with a decrease in the interfacial hydropathy of the MPER sequence, suggesting that the prefusion Env complex had been adversely affected in these cases.

Binding by gp120 to CD4 and a chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) activates the membrane fusion function of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein (8Melikyan G.B. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Gp41 is a class I fusion glycoprotein composed of an N-terminal fusion peptide, connected through a polar segment (also referred to as the fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR) (9Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W.

The binding of gp120 to CD4 causes major structural changes in gp120, which trigger the pre-hairpin intermediate conformation of gp41 that bridges the viral and cellular membranes (5Liu J.

The subsequent engagement of chemokine receptors by gp120-CD4 is believed to enable further structural changes in gp41 including the antiparallel packing of HR2 into hydrophobic grooves on the exterior of the coiled-coil to form the 6-helix bundle core. Six-helix bundle formation brings together the N- and C-terminal membrane-inserted ends (i.e. the fusion peptide and TMD) in a trimer of hairpins structure that apposes the associated viral and cellular membranes, ready for merger (15Chan D.C.

Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The functional role of the MPER, which links HR2 to the TMD, is of major interest because it encompasses the epitopes of broadly neutralizing mAbs 2F5, 4E10, and Ze13 (10Montero M. van Houten N.E. Wang X. Scott J.K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 54-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), indicating that it is a conserved antiviral target. Electron density corresponding to the MPER is not observed in a cryotomographic structure of virion gp120-gp41 in which the orientation of the glycoproteins was confirmed using ligands (5Liu J. Bartesaghi A. Borgnia M.J. Sapiro G. Subramaniam S. Nature. 2008; 455: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), however, biophysical approaches indicate that this sequence is embedded in the viral envelope, most likely at the base of the trimer (21Chakrabarti B.K.

Spectroscopic studies of synthetic MPER peptides and model membranes have revealed a lipid-immersed α-helix-kink-α-helix conformation. Interestingly, the side chains of the key mAb 2F5- (Trp666) and 4E10- (Trp672, Phe673, and Ile675) binding residues are buried, forming part of the lipid-interactive face of the peptide (22Sun Z.Y.

Med. 2011; 208: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereby the mAb paratope initially interacts with lipid and then extracts its epitope from the hydrophobic phase. Taken together, these studies indicate that the MPER is immersed in lipid and protein-protein interactions can induce its extraction from this environment. A number of studies have examined the role of the MPER in the HIV-1 membrane fusion mechanism. Mutational studies have indicated that the conserved Trp666-Trp670-Trp672-Trp678-Trp680 motif of the MPER functions cooperatively in a late stage of membrane fusion (27Muñoz-Barroso I. Salzwedel K. Hunter E. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction between synthetic peptide MPER analogues and liposomes indicate membrane partitioning, lipid mixing, and permeability activities, however, these activities depend on peptide length and liposome composition (see Ref. 10Montero M. van Houten N.E. Wang X. Scott J.K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 54-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Whether these observations with peptides reflect the native function of the MPER remains unclear. We previously reported that an interaction between the MPER and polar segment confers stability to the trimer of the hairpins conformation of gp41 and proposed that a terminal clasp forms at its membrane-interactive end (29Bellamy-McIntyre A.K. Lay C.S. Baär S. Maerz A.L. Talbo G.H. Drummer H.E. Poumbourios P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23104-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Lay C.S. Wilson K.A. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Drummer H.E. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has now revealed that the polar segment and MPER form helical extensions of the central trimeric HR1 coiled-coil and antiparallel HR2 segments, respectively (9Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The clasp is stabilized by predominantly hydrophobic interactions between residues of the polar segment coiled-coil and adjacent antiparallel MPER helices (Gly531-Leu679, Ala533-Trp670, Met535-Ile675/Asn671, and Thr536/Leu537-Trp666). In this study, we examined the functional role of the terminal clasp by mutagenesis. We found that clasp destabilization in a trimer of hairpins model protein is linked to a block in the lipid mixing/hemifusion phase of the membrane fusion cascade, indicating that terminal clasp formation is important for the initiation of membrane fusion. The preparation of CMV and bacteriophage T7 promoter-driven HIV-1AD8 Env expression vectors, pCDNA3.1-AD8env and pTM-AD8env, respectively, are described elsewhere (29Bellamy-McIntyre A.K. Lay C.S.

At 24-h post-transfection, 293T cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C prior to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with mAb C8 and DV-012. The immunoblots were developed with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-sheep Ig (Invitrogen) and scanned in a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. 293T cells (600,000 cells/well of a 6-well flat bottomed plate) were cotransfected with pCAG-T7 and pTM-AD8env vectors in triplicate. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% FCS and incubated with mAb 2G12, directed to gp120 for 1 h on ice. After 2 washes in PBS, 1% FCS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Fab for 30 min on ice. After a further 2 washes in PBS, 1% FCS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS prior to flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Bioscience) and CellQuest software. The mean fluorescence intensity from the acquisition of 10,000 gated events was used as a measure of binding. 293T cells were cotransfected with pTM-AD8env and pCAG-T7 plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were starved in methionine and cysteine-free medium for 30 min and then pulse labeled with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals) for 45 min. The labeled cells were washed and then chased for 5 h with complete medium in the presence or absence of sCD4 (15 μg of sCD4/0.6 ml of medium). All incubations were at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells and culture supernatants were processed for immunoprecipitation with mAb 2G12 and protein G-Sepharose and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. The labeled proteins were visualized by scanning in a Typhoon TRIO variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). 293T effector cells (250,000 cells per well of a 12-well culture plate) were cotransfected with pTM-AD8env and pCAG-T7 plasmids.

The protein composition of pseudotyped virions was assessed by first pelleting the virions from 9 ml of transfection supernatant through a 1.5-ml 25% (w/v) sucrose/PBS cushion (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor, 25,000 rpm, 2.5 h, 4 °C) followed by reducing SDS-PAGE in 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels and Western blotting with DV-012 and IgG from an HIV-1-infected individual (IgG14). The immunoblots were developed with IRDye 800CW-conjugated rabbit anti-human Ig (Rockland) or Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated donkey anti-sheep Ig (Invitrogen), respectively, and scanned in a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. PBMC infections were conducted as described previously (45Hill M.K. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Campbell S.M. Poumbourios P. Crowe S.M. Mak J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8329-8335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, PBMCs isolated from buffy packs (Red Cross Blood Bank) were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (10 μg/ml; Murex Diagnostics) for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and IL-2 (10 units/ml; Roche Applied Science). Virus stocks were prepared by transfecting 293T cell monolayers with pAD8 infectious clones using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Virus-containing supernatants were normalized according to RT activity, and then used to infect 105 PBMCs in a 96-well tissue culture plate (eight 10-fold serial dilutions of each virus were tested in triplicate). Supernatants were assayed for RT activity. The MBP/gp41(528-L-677)AD.ST chimera comprises the HIV-1AD8 polar segment (Ser528-Gln540) and HIV-2ST HR1 (Ser541-Trp596), linked through Ser-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly, to the HIV-2ST HR2 (Trp610-Ser665) and the HIV-1AD8 MPER (Trp666-Asn677) (19Tan K.

The PCR products were ligated into the MBP expression vector through NotI-SalI. The various substitution mutations were introduced to MBP/gp41(528-L-677)AD.ST by overlap extension PCR. The tr665 construct, which was truncated after residue 665 to remove the MPER was produced by PCR using MBP/gp41(528-L-677)AD.ST as the template and 5′-CCGCGCGGCCGCGAGCACTATGGGCGCCGCGTCAATAACG and 5′-GGCGGTCGACTTAGCTATTTAATTTTTGTAGTTCATACATG as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The tr665 PCR product was ligated into the MBP expression vector through NotI-SalI. DNA sequences were confirmed using ABI Prism BigDye terminator (Applied Biosystems). MBP/gp41 chimeras were induced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by amylose-agarose affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs) and gel filtration as described (30Lay C.S. Wilson K.A. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Drummer H.E. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MBP/gp41 trimers were proteolyzed with sequencing-grade chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science and Promega) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12–17% polyacrylamide gradient gels as described (30Lay C.S. Wilson K.A. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Drummer H.E. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6220 Accurate Mass TOF LC/MS Mass Spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1100 LC system. All data were acquired and reference mass was corrected via a dual-spray electrospray ionization source. Each scan or data point on the total ion chromatogram is an average of 10,000 transients, producing a scan every second. Spectra were created by averaging the scans across each peak. Chromatographic separation was carried out following injection of 10 μl of protein sample (0.5 mg/ml) using a MassPREP On-Line Desalting Cartridge, 2.1 × 10 mm (Waters). Unbound material including chymotrypsin buffer reagents were removed with a one-min 15% “B” (95% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid) wash that was directed to waste. Eluted molecules were then sent to the mass spectrometer during a 15–80% B gradient at 0.25 ml/min. 293T effector cells (5 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate) were cotransfected with pCAG-T7 and wild type or mutant Env-expression vectors. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were stained with the red lipophilic dye DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; red fluorescence, excitation at 549 nm, emission at 565 nm (Invitrogen)) for 15 min at room temperature. At the same time, JC53 (46Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) target cells were labeled with DiO (3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; green fluorescence, excitation at 484 nm, emission at 501 nm). After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were detached with PBS, 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in complete medium. Equivalent numbers of effector and target cells were mixed and added to the wells of fibronectin-coated chamber slides. The cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h at the fusion nonpermissive temperature of 23 °C after which fusion was initiated by raising the temperature to 37 °C. Following 2 h of coculture at 37 °C, lipophilic dye transfer events were recorded using an API Deltavision RT Deconvolution system and SoftWorx 1.2 software. Images of 10–15 random fields (×60 magnification) were collected for each condition. Imaris Colocalization software was used to quantify lipid-mixing events in reconstructed z-stacks by determining the Pearson coefficient of correlation for the location of green and red fluorescing pixels (referred to as voxels). Cytoplasmic dye transfer assays were performed essentially as described for lipophilic dyes, above, except that effector cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with CellTracker orange CMTMR (554.04 Da, excitation at 541 nm, emission at 565 nm (Invitrogen)), and targets were labeled with CellTracker green CMFDA (464.86 Da; excitation at 492 nm, emission at 517 nm). A homology-based model of HIV-1AD8 gp41 was generated from PDB entry 2X7R (9Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using the Modeler algorithm (47Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10635) Google Scholar) within Discovery Studio, version 3.0 (Accelrys). Five independent models were generated from iterative cycles of conjugate-gradient energy minimization against spatial constraints derived from the template crystal structure. The model with the lowest energy (probability density function) was selected for structural analysis. Point mutations were introduced using the “Build Mutants” routine of Modeler within Discovery Studio and optimized using the same approach as for the wild type AD8 homology model. In this study, we used mutagenesis of HIV-1AD8 Env to determine the role of the terminal clasp in the membrane fusion mechanism. Ile535 and Val539 were initially chosen as mutagenic targets because they were predicted to occupy outward-facing e and b positions, respectively, of the polar segment-HR1 coiled-coil heptad repeat (Fig. 1). Modeling of Ile535 into the terminal clasp of PDB entry 2X7R indicates that it will mediate hydrophobic contacts with Asn671 and Ile675 of the MPER. On the other hand, Val539 does not contact other residues. The individual I535A and V539G mutations led to modest reductions in cell-cell fusion (30 and 25%, respectively; Fig. 2A) and single cycle entry (75 and 60%, respectively; Fig. 2B), whereas both functions were abolished for the combination mutant, I535A/V539G. Consistent with these data, HIV-1AD8 infectious clones containing I535A or V539G exhibited slightly delayed replication kinetics with respect to wild type in phytohemagg"
https://openalex.org/W2055908204,"The filamentous fungus Penicillium brevicompactum produces the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid (MPA), which is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic IMP dehydrogenases (IMPDHs). IMPDH catalyzes the conversion of IMP to XMP via a covalent enzyme intermediate, E-XMP*; MPA inhibits by trapping E-XMP*. P. brevicompactum (Pb) contains two MPA-resistant IMPDHs, PbIMPDH-A and PbIMPDH-B, which are 17- and 10(3)-fold more resistant to MPA than typically observed. Surprisingly, the active sites of these resistant enzymes are essentially identical to those of MPA-sensitive enzymes, so the mechanistic basis of resistance is not apparent. Here, we show that, unlike MPA-sensitive IMPDHs, formation of E-XMP* is rate-limiting for both PbIMPDH-A and PbIMPDH-B. Therefore, MPA resistance derives from the failure to accumulate the drug-sensitive intermediate."
