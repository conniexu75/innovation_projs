https://openalex.org/W2410468716,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-β. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-β activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-β pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM."

Here we develop a fast and accurate LRP method, Eagle, that extends this paradigm to populations with much smaller proportions of genotyped samples by harnessing long (>4-cM) identical-by-descent (IBD) tracts shared among distantly related individuals. We applied Eagle to N ≈ 150,000 samples (0.2% of the British population) from the UK Biobank, and we determined that it is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing methods while achieving similar or better phasing accuracy (switch error rate ≈ 0.3%, corresponding to perfect phase in a majority of 10-Mb segments). We also observed that, when used within an imputation pipeline, Eagle prephasing improved downstream imputation accuracy in comparison to prephasing in batches using existing methods, as necessary to achieve comparable computational cost."
https://openalex.org/W2414343162,"A mechanistic understanding of neural computation requires determining how information is processed as it passes through neurons and across synapses. However, it has been challenging to measure membrane potential changes in axons and dendrites in vivo. We use in vivo, two-photon imaging of novel genetically encoded voltage indicators, as well as calcium imaging, to measure sensory stimulus-evoked signals in the Drosophila visual system with subcellular resolution. Across synapses, we find major transformations in the kinetics, amplitude, and sign of voltage responses to light. We also describe distinct relationships between voltage and calcium signals in different neuronal compartments, a substrate for local computation. Finally, we demonstrate that ON and OFF selectivity, a key feature of visual processing across species, emerges through the transformation of membrane potential into intracellular calcium concentration. By imaging voltage and calcium signals to map information flow with subcellular resolution, we illuminate where and how critical computations arise."

We present a new phasing method, SHAPEIT3, that can handle such biobank-scale data sets and results in switch error rates as low as ∼0.3%. The method exhibits O(NlogN) scaling with sample size N, enabling fast and accurate phasing of even larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2416742466,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder without effective treatment. It is generally sporadic with unknown etiology. However, genetic studies of rare familial forms have led to the identification of mutations in several genes, which are linked to typical Parkinson's disease or parkinsonian disorders. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease remains largely elusive. Here we report a locus for autosomal dominant, clinically typical and Lewy body-confirmed Parkinson's disease on the short arm of chromosome 20 (20pter-p12) and identify TMEM230 as the disease-causing gene. We show that TMEM230 encodes a transmembrane protein of secretory/recycling vesicles, including synaptic vesicles in neurons. Disease-linked TMEM230 mutants impair synaptic vesicle trafficking. Our data provide genetic evidence that a mutant transmembrane protein of synaptic vesicles in neurons is etiologically linked to Parkinson's disease, with implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of Parkinson's disease and for developing rational therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2411573336,"How mechanical and biological processes are coordinated across cells, tissues, and organs to produce complex traits is a key question in biology. Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells-a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2415058043,"The neural circuits underlying face recognition provide a model for understanding visual object representation, social cognition, and hierarchical information processing. A fundamental piece of information lacking to date is the detailed anatomical connections of the face patches. Here, we injected retrograde tracers into four different face patches (PL, ML, AL, AM) to characterize their anatomical connectivity. We found that the patches are strongly and specifically connected to each other, and individual patches receive inputs from extrastriate cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and three subcortical structures (the pulvinar, claustrum, and amygdala). Inputs from prefrontal cortex were surprisingly weak. Patches were densely interconnected to one another in both feedforward and feedback directions, inconsistent with a serial hierarchy. These results provide the first direct anatomical evidence that the face patches constitute a highly specialized system and suggest that subcortical regions may play a vital role in routing face-related information to subsequent processing stages."
https://openalex.org/W2411562838,"Caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan of flies, worms, and yeast by counteracting age-related oxidation of H2O2-scavenging peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Here, we show that increased dosage of the major cytosolic Prx in yeast, Tsa1, extends lifespan in an Hsp70 chaperone-dependent and CR-independent manner without increasing H2O2 scavenging or genome stability. We found that Tsa1 and Hsp70 physically interact and that hyperoxidation of Tsa1 by H2O2 is required for the recruitment of the Hsp70 chaperones and the Hsp104 disaggregase to misfolded and aggregated proteins during aging, but not heat stress. Tsa1 counteracted the accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates during aging and the reduction of hyperoxidized Tsa1 by sulfiredoxin facilitated clearance of H2O2-generated aggregates. The data reveal a conceptually new role for H2O2 signaling in proteostasis and lifespan control and shed new light on the selective benefits endowed to eukaryotic peroxiredoxins by their reversible hyperoxidation."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have complex and diverse functions in brain development. lncRNAs have relatively low levels of evolutionary conservation with sequence deletions and insertions (McLean et al., 2011McLean C.Y.

About a third of the lncRNAs are unique to the primate lineage (Derrien et al., 2012Derrien T. Johnson R. Bussotti G. Tanzer A. Djebali S. Tilgner H. Guernec G. Martin D. Merkel A.

USA. 2008; 105: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are derived from hairpin precursors that function in association with Argonaute proteins to regulate target genes post-transcriptionally. These ∼21–23 nucleotide sequences change quite dramatically as cells transition from germ cells to neural stem cells, and at all stages of cell differentiation during brain development (reviewed in Fineberg et al., 2009Fineberg S.K. Kosik K.S. Davidson B.L. MicroRNAs potentiate neural development.Neuron. 2009; 64: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The many regulatory controls over miRNA levels and cell-type-specific expression include the well-known panoply of gene expression mechanisms, e.g., promoters, enhancers, and epigenetic modifications, as well as degradation and biogenesis pathways (Ha and Kim, 2014Ha M. Kim V.N. Regulation of microRNA biogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). An additional source of control over the levels of mature miRNAs is their sequestration and release from binding sites, known as miRNA response elements (MREs), in transcribed pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (Cesana et al., 2011Cesana M.

These natural miRNA-binding platforms known as sponges contain MREs that can relieve mRNA targets from repression or indirectly induce target mRNA repression by release of miRNAs from this reservoir. Natural miRNA sponges impart stability to miRNAs (Bail et al., 2010Bail S. Swerdel M. Liu H. Jiao X. Goff L.A. Hart R.P. Kiledjian M.

Short stretches of complementarity to miRNA seeds in regions of relatively unstructured RNA found in lncRNAs could evolve easily (Ebert and Sharp, 2010Ebert M.S. Sharp P.A.

The H19 lncRNA has been detected in a complex with miR-17-5p by photo-crosslinking and Argonaute 2 immunopurification (Imig et al., 2015Imig J. Brunschweiger A. Brümmer A. Guennewig B. Mittal N.

We identified and functionally characterized an lncRNA, LncND (lncRNA for neurodevelopment), that is deleted in a region of the genome associated with a human neurodevelopmental disorder. A microdeletion at 2p25.3 includes LncND and 6–7 protein-coding genes (Stevens et al., 2011Stevens S.J.C. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C.M. Janssen J.W. Klein Wassink-Ruiter J.S. van Essen A.J.

Six individuals harboring 2p25.3 terminal or interstitial deletions of different sizes, all including LncND, had intellectual disability (Stevens et al., 2011Stevens S.J.C. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C.M.

A set of monozygotic twins with a karyotype involving this genomic locus had a discordant phenotype: one with a heterozygous deletion of the 2p25.3 region exhibited developmental delay, absence of speech, and hyperactivity, and the other harbored somatic mosaicism and had autism spectrum disorder (Rio et al., 2013Rio M.

Five patients with a deletion of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 2 (size 2.90–2.97 Mb) had intellectual disability with aggressive outbursts and hyperactivity (Doco-Fenzy et al., 2014Doco-Fenzy M. Leroy C. Schneider A. Petit F. Delrue M.-A. Andrieux J. Perrin-Sabourin L. Landais E. Aboura A.

The deleted region included Ysc84-like-1 (SH3YL1), acid phosphatase 1 soluble (ACP1), transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), syntrophin gamma 2 (SNTG2), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), Drosophila peroxidasin homolog (PXDN), myelin transcription factor 1-like (MYT1L) (Figure S1A, available online), and uncharacterized long-non coding RNAs, including LncND. We demonstrated that LncND acts as an miRNA sponge for miR-143-3p and in so doing can regulate the Notch signaling pathway. The knockdown of LncND in neuroblastoma cells repressed NOTCH-1 and NOTCH-2 and differentiated the cells to neurons. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated a significant number of differentially expressed overlapping genes (including cell-cycle-related and neurogenesis genes) after LncND knockdown or miR-143-3p overexpression. Single-cell analysis and in situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed the high expression of LncND in radial glia cells (RGCs) in human cortex, suggesting its role in maintaining the neural progenitor pool during the expansion of the cerebral cortex by regulating the Notch signaling pathway. This conclusion was supported by a functional assay in which expansion of the radial glial population occurred following in vivo overexpression of LncND. Recently, a reference catalog of more than 8,000 human lncRNAs was defined from about four billion RNA-seq reads across 24 tissues and cell types (Cabili et al., 2011Cabili M.N. Trapnell C. Goff L. Koziol M. Tazon-Vega B. Regev A. Rinn J.L. Integrative annotation of human large intergenic noncoding RNAs reveals global properties and specific subclasses.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1915-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). A stringent set of 4,662 high-quality human lncRNA loci (14,353 transcripts) was annotated (Human Body Map lincRNAs, Broad Institute). We focused on brain-expressed lncRNAs and selected 358 lncRNA loci (1,175 transcripts) that were expressed (fpkm ≥ 1) in two biological replicates from the database. TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9835) Google Scholar) was used to predict miRNA binding sites along these full-length lncRNAs. In total, 53 brain-expressed miRNAs were selected from profiling 40 normal human tissues (Liang et al., 2007Liang Y. Ridzon D. Wong L. Chen C. Characterization of microRNA expression profiles in normal human tissues.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 166Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). We postulated that the tendency of an RNA to act as an miRNA sponge will increase with an increasing number of miRNA response elements (MREs). Taking these factors into consideration, we identified four lncRNA loci (6 transcripts) with 10 or more MREs for a single miRNA (Figure 1A). The transcript, TCONS_00003534 transcript (sense strand), has multiple MREs for several miRNAs spread over a relatively short sequence segment. However, with further computational analysis, we observed contradictory information on the directionality of this transcript. RNA-seq data from hiPSC-derived neurons (M.A. Lalli., I. Hernandez, and K.S.K., unpublished data) and RNA-seq data on the UCSC Genome Browser showed most of the reads derived from the antisense strand, contrary to the annotation in the Human Body Map lincRNAs catalog. The antisense transcript, hereafter referred to as LncND, is located on chromosome 2: 663814-666523 (2p25.3 arm of chromosome 2) with seven protein-coding genes in its vicinity (Figure S1A). Several marks of active transcription and conserved regulatory elements are present upstream of the LncND locus (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Kent et al., 2002Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. The human genome browser at UCSC.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6719) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). There were multiple MREs for several miRNAs on the antisense strand, among them miR-143-3p, miR-4286, miR-1912, and miR-4330 (Figure 1B). To confirm the strand usage of this lncRNA, we performed ISH on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (H9 cells) before and after differentiation into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by dual SMAD inhibition (SMADi) (Chambers et al., 2009Chambers S.M. Fasano C.A. Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M. Sadelain M. Studer L. Highly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Consistent with our RNA-seq data from the hiPSC-derived neurons, only the antisense strand was expressed in NPCs (Figure 1C, top). No signal was detected in undifferentiated H9 cells (Figure S1C). We obtained the same result with the antisense probe in human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y (Figure 1C, bottom). The signal was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Figure 1C; black arrows, cytoplasmic; red arrows, nuclear). Therefore, a mis-annotation of the strand usage is present in the Human Body Map lincRNA catalog, likely due to the use of a sequencing method that lacked strand specificity (Cabili et al., 2011Cabili M.N. Trapnell C. Goff L. Koziol M. Tazon-Vega B. Regev A. Rinn J.L. Integrative annotation of human large intergenic noncoding RNAs reveals global properties and specific subclasses.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1915-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). Cabili et al. predicted four splice variants of LncND. One of these isoforms (TCONS_00003534) was identified with a small intron (59 bases from 758 to 816 bp) between two exons (1–757 bp and 817–2651 bp) with a full transcript of 2,651 bp. Fragments of the full-length LncND transcript with overlapping regions were successfully amplified from human brain RNA (FirstChoice Human Brain Total RNA from Ambion) using either random hexamers (Figure S1D) or oligo-dT primers (Figure S1E). Therefore, the predicted intron sequence (between 758 and 816 bp) is part of an exon, suggesting that the transcript might be expressed as a single large exon similar to MALAT1 and NEAT1 lncRNAs (Hutchinson et al., 2007Hutchinson J.N.

LncND is poorly conserved with a primate-specific insertion in the 5′ end of LncND RNA (Multiz Alignment; Figure 1D). Interestingly, most of the MREs are located in the primate-specific region (Figures 1D and 1B). The phylogeny tree, created by phylogeny.fr (Dereeper et al., 2008Dereeper A. Guignon V. Blanc G. Audic S. Buffet S. Chevenet F. Dufayard J.F. Guindon S. Lefort V. Lescot M. et al.Phylogeny.fr: robust phylogenetic analysis for the non-specialist.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W465-W469Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar), shows that the LncND sequences among Catarrhini (Old World monkeys, including rhesus, green monkey, baboon, and crab-eating macaque, and apes, including chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and human) are closely related, and the MREs for miR-143-3p are less conserved in Platyrrhini (New World monkeys, including squirrel monkeys and marmoset) compared to Catarrhini (Figure 1E). To determine the expression of LncND during development, we differentiated H9 hESCs either into neurons through intermediate stages using dual SMAD inhibitors (Chambers et al., 2009Chambers S.M. Fasano C.A. Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M. Sadelain M. Studer L. Highly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) or into mesendoderm using BMP4 and FGF2 (Yu et al., 2011Yu P. Pan G. Yu J. Thomson J.A. FGF2 sustains NANOG and switches the outcome of BMP4-induced human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 326-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SMAD inhibition directed the stem cells specifically toward neuroectoderm, in which mRNA expression of PAX6, SOX2, NES, and HES1 was highly upregulated at day 5 of differentiation (Figures S2A and S2B). Markers for endoderm (GATA6) and mesoderm (Brachyury or the T gene) were low (Ct values lower than 30) (Figure S2A). With further differentiation to neurons, PAX6 was downregulated (Figure S2A) and immunostaining with Tau- and MAP2-specific antibodies became apparent (Figure S2C). LncND expression increased in neural progenitors at day 5 of differentiation and then dropped rapidly in neurons (Figure 2A). We also measured the expression of LncND using a second model of neuronal differentiation (passage through embryoid bodies and neurospheres) and again observed a gradual increase in the expression of LncND till the neurosphere stage, followed by a decrease in its expression in neurons (data not shown). When H9 cells were differentiated into mesendoderm, GATA6 and Brachyury mRNA were highly upregulated at day 5 (Figure S2D). PAX6 was expressed at very low levels in these cells, consistent with differentiation toward mesendoderm (Figure S2D). LncND expression remained stable at day 2 and downregulated at day 5 of mesendoderm differentiation (Figure 2B). The expression of LncND in SHSY5Y cells exceeded the levels of neural stem cells at day 5 of differentiation of H9 cells (Figure S2E). Thus, LncND is preferentially elevated in early neural progenitor cells, suggesting its selective role during neuronal differentiation. Near-perfect complementarity at the “seed region” from position 2–7 at the 5′ end of the miRNA determines target specificity (Friedman et al., 2009Friedman R.C. Farh K.K.H. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

All these sites, except one with a 7-mer-1A site, are perfect 6-mer sites, together with complementarity at the 3′ end of miRNA (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

A large number of MREs for several other miRNAs were found, including miR-4286, miR-1912, and miR-4330 (Figures 2C and 1B). A thermodynamic energy prediction between LncND and miR-143-3p sites indicated highly negative ΔG values for all of its sites (Figure 2D). The other three potential miRNAs also had very low ΔG values (Figure S3). A miRNA sponge is expected to form a complex with Ago2, a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Gregory et al., 2005Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R.

LncND was highly enriched (∼6- to 7-fold) in Ago2 immunoprecipitation (IP), with an Ago2-specific antibody in SHSY5Y cells, as compared to the IgG control (Figures 2E and 2F). As a positive control, we observed ∼8- to 9-fold enrichment of H19 lncRNA in Ago2-IP (Figure 2F), which was previously identified as a miRNA sponge enriched in an Ago2-IP (Kallen et al., 2013Kallen A.N.

https://openalex.org/W2415283703,"During the lifespans of most animals, reproductive maturity and mating activity are highly coordinated. In Drosophila melanogaster, for instance, male fertility increases with age, and older males are known to have a copulation advantage over young ones. The molecular and neural basis of this age-related disparity in mating behavior is unknown. Here, we show that the Or47b odorant receptor is required for the copulation advantage of older males. Notably, the sensitivity of Or47b neurons to a stimulatory pheromone, palmitoleic acid, is low in young males but high in older ones, which accounts for older males' higher courtship intensity. Mechanistically, this age-related sensitization of Or47b neurons requires a reproductive hormone, juvenile hormone, as well as its binding protein Methoprene-tolerant in Or47b neurons. Together, our study identifies a direct neural substrate for juvenile hormone that permits coordination of courtship activity with reproductive maturity to maximize male reproductive fitness."

To further investigate the mechanism of pemetrexed resistance and potential prognostic outcomes in lung cancer, we established pemetrexed-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell sublines from CL1 harboring a mutated TP53 gene (R248W) and A549 harboring wild-type TP53. We found the TS expression is upregulated in both pemetrexed-resistant sublines and the reduced TS level achieved through shRNA inhibition resulted in higher pemetrexed sensitivity. We also demonstrated that the acquisitions of pemetrexed resistance enhances epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vivo with a mice animal model and in vitro with CL1 and A549 sublines, which was associated with upregulation of ZEB1 which, in turn, downregulates E-cadherin and upregulates fibronectin. When ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced by an inhibitor (U0126) or siRNA inhibition, both pemetrexed-resistant sublines reduced their migration and invasion abilities. Therefore, the ERK-mediated pathways induce apoptosis with pemetrexed treatment, and may in turn mediate EMT when cancer cells are resistant to pemetrexed. We further demonstrated that the growth of pemetrexed-resistant tumors could be inhibited by vinblastine in vivo and vincristine in vitro. Our data indicate that pemetrexed resistance could be relieved by non-cross-resistant chemotherapeutic drugs such as vinca alkaloids and might be independent to TP53 status. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of ERK was reduced by vincristine. This finding provides a new insight for overcoming pemetrexed resistance and metastasis by application of vinca alkaloids."
https://openalex.org/W2415703368,"A central goal in the study of any sensory system is to predict neural responses to complex inputs, especially those encountered during natural stimulation. Nowhere is the transformation from stimulus to response better understood than the vertebrate retina. Nevertheless, descriptions of retinal computation are largely based on stimulation using artificial visual stimuli, and it is unclear how these descriptions map onto the encoding of natural stimuli. We demonstrate that nonlinear spatial integration, a common feature of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) processing, shapes neural responses to natural visual stimuli in primate Off parasol RGCs, whereas On parasol RGCs exhibit surprisingly linear spatial integration. Despite this asymmetry, both cell types show strong nonlinear integration when presented with artificial stimuli. We show that nonlinear integration of natural stimuli is a consequence of rectified excitatory synaptic input and that accounting for nonlinear spatial integration substantially improves models that predict RGC responses to natural images."

This suggests that the primate brain processes value serially, and that value-coding neurons may be modulated by changes in gaze. To test this hypothesis, we presented monkeys with value-associated visual cues and took the unusual step of allowing unrestricted free viewing while we recorded neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). By leveraging natural gaze patterns, we found that a large proportion of OFC cells encode gaze location and, that in some cells, value coding is amplified when subjects fixate near the cue.

One of the most important tasks that an organism performs is judging the economic value—the potential for reward or punishment—associated with the stimuli in its environment. This is a difficult task in natural settings, in which many stimuli need to be accurately evaluated. One way that organisms address this problem is by evaluating stimuli serially. In primates, this is done through saccadic eye movements: by shifting gaze between objects, primates can focus their perceptual and cognitive resources on one stimulus at a time (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P.

A logical hypothesis, therefore, is that when primates judge the value of visual objects in natural settings, they recruit their valuation circuitry in a serial fashion, according to the location of gaze. Furthermore, this suggests that to understand ecologically realistic decisions in primates, it is critical to understand how neural valuation circuitry is influenced by gaze. While several neural mechanisms exist for encoding the value of visible objects (Kennerley et al., 2011Kennerley S.W. Behrens T.E.J. Wallis J.D.

In fact, most primate behavioral tasks suppress natural eye movements by requiring prolonged fixation of gaze at a single location. And in cases where gaze was not subject to strict control, there has been no analysis—or even discussion—of how value signals might relate to gaze (e.g., Bouret and Richmond, 2010Bouret S.

Specifically, subjects are more likely to choose an item if they fixate on that item longer than the alternatives. While the underlying neural mechanism is unknown, computational models suggest that the effects of fixation on choice are best explained by a value signal that is modulated by the location of gaze. In these models, choices are made by comparing and sequentially integrating over time the instantaneous value of the available items. As subjects shift their fixation between items, at any given instant the value of the fixated item is amplified relative to the unfixated ones, biasing the integration process in its favor, producing a choice bias for the items fixated longer overall. Using fMRI in humans, Lim et al., 2011Lim S.-L. O’Doherty J.P. Rangel A. The decision value computations in the vmPFC and striatum use a relative value code that is guided by visual attention.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13214-13223Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar tested this hypothesis by asking if changes in fixation target could modulate the decision value signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, see Basten et al., 2010Basten U.

Glimcher P.W. The neural correlates of subjective value during intertemporal choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). They found that vmPFC value signals were positively correlated with the value of the currently fixated object and negatively correlated with the unfixated object’s value. While these results suggest that value signals are modulated by gaze, they leave many open questions, which the current study begins to address. First, with its limited spatial and temporal resolution, fMRI cannot show whether gaze modulates value signals at the natural functional unit of the nervous system (single neurons) and at the millisecond timescale of natural free viewing. Second, the gaze studies discussed above have focused on binary choice situations, yet it is possible that gaze modulates value signals in any situation in which value is relevant, not only when facing an explicit choice. Third, an effect of gaze on value representations has not been demonstrated in non-human primates. To address these questions simultaneously, we use a behavioral task in which monkeys viewed reward-associated visual cues with no eye movement restrictions (free viewing), while we recorded single and multi-unit neural activity in a region known to express robust value signals for visual objects, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Abe and Lee, 2011Abe H.

This task explicitly manipulates the expectation of value, but, unconventionally, allows for natural gaze behavior, producing rich variation in gaze location that we then exploit to assess the effect of gaze on value coding. Importantly, reward delivery in the task did not depend on gaze behavior, meaning that any effects of gaze on value-related neural activity was not confounded by the operant demands of the task. We found strong modulation of value coding by gaze, including cells in which value signals became amplified as the fixation drew close to the cue. Overall, the encoding of fixation location was nearly as strong as the encoding of value in the OFC population, a surprising observation given the predominance of value-coding accounts of OFC in the literature (Rolls, 2015Rolls E.T. Taste, olfactory, and food reward value processing in the brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2015; 127-128: 64-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings provide, (1) novel insight into the dynamic coding of value during free viewing, (2) evidence for a key element of computational models that account for the effects of fixation on behavioral choice, and (3) a link between the dynamics of frontal lobe value signals at the areal and cellular levels (human fMRI and monkey electrophysiology, respectively). Every experimental session had two phases: an initial conditioning phase followed by neural data collection. During the conditioning phase, monkeys were trained to associate three distinct color cues with three different volumes of juice (large = ∼3 drops, small = 1 drop, and no reward = 0 drops), using a form of Pavlovian conditioning (Figure 1). New, randomly chosen colors were used in every session, and the monkeys performed the conditioning trials until they had learned the cue-reward association, indicated by different licking responses for all three cues (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 1B shows licking responses after conditioning was complete. Neurons were isolated and data collection began immediately after behavioral conditioning. The trial structure during both conditioning and data collection was identical (Figure 1A): Each trial began with a brief period of enforced gaze upon a fixation point (FP) placed at one of two locations in the screen. Then, a conditioned cue (chosen randomly) appeared at the center of the fixation window and fixation control was immediately released, allowing the monkey to move his gaze for the 4 s duration of the trial. At 4 s after cue onset, the predicted amount of juice (if any) was delivered and the trial ended. Eye position was monitored during the trial, but had no consequence on the outcome. Importantly, we only collected spike data after the cue-reward associations had been learned and licking behavior had stabilized. Thus, none of the results described here include data from the initial conditioning phase. Figure 2 shows the location of fixations during the free-viewing period, using data from 0.5 to 3.75 s after cue onset. We focus on this period to minimize the impact of the cue onset or the juice delivery on the analysis. Figure 2A depicts the eye position in a sample trial, which starts at the cue location, visits several locations on the screen (including the cue), and ends at the cue just before juice delivery. Figure 2B illustrates the distribution of fixations across the study. Both animals were more likely to fixate on the cue than anywhere else, regardless of cue identity (frequency at center grid square was significantly greater than at the square with next-highest frequency, p < 8 × 10−7 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for all six images in Figure 2B). Importantly, this is not driven by the fact that the cue is first presented at the initial FP, because the subjects almost always moved their eyes away from the cue within the first 0.5 s after cue onset (see Figure 3A for an example), and all data before 0.5 s were excluded from this analysis. Qualitatively, Figure 2B also shows that non-cue fixations were distributed widely, but tended to fall below the cue location for monkey 1 and toward the right edge of the monitor for monkey 2. Finally, the average likelihood of fixating the cue was not monotonically related to the size of the juice reward: the cue indicating a small reward was fixated more often than either the large or no reward cues by both monkey 1 (p < 9 × 10−7 for both small versus no reward and small versus large, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and monkey 2 (p < 2 × 10−5 for both comparisons).Figure 3Value and Fixation Location Encoding in a Single NeuronShow full captionAll images show the same single neuron.

See also Figure S1. The dots and squares above the PSTHs are illustrations, not the actual fixation data. Together, these results show that the fixations fluctuated widely across the screen, which is necessary for the analyses below. We leveraged the rich, natural variability in fixation location to address the key question of our study: how fixation location influenced value signals in OFC neurons. We recorded from 176 single neurons and 107 multi-unit signals (total 283, see Experimental Procedures; Figures 1C and 1D). When discussing individual neural responses, we use the terms “single unit” and “multi-unit signal” as appropriate; when referring to group-level data, we use the terms “cells” or “neurons,” which encompass both single unit and multi-unit signals. Below, we present examples of the main form of gaze modulation in the OFC, which is the encoding of fixation distance from the cue. Then, we show that this distance signal is widespread at the population level and unlikely to be due to encoding of other gaze-related variables. Finally, we show that gaze distance and value signals overlap in many cells, including in a subset of cells with value signals that are greatest when subjects fixate on the cue. Figure 3A depicts eye position and the firing of an identified single unit over one trial. In this trial, the cell fired more after fixations near the cue (gray bars in raster below x axis), but fired less following fixations away from the cue. Critically, this location-dependent modulation was strong when the “no reward” cue was shown (Figure 3B, top rows), but was weak or absent when the “small” or “large” reward was shown (Figure 3B, middle and bottom rows). Average firing rates time-locked to cue onset in each trial (Figure 3C) show that this cell fires most for the no reward cue and least for large, throughout nearly the whole trial (Figure 3C). However, trial-averaged data obscure the effect of fixation location on firing, because fixation patterns were unique in every trial. In Figure 3D, therefore, we replot these data to show firing time-locked to fixation onset, using fixations that began between 0.50 and 3.75 s after cue onset (Figure 3C, “fixations eligible for analysis,” see Experimental Procedures). Referenced to fixation onset, activity is clearly modulated by both value and fixation location: fixations near the no reward cue were followed by a burst of firing, but fixations onto the other cues elicited little or no response (Figure 3D, left). Thus, the cell’s value code—its differentiation between the cues—depends on fixation distance: it is strong following fixations onto the cue, but is weak following fixations away (Figure 3D, right). To summarize value and fixation distance encoding in this single unit, we segmented the eye position data into saccade and fixation epochs, extracted the firing in a 200 ms window following the onset of each fixation (see Experimental Procedures; Figure S1), and plotted this “fixation-evoked” firing as a function of cue value and the distance of fixation from the cue. This plot, in Figure 4A, shows the interaction between value and distance encoding exhibited by this cell: value coding is maximal when fixations land near the cue. Figures 4B–4D show three additional examples of value and fixation encoding, with patterns distinct from the cell in Figure 4A. The multi-unit signal in Figure 4B also encodes an interaction between value and location, but with the opposite effect from the cell in Figure 4A: firing does not distinguish between the cues following on-cue fixations, but does following fixations away. The multi-unit signal in Figure 4C and single unit in Figure 4D encode both value and fixation location, but in an additive, not interactive, manner. Both distinguish between the cues, and at the same time, they modulate their overall activity level depending on gaze: one fires more overall for near-to-cue fixations (Figure 4C), while the other fires more for fixations away (Figure 4D). In contrast to these four examples with both value and fixation location effects, cells that only encode either value or distance alone yield very different firing patterns, illustrated in Figures 5H–5J. We now look beyond individual examples to the population of recorded neurons (n = 283) to ask how often OFC cells encode fixation location, especially in comparison to the value signals for which this region is known, and to ask how often both value and location are encoded by individual cells. We fit for every cell (single unit or multi-unit signal) a linear model that explains firing as a function of three variables: cue value, distance of fixation from the cue, and the value-by-distance interaction (here, cue value is its associated reward volume, because the cue-reward association as well as reward timing and probability remain constant throughout the session). We then ask how many cells show statistically significant effects of value or gaze alone, and, critically, how many show both effects, or show an interaction between value and gaze (as in Figures 3, 4A, and 4B). We also address the encoding of gaze-related variables other than fixation distance. Table 1 shows the percentage of OFC neurons with significant effects of cue value, fixation distance from the cue, and the value-by-distance interaction in the generalized linear models (GLM). Many cells had significant effects of cue value, consistent with prior observations (Morrison and Salzman, 2009Morrison S.E. Salzman C.D.

Taste, olfactory, and food reward value processing in the brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2015; 127-128: 64-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Critically, nearly as many were significantly modulated by fixation distance or the value-by-distance interaction. The number of cells encoding these fixation variables reached its maximum around 200 ms after fixation onset, consistent with the typical visual response latency in OFC (Figure S2). For all variables, the number of neurons with significant effects far exceeded chance levels (p < 0.001), established by a permutation test (Table 1, right column). In Table S1, we further explore these results, showing: (1) results were similar for the two subjects, with the exception that monkey 2 had fewer significant effects of value and gaze distance. (2) Results were similar for single and multi-unit signals. And (3) results were similar when the GLM was performed using the same post-fixation firing window in all cells (rather than the cell-specific windows used in the main analysis, see Experimental Procedures).Table 1Significant Effects in GLMPercent of Neurons with Effects at p < 0.05aThe percentage of neurons (out of 283) significantly modulated by variables in a GLM (Equation 1).

Here we identified that the lysine-specific demethylase KDM3A played a dual role in breast cancer cell invasion and apoptosis by demethylating histone and the non-histone protein p53, respectively. While inducing pro-invasive genes by erasing repressive histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, KDM3A promotes chemoresistance by demethylating p53. KDM3A suppressed pro-apoptotic functions of p53 by erasing p53-K372me1, as this methylation is crucial for the stability of chromatin-bound p53. Unexpectedly, depletion of KDM3A was capable of reactivating mutated p53 to induce the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in breast cancer with mutant p53. Moreover, KDM3A knockdown also potently inhibited tumorigenic potentials of breast cancer stem-like cells and rendered them sensitive to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Taken together, our results suggest that KDM3A might be a potential therapeutic target for human breast cancer treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2419324264,"Forgetting, one part of the brain's memory management system, provides balance to the encoding and consolidation of new information by removing unused or unwanted memories or by suppressing their expression. Recent studies identified the small G protein, Rac1, as a key player in the Drosophila mushroom bodies neurons (MBn) for active forgetting. We subsequently discovered that a few dopaminergic neurons (DAn) that innervate the MBn mediate forgetting. Here we show that Scribble, a scaffolding protein known primarily for its role as a cell polarity determinant, orchestrates the intracellular signaling for normal forgetting. Knocking down scribble expression in either MBn or DAn impairs normal memory loss. Scribble interacts physically and genetically with Rac1, Pak3, and Cofilin within MBn, nucleating a forgetting signalosome that is downstream of dopaminergic inputs that regulate forgetting. These results bind disparate molecular players in active forgetting into a single signaling pathway: Dopamine→ Dopamine Receptor→ Scribble→ Rac→ Cofilin."

Here we show that KIF1A-haploinsufficient mice developed sensory neuropathy. We found progressive loss of TrkA(+) sensory neurons in Kif1a(+/-) dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Moreover, axonal transport of TrkA was significantly disrupted in Kif1a(+/-) neurons. Live imaging and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that KIF1A bound to TrkA-containing vesicles through the adaptor GTP-Rab3, suggesting that TrkA is a cargo of the KIF1A motor. Physiological measurements revealed a weaker capsaicin response in Kif1a(+/-) DRG neurons. Moreover, these neurons were hyposensitive to nerve growth factor, which could explain the reduced neuronal survival and the functional deficiency of the pain receptor TRPV1. Because phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling significantly rescued these phenotypes and also increased Kif1a mRNA, we propose that KIF1A is essential for the survival and function of sensory neurons because of the TrkA transport and its synergistic support of the NGF/TrkA/PI3K signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2412321191,"Key molecular drivers that underlie transformation of colonic epithelium into colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) are well described. However, the mechanisms through which clinically targeted pathways are activated during CRC progression have yet to be elucidated. Here, we used an integrative genomics approach to examine CRC progression. We used laser capture microdissection to isolate colonic crypt cells, differentiated surface epithelium, adenomas, carcinomas and metastases, and used gene expression profiling to identify pathways that were differentially expressed between the different cell types. We identified a number of potentially important transcriptional changes in developmental and oncogenic pathways, and noted a marked upregulation of EREG in primary and metastatic cancer cells. We confirmed this pattern of gene expression by in situ hybridization and observed staining consistent with autocrine expression in the tumor cells. Upregulation of EREG during the adenoma–carcinoma transition was associated with demethylation of two key sites within its promoter, and this was accompanied by an increase in the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, as assessed by reverse-phase protein analysis. In CRC cell lines, we demonstrated that EREG demethylation led to its transcriptional upregulation, higher levels of EGFR phosphorylation, and sensitization to EGFR inhibitors. Low levels of EREG methylation in patients who received cetuximab as part of a phase II study were associated with high expression of the ligand and a favorable response to therapy. Conversely, high levels of promoter methylation and low levels of EREG expression were observed in tumors that progressed after treatment. We also noted an inverse correlation between EREG methylation and expression levels in several other cancers, including those of the head and neck, lung and bladder. Therefore, we propose that upregulation of EREG expression through promoter demethylation might be an important means of activating the EGFR pathway during the genesis of CRC and potentially other cancers."

Three major forms of O-glycosylation are predicted to occur at consensus sites within the epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular domain of the receptor: O-fucosylation, O-glucosylation, and O-GlcNAcylation. We have performed comprehensive mass spectral analyses of these three types of O-glycosylation on Drosophila Notch produced in S2 cells and identified peptides containing all 22 predicted O-fucose sites, all 18 predicted O-glucose sites, and all 18 putative O-GlcNAc sites. Using semiquantitative mass spectral methods, we have evaluated the occupancy and relative amounts of glycans at each site. The majority of the O-fucose sites were modified to high stoichiometries. Upon expression of the β3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Fringe with Notch, we observed varying degrees of elongation beyond O-fucose monosaccharide, indicating that Fringe preferentially modifies certain sites more than others. Rumi modified O-glucose sites to high stoichiometries, although elongation of the O-glucose was site-specific. Although the current putative consensus sequence for O-GlcNAcylation predicts 18 O-GlcNAc sites on Notch, we only observed apparent O-GlcNAc modification at five sites.

https://openalex.org/W2414877112,"Patrick H O'Farrell and Hansong Ma simultaneously introduce mitochondrial genomes from distantly related strains or other species into Drosophila melanogaster, rate fly fitness and follow mitochondrial DNA transmission. They find evidence for selfish selection, where genomes with compromised function outcompete fully competent ones, and identify mitochondrial sequences responsible for the selfish behavior. Mitochondrial genomes compete for transmission from mother to progeny. We explored this competition by introducing a second genome into Drosophila melanogaster to follow transmission. Competitions between closely related genomes favored those functional in electron transport, resulting in a host-beneficial purifying selection1. In contrast, matchups between distantly related genomes often favored those with negligible, negative or lethal consequences, indicating selfish selection. Exhibiting powerful selfish selection, a genome carrying a detrimental mutation displaced a complementing genome, leading to population death after several generations. In a different pairing, opposing selfish and purifying selection counterbalanced to give stable transmission of two genomes. Sequencing of recombinant mitochondrial genomes showed that the noncoding region, containing origins of replication, governs selfish transmission. Uniparental inheritance prevents encounters between distantly related genomes. Nonetheless, in each maternal lineage, constant competition among sibling genomes selects for super-replicators. We suggest that this relentless competition drives positive selection, promoting change in the sequences influencing transmission."

We recently reported that targeting a key oxidative PPP enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), using our novel small-molecule 6PGD inhibitors Physcion and its derivative S3, shows anticancer effects. Notably, humans with genetic deficiency of either 6PGD or another oxidative PPP enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibit non-immune hemolytic anemia upon exposure to aspirin and various antimalarial drugs. Inspired by these clinical observations, we examined the anticancer potential of combined treatment with 6PGD inhibitors and antimalarial drugs. We found that stable knockdown of 6PGD sensitizes leukemia cells to antimalarial agent dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Combined treatment with DHA and Physcion activates AMP-activated protein kinase, leading to synergistic inhibition of human leukemia cell viability. Moreover, our combined therapy synergistically attenuates tumor growth in xenograft nude mice injected with human K562 leukemia cells and cell viability of primary leukemia cells from human patients, but shows minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells in mice as well as red blood cells and mononucleocytes from healthy human donors.

Synapses are key elements in the organization and function of neuronal circuits. The assembly of synapses is a progressive process that depends on the alignment and differentiation of pre- and postsynaptic structures. Initial synaptic associations involve surface recognition and adhesion, with acquired proximity permitting signals from the pre- and postsynaptic structures to induce specialized features of the complementary synaptic element (Akins and Biederer, 2006Akins M.R. Biederer T. Cell-cell interactions in synaptogenesis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).

Once synaptic structures are established, a process of highly dynamic communication between synaptic partners transmits neural information and maintains synaptic homeostasis. However, in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), it remains unclear what retrograde molecular signals induce presynaptic differentiation and support homeostatic adaptations of synaptic function in local circuits. Intrinsic neural activity and postsynaptic trophic signals have been implicated in the control of presynaptic differentiation (Andreae and Burrone, 2014Andreae L.C. Burrone J. The role of neuronal activity and transmitter release on synapse formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neuronal activity can act through cell-autonomous mechanisms to activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and downstream Ca2+-triggered signaling pathways (Greenberg et al., 1986Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Stimulation of neuronal acetylcholine receptors induces rapid gene transcription.Science. 1986; 234: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Independently, activity-driven neurotransmitter release can act cell autonomously, signaling through autoreceptors, to influence presynaptic function (Bewick et al., 2005Bewick G.S. Reid B. Richardson C. Banks R.W. Autogenic modulation of mechanoreceptor excitability by glutamate release from synaptic-like vesicles: evidence from the rat muscle spindle primary sensory ending.J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), as well as nonautonomously, to influence the presynaptic differentiation of neighboring synapses via local diffusion (Kullmann and Asztely, 1998Kullmann D.M.

Neuronal activity also regulates expression of trophic factors important for synaptic development (Hong et al., 2008Hong E.J. McCord A.E. Greenberg M.E.

Neurotrophins as synaptic modulators.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). However, how presumed homeostatic signals that influence presynaptic differentiation in the CNS converge to direct the complex and multifaceted biochemical differentiation of a single synaptic terminal remains unclear. Many studies of synaptic differentiation have focused on inhibitory interneurons, given the biochemical and functional diversity of their neuronal subclasses (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Anderson S.A. Barrionuevo G. Benavides-Piccione R. Burkhalter A. Buzsáki G. Cauli B. Defelipe J. Fairén A. et al.Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature GroupPetilla terminology: nomenclature of features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). At a functional level, inhibitory interneurons within the same microcircuit can exhibit distinct synaptic dynamics, reflecting the specialized character of different inhibitory terminals (Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006Glickfeld L.L. Scanziani M. Distinct timing in the activity of cannabinoid-sensitive and cannabinoid-insensitive basket cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Inhibitory synaptic terminals can also differ in their choice of neurotransmitter, predominantly GABA or glycine. Moreover, even within a single inhibitory neuronal class, multiple genes encoding different transmitter synthetic enzymes, synaptic vesicle proteins, and membrane channels can be expressed (Cauli et al., 1997Cauli B.

Both enzymes synthesize GABA and thus determine net neuronal GABA expression (Asada et al., 1997Asada H. Kawamura Y. Maruyama K. Kume H. Ding R.G. Kanbara N. Kuzume H. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Obata K.

USA. 1997; 94: 6496-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). GAD67 is expressed in the cytosol of most GABAergic neurons and produces the majority of basal-level neurotransmitter released at GABAergic synapses (Asada et al., 1997Asada H. Kawamura Y. Maruyama K. Kume H. Ding R.G. Kanbara N. Kuzume H. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Obata K.

In contrast, GAD65, which is expressed with GAD67 in a subset of GABAergic neurons, is vesicle bound and ensures GABA synthesis during prolonged synaptic transmission (Esclapez et al., 1994Esclapez M.

These different molecular characteristics permit individual terminals to respond to the physiological demands of their particular circuit. In the spinal cord, GABApre neurons form highly specialized axo-axonic synapses with the terminals of primary sensory afferents, providing the anatomical substrate for presynaptic inhibition. GABApre neurons can be distinguished from other spinal inhibitory interneurons in that they coexpress GAD65 in conjunction with GAD67 (Betley et al., 2009Betley J.N. Wright C.V. Kawaguchi Y. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Jessell T.M. Kaltschmidt J.A.

USA. 2005; 102: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BDNF released by sensory terminals acts on GABApre terminals to promote synaptic terminal accumulation of GAD65 (Betley et al., 2009Betley J.N. Wright C.V. Kawaguchi Y. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Jessell T.M. Kaltschmidt J.A. Stringent specificity in the construction of a GABAergic presynaptic inhibitory circuit.Cell. 2009; 139: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GAD67 levels are not affected in the absence of BDNF, suggesting that these two GABA synthetic enzymes are differentially regulated. More broadly, this distinction raises the possibility that multiple regulatory pathways act in parallel or hierarchically to influence the functional differentiation of GABApre presynaptic terminals. Here we have explored the roles of activity-evoked transmitter release from sensory afferents in the differentiation and function of GABApre inhibitory terminals. We have used mouse molecular genetics to manipulate glutamate release from proprioceptive sensory terminals and glutamate receptor expression in GABApre neurons, examining the consequences of these manipulations on GAD enzyme expression by GABApre neurons and on presynaptic inhibition. Compromising glutamate release from sensory terminals by inactivating the predominant vesicular glutamate transporter vGluT1 elicits a marked reduction in GABApre GAD67 levels and functionally reduces the strength of presynaptic inhibition. Similarly, inactivating the mGluR1β receptor, which we show is expressed at GABApre terminals, reduces GAD67 expression and presynaptic inhibition. In addition, we find that depletion of glutamate release lowers spinal cord BDNF levels and GABApre terminal GAD65 levels, implying an upstream hierarchical role for activity-dependent glutamate release in coordinating both GABA synthetic enzymes. Together, these results indicate that distinct sensory-derived signals act together to determine the specialized presynaptic differentiation and function of a defined set of inhibitory interneurons in the mammalian CNS. Functionally, this constellation of signaling mechanisms supports a homeostatic feedback system by which sensory-derived glutamate controls GABA release from GABApre terminals to constrain activity across the sensory-motor synapse. To assess the role of sensory-derived glutamate release in the differentiation and function of GABApre terminals, we used a mouse model in which the major vesicular glutamate transporter, vGluT1, utilized in proprioceptive synapses, was eliminated (Alvarez et al., 2004Alvarez F.J.

Tourtellotte W.G. Arber S. Jessell T.M. Degradation of mouse locomotor pattern in the absence of proprioceptive sensory feedback.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We confirmed complete absence of vGluT1 from proprioceptive terminals in postnatal day (p)12 and p21 vGluT1 mutant mice (Figures 1A–1C; see Figures S1A, S1B, S1E–S1F′′′, S1K, and S1L available online). We further found that loss of vGluT1 did not lead to upregulation of the other two vesicular glutamate transporters, vGluT2 and vGluT3 (Figures S1E–S1F′′′; data not shown). To measure the sensory-motor monosynaptic reflex in vGluT1 mutants, we employed a spinal cord in vitro preparation (Jiang et al., 1999Jiang Z. Carlin K.P. Brownstone R.M.

In rodents, during the first 2 weeks after birth, proprioceptive synapses depress readily at frequencies as low as 1 Hz under in vitro conditions (Lev-Tov and Pinco, 1992Lev-Tov A. Pinco M.

Short-term synaptic depression in the neonatal mouse spinal cord: effects of calcium and temperature.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 2047-2062PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore compared the efficacy of glutamate release in wild-type (WT) and vGluT1 mutant mice by measuring the amplitude of the ventral root reflex following successive dorsal root stimuli at 1Hz. We saw no difference in the amplitude of the monosynaptically mediated reflex between vGluT1 mutant and WT mice at the first trial; however, we noticed a significant reduction with successive trials of stimulation in vGluT1 mutants (Figure 1F). The monosynaptic reflex recorded from WT mice was depressed by 45% at the second stimulus and reached its maximum depression (∼60%) by the fifth stimulus, consistent with previous reports (Figures 1E and 1F) (Li and Burke, 2001Li Y. Burke R.E. Short-term synaptic depression in the neonatal mouse spinal cord: effects of calcium and temperature.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 2047-2062PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, vGluT1 mutants revealed a more prominent reduction in synaptic depression compared to WT mice from the second trial (∼70%), reaching a maximum level of depression (∼90%) by the fifth trial (Figures 1E and 1F). These results demonstrate that glutamate neurotransmission in proprioceptive synapses is severely impaired in the absence of vGluT1. To test the role of glutamate release in the formation of GABApre-sensory contacts, we first assessed whether the differentiation of proprioceptive neurons and their synapses on motor neurons occurs normally in vGluT1 mutant mice. We found that dorsal root ganglia in vGluT1 mutants expressed normal numbers of Parvalbumin (Pv)ON and Runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3)ON sensory neurons (Figure 1D) (Chen et al., 2006Chen A.I. de Nooij J.C.

Also, PvON sensory terminals in vGluT1 mutants normally coexpressed the presynaptic marker SV2B (Grønborg et al., 2010Grønborg M. Pavlos N.J. Brunk I. Chua J.J. Münster-Wandowski A. Riedel D. Ahnert-Hilger G. Urlaub H. Jahn R. Quantitative comparison of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicles unveils selectivity for few proteins including MAL2, a novel synaptic vesicle protein.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and aligned with the postsynaptic marker Shank1a (Figures 1A–1B′′′; Figures S1K–S1N′′). Finally, analysis at the ultrastructural level revealed that proprioceptive terminals showed only a modest decrease in active zone (AZ) length (∼17%; Figures S1G–S1I) and a similarly modest decrease in the density of synaptic vesicles near the AZ (∼14%; Figures S1G, S1H, and S1J). Thus, the early differentiation of proprioceptive synapses appears relatively unaffected by loss of vGluT1. We next examined whether the loss of vGluT1 from proprioceptive sensory terminals impacts the organization of GABApre terminals. We observed no change in number and size of GABApre contacts on sensory afferent terminals between WT and vGluT1 mutant mice (Figures S2F and S2G). To analyze GABApre terminal differentiation, we analyzed expression of the GABA-synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 in p21 GABApre synaptic terminals (Betley et al., 2009Betley J.N. Wright C.V. Kawaguchi Y. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Jessell T.M. Kaltschmidt J.A. Stringent specificity in the construction of a GABAergic presynaptic inhibitory circuit.Cell. 2009; 139: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GAD67 expression levels were reduced by 52% in vGluT1 mutants as compared to WT mice (Figures 2A–2C; for similar p12 values see Figures S2A–S2C). To test the possibility that loss of vGluT1 affects GABApre terminal GAD67 expression by diminishing potential direct sensory input onto GABApre interneurons, we assessed GAD67 levels at terminals of GABApost interneurons, which form contacts directly on motor neurons and are known to receive direct sensory afferent input. We found that the level of GAD67 in GABApost terminals was not affected in vGluT1 mutants (Figure 2C), indicating that reduced glutamate release leads to a decrease in GAD67 expression specifically in GABApre terminals. We next assessed whether GAD65 was also altered in GABApre terminals of vGluT1 mutant mice. vGluT1 mutant mice exhibited significantly reduced levels of GAD65 in GABApre terminals compared to WT mice (49%; Figures 2A–2C; for similar p12 values, see Figures S2A–S2C). Since GAD65 is vesicle bound, we considered whether the reduction of GAD65 might be due to a reduced number of synaptic vesicles in vGluT1 mutant GABApre terminals. We quantified the density of synaptic vesicles in GABApre terminals in WT and vGluT1 mutant mice. To label synaptic vesicles in GABApre terminals, we intercrossed Gad65-N45GFP mice—previously shown to label ≥95% of GABApre terminals (Betley et al., 2009Betley J.N. Wright C.V. Kawaguchi Y. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Jessell T.M. Kaltschmidt J.A. Stringent specificity in the construction of a GABAergic presynaptic inhibitory circuit.Cell. 2009; 139: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)—with vGluT1 mutants. Analysis at the ultrastructural level (EM single immunolabeling-GFP) revealed no significant difference in the density of synaptic vesicles in GABApre terminals between Gad65-N45GFP and Gad65-N45GFP; vGluT1−/− mice (Figure S2H). This suggests that the observed decrease in the amount of GAD65 localized to the GABApre terminal is not due to a decrease in synaptic vesicle number. Taken together, the significant reduction in localization of the GABA-synthesizing enzymes to GABApre terminals seen in vGluT1 mutants suggests that compromised sensory-derived glutamate release affects the synaptic terminal differentiation of GABApre neurons. Given that GAD levels are reduced in GABApre terminals of vGluT1 mutant mice, we assessed whether loss of vGluT1 has a functional impact on presynaptic inhibition. We used an in vitro conditioning paradigm to measure the efficacy of presynaptic inhibition (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). In this protocol, the amplitude of the monosynaptic reflex evoked by homonymous dorsal root stimulation was compared to that evoked by time-conditioned stimulation of the adjacent dorsal root (Figures 3A–3C; Figures S3A–S3C). At long conditioning intervals (>300 ms), there was a gradual reduction of the monosynaptically evoked response, reaching statistical significance at conditioning intervals of 700–900 ms (Figure 3D; Figure S3D). Blockade of GABAA receptors with bicuculline reversed this reduction, but application of strychnine, a glycine receptor blocker, did not (Figures 3E and 3F; Figures S3E and S3F), suggesting that the conditioned reduction in monosynaptically evoked response was due to GABAergic presynaptic inhibition. To assess presynaptic inhibition in vGluT1 mutant mice, we took advantage of the observation that with a single stimulus, the monosynaptically mediated reflex in vGluT1 mutant mice was comparable to that of WT mice (inset in Figure 3A). The specific AMPA receptor blocker, NBQX, abolished this monosynaptic response (Figures S1C and S1D), confirming that neurotransmission at the proprioceptive synapses in vGluT1 mutant mice was glutamatergic in nature. We assessed the strength of presynaptic inhibition in vGluT1 mutant mice using the in vitro conditioning paradigm. In vGluT1 mutants, the strength of presynaptic inhibition was ∼50% reduced as compared to WT mice (WT, ∼35%; vGluT1−/−, ∼18%; conditioning interval, 700–900 ms; Figures 3D–3F). These results suggest that the reduction of GAD synthesizing enzymes seen in vGluT1 mutants has significant functional consequences for the strength of presynaptic inhibition. We next examined whether glutamate influences the level of GAD65 and GAD67 in GABApre terminals. To assess whether glutamate might signal to GABApre terminals directly, we examined the expression of glutamate receptors on GABApre terminals. Presynaptic glutamate receptors have been shown to influence synaptic neurotransmitter release through a variety of mechanisms (Pinheiro and Mulle, 2008Pinheiro P.S. Mulle C. Presynaptic glutamate receptors: physiological functions and mechanisms of action.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Unlike fast-acting ionotropic glutamate receptors, activation of metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) can last for long periods of time (Conn and Pin, 1997Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Since proprioceptive activity is relatively high even at quiescent periods (Prochazka, 1999Prochazka A. Quantifying proprioception.Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 123: 133-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mGluRs are strong candidates to be acting as sensors for sustained glutamate release (Eccles et al., 1962Eccles J.C. Kostyuk P.G. Schmidt R.F. Central pathways responsible for depolarization of primary afferent fibres.J. Physiol. 1962; 161: 237-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To identify mGluR gene expression in postnatal spinal neurons, we carried out in situ hybridization analysis in p6 lumbar spinal cord, an age when GABApre neurons have formed clearly defined boutons on proprioceptive afferent terminals (Betley et al., 2009Betley J.N.

AR complex formation by multiple transcription factors is important for enhancer activity and transcriptional regulation. However, the significance of such collaborative transcription factors has not been fully understood. In this study, we show that Oct1, an AR collaborative factor, coordinates genome-wide AR signaling for prostate cancer growth. Using global analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that Oct1 is recruited to AR-binding enhancer/promoter regions and facilitates androgen signaling. Moreover, a major target of AR/Oct1 complex, acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3), contributes to tumor growth in nude mice, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Next, we examined the therapeutic effects of pyrrole-imidazole polyamides that target the Oct1-binding sequence identified in the center of the ACSL3 AR-binding site. We observed that treatment with Oct1 polyamide severely blocked the Oct1 binding at the ACSL3 enhancer responsible for its transcriptional activity and ACSL3 induction. In addition, Oct1 polyamides suppressed castration-resistant tumor growth and specifically repressed global Oct1 chromatin association and androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells, with few nonspecific effects on basal promoter activity. Thus, targeting Oct1 binding could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AR-activated castration-resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2414346120,"Phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) is the effector enzyme in the phototransduction cascade and is critical for the health of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Its dysfunction, caused by mutations in either the enzyme itself or AIPL1 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1), leads to retinal diseases culminating in blindness. Progress in research on PDE6 and AIPL1 has been severely hampered by failure to express functional PDE6 in a heterologous expression system. Here, we demonstrated that AIPL1 is an obligate chaperone of PDE6 and that it enables low yield functional folding of cone PDE6C in cultured cells. We further show that the AIPL1-mediated production of folded PDE6C is markedly elevated in the presence of the inhibitory Pγ-subunit of PDE6. As illustrated in this study, a simple and sensitive system in which AIPL1 and Pγ are co-expressed with PDE6 represents an effective tool for probing structure-function relationships of AIPL1 and reliably establishing the pathogenicity of its variants."

SLiMs are sequences of ∼3–10 amino acid residues typically located in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which may become structured upon binding. This entropically unfavorable disorder-to-order transition upon binding permits transient interactions of relatively low affinity but high specificity. In the context of complex signaling networks, decoupling affinity from specificity brings in functional advantages, as both rapid association and dissociation are required. Intracellular signaling is typically under tight regulation. Tightly regulated processes are frail and constantly targeted by various pathogens, which mimic the SLiMs and are able to hijack (or disconnect) part of the signaling pathway to their own needs by fine-tuning of amino acid composition of the pathogenic effector (3Davey N.E.

Amphiphysin-2/BIN1 has key roles in regulation of endocytosis and membrane recycling, cytoskeleton regulation, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 4Prokic I.

It is widely expressed in different tissues in >10 isoforms. All isoforms have in common an N-terminal BAR (BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain capable of forming crescent-shaped dimers and sensing and inducing membrane curvature (5Mim C.

Amphiphysin SH3 domain (referred hereafter to as amp-SH3) interacts among others with dynamin (6Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P.

Biol. 2005; 351: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that amphiphysin is targeted by several alphaviruses (9Neuvonen M. Kazlauskas A. Martikainen M. Hinkkanen A. Ahola T. Saksela K. et al.SH3 domain-mediated recruitment of host cell amphiphysins by Alphavirus nsP3 promotes viral RNA replication.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002383Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the genus containing ∼30 members including Chikungunya (CHIKV), Semliki forest (SFV), and Sindbis viruses. Alphavirus RNA replication takes place in small membrane invaginations, spherules, protruding initially from the surface of the plasma membrane and at a later stage of the infection from the surface of cytopathic vacuoles type I (10Spuul P. Balistreri G. Kääriäinen L. Ahola T. et al.Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, actin-, and microtubule-dependent transport of Semliki Forest Virus replication complexes from the plasma membrane to modified lysosomes.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 7543-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The latter are modified endo- and lysosomes with the viral replication complex consisting of nonstructural proteins nsP1-nsP4 on their surface. The role of nsP3 in the replication complex remains less clear. It has three domains, the N-terminal macrodomain with phosphatase activity and nucleic acid binding ability, the Alphavirus unique domain, and the hypervariable C-terminal region. Mutational studies focused on the structurally conserved N-terminal macrodomain have pinpointed its role in RNA synthesis (11Park E. Griffin D.E. et al.The nsP3 macro domain is important for Sindbis virus replication in neurons and neurovirulence in mice.Virology. 2009; 388: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite its poor conservation, the C-terminal tail region of nsP3 is essential for virulence of alphaviruses (12Tuittila M. Hinkkanen A.E. et al.Amino acid mutations in the replicase protein nsP3 of Semliki Forest virus cumulatively affect neurovirulence.J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nsP3 C-terminal domain harbors a conserved proline-rich motif (P(I/V)(P/A)PPR) that targets the SH3 domain of amphiphysin. This proline-rich region recruits the amp-SH3 to the site of viral replication complex, and mutation of Arg with Glu completely abolishes the interaction with amp-SH3 and drastically suppressed the virus replication in vitro (9Neuvonen M. Kazlauskas A. Martikainen M. Hinkkanen A. Ahola T. Saksela K. et al.SH3 domain-mediated recruitment of host cell amphiphysins by Alphavirus nsP3 promotes viral RNA replication.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002383Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a similar P(I/V)(P/A)PPR motif is found in the NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which also has been reported as a ligand for amp-SH3 (13Zech B. Kurtenbach A. Krieger N. Strand D. Blencke S. Morbitzer M. Salassidis K. Cotten M. Wissing J. Obert S. Bartenschlager R. Herget T. Daub H. et al.Identification and characterization of amphiphysin II as a novel cellular interaction partner of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein.J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HCV belongs to flaviviruses and is thus very different from alphaviruses. However, it is also a positive-strand RNA virus adapted to replication within membranous structures appearing in infected cells (14Moradpour D. Gosert R. Egger D. Penin F. Blum H.E. Bienz K. et al.Membrane association of hepatitis C virus nonstructural proteins and identification of the membrane alteration that harbors the viral replication complex.Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this viral amp-SH3 binding motif is markedly different from the PXRPXR consensus motif reported for cellular amp-SH3 ligands (7Cestra G. Castagnoli L. Dente L. Minenkova O. Petrelli A. Migone N. Hoffmüller U. Schneider-Mergener J.

In this work we have employed solution state NMR spectroscopy to solve the structure of amp-SH3 in complex with CHIKV nsP3. Further characterization using NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), site-directed mutagenesis, and bioinformatics indicate that the SH3 binding epitope in dynamin is larger than previously described and that binding sites of the cellular ligand dynamin and viral proteins on amp-SH3 are similar. Mimicking the dynamin proline-rich motif permits alphaviruses to recruit amphiphysin to the viral replication complex. Through binding epitope fine-tuning alphaviruses obtain, however, a drastically higher affinity to amp-SH3. Analysis of dynamin using bioinformatics tools reveals that its C-terminal tail, devoid of any secondary structure, is predicted to belong to the class of intrinsically disordered regions (see Fig. 2A). To characterize the interaction between dynamin and amp-SH3, we produced a 29-residue dynamin peptide (dynamin hereafter) from its C-terminal tail, 820GASPDPFGPPPQVPSRPNRAPPGVPSRSG848, which contains the previously defined PXRPXR epitope shown to be essential for amp-SH3 recognition (15Grabs D.

See Fig. 1 for the sequence alignment of all peptides used and discussed. We performed a peptide binding assay in which unlabeled dynamin was titrated into 15N-labeled amp-SH3, and binding-induced chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were monitored using the 1H,15N HSQC NMR experiment. It was observed that peaks shifted linearly with the addition of peptide, indicating a bimolecular complex exchanging in intermediate-to-fast NMR time scale, which is a fast dissociating complex. Mapping of CSPs onto the structure showed that dynamin binds to the canonical SH3 binding site in amphiphysin 2 (Fig. 2B). The largest CSPs, δΔ > 0.1 ppm, were observed for residues Thr-534 and Glu-538 in the RT loop and Asp-559 in the n-Src loop as well as Val-583–Phe-588 in the 310 helix and residues flanking it. All residues showing significant CSPs were located on the rims of the canonical hydrophobic peptide binding groove.FIGURE 2.Dynamin and its interaction with amp-SH3.

Chemical shift assignment of dynamin in amp-SH3-bound form turned out to be a non-straightforward process due to line-broadening caused by intermediate exchange as well as multiple conformations observed for residues outside the binding epitope (Fig. 2C). Intermolecular NOEs between dynamin residues 830PQVP833 and aromatic residues in amp-SH3 were observed, these aromatic residues most probably corresponding to Trp-562 and Phe-588 in the canonical hydrophobic binding pockets (explicit NOE peak assignment was not performed). No unambiguous intermolecular NOEs were observed outside the tetrapeptide. However, the proton resonances of Arg-835 were significantly up-field-shifted, presumably due to the proximity of amp-SH3 Trp-562. Additionally, for residues 831–838 a single set of peaks was observed in the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum whereas for residues at peptide termini, 820–827 and 839–848, two or three sets of peaks were present (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that amp-SH3 recognizes 830PQVPSRPNR838 as the binding epitope in dynamin. This corresponds to a PXXPXRPXR consensus sequence, where prolines 1 and 4 establish the classical PXXP motif. The C-terminal RPXR tetrapeptide element targets the specificity zone of amp-SH3, most probably through an interaction similar to that described below for the amp-SH3·CHIKV complex. Thus, we propose that amp-SH3 recognizes PXXPXR(P)XR-type ligands that harbor the PXRPXR consensus motif identified earlier (15Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C.

Binding thermodynamics was obtained using ITC (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). In agreement with the results obtained using NMR spectroscopy, dynamin binds amp-SH3 with relatively low affinity, the dissociation constant (Kd 8.9 μm). The binding is driven by strong negative enthalpy (ΔH = −76.5 kJ/mol), which is counterbalanced by a large entropic penalty (−TΔS = 47.7 kJ/mol).TABLE 1Amp-SH3 binding thermodynamics measured using ITC1 A minus sign signifies one conformation present for dynamin in the dynamin·amp-SH3 complex.

Simon I. et al.IUPred: web server for the prediction of intrinsically unstructured regions of proteins based on estimated energy content.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3433-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar) shows that the nsP3 proteins of several alphaviruses, including CHIKV and SFV, have a tendency for disorder in the C-terminal portion (Fig. 4A). We sought to understand on the structural level how these viruses recruit amphiphysin-2 to alphaviral replication complexes. To this end, peptides from CHIKV nsP3 (1728STVPVAPPRRRRGRNLT1744, with the Class II consensus sequence in bold) and SFV nsP3 (1733LENPIPPPRPKRAAYLA1750) as well as the related peptide from NS5A of HCV subtype 1a (2320RSPPVPPPRKRRTVVLT2336) were titrated into 15N-labeled amp-SH3, and binding-induced CSPs were monitored in 1H,15N HSQC spectra. The three peptides induced the same type of changes in the spectra: with increasing peptide concentration, peaks of the free form of amp-SH3 disappeared while those of the bound form simultaneously appeared (Fig. 4B). This indicates slow complex dissociation in the NMR time scale associated with high affinity binding. Moreover, all three peptides were found to occupy the same binding site given that ligand-induced CSPs were observed for the same residues in amp-SH3 (Fig. 4B). Further analysis of CHIKV nsP3 binding using ITC (Table 1 and Fig. 3B) showed that the affinity of this viral peptide to amp-SH3 is unusually high, with a Kd of 0.024 μm, clearly among the strongest found for SH3 domains (18Li S.S. et al.Specificity and versatility of SH3 and other proline-recognition domains: structural basis and implications for cellular signal transduction.Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). amp-SH3 interacts with SFV nsP3 with an almost 10-fold lower but, nevertheless, high affinity (Kd 0.16 μm). We did not carry out ITC measurements for the HCV NS5A peptide, but based on the slow exchange kinetics observed in NMR titration and its highly similar amino acid composition with CHIKV and SFV, we presume that it also has a similar high amp-SH3 binding affinity. Indeed, a slowly dissociating complex in NMR-based titration experiments and a Kd of 0.24 μm for the subtype 1b peptide of HCV NS5A (347TKAPPIPPPRRKRTV361) and amp-SH3 have recently been reported (19Aladag A. Hoffmann S. Stoldt M. Bösing C. Willbold D. Schwarten M. et al.Hepatitis C virus NS5A is able to competitively displace c-Myc from the Bin1 SH3 domain in vitro.J. Pept. Sci. 2014; 20: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To investigate on the structural determinants leading to the very high affinity, we determined the structure of amp-SH3 in complex with CHIKV nsP3 peptide using solution state NMR. Rather than resorting to differently labeled components of the complex and isotope-filtered spectroscopy, we mixed uniformly 13C,15N-labeled CHIKV nsP3 and amp-SH3 in 1:1 concentration ratio and measured a conventional set of triple-resonance experiments as well as 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY experiments for the assignment of amp-SH3 and CHIKV nsP3 resonances and collection of intra- and intermolecular distance restraints. The solution structure of the amp-SH3·CHIKV complex is presented in Fig. 5A. The 20 lowest energy structures overlay well, the backbone (N, Cα, C′) and heavy atom r.m.s.d. being 0.36 and 0.74 Å, respectively, for the structured regions of the protein (residues 516–593) and peptide (1730–1736) (Table 2) . amp-SH3 adopts the typical SH3 domain-fold consisting of five β strands, connected by the RT loop between β1 and β2, the n-Src loop between β2 and β3, and the distal loop between β3 and β4. A short helical stretch connects β4 to β5. The structure of amp-SH3 in complex with CHIKV is very similar to that of its free form (PDB code 1MUZ; Ref. 16Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D.

Structural differences are observed at the peptide binding interface where the side chains of Asp-559, Trp-562, and Phe-588, in direct contact with the peptide in the complex, reposition for optimal interaction. Also, side chains in the cluster of negatively charged residues Asp-535, Asp-537, and Glu-538 in the RT loop and Glu-556 and Glu-557 in the n-Src loop are reoriented to better face the C-terminal arginines of the CHIKV peptide. Side-chain dispersion of residues in the negatively charged cluster is much higher in the complex form, mirroring the conformational heterogeneity of the peptide arginine side chains.TABLE 2Structural statistics of the amp-SH3·CHIKV complexCompleteness of resonance assignmentsaBackbone includes Cα, Cβ, N, and H atoms, except the N-terminal amide.

The 1730VPVAPPR1736 binding motif interacts with amp-SH3 in the canonical manner with 1730VP1731 and 1733AP1734 interacts with the two hydrophobic XP grooves formed by the conserved residues His-529, Phe-588, Tyr-531, Trp-562, and Pro-585 (Fig. 5B). Backbone atoms of R1736 are relatively well defined in the complex structure, but the structural dispersion increases toward the end of the side chain. Several intermolecular NOE correlations were observed between Arg-1736 and amp-SH3 Asp-559 and Trp-562 side-chain protons. Chemical shifts of Arg-1736 were significantly up-field-shifted, consistent with the arginine side chain being steadily proximal to Trp-562. An averaged guanido signal was, however, observed for Arg-1736, interpreted as conformational exchange at the very end of the side chain. Structural dispersion rapidly grew from Arg-1736 toward the C terminus of the peptide. Some structural preference, however, still persisted in 1737RRR1739. Side-chain conformations of Arg-1737 and Arg-1739 were not completely random. Arg-1737 was oriented toward Asp-559 and Glu-560 in the n-Src loop, and Arg-1739 was oriented toward Asp-537, Glu-556, and Glu-557, structurally between the RT and n-Src loops (see supplemental Fig. S2 for the structural representation of the latter interaction). Due to signal overlap and low intensity, NOE peak assignments between these residues were ambiguous, but the tendency for structural order was supported by non-random coil Cα, Cβ, and Hα and non-degenerate Hβ arginine chemical shifts as well as relaxation data (next subsection). Broad ϵ signals were observed for 1737RRR1739. It appears that the ligand arginine side-chain interactions with the SH3 domain surface are transient or fluctuating. Restrictions in the disposable conformational space and, by implication, the preference for alike orientation as well as restricted backbone dynamics could at least partly be caused by like-charge repulsion of successive arginine side chains. For peptide residues C-terminal to Arg-1739, sparse intraresidual and sequential NOE peaks were observed resulting in random conformations with no contact t"
https://openalex.org/W2413349202,"Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) is a multifunctional, structure-specific nuclease that has a critical role in maintaining human genome stability. FEN1 mutations have been detected in human cancer specimens and have been suggested to cause genomic instability and cancer predisposition. However, the exact relationship between FEN1 deficiency and cancer susceptibility remains unclear. In the current work, we report a novel colorectal cancer-associated FEN1 mutation, L209P. This mutant protein lacks the FEN, exonuclease (EXO) and gap endonuclease (GEN) activities of FEN1 but retains DNA-binding affinity. The L209P FEN1 variant interferes with the function of the wild-type FEN1 enzyme in a dominant-negative manner and impairs long-patch base excision repair in vitro and in vivo. Expression of L209P FEN1 sensitizes cells to DNA damage, resulting in endogenous genomic instability and cellular transformation, as well as tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. These data indicate that human cancer-associated genetic alterations in the FEN1 gene can contribute substantially to cancer development."

https://openalex.org/W2418527105,"The inadequate transport of drugs into the tumor tissue caused by its abnormal vasculature is a major obstacle to the treatment of cancer. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs can cause phenotypic alteration and maturation of the tumor's vasculature. However, whether this consistently improves delivery and subsequent response to therapy is still controversial. Clinical results indicate that not all patients benefit from antiangiogenic treatment, necessitating the development of criteria to predict the effect of these agents in individual tumors. We demonstrate that, in anti-VEGF-refractory murine tumors, vascular changes after VEGF ablation result in reduced delivery leading to therapeutic failure. In these tumors, the impaired response after anti-VEGF treatment is directly linked to strong deposition of fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components and high expression of lysyl oxidases. The resulting condensed, highly crosslinked ECM impeded drug permeation, protecting tumor cells from exposure to small-molecule drugs. The reduced vascular density after anti-VEGF treatment further decreased delivery in these tumors, an effect not compensated by the improved vessel quality. Pharmacological inhibition of lysyl oxidases improved drug delivery in various tumor models and reversed the negative effect of VEGF ablation on drug delivery and therapeutic response in anti-VEGF-resistant tumors. In conclusion, the vascular changes after anti-VEGF therapy can have a context-dependent negative impact on overall therapeutic efficacy. A determining factor is the tumor ECM, which strongly influences the effect of anti-VEGF therapy. Our results reveal the prospect to revert a possible negative effect and to potentiate responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy by concomitantly targeting ECM-modifying enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2417211306,"Remodeling of the acyl chains of cardiolipin (CL) is responsible for final molecular composition of mature CL after de novo CL synthesis in mitochondria. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes tafazzin-mediated CL remodeling, in which tafazzin serves as a transacylase from phospholipids to monolyso-CL (MLCL). In light of the diversity of the acyl compositions of mature CL between different organisms, the mechanism underlying tafazzin-mediated transacylation remains to be elucidated. We investigated the mechanism responsible for transacylation using purified S. cerevisiae tafazzin with liposomes composed of various sets of acyl donors and acceptors. The results revealed that tafazzin efficiently catalyzes transacylation in liposomal membranes with highly ordered lipid bilayer structure. Tafazzin elicited unique acyl chain specificity against phosphatidylcholine (PC) as follows: linoleoyl (18:2) > oleoyl (18:1) = palmitoleoyl (16:1) ≫ palmitoyl (16:0). In these reactions, tafazzin selectively removed the sn-2 acyl chain of PC and transferred it into the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of MLCL isomers at equivalent rates. We demonstrated for the first time that MLCL and dilyso-CL have inherent abilities to function as an acyl donor to monolyso-PC and acyl acceptor from PC, respectively. Furthermore, a Barth syndrome-associated tafazzin mutant (H77Q) was shown to completely lack the catalytic activity in our assay. It is difficult to reconcile the present results with the so-called thermodynamic remodeling hypothesis, which premises that tafazzin reacylates MLCL by unsaturated acyl chains only in disordered non-bilayer lipid domain. The acyl specificity of tafazzin may be one of the factors that determine the acyl composition of mature CL in S. cerevisiae mitochondria."

In this study, we used RNA-seq to quantify the transcriptomes and transcript variants that are differentially regulated by THC in super antigen-activated lymph node cells and CD4+ T cells. We found that the expressions of many transcripts were altered by THC in both total lymph node cells and CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the abundance of many miRNA precursors and long non-coding RNAs was dramatically altered in THC-treated mice. For example, the expression of miR-17/92 cluster and miR-374b/421 cluster was down-regulated by THC. On the other hand miR-146a, which has been shown to induce apoptosis, was up-regulated by THC. Long non-coding RNAs that are expressed from the opposite strand of CD27 and Appbp2 were induced by THC. In addition, THC treatment also caused alternative promoter usage and splicing. The functions of those altered transcripts were mainly related to immune response and cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2414207030,"Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has attracted great interest due to its multiple potential biomedical applications with cancer treatment being among the most urgent. To realize the clinical potential of non-thermal plasma, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of plasma effects must be understood. This work aimed at studying the prostate cancer specific mechanisms of non-thermal plasma effects on energy metabolism as a central regulator of cell homeostasis and proliferation. It was found that cancer cells with higher metabolic rate initially are more resistant to plasma treated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) since the respiratory and calcium sensitive signaling systems were not responsive to plasma exposure. However, dramatic decline of cancer oxidative phosphorylation developed over time resulted in significant progression of cell lethality. The normal prostate cells with low metabolic activity immediately responded to plasma treated PBS by suppression of respiratory functions and sustained elevation of cytosolic calcium. However, over time the normal cells start recovering their mitochondria functions, proliferate and restore the cell population. We found that the non-thermal plasma induced increase in intracellular ROS is of primarily non-mitochondrial origin. The discriminate non-thermal plasma effects hold a promise for clinical cancer intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2408875255,"Smad proteins are central mediators in the canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway in mammalian cells. We report here that bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) functions as a novel transcription coactivator for Smads in TGF-β signaling. BRD7 forms a TGF-β inducible complex with Smad3/4 through its N-terminal Smad-binding domain. BRD7 simultaneously binds to acetylated histones to promote Smad-chromatin association, and associates with histone acetyltransferase p300 to enhance Smad transcriptional activity. Ectopic expression of BRD7, but not its mutants defective in Smad binding, enhances TGF-β transcriptional, tumor-suppressing and epithelial-mesenchymal transition responses. Conversely, depletion of BRD7 inhibits TGF-β responses. Thus, our study provides compelling evidence for a new function of BRD7 in fine-tuning TGF-β physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2410498954,"R-spondin1 is a secreted regulator of WNT signaling, involved in both embryonic development and homeostasis of adult organs. It can have a dual role, acting either as a mitogen or as a tumor suppressor. During ovarian development, Rspo1 is a key factor required for sex determination and differentiation of the follicular cell progenitors, but is downregulated after birth. In human, increased RSPO1 expression is associated with ovarian carcinomas, but it is not clear whether it is a cause or a consequence of the tumorigenic process. To address the role of Rspo1 expression in adult ovaries, we generated an Rspo1 gain-of-function mouse model. Females were hypofertile and exhibited various ovarian defects, ranging from cysts to ovarian tumors. Detailed phenotypical characterization showed anomalies in the ovulation process. Although follicles responded to initial follicle-stimulating hormone stimulation and developed normally until the pre-ovulatory stage, they did not progress any further. Although non-ovulated oocytes degenerated, the surrounding follicular cells did not begin atresia. RSPO1-induced expression not only promotes canonical WNT signaling but also alters granulosa cell fate decisions by maintaining epithelial-like traits in these cells. This prevents follicle cells from undergoing apoptosis, leading to the accumulation of granulosa cell tumors that reactivates the epithelial program from their progenitors. Taken together, our data demonstrate that activation of RSPO1 is sufficient in promoting ovarian tumors and thus supports a direct involvement of this gene in the commencement of ovarian cancers."

The experiments in this report demonstrate that loss of 14-3-3σ leads to a decrease in the expression of epithelial markers and an increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers, which is indicative of an induction of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT was accompanied by an increase in migration and invasion in the 14-3-3σ−/− cells. 14-3-3σ−/− cells show increased stabilization of c-Jun, resulting in an increase in the expression of the EMT transcription factor slug. 14-3-3σ induces the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Jun in an FBW7-dependent manner. c-Jun ubiquitination is dependent on the presence of an intact nuclear export pathway as c-Jun is stabilized and localized to the nucleus in the presence of a nuclear export inhibitor. Furthermore, the absence of 14-3-3σ leads to the nuclear accumulation and stabilization of c-Jun, suggesting that 14-3-3σ regulates the subcellular localization of c-Jun.

https://openalex.org/W2418961273,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation and its inactivation is a frequent underlying factor in tumorigenesis. While the regulation of RB function by phosphorylation is well studied, proteasome-mediated RB protein degradation is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism. Although our understanding of RB turnover is currently limited, there is evidence that the nuclear lamina filament protein Lamin A/C protects RB from proteasomal degradation. Here we show that SUMO1 conjugation of RB and Lamin A/C is modulated by the SUMO protease SENP1 and that sumoylation of both proteins is required for their interaction. Importantly, this SUMO1-dependent complex protects both RB and Lamin A/C from proteasomal turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2409576917,"As a transcription factor, localization to the nucleus and the recruitment of cofactors to regulate gene transcription is essential. Nuclear localization and nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex binding are required for the zinc-finger transcription factor CASZ1 to function as a neuroblastoma (NB) tumor suppressor. However, the critical amino acids (AAs) that are required for CASZ1 interaction with NuRD complex and the regulation of CASZ1 subcellular localization have not been characterized. Through alanine scanning, immunofluorescence cell staining and co-immunoprecipitation, we define a critical region at the CASZ1 N terminus (AAs 23-40) that mediates the CASZ1b nuclear localization and NuRD interaction. Furthermore, we identified a nuclear export signal (NES) at the N terminus (AAs 176-192) that contributes to CASZ1 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling in a chromosomal maintenance 1-dependent manner. An analysis of CASZ1 protein expression in a primary NB tissue microarray shows that high nuclear CASZ1 staining is detected in tumor samples from NB patients with good prognosis. In contrast, cytoplasmic-restricted CASZ1 staining or low nuclear CASZ1 staining is found in tumor samples from patients with poor prognosis. These findings provide insight into mechanisms by which CASZ1 regulates transcription, and suggests that regulation of CASZ1 subcellular localization may impact its function in normal development and pathologic conditions such as NB tumorigenesis."

We then examine the spatial distribution of the co-benefits and costs, and the implications of a range of cost assumptions in the implementation year of 2020. Nationwide, the total health co-benefits were $29 billion 2010 USD (95% CI: $2.3 to $68 billion), and net co-benefits under our central cost case were $12 billion (95% CI: -$15 billion to $51 billion).

https://openalex.org/W2397609352,"Tropical or Mediterranean theileriosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Theileria annulata, remains an economically important bovine disease in North Africa, Southern Europe, India, the Middle East and Asia. The disease affects mainly exotic cattle and imposes serious constraints upon livestock production and breed improvement programmes. While microscopic and molecular methods exist which are capable of detecting T. annulata during acute infection, the identification of animals in the carrier state is more challenging. Serological tests, which detect antibodies that react against parasite-encoded antigens, should ideally have the potential to identify carrier animals with very high levels of sensitivity and specificity. However, assays developed to date have suffered from a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity and it is, therefore, necessary to identify novel parasite antigens, which can be developed for this purpose. In the present study, genes encoding predicted antigens were bioinformatically identified in the T. annulata genome. These proteins, together with a panel of previously described antigens, were assessed by western blot analysis for immunoreactivity, and this revealed that four novel candidates and five previously described antigens were recognised by immune bovine serum. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and mass spectrophotometric analysis, an immunodominant protein (encoded by TA15705) was identified as Ta9, a previously defined T cell antigen. Western blotting revealed another of the five proteins in the Ta9 family, TA15710, also to be an immunodominant protein. However, validation by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay indicated that due to either allelic polymorphism or differential immune responses of individual hosts, none of the novel candidates can be considered ideal for routine detection of T. annulata-infected/carrier animals."

https://openalex.org/W2467581980,"Myeloid translocation genes (MTGs), originally identified as chromosomal translocations in acute myelogenous leukemia, are transcriptional corepressors that regulate hematopoietic stem cell programs. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that MTGs were mutated in epithelial malignancy and suggested that loss of function might promote tumorigenesis. Genetic deletion of MTGR1 and MTG16 in the mouse has revealed unexpected and unique roles within the intestinal epithelium. Mtgr1−/− mice have progressive depletion of all intestinal secretory cells, and Mtg16−/− mice have a decrease in goblet cells. Furthermore, both Mtgr1−/− and Mtg16−/− mice have increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. We thus hypothesized that loss of MTGR1 or MTG16 would modify Apc1638/+-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis. Mtgr1−/− mice, but not Mtg16−/− mice, had a 10-fold increase in tumor multiplicity. This was associated with more advanced dysplasia, including progression to invasive adenocarcinoma, and augmented intratumoral proliferation. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data sets for MTGR1 and MTG16 targets indicated that MTGR1 can regulate Wnt and Notch signaling. In support of this, immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis revealed that both Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were hyperactive in Mtgr1−/− tumors. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancer (CRC) samples MTGR1 was downregulated at both the transcript and protein level. Overall our data indicates that MTGR1 has a context-dependent effect on intestinal tumorigenesis."

In melanoma, despite recent advances in targeted therapy and immunomodulatory therapies, this cancer remains difficult to treat. Our previous studies show melanoma cells interact with skin cells in their invasion into tissue engineered skin and suggest inflammation stimulates invasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. To do this we developed a wounded and inflamed in vitro 3D melanoma model in which to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. The tissue engineered skin model was based on human de-epidermised acellular dermis to which keratinocytes, fibroblasts and three different melanoma cell lines were added in various combinations. A simple incisional wound was made in the model and TNF-α and fibrin were added to simulate conditions of inflammation. Topical ibuprofen in a hydrogel was added and the extent of melanoma invasion into the dermis was assessed under the various conditions. The results showed that penetration of two of the cell lines (HBL and A375SM) into the tissue engineered skin was exacerbated by wounding and ibuprofen significantly decreased invasion of A375SM cells and slightly reduced invasion of HBL cells. A third cell line, C8161, was aggressively invasive under all conditions to an extent that was not influenced by wounding, TNF-α or the addition of ibuprofen. In summary, the results for one these cell lines (and a trend for a second cell line) support the hypothesis that a wound environment is conducive to melanoma invasion but the local addition of an anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may attenuate invasion."

During degradation of the bacterial and eukaryotic cell membrane, the glycerophospholipid building blocks are first deacylated by phospholipases A1 and A2, resulting in the formation of glycerophosphodiesters. These glycerophosphodiesters, which differ based on the alcohol moiety present (e.g. choline, inositol, or glycerol), are further hydrolyzed by GDPDs, producing the corresponding alcohol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Gro3P). GDPDs vary in their substrate specificity, biological function, and localization inside the cell. For bacteria, GDPDs, e.g. the well characterized Escherichia coli periplasmic GlpQ and cytosolic UgpQ, play an important role in glycerophospholipid metabolism where the released alcohol moiety may act as an essential bacterial growth factor and where the produced Gro3P represents a major carbon and phosphate source (2.Larson T.J.

The seven different GDPD isoforms identified in humans display a high degree of substrate specificity (not necessarily a glycerophosphodiester) and tissue functionality. For example, human kidney GDE2 is an osmoregulated enzyme that controls the levels of the osmoprotector glycerophosphocholine (7.Gallazzini M. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. et al.GDPD5 is a glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase that osmotically regulates the osmoprotective organic osmolyte GPC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, their predicted functionality has not yet been assessed. The present study investigates the GDPD derived from the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus group b bacteriophage 17 (phage Ld17) and the L. lactis subsp. lactis bacteriophage 340 (phage 340) and represents the first characterization of bacteriophage-encoded GDPD. Besides an in-depth biochemical and molecular analysis of the GDPD of phage Ld17 (GDPDLd17), we studied substrate specificity and highlight the importance of the native GDPDLd17 during phage infection. The structural module of the genomes of all known group b L. delbrueckii-infecting phages and of the L. lactis subsp. lactis-infecting phages 340 and 645 contains a gene that encodes a protein containing a GDPD(-like) domain. Because of the high protein identity of these putative GDPD-containing proteins within the group b Ldb-infecting phages (93–95% identity) and between the two L. lactis ssp. lactis-infecting phages (phages 340 and 645; 99% identity), the GDPDs of phage Ld17 (designated here as GDPDLd17) and 340 (named GDPD340) were selected as representatives of the respective phage groups. Bioinformatics analysis revealed an apparent tripartite domain structure in both GDPDs (Fig. 1A): (i) an N-terminal domain that is presumably required for physical association with the phage particle, (ii) a putative carbohydrate-binding domain, and (iii) the GDPD(-like) domain with the latter two domains displaying an inverse arrangement in GDPDLd17 and GDPD340. NCBI Conserved Domain Detection analysis (20.Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H. et al.CD-search: protein domain annotations on the fly.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W327-W331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) identified a DUF2479 domain (residues 23–167; 9.76E−03) within the N terminus of GDPD340; this domain is a typical feature of the neck passage structure (NPS) of lactococcal 936-type phages to which phage 340 belongs (21.Murphy J. Bottacini F. Mahony J. Kelleher P. Neve H. Zomer A. Nauta A. van Sinderen D. et al.Comparative genomics and functional analysis of the 936 group of lactococcal Siphoviridae phages.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 21345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transmission electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled GDPD340 confirm the presence of GDPD340 as part of the phage 340 NPS (Fig. 2B). No conserved domains were detected in the N terminus of GDPDLd17, whereas immuno-EM using anti-GDPDLd17 antibodies revealed that the GDPD protein of Ld17 is associated with the baseplate of phage Ld17 (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2.Transmission electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled GDPD protein as part of the baseplate of L. delbreuckii subsp. bulgaricus phage 17 (A) and as part of the neck passage structure of L. lactis subsp. lactis phage 340 (B). Phages were incubated with polyclonal anti-GDPD rabbit antibodies raised against the GDPD specific for that phage and labeled with anti-rabbit secondary mouse antibodies conjugated to 5-nm gold particles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although a conserved carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM_4_9; residues 664–788; 9.76E−03) is present in the C terminus of GDPDLd17, we hypothesize that a carbohydrate-binding function is present in the central domain of GDPD340 based on the identification of a ±124-amino acid repeating unit using the Trust server (22.Szklarczyk R. Heringa J. et al.Tracking repeats using significance and transitivity.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: i311-i317Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The full repeat region (residues 169–618) consisting of three full repeating units of ±124 amino acids and one partial unit suggests interaction with a (repeated) component of the bacterial cell envelope and is therefore assigned as the putative carbohydrate-binding domain of GDPD340. Sequence similarity between GDPDLd17 and GDPD340 is restricted to their GDPD(-like) domains, which share 28 and 20% amino acid identity, respectively, with the well characterized cytoplasmic E. coli protein UgpQ. The GDPD domain (residues 378–613) of GDPDLd17 belongs to the large family of the canonical prokaryotic and eukaryotic GDPDs (EC 3.1.4.46) represented by UgpQ. ClustalW alignment (Fig. 1B) highlights in the GDPD-domain of GDPDLd17 the presence of five conserved amino acid residues, two catalytic histidine residues (His-381 and His-421 in GDPDLd17) and three residues (Glu-408, Asp-410, and Glu-491) for binding a divalent cation, which are believed to be involved in the catalytic metal ion-dependent acid-base reaction mechanism to hydrolyze glycerophosphodiester linkages (23.Shi L. Liu J.F. An X.M. Liang D.C. et al.Crystal structure of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, a metal ion-dependent enzyme: insight into the catalytic mechanism.Proteins. 2008; 72: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The GDPD-like domain (residues 635–795) of GDPD340 belongs to a subfamily of uncharacterized bacterial GDPDs (cd08582; 7.40E−15); curiously, ClustalW alignment identified just two (His-669 and Glu-737) of the five conserved residues that are associated with the typical GDPD-mediated reaction mechanism. Consistent with the immunogold electron microscopy findings (Fig. 2), mass spectrometric analyses of Ld17 (17.Casey E. Mahony J. O'Connell-Motherway M. Bottacini F. Cornelissen A. Neve H. Heller K.J. Noben J.P. Dal Bello F. van Sinderen D. et al.Molecular characterization of three Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus phages.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 80: 5623-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 340 (supplemental Table S2) virions indicates the presence of the full-length GDPDs as part of the structural phage particle. Full-length GDPDLd17 and GDPD340 were recombinantly expressed and purified using the L. lactis NZ9000-pTX8048 expression system (24.Douillard F.P. O'Connell-Motherway M. Cambillau C. van Sinderen D. et al.Expanding the molecular toolbox for Lactococcus lactis: construction of an inducible thioredoxin gene fusion expression system.Microb. Cell Fact. 2011; 10: 66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mass calculations using SEC-MALS-RI analyses of the purified recombinant GDPDLd17 and GDPD340 proteins revealed the presence of complexes with estimated masses of 325 and 326 kDa, respectively, which correspond to the homotrimeric native conformations (theoretical molecular masses of 111.9 and 110.7 kDa for GDPDLd17 and GDPD340 monomers, respectively) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, GDPDLd17 appears to form a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant homotrimer at room temperature (Fig. 3B). An estimated molecular mass of ∼335 kDa, consistent with a homotrimer, was observed when unheated samples of GDPDLd17 were loaded on a 7% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, whereas a band consistent with the theoretical molecular mass of the monomer (111.9 kDa) was observed when the protein sample was boiled for 5 min prior to loading on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The GDPD340 protein does not display this SDS resistance characteristic at room temperature and appears to disassemble into its monomers with or without a heating step prior to or upon electrophoresis. During metabolism or pathogenesis, bacterial GDPDs are known to hydrolyze deacylated phospholipids, called glycerophosphodiesters, into the corresponding alcohol and Gro3P. Therefore, we analyzed in the first instance the ability of the bacteriophage-encoded GDPDs to degrade glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), a glycerophosphodiester, with HPAEC-PAD analysis in parallel with an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay quantifying the formation of Gro3P. The specific GDPD activity of GDPDLd17, expressed as ΔA340 nm/(μmol of GDPD × min) using 2.5 mm GPC substrate after 30-min incubation at 30 °C was 7466.67 ± 108.44 (supplemental Fig. S1A). In parallel, the HPAEC-PAD chromatogram showed one additional peak at 42 min after GDPDLd17 treatment of the GPC substrate that we attribute to the formation of Gro3P (data not shown). As the bacterial GDPDs perform a second step in cell membrane degradation subsequent to deacetylation of the glycerophospholipids by phospholipase A, we presumed that these glycerophosphodiesters are not the natural substrates of the bacteriophage-encoded GDPD but that this activity is serendipitous. Because bacteriophage-encoded GDPDs, which are a structural component of the virion, are most likely to interact with phosphodiester-containing substrates (e.g. teichoic acids (25.Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. et al.Wall teichoic acid function, biosynthesis, and inhibition.Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) or other surface-associated carbohydrates (26.Chapot-Chartier M.-P. Vinogradov E. Sadovskaya I. Andre G. Mistou M.-Y. Trieu-Cuot P. Furlan S. Bidnenko E. Courtin P. Péchoux C. Hols P. Dufrêne Y.F. Kulakauskas S. et al.Cell surface of Lactococcus lactis is covered by a protective polysaccharide pellicle.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10464-10471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) in the host cell envelope, we implemented an extraction procedure to concentrate cell wall-associated carbohydrates (CWaCs) excluding peptidoglycan. HPAEC-PAD analysis of the CWaC extract of Ldb17, the bacterial host of phage Ld17, displayed an extra peak at 42 min following GDPDLd17 treatment compared with the negative buffer control (data not shown). This peak corresponds to the Gro3P peak liberated in the presence of the GPC substrate. Using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay specific for the detection of Gro3P, the GDPDLd17 activity on the Ldb17 CWaC extract was quantified as 2071.11 ± 37.91 ΔA340 nm/(μmol of GDPD × min). These results imply the presence of carbohydrate substrates in the Ldb17 cell envelope that, following GDPDLd17 hydrolysis, generate a reaction product identical to that generated during GPC hydrolysis, namely Gro3P. We have recently identified two carbohydrates associated with the Ldb17 cell surface that contain Gro3P: a Gro3P-substituted linear d-galactan, surface-associated polysaccharide 2 (sPS2), with the following repeating unit (-(Gro-3P-(1–6)-)-3-β-Galf-3-α-Galp-2-β-Galf-6-β-Galf-3-β-Galp-) and short chain cell wall teichoic acid (CWTA) structures with a partially glycosylated poly(glycerol phosphate) backbone (27.Vinogradov E. Sadovskaya I. Cornelissen A. van Sinderen D. et al.Structural investigation of cell wall polysaccharides of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 17.Carbohydr. Res. 2015; 413: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay, a GDPDLd17 activity of 31.56 ± 0.77 and 873.33 ± 13.33 ΔA340 nm/(μmol of GDPD × min) was identified on the CWTA and the Gro3P-decorated d-galactan of Ldb17, respectively (Table 1). NMR analysis of GDPDLd17-treated sPS2 showed the absence of all signals of Gro3P (Fig. 4). Although native sPS2 contained ∼0.7 μm/mg of phosphate, the phosphate content of the GDPDLd17-treated sPS2 was below the level of detection. HPAEC-PAD (Table 1) further confirmed the cleavage of Gro3P from these purified carbohydrates after exposure to GDPDLd17.TABLE 1Enzymatic activity of GDPDLd17 on purified carbohydratesChemical structureRef.GDPD activityHPAEC-PADΔΑ340 nm/ (μmol × min)Cell wall teichoic acidS. aureus NM8mN-Acetyl-d-glucosaminated poly(ribitol phosphate) d-alanylated poly(glycerol phosphate)29.Vinogradov E.

According to HPAEC-PAD analyses (Table 1), the sole end product of GDPDLd17 hydrolysis is Gro3P, which is removed from the poly(glycerol phosphate) CWTA backbone, the Gro3P-decorated linear d-galactan, and the bacterial GPC. The single Gro3P peak observed in the HPAEC-PAD chromatograms of all poly(glycerol phosphate) CWTA exposed to GDPDLd17 at any time point in the incubation when measuring GDPDLd17 activity in the linear activity range or when excess GDPDLd17 protein (10-fold the amount compared with the highest amount used in the linear range of activity) is applied during longer incubation periods (up to 2 h) suggests exolytic activity for GDPDLd17 whereby Gro3P units are released one by one from the CWTA ends. Furthermore, the absence of peaks other than that corresponding to Gro3P and the correlation between the observed Gro3P peak volume in the HPAEC-PAD chromatograms and the Gro3P quantification by an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay suggests that decorated, typically by glycosylation or d-alanylation for CWTA, Gro3P units in the CWTA backbone are not removed. This indicates that GDPDLd17-mediated degradation of CWTA is terminated at a substituted Gro3P unit. This notion is consistent with the low GDPDLd17 activity (11.11 ± 0.77) observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A CWTA (28.Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Li J. Jabbouri S. et al.Structural elucidation of the extracellular and cell-wall teichoic acids of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A, a reference biofilm-positive strain.Carbohydr.

Jabbouri S. et al.Structural elucidation of the extracellular and cell-wall teichoic acids of Staphylococcus aureus MN8m, a biofilm forming strain.Carbohydr.

Gel filtration chromatography of the long poly(glycerol phosphate) CWTA of two S. epidermidis strains, 1457 and 5, also confirms exolytic cleavage of unsubstituted Gro3P units by GDPDLd17. The purified CWTAs of 1457 and 5 are in the size range of about 10 kDa consisting of 30–50 Gro3P units. The relative molar ratio (glycerol:glucose:N-acetylglucosamine) of 1457 and 5 CWTAs was assessed as 15:1:1.5 and 50:1:1.8, respectively. Because of this glycosylation combined with partial d-alanylation of the poly(glycerol phosphate) backbone, the number of unsubstituted Gro3P units cleaved off from the CWTA end is restricted, resulting in the absence of smaller oligo(glycerol phosphates) during gel filtration of 1457 and 5 CWTAs treated with excess GDPDLd17 for 2 h at 30 °C (supplemental Fig. S2).

https://openalex.org/W2414906658,"Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis and wound healing by facilitating thrombus formation at sites of injury. Platelets also mediate inflammation and contain several pro-inflammatory molecules including cytokines and chemokines that mediate leukocyte recruitment and activation. Not surprisingly, platelet dysfunction is known to contribute to several inflammatory disorders. Antiplatelet therapies, such as aspirin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) antagonists, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, and anticoagulants such as warfarin, dampen platelet activity at the risk of unwarranted bleeding. Thus, the development of drugs that reduce platelet-mediated inflammation without interfering with thrombus formation is of importance to combat platelet-associated disorders. We have shown here for the first time that the tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline, administered to HIV-infected individuals reduces plasma levels of soluble CD40L and platelet factor 4 levels, host molecules predominately released by platelets. Minocycline reduced the activation of isolated platelets in the presence of the potent platelet activator, thrombin, as measured by ELISA and flow cytometry. Platelet degranulation was reduced upon exposure to minocycline as shown by mepacrine retention and flow cytometry. However, minocycline had no effect on spreading, aggregation, GPIIb/IIIa activation, or in vivo thrombus formation. Lastly, immunoblot analysis suggests that the antiplatelet activity of minocycline is likely mediated by inhibition of mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3)-p38 MAPK signaling axis and loss of p38 activity. Our findings provide a better understanding of platelet biology and a novel repurposing of an established antibiotic, minocycline, to specifically reduce platelet granule release without affecting thrombosis, which may yield insights in generating novel, specific antiplatelet therapies."
