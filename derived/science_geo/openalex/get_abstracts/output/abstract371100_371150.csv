To examine the mechanisms of lifespan extension upon DR, we assayed genome-wide translational changes in Drosophila. A number of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, including those in Complex I and IV of the electron transport chain, showed increased ribosomal loading and enhanced overall activity upon DR. We found that various mitochondrial genes possessed shorter and less structured 5'UTRs, which were important for their enhanced mRNA translation. The translational repressor 4E-BP, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein, was upregulated upon DR and mediated DR dependent changes in mitochondrial activity and lifespan extension. Inhibition of individual mitochondrial subunits from Complex I and IV diminished the lifespan extension obtained upon DR, reflecting the importance of enhanced mitochondrial function during DR. Our results imply that translational regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression by 4E-BP plays an important role in lifespan extension upon DR.

https://openalex.org/W2100336754,"RNAi-related pathways regulate diverse processes, from developmental timing to transposon silencing. Here, we show that in C. elegans the Argonaute CSR-1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase EGO-1, the Dicer-related helicase DRH-3, and the Tudor-domain protein EKL-1 localize to chromosomes and are required for proper chromosome segregation. In the absence of these factors chromosomes fail to align at the metaphase plate and kinetochores do not orient to opposing spindle poles. Surprisingly, the CSR-1-interacting small RNAs (22G-RNAs) are antisense to thousands of germline-expressed protein-coding genes. Nematodes assemble holocentric chromosomes in which continuous kinetochores must span the expressed domains of the genome. We show that CSR-1 interacts with chromatin at target loci but does not downregulate target mRNA or protein levels. Instead, our findings support a model in which CSR-1 complexes target protein-coding domains to promote their proper organization within the holocentric chromosomes of C. elegans."

Male behaviors require both testosterone and estrogen, but it is unclear how the two hormonal pathways intersect. Circulating testosterone activates the androgen receptor (AR) and is also converted into estrogen in the brain via aromatase. We demonstrate extensive sexual dimorphism in the number and projections of aromatase-expressing neurons. The masculinization of these cells is independent of AR but can be induced in females by either testosterone or estrogen, indicating a role for aromatase in sexual differentiation of these neurons. We provide evidence suggesting that aromatase is also important in activating male-specific aggression and urine marking because these behaviors can be elicited by testosterone in males mutant for AR and in females subjected to neonatal estrogen exposure. Our results suggest that aromatization of testosterone into estrogen is important for the development and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors.

Our results suggest that aromatization of testosterone into estrogen is important for the development and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors. All sexually reproducing species exhibit gender dimorphisms in behavior. Such sex differences can be observed in various displays, including in mating, aggression, territorial marking, and parental care. Behavioral dimorphisms can be observed in socially naive animals, suggesting that sexual differentiation of the underlying neural circuits is tightly controlled by internal physiological regulators. In vertebrates, gonadal steroid hormones play a central role in the development and function of these neural circuits (Arnold et al., 2003Arnold A.P. Rissman E.F. De Vries G.J.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Both testosterone and estrogen are required for male behaviors in many vertebrates, including mammals. It remains to be determined how these two hormonal pathways intersect to control dimorphic behaviors in males (Juntti et al., 2008Juntti S.A. Coats J.K. Shah N.M. A genetic approach to dissect sexually dimorphic behaviors.Horm. Behav. 2008; 53: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Testosterone is required for male behaviors in most vertebrates, including mice and humans. Testosterone mediates its effects by activating AR and male mice mutant for this receptor do not display sexual behavior or aggression (Ohno et al., 1974Ohno S. Geller L.N. Lai E.V. TfM mutation and masculinization versus feminization of the mouse central nervous system.Cell. 1974; 3: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Testosterone is essential in newborn and adult male mice for the display of sex specific behaviors such as aggression (Finney and Erpino, 1976Finney H.C. Erpino M.J.

This testicular hormone is thought to masculinize neural circuits in neonatal rodents, and to act upon these pathways in adult males to permit the display of dimorphic behaviors (Phoenix et al., 1959Phoenix C.H. Goy R.W. Gerall A.A. Young W.C. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig.Endocrinology. 1959; 65: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Estrogen is also essential for male behaviors. The requirement for estrogen to masculinize behavior seems counterintuitive because this ovarian hormone is essentially undetectable in the male circulation. Estrogenic steroids are synthesized in vivo from testosterone or related androgens in a reaction catalyzed by aromatase. Aromatase-expressing cells in the brain convert circulating testosterone into estrogen, and it is this local estrogen that is thought to control dimorphic behaviors in males (Figure 1A) (MacLusky and Naftolin, 1981MacLusky N.J.

Consistent with a requirement for estrogen in male behaviors, aromatase activity is essential for male behaviors. Mice mutant for aromatase exhibit a profound reduction in male sexual behavior and aggression (Honda et al., 1998Honda S. Harada N. Ito S. Takagi Y. Maeda S.

Similar to testosterone, estrogen is essential in neonates and adults for the display of dimorphic behaviors in males (Finney and Erpino, 1976Finney H.C. Erpino M.J.

Estrogen mediates many of its effects by signaling through the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, which exhibit overlapping expression patterns, and regulate masculinization of the brain and behavior in a complex, redundant manner (Bodo et al., 2006Bodo C.

Estrogen receptor function as revealed by knockout studies: neuroendocrine and behavioral aspects.Horm. Behav. 1997; 31: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The role of a third estrogen receptor, GPR30, in male behaviors is presently unknown (Revankar et al., 2005Revankar C.M. Cimino D.F. Sklar L.A. Arterburn J.B. Prossnitz E.R. A transmembrane intracellular estrogen receptor mediates rapid cell signaling.Science. 2005; 307: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). The dual requirement for testosterone and estrogen signaling in male behaviors suggests that these two pathways might interact genetically to control these dimorphic displays. One potential site of interaction is the control of aromatase expression. We have therefore sought to determine whether aromatase expression is regulated by testosterone or estrogen signaling. To visualize aromatase expression at cellular resolution, we have genetically modified the aromatase locus such that all cells expressing this enzyme coexpress two reporters, nuclear targeted LacZ and placental alkaline phosphatase, thereby labeling the cell bodies and projections of aromatase-positive neurons. We find extensive, previously uncharacterized sexual dimorphisms in both the number and projections of neurons expressing aromatase. The masculinization of these neural pathways is independent of AR but can be induced in neonatal females by testosterone or estrogen, indicating that aromatase plays an important role in the sexual differentiation of these neurons. In addition, testosterone activates male typical fighting and urine marking independent of AR, demonstrating that the differentiation and function of the neural circuits underlying these behaviors are governed by testosterone, at least in part, after its conversion into estrogen. Finally, our results show that adult gonadal hormones of either sex can support male territorial marking and fighting provided estrogen has neonatally masculinized the underlying neural circuitry. To define where testosterone may be converted into estrogen in the mouse brain, we sought to characterize the expression of aromatase at cellular resolution. We used homologous recombination in ES cells to insert an IRES-plap-IRES-nuclear lacZ reporter cassette into the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the aromatase locus (Figure 1B). The use of IRES elements permits faithful expression of PLAP and nuclear β-galactosidase (βgal) in cells transcribing the targeted allele (Shah et al., 2004Shah N.M. Pisapia D.J. Maniatis S. Mendelsohn M.M. Nemes A. Axel R. Visualizing sexual dimorphism in the brain.Neuron. 2004; 43: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This strategy maintains the expression and function of aromatase, thereby permitting the examination of neural pathways expressing this enzyme in otherwise wild-type (WT) animals. In sharp contrast to aromatase−/− animals, mice homozygous for the aromatase- IRES-plap-IRES-nuclear lacZ (aromatase-IPIN) allele are fertile and behaviorally similar to their WT littermates, and they have normal levels of serum testosterone and estrogen (see Supplemental Text available online). Analysis of βgal activity in the brain reveals small pools of cells that account for less than 0.5% of neurons in the brain (Figures 1C–1F). We observe βgal labeled cells in discrete locations, including the posteromedial component of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), posterodorsal component of the medial amygdala (MeA), preoptic hypothalamus (POA), and lateral septum. The expression of βgal mirrors the distribution of aromatase mRNA as revealed by in situ hybridization (Figure S1) and RT-PCR (Harada and Yamada, 1992Harada N. Yamada K. Ontogeny of aromatase messenger ribonucleic acid in mouse brain: fluorometrical quantitation by polymerase chain reaction.Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The absence of sensitive, specific antibodies to aromatase precludes colocalization studies with βgal in single cells. Although in situ hybridization (ISH) reveals low levels of aromatase mRNA with poor signal:noise, the activity of our reporters is robust and offers superior cellular resolution (Figure S2). In addition, labeling the brain for PLAP activity reveals the soma and projection fibers of neurons expressing aromatase (Figure S3). A comparison of aromatase-positive cells in adult male and female mice bearing the aromatase-IPIN allele reveals several previously undescribed sexual dimorphisms. We find sex differences in both the number and projection patterns of aromatase-expressing neurons. We find more aromatase-positive cells in the BNST and MeA in males compared to females (Figures 2A–2D and 2P). These two regions have previously been shown to regulate sexual and aggressive behaviors (Albert and Walsh, 1984Albert D.J. Walsh M.L. Neural systems and the inhibitory modulation of agonistic behavior: a comparison of mammalian species.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1984; 8: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Kondo et al., 1998Kondo Y. Sachs B.D. Sakuma Y.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5245-5253PubMed Google Scholar). We also observe sexual dimorphism in cell number in the caudal hypothalamus, where we observe more aromatase-expressing cells in females compared with males (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2P). The presence of more aromatase-positive neurons in the female caudal hypothalamus is surprising as there is little testosterone in the female circulation that could serve as a substrate for conversion to estrogen. In any case, most βgal-positive cells (>95%; n ≥ 3) in these dimorphic clusters express the pan-neuronal marker NeuN, indicating that they are neurons. A similar proportion of NeuN-positive cells in the BNST and MeA expresses βgal in both sexes, indicating an absolute increase in the total number of neurons in these regions in males (Supplemental Text). Labeling for PLAP activity also revealed sex differences in the fibers of aromatase-expressing neurons. Consistent with the dimorphisms in cell number, PLAP labeling reveals a richer plexus of fibers in the BNST and MeA in males and in the caudal hypothalamus in females (Figure S3). We also observe previously undescribed dimorphic processes in the anterior hypothalamic (AH) region and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), with PLAP-labeled fibers occupying a larger volume in males compared with females (Figures 2G–2J and 2P). In contrast to the poorly characterized anterior hypothalamic region, the VMH is known to regulate feeding and sexual behaviors (Musatov et al., 2006Musatov S. Chen W. Pfaff D.W. Kaplitt M.G. Ogawa S. RNAi-mediated silencing of estrogen receptor {alpha} in the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus abolishes female sexual behaviors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10456-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Musatov et al., 2007Musatov S. Chen W. Pfaff D.W. Mobbs C.V. Yang X.J. Clegg D.J. Kaplitt M.G. Ogawa S. Silencing of estrogen receptor alpha in the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus leads to metabolic syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Within the limits of detection, the dimorphisms in PLAP activity are unlikely to reflect differences in aromatase expression levels as extended staining did not reveal additional fibers in the female brain. Both the anterior and ventromedial hypothalamic regions contain a few βgal-positive cells in both sexes (Supplemental Text), indicating that the dimorphisms might reflect an increase in arborization of local neurons or projections from distant aromatase-expressing neurons. There are more synapses on VMH neurons in males (Matsumoto and Arai, 1986Matsumoto A. Arai Y. Development of sexual dimorphism in synaptic organization in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus in rats.Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 68: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and our findings suggest that aromatase-positive neurons might contribute to this dimorphic innervation. The pattern of PLAP-labeled fibers surrounding the VMH resembles afferent input to this structure from the BNST, MeA, POA, and septum (Canteras et al., 1995Canteras N.S. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W.

(Berl.). 1999; 199: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each of these afferent regions expresses aromatase (Figures 1 and S1), and might contribute to the dimorphic PLAP labeling in the VMH. Taken together, our studies using genetically encoded reporters reveal previously undescribed sex differences in aromatase-expressing neural pathways. We tested whether masculinization of aromatase-positive neural pathways requires the activity of androgens such as testosterone signaling through AR. We crossed mice carrying the aromatase-IPIN allele to animals harboring the tfm allele, a loss-of-function allele of the X-linked AR (Charest et al., 1991Charest N.J. Zhou Z.X. Lubahn D.B. Olsen K.L. Wilson E.M. French F.S. A frameshift mutation destabilizes androgen receptor messenger RNA in the Tfm mouse.Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We find male typical differentiation of aromatase-positive neurons in Tfm mutant males. The number of βgal-positive neurons in the BNST, MeA, and caudal hypothalamus is similar between Tfm and WT males (Figures 3A–3F and 3K). Staining for PLAP activity labels male typical projection patterns in the VMH and the anterior hypothalamic area of Tfm mutant males (Figures 3G–3K). These findings demonstrate that masculinization of the number and projections of aromatase-expressing neurons is largely independent of testosterone signaling through AR. We next sought to determine the influence of estrogen in establishing the sexual dimorphisms in aromatase-positive neurons. The complexity and redundancy within estrogen signaling pathways makes it difficult to test the relevance of individual ERs in establishing dimorphisms in aromatase expression. We therefore asked if estrogen is sufficient to masculinize aromatase expression in females. Because estrogen influences sexual differentiation of neural pathways in the early neonatal period in male rodents (McCarthy, 2008McCarthy M.M. Estradiol and the developing brain.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 91-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), we treated female pups bearing the aromatase-IPIN allele with estrogen at P1 (postnatal day 1, the day of birth), P8, and P15. A cohort of control females was administered vehicle (NV) at these time points. The dosage and injection schedule were chosen as being the most effective at masculinizing aromatase-positive neurons. We find that in females administered estrogen neonatally (NE), aromatase-expressing neural pathways appear indistinguishable from those observed in WT males (Figure 4). These data demonstrate that neonatally administered estrogen can masculinize both the cell number and projection patterns of aromatase-expressing neurons. Our results show that the masculinization of aromatase-positive neurons is independent of AR (Figure 3) and can be induced in females by neonatal estrogen (Figure 4). In neonates, the ovaries are quiescent whereas the testes generate a surge in circulating testosterone immediately after birth (McCarthy, 2008McCarthy M.M. Estradiol and the developing brain.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 91-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that aromatization of testosterone into estrogen masculinizes aromatase-positive neurons during this period. To test this hypothesis, we provided testosterone to neonatal females. We find that testosterone administration is equivalent to estrogen supplementation in masculinizing aromatase-expressing neural pathways (Figure S6A), suggesting that testosterone induces male differentiation of these neurons after its conversion into estrogen in vivo. We wished to uncover the mechanism whereby estrogen drives sexual differentiation of aromatase-positive neurons. An equivalent number of cells expresses aromatase in both sexes in the BNST and MeA at P1, whereas there are more βgal-positive cells in these regions in males compared to females at P14 (Figures 5A–5E, and data not shown). Neurons in the BNST and MeA are born prenatally in rodents (al-Shamma and De Vries, 1996al-Shamma H.A. De Vries G.J. Neurogenesis of the sexually dimorphic vasopressin cells of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala of rats.J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Bayer, 1980Bayer S.A. Quantitative 3H-thymidine radiographic analyses of neurogenesis in the rat amygdala.J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 194: 845-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and we therefore asked if the sexual dimorphisms in these regions resulted from sex-specific apoptosis. We labeled apoptotic nuclei in the neonatal BNST and MeA with the TUNEL assay. We find more TUNEL-positive cells in the BNST in females compared to males at several time points from P1 to P10, a finding consistent with previous work (Gotsiridze et al., 2007Gotsiridze T. Kang N. Jacob D. Forger N.G. Development of sex differences in the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis of mice: role of Bax-dependent cell death.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observe a similar increase in TUNEL-positive cells in the MeA in females compared with males at these time points (Figures 5F–5I). The most significant sex difference in cell death was observed at P4 in the MeA and P7 in the BNST, with a ∼2-fold increase in apoptotic nuclei in females compared with males (Figure 5J). Because the conditions for TUNEL preclude colabeling for βgal, we immunolabeled sections through the BNST and MeA for βgal and effectors of apoptosis (using a cocktail of antibodies to activated caspase-3, caspase-9, and Apaf-1) in P7 mice bearing the aromatase-IPIN allele. In accord with results of the TUNEL assay, these effectors of apoptosis label significantly more cells in females than in males in the BNST and MeA (≥2-fold in each region; n = 3; p < 0.001). We find many apoptotic cells expressing βgal in both sexes, with significantly more double-labeled cells present in females compared to males (% apoptotic cells expressing βgal in BNST: females, 50 ± 1; males, 26 ± 2, n = 3, p < 0.001; % apoptotic cells expressing βgal in MeA: females, 54 ± 2; males, 35 ± 3, n = 3, p < 0.01). Because neonatally administered estrogen is sufficient to masculinize aromatase-positive neurons in the female BNST and MeA, we asked whether such supplementation promoted the survival of cells fated to die in these regions. Neonatal estrogen treatment promotes cell survival such that the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the BNST and MeA is indistinguishable between NE females and WT males (Figure 5J). Such cell survival promoting effects of estrogen are reminiscent of the known neuroprotective effects of this hormone (Arai et al., 1996Arai Y. Sekine Y. Murakami S. Estrogen and apoptosis in the developing sexually dimorphic preoptic area in female rats.Neurosci. Res. 1996; 25: 403-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Is estrogen synthesis essential for cell survival in the BNST and MeA? To address this issue, we analyzed cell death in male mice null for aromatase (Honda et al., 1998Honda S. Harada N. Ito S. Takagi Y. Maeda S. Disruption of sexual behavior in male aromatase-deficient mice lacking exons 1 and 2 of the cyp19 gene.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In these males, the number of apoptotic figures is comparable to that observed in WT females, and significantly different from WT males (Figure 5J). In summary, we observe more cell death in the BNST and MeA in females than in males, with an increase in the survival of aromatase-expressing cells in males compared with females. Further, administration of estrogen to female pups reduces cell death whereas abrogation of estrogen synthesis increases apoptosis in males, demonstrating that estrogen is necessary and sufficient to promote cell survival in the BNST and MeA. We tested adult NE females bearing the aromatase-IPIN allele to determine whether sex specific behaviors were also masculinized. Males reliably mate with females at high frequency whereas females exhibit male pattern sexual behavior at a low frequency toward females (Baum et al., 1974Baum M.J. Sodersten P. Vreeburg J.T.

In sharp contrast to resident males, both NE and NV females mated with intruders in fewer assays, consistent with the notion that neonatal estrogen does not alter the low frequency of male sexual behavior in females (Figure 6C) (Burns-Cusato et al., 2004Burns-Cusato M.

Understanding the mechanisms by which the miRNA pathway is regulated, therefore, represents an important area of investigation. We determined that the human miRNA-generating complex is comprised of Dicer and phospho-TRBP isoforms. Phosphorylation of TRBP is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk. Expression of phospho-mimic TRBP and TRBP phosphorylation enhanced miRNA production by increasing stability of the miRNA-generating complex. Mitogenic signaling in response to serum and the tumor promoter PMA was dependent on TRBP phosphorylation. These effects were accompanied by a coordinated increase in levels of growth-promoting miRNA and reduced expression of let-7 tumor suppressor miRNA. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of MAPK/Erk resulted in an anti-growth miRNA profile. Taken together, these studies indicate that the MAPK/Erk pathway regulates the miRNA machinery and suggest a general principle, wherein signaling systems target the miRNA pathway to achieve biological responses."

Here, fission yeast and human Nbs1 structures defined by X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveal Nbs1 cardinal features: fused, extended, FHA-BRCT(1)-BRCT(2) domains flexibly linked to C-terminal Mre11- and ATM-binding motifs. Genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses of an Nbs1-Ctp1 complex show Nbs1 recruits phosphorylated Ctp1 to DSBs via binding of the Nbs1 FHA domain to a Ctp1 pThr-Asp motif. Nbs1 structures further identify an extensive FHA-BRCT interface, a bipartite MDC1-binding scaffold, an extended conformational switch, and the molecular consequences associated with cancer predisposing Nijmegen breakage syndrome mutations. Tethering of Ctp1 to a flexible Nbs1 arm suggests a mechanism for restricting DNA end processing and homologous recombination activities of Sae2/Ctp1/CtIP to the immediate vicinity of DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W2038386885,"KRAS mutations occur in 35-45% of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC) and preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted therapy with cetuximab or panitumumab. However, less than 20% patients displaying wild-type KRAS tumors achieve objective response. Alterations in other effectors downstream of the EGFR, such as BRAF, and deregulation of the PIK3CA/PTEN pathway have independently been found to give rise to resistance. We present a comprehensive analysis of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations, and PTEN expression in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab, with the aim of clarifying the relative contribution of these molecular alterations to resistance.We retrospectively analyzed objective tumor response, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) together with the mutational status of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and expression of PTEN in 132 tumors from cetuximab or panitumumab treated mCRC patients. Among the 106 non-responsive patients, 74 (70%) had tumors with at least one molecular alteration in the four markers. The probability of response was 51% (22/43) among patients with no alterations, 4% (2/47) among patients with 1 alteration, and 0% (0/24) for patients with > or =2 alterations (p<0.0001). Accordingly, PFS and OS were increasingly worse for patients with tumors harboring none, 1, or > or =2 molecular alteration(s) (p<0.001).When expression of PTEN and mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies can be identified. We propose to define as 'quadruple negative', the CRCs lacking alterations in KRAS, BRAF, PTEN and PIK3CA. Comprehensive molecular dissection of the EGFR signaling pathways should be considered to select mCRC patients for cetuximab- or panitumumab-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2146742867,"GABAergic interneurons are key elements in neural coding, but the mechanisms that assemble inhibitory circuits remain unclear. In the spinal cord, the transfer of sensory signals to motor neurons is filtered by GABAergic interneurons that act presynaptically to inhibit sensory transmitter release and postsynaptically to inhibit motor neuron excitability. We show here that the connectivity and synaptic differentiation of GABAergic interneurons that mediate presynaptic inhibition is directed by their sensory targets. In the absence of sensory terminals these GABAergic neurons shun other available targets, fail to undergo presynaptic differentiation, and withdraw axons from the ventral spinal cord. A sensory-specific source of brain derived neurotrophic factor induces synaptic expression of the GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65--a defining biochemical feature of this set of interneurons. The organization of a GABAergic circuit that mediates presynaptic inhibition in the mammalian CNS is therefore controlled by a stringent program of sensory recognition and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2169593095,"We have studied the function of a conserved germline-specific nucleotidyltransferase protein, CDE-1, in RNAi and chromosome segregation in C. elegans. CDE-1 localizes specifically to mitotic chromosomes in embryos. This localization requires the RdRP EGO-1, which physically interacts with CDE-1, and the Argonaute protein CSR-1. We found that CDE-1 is required for the uridylation of CSR-1 bound siRNAs, and that in the absence of CDE-1 these siRNAs accumulate to inappropriate levels, accompanied by defects in both meiotic and mitotic chromosome segregation. Elevated siRNA levels are associated with erroneous gene silencing, most likely through the inappropriate loading of CSR-1 siRNAs into other Argonaute proteins. We propose a model in which CDE-1 restricts specific EGO-1-generated siRNAs to the CSR-1 mediated, chromosome associated RNAi pathway, thus separating it from other endogenous RNAi pathways.

RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which genes are silenced by small RNA molecules (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (10946) Google Scholar, Mello and Conte, 2004Mello C.C.

Genetic screens, in combination with biochemical studies, have elucidated the genes and mechanisms involved in the initiation and amplification of the RNAi response in C. elegans. Primary siRNAs are generated from long dsRNA via cleavage by DCR-1 and are incorporated in the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), whose main component is the Argonaute protein RDE-1. RISC is then targeted to an RNA molecule by sequence complementarity, marking this RNA for silencing. An RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) is then recruited and, using the targeted RNA as a template, synthesizes secondary siRNAs (Pak and Fire, 2007Pak J. Fire A.

These secondary siRNAs are then loaded into RISCs containing any of a number of secondary, worm-specific Argonautes (WAGOs) (Yigit et al., 2006Yigit E. Batista P.J. Bei Y. Pang K.M. Chen C.C.

Several endogenous functions of the RNAi machinery in C. elegans have been described thus far. First, some genes involved in RNAi were found to be required for transposon silencing (Ketting et al., 1999Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H. van Luenen H.G. Plasterk R.H.

Plasterk R.H. Transposon silencing in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline by natural RNAi.Nature. 2003; 426: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Second, several RNAi mutants show a High incidence of males (Him) phenotype (Ketting et al., 1999Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H. van Luenen H.G. Plasterk R.H.

A direct role for RNAi components in this process has however not yet been demonstrated in animals. Work in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has given a clear indication for a direct role of RNAi in genome stability. In S. pombe, RNAi is required for pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, and therefore for centromere function and faithful chromosome segregation (Hall et al., 2003Hall I.M. Noma K. Grewal S.I. RNA interference machinery regulates chromosome dynamics during mitosis and meiosis in fission yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 193-198Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Martienssen et al., 2005Martienssen R.A. Zaratiegui M. Goto D.B. RNA interference and heterochromatin in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 450-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Two interacting protein complexes are involved in this mechanism. One is the RNA-Induced Transcriptional Silencing (RITS) complex, which consists of the Argonaute protein Ago1, the chromodomain protein Chp1, and the adaptor protein Tas3, and the other is the RNA-Directed RNApolymerase Complex (RDRC), which contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase Rdp1, the helicase Hrr1, and the nucleotidyltransferase Cid12 (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R. Verdel A. Colmenares S.U. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Moazed D.

Both of these complexes are required to maintain silencing of pericentromeric repetitive sequences. Integrity of this pericentromeric heterochromatin is required both for the initial loading of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A (Folco et al., 2008Folco H.D. Pidoux A.L. Urano T. Allshire R.C. Heterochromatin and RNAi are required to establish CENP-A chromatin at centromeres.Science. 2008; 319: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and for the establisment of a rigid structural framework of cohesins between the sister centromeres, to allow for bipolar spindle orientation and attachment (reviewed in Ekwall, 2004Ekwall K. The roles of histone modifications and small RNA in centromere function.Chromosome Res. 2004; 12: 535-542Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutation of the nucleotidyltransferase Cid12 leads to increased errors in chromosome segregation due to premature loss of centromeric cohesion (Win et al., 2006Win T.Z. Stevenson A.L. Wang S.W.

Biol. 2005; 15: 378-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In a previous screen for genes involved in an RNAi-related silencing phenomenon named cosuppression (Robert et al., 2005Robert V.J. Sijen T. van Wolfswinkel J. Plasterk R.H. Chromatin and RNAi factors protect the C. elegans germline against repetitive sequences.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we identified rde-3/mut-2 as well as two new family members: cde-1 and cde-2 (for cosuppression defective). Cde-1 has since been named cid-1 (for caffeine induced death) (Olsen et al., 2006Olsen A. Vantipalli M.C. Lithgow G.J. Checkpoint proteins control survival of the postmitotic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2006; 312: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and pup-1 (for poly(U) polymerase). However, cde-1 mutant worms do not show a cid phenotype, nor does the name pup-1 reveal any biological function, thus we prefer the name cde-1. Here, we describe cde-1 as a gene involved in RNAi and chromosome segregation. We place CDE-1 in a molecular pathway with the RdRP enzyme EGO-1 and the Argonaute CSR-1, with all three proteins localizing to chromosomes (also see Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S. Ketting R.F. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C.

CDE-1 uridylates siRNAs generated in the context of the CSR-1 pathway, and loss of CDE-1 results in an increase of CSR-1 siRNA levels. This is accompanied by defects in chromosome segregation, much like those observed in csr-1 mutants (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S. Ketting R.F. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C.

We also present evidence that in cde-1 mutants, siRNAs that are usually bound by CSR-1 now feed into other, CSR-1 independent RNAi pathways, including those mediating mRNA turnover. Thus, we propose that CDE-1 restricts siRNAs produced from specific loci by EGO-1 to one particular Argonaute, CSR-1, thereby playing a role in keeping the diverse RNAi pathways in C. elegans distinct and functionally separated from each other. The cde-1 gene, K10D2.3, encodes a member of a larger protein family, often referred to as the TRF-like nucleotidyltransferases, with family members present from yeast to mammals (Figures 1A and 1B). CDE-1 has two TRF-like domains, of which only the more C-terminal one appears to be catalytically active, based on conservation of catalytic residues. We have raised an antibody against CDE-1 and have used that to immunopurify CDE-1 from C. elegans embryonic extracts and test its nucleotidyltransferase activity in vitro. In these assays, CDE-1 preferentially adds uridine nucleotides to the 3′ end of a short RNA probe (Figure 1C), consistent with in vitro experiments using a recombinant CDE-1 fragment (Kwak and Wickens, 2007Kwak J.E. Wickens M. A family of poly(U) polymerases.RNA. 2007; 13: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Rissland et al., 2007Rissland O.S. Mikulasova A. Norbury C.J. Efficient RNA polyuridylation by noncanonical poly(A) polymerases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3612-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The activity displayed by CDE-1 is not very processive as indicated by the relatively short U-tails added to the substrate. Furthermore, the transferase activity is inhibited by the presence of a 2′O-methyl group on the most 3′ nucleotide, a chemical modification found on some endogenous small RNA molecules (data not shown). To study the role of cde-1 in vivo we have used two deletion alleles (tm1021 and tm936) (Figure 1B). Both alleles behave identically. Cde-1 mutants do not display notable defects in general RNA metabolism, as judged by Northern blotting experiments for a number of noncoding RNAs (see Figure S1A available with this article online), but two endogenous siRNAs were slightly reduced in abundance (Figure S1B). Furthermore, both cde-1 mutant alleles are fully sensitive to RNAi against somatically expressed genes but show reduced sensitivity to RNAi against germline genes (Figure 1D). It was previously reported that RNAi-mediated knockdown of cde-1 relieves cosuppression (Robert et al., 2005Robert V.J. Sijen T. van Wolfswinkel J. Plasterk R.H. Chromatin and RNAi factors protect the C. elegans germline against repetitive sequences.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We used the two cde-1 alleles to confirm this phenotype (Figure 1E). Finally, we also tested the transposon activation phenotype described before by Robert et al. (Robert et al., 2005Robert V.J. Sijen T. van Wolfswinkel J. Plasterk R.H. Chromatin and RNAi factors protect the C. elegans germline against repetitive sequences.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon testing Tc1 and Tc3 activity we found that only Tc1 becomes activated in the cde-1 mutant background, and that this is accompanied by a loss of Tc1 specific siRNAs and by an increased load of double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis (Figures S2 and S3). We performed in situ hybridization to detect the localization of endogenous cde-1 mRNA (Figure 2A). On whole mounts, clear staining of the gonad arms was visible and no other expression patterns were detected. Closer inspection on extruded gonads showed cde-1 mRNA throughout the entire gonad, without clear localization to a specific region. Northern blot analysis showed that the cde-1 signal was drastically decreased in the glp-4(bn2) mutant, which lacks a germline (Beanan and Strome, 1992Beanan M.J. Strome S. Characterization of a germ-line proliferation mutation in C. elegans.Development. 1992; 116: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar) compared to wild-type worms, confirming its germline localization (Figure 2B). These results are consistent with cde-1 expression data from previous microarray studies (Kim et al., 2001Kim S.K. Lund J. Kiraly M. Duke K. Jiang M. Stuart J.M. Eizinger A. Wylie B.N. Davidson G.S.

Cell. 2000; 6: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We used the antibodies raised against CDE-1 to examine its cellular and subcellular localization pattern throughout development. CDE-1 was detected throughout the female germline cytoplasm, where we found it to be enriched in the perinuclear region (Figure 2C). However, CDE-1 did not display the clear granular structure that is commonly observed for the P granule marker PGL-1 at this stage. In the sperm-producing germlines of both males and L4 stage hermaphrodites, bright granules were found in close proximity to the condensing DNA of maturating sperm. In embryos, CDE-1 was detected in perinuclear granules in the P-cell lineage, mainly colocalizing with PGL-1 (Figure 2D). In addition, staining could be detected on the outer edges of condensing chromosomes at prometaphase. This staining became more intense on the spindle-facing sides of the metaphase plate and remained detectable through anaphase (Figure 2E). Parallel experiments in cde-1 mutant animals did not show the patterns described above (Figure S4), indicating that the observed signals reflect true CDE-1 localization. Specific intestinal staining as previously reported based on a transgenic approach (Olsen et al., 2006Olsen A. Vantipalli M.C. Lithgow G.J. Checkpoint proteins control survival of the postmitotic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2006; 312: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) could not be detected. The brood of the cde-1 mutant animals contains an increasing proportion of nonhatching eggs as animals age, ranging from 5% on the first day of adulthood to 80% on day 4 (data not shown). This is accompanied by an elevated percentage of males, suggesting that cde-1 may affect chromosome segregation. We looked further into this embryonic viability phenotype using a number of assays. First, to evaluate the contribution of missegregation during mitosis in the germline we studied the chromosomal content of pachytene nuclei using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with a probe against chromosome V. Among 500 cde-1 nuclei analyzed, no aberrations were detected, indicating that mitotic germline missegregation is rare (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the chromosomes in diakinetic oocytes using regular DAPI staining. This revealed that in cde-1 mutants frequently one or more bivalents separated into univalents (Figures 3A, S3D, and S3E), most likely causing the observed Him phenotype in the cde-1 mutant. This indicates that the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is affected by CDE-1. Third, we used SNP typing to characterize the gross chromosomal makeup of 104 nonhatching eggs that resulted from a cross between cde-1 and males of a Hawaiian strain of C. elegans. (For a detailed description and additional controls see Supplemental Results and Figure S5). In 29% of the dead embryos, abnormal underrepresentation of one or more chromosomes was detected (Figure 3B). In 46% of those embryos, abnormalities involved more than one chromosome, indicating a major segregation failure. Both Bristol copies and Hawaiian copies were affected (Figure S5A). The fact that not only N2-derived chromosomes, but also Hawaiian-derived chromosomes were affected by cde-1 mutation, suggests that at least part of the missegregation occurs during embryonic mitosis. In order to find cytological indications for embryonic missegregation, we stained early embryos for DNA and microtubules. In early embryos of cde-1 mutants grown at 25°C several aberrant segregation figures were identified (Figure S6). Bridging DNA at anaphase was frequently detected, and occasionally severe spindle defects such as a tripolar spindle were observed. Aberrant chromosome segregation during embryonic cell division was confirmed by FISH on early embryos with probes against chromosome V: out of 32 wild-type 2-12 cell embryos only 2 showed aberrant segregation, whereas 23 aberrant segregation patterns were found among 36 cde-1 mutant embryos (Figure 3C). We next used video microscopy to visualize the first embryonic divisions in real time. Still frames from representative movies (Movies S1–S3) are shown in Figure 3D. Two major defects were identified in the cde-1 embryos from aged mothers. First, bridging DNA at anaphase was frequently observed. Although mitosis was carried to completion in all cases, chromosome bridging was present throughout anaphase, resulting in two daughter nuclei that remained connected to each other by DNA strands (Figure 3E middle panel). Upon cytokinesis these strands were broken, resulting in a seemingly normal 2-cell embryo, although some DNA was probably lost during this division. The second defect concerned extrusion of the second polar body. In several of the subsequent divisions, the second polar body remained present in the cytoplasm, and could therefore join the pronuclei in the division (Figure 3E, right panel). We note that this type of meiotic defect will influence the read-out in some of the above-mentioned experiments, which analyze paternal and maternal chromosomes at the same time. Therefore we repeated the FISH analysis using probes against an integrated transgenic locus that was crossed in via a wild-type male (Figure 3D). This showed clear evidence of mitotic defects in embryos derived from cde-1 mutant mothers, but not in those derived from wild-type mothers. To further evaluate the function of CDE-1 in mitosis we studied the localization of centromeric histone protein CENP-A and outer kinetochore protein CENP-F using immunohistochemistry. In wild-type embryos these proteins localize in what appear to be parallel lines on the spindle facing sides of the metaphase plate (Figure 3F) (Buchwitz et al., 1999Buchwitz B.J. Ahmad K. Moore L.L. Roth M.B. Henikoff S. A histone-H3-like protein in C. elegans.Nature. 1999; 401: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In cde-1 mutants, CENP-A loaded normally onto chromosomes at prometaphase (Figure S7A), and formed clear concentrations at metaphase. However, frequently CENP-A did not form straight lines along the metaphase plate. Instead, CENP-A appeared interrupted, with connections between the two faces of the plate, or was “striped,” with many lines of CENP-A in parallel, resulting in a twisted appearance of the metaphase plate. Staining of the outer kinetochore protein CENP-F (Moore et al., 1999Moore L.L. Morrison M. Roth M.B. HCP-1, a protein involved in chromosome segregation, is localized to the centromere of mitotic chromosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 471-480Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) confirmed the notion that the metaphase plate is disorganized in cde-1 (Figure S7B). To analyze the metaphase plate defects in more detail we followed formation and separation of the metaphase plate in real time using GFP::KBP-4 as a kinetochore marker (Gassmann et al., 2008Gassmann R. Essex A. Hu J.S. Maddox P.S. Motegi F. Sugimoto A. O'Rourke S.M. Bowerman B. McLeod I. Yates 3rd, J.R. et al.A new mechanism controlling kinetochore-microtubule interactions revealed by comparison of two dynein-targeting components: SPDL-1 and the Rod/Zwilch/Zw10 complex.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). KBP-4 begins to flank opposite faces of the chromosomes during prophase, and rapidly becomes visible as two distinct lines on the spindle-facing sides of the metaphase plate as the result of chromosome alignment. As shown in Figure 3G, in absence of CDE-1, KBP-4 loads normally onto chromosomes, at least at the resolution of our current analysis. However, CDE-1 appears to be required for efficient alignment of the chromosomes at the metaphase plate, as mutant embryos often go into anaphase when chromosomes have not yet fully aligned. This is consistent with our finding that the disorganized metaphase plates observed using immunohistochemistry were also observed in wild-type embryos, albeit at a much lower frequency (Figures 3F and S7B), suggesting that the disorganized state of the metaphase plate also occurs in wild-type animals, but becomes more rapidly organized compared to metaphase plates in cde-1 mutants. In fission yeast, the nucleotidyltransferase protein Cid12 associates with the RdRP enzyme Rdp1. In turn this complex interacts with the Argonaute protein Ago1 (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R. Verdel A. Colmenares S.U. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Two RNAi complexes, RITS and RDRC, physically interact and localize to noncoding centromeric RNAs.Cell. 2004; 119: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For various reasons, EGO-1 (an RdRP) and CSR-1 (an Argonaute) are C. elegans candidates to interact with CDE-1 in a similar manner. First, EGO-1 and CSR-1 show localization to and around the metaphase plate (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S. Ketting R.F. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C.

Second, csr-1 is one of three Argonaute genes that had been identified in the cosuppression screen in which also cde-1 was identified (Robert et al., 2005Robert V.J. Sijen T. van Wolfswinkel J. Plasterk R.H. Chromatin and RNAi factors protect the C. elegans germline against repetitive sequences.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Third, mutations in csr-1 and ego-1 also lead to defects in CENP-A localization and chromosome segregation (Figure S7C) (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S. Ketting R.F. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C.

We therefore asked whether CDE-1 interacts with EGO-1 and CSR-1. First we asked whether subcellular localization of CDE-1 depends on EGO-1 and CSR-1. We used RNAi in an RNAi hypersensitive genetic background (rrf-3 mutant) to knock down ego-1 and csr-1. In rrf-3 mutant embryos, CDE-1 localized to the outside of the metaphase plate, just as in wild-type embryos. After RNAi against ego-1, CDE-1 localization was dispersed over the whole plate (Figure 4A). The granular structures found on condensing sperm DNA were no longer detectable, but instead a halo around the DNA was formed. On the other hand, RNAi against csr-1 resulted in very faint (but correct) or no localization of CDE-1 to the metaphase plate. Sperm granules still contained CDE-1 after csr-1 knock-down, but these granules did not associate with the condensing DNA anymore (Figure 4A). P-granule localization of CDE-1 was not affected by knock-down of either ego-1 or csr-1 (data not shown). EGO-1 and CSR-1 localization in absence of CDE-1 appears to be largely normal (data not shown). To test whether CDE-1, EGO-1 and CSR-1 physically interact we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 4B). Using antibodies specific for CDE-1 we were able to pull down EGO-1, but not CSR-1 (not shown), from embryonic extracts. EGO-1 did not come down from cde-1 mutant extracts, while EGO-1 levels were normal. These results strongly suggest that CDE-1 and EGO-1 are present in a shared complex. We used deep sequencing of wild-type and cde-1 mutant small RNA libraries to gain further insights in the role of CDE-1 in small RNA metabolism. More than 5 million reads were obtained from each library (Table S2). To analyze the data, we first removed all reads derived from structural RNAs like rRNAs and tRNAs. Then, we defined five classes of (potential) genuine RNAi related small RNAs: siRNAs (antisense to coding regions), miRNAs, 21U RNAs, repeat derived small RNAs and “other” (see Supplem"

Nuclease (Mre11) and scaffolding (Rad50) components of MRN have been extensively characterized, but the molecular basis of Nbs1 function has remained elusive. Here, we present a 2.3A crystal structure of the N-terminal region of fission yeast Nbs1, revealing an unusual but conserved architecture in which the FHA- and BRCT-repeat domains structurally coalesce. We demonstrate that diphosphorylated pSer-Asp-pThr-Asp motifs, recently identified as multicopy docking sites within Mdc1, are evolutionarily conserved Nbs1 binding targets. Furthermore, we show that similar phosphomotifs within Ctp1, the fission yeast ortholog of human CtIP, promote interactions with the Nbs1 FHA domain that are necessary for Ctp1-dependent resistance to DNA damage. Finally, we establish that human Nbs1 interactions with Mdc1 occur through both its FHA- and BRCT-repeat domains, suggesting how their structural and functional interdependence underpins Nbs1 adaptor functions in the DNA-damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2019100219,"A property of long-term memory (LTM) induction is the requirement for repeated training sessions spaced over time. This augmentation of memory formation with spaced resting intervals is called the spacing effect. We now show that in Drosophila, the duration of resting intervals required for inducing LTM is regulated by activity levels of the protein tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew (CSW). Overexpression of wild-type CSW in mushroom body neurons shortens the inter-trial interval required for LTM induction, whereas overexpression of constitutively active CSW proteins prolongs these resting intervals. These gain-of-function csw mutations are associated with a clinical condition of mental retardation. Biochemical analysis reveals that LTM-inducing training regimens generate repetitive waves of CSW-dependent MAPK activation, the length of which appears to define the duration of the resting interval. Constitutively active CSW proteins prolong the resting interval by altering the MAPK inactivation cycle. We thus provide insight into the molecular basis of the spacing effect."
https://openalex.org/W2078071018,"The IGF receptor type 1 (IGF-1R) pathway is frequently deregulated in human tumors and has become a target of interest for anti-cancer therapy.We used a panel of 22 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to investigate predictive biomarkers of response to R1507, a fully-humanized anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (Ab; Roche). 5 lines were moderately sensitive (25-50% growth inhibition) to R1507 alone. While levels of phospho-IGF-1R did not correlate with drug sensitivity, 4 out of 5 sensitive lines displayed high levels of total IGF-1R versus 1 out of 17 resistant lines (p = 0.003, Fisher's Exact). Sensitive lines also harbored higher copy numbers of IGF-1R as assessed by independent SNP array analysis. Addition of erlotinib or paclitaxel to R1507 led to further growth inhibition in sensitive but not resistant lines. In one EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (11-18), R1507 and erlotinib co-treatment induced apoptosis, whereas treatment with either drug alone induced only cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was mediated, in part, by the survival-related AKT pathway. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of total IGF-1R with an anti-total IGF-1R Ab (G11;Ventana) was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 270 independent NSCLC tumor samples. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3+. 39.3% of tumors showed medium to high IGF-1R IHC staining (scores of 2+ or 3+, respectively), while 16.7% had scores of 3+.In NSCLC cell lines, high levels of total IGF-1R are associated with moderate sensitivity to R1507. These results suggest a possible enrichment strategy for clinical trials with anti-IGF-1R therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039208113,"Background Although fibroblast-to-myocyte electrical coupling is experimentally suggested, electrophysiology of cardiac fibroblasts is not as well established as contractile cardiac myocytes. The present study was therefore designed to characterize ion channels in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts. Methods and Findings A whole-cell patch voltage clamp technique and RT-PCR were employed to determine ion channels expression and their molecular identities. We found that multiple ion channels were heterogeneously expressed in human cardiac fibroblasts. These include a big conductance Ca2+-activated K+ current (BKCa) in most (88%) human cardiac fibroblasts, a delayed rectifier K+ current (IKDR) and a transient outward K+ current (Ito) in a small population (15 and 14%, respectively) of cells, an inwardly-rectifying K+ current (IKir) in 24% of cells, and a chloride current (ICl) in 7% of cells under isotonic conditions. In addition, two types of voltage-gated Na+ currents (INa) with distinct properties were present in most (61%) human cardiac fibroblasts. One was a slowly inactivated current with a persistent component, sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX) inhibition (INa.TTX, IC50 = 7.8 nM), the other was a rapidly inactivated current, relatively resistant to TTX (INa.TTXR, IC50 = 1.8 µM). RT-PCR revealed the molecular identities (mRNAs) of these ion channels in human cardiac fibroblasts, including KCa.1.1 (responsible for BKCa), Kv1.5, Kv1.6 (responsible for IKDR), Kv4.2, Kv4.3 (responsible for Ito), Kir2.1, Kir2.3 (for IKir), Clnc3 (for ICl), NaV1.2, NaV1.3, NaV1.6, NaV1.7 (for INa.TTX), and NaV1.5 (for INa.TTXR). Conclusions These results provide the first information that multiple ion channels are present in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts, and suggest the potential contribution of these ion channels to fibroblast-myocytes electrical coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2116618150,"The effects of diet-induced obesity on skeletal muscle function are largely unknown, particularly as it relates to changes in oxidative metabolism and morphology.Compared to control fed mice, mice fed a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal: fat) for 8 weeks displayed increased body mass and insulin resistance without overt fasting hyperglycemia (i.e. pre-diabetic). Histological analysis revealed a greater oxidative potential in the HFD gastrocnemius/plantaris (increased IIA, reduced IIB fiber-type percentages) and soleus (increased I, IIA cross-sectional areas) muscles, but no change in fiber type percentages in tibialis anterior muscles compared to controls. Intramyocellular lipid levels were significantly increased relative to control in HFD gastrocnemius/plantaris, but were similar to control values in the HFD soleus. Using a novel, single muscle fiber approach, impairments in complete palmitate and glucose oxidation (72.8+/-6.6% and 61.8+/-9.1% of control, respectively; p<0.05) with HFD were detected. These reductions were consistent with measures made using intact extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. Compared to controls, no difference in succinate dehydrogenase or citrate synthase enzyme activities were observed between groups in any muscle studied, however, short-chain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) activity was elevated in the HFD soleus, but not tibialis anterior muscles. Despite these morphological and metabolic alterations, no significant difference in peak tetanic force or low-frequency fatigue rates were observed between groups.These findings indicate that HFD induces early adaptive responses that occur in a muscle-specific pattern, but are insufficient to prevent impairments in oxidative metabolism with continued high-fat feeding. Moreover, the morphological and metabolic changes which occur with 8 weeks of HFD do not significantly impact muscle contractile properties."
https://openalex.org/W2160258211,"The coral holobiont includes the coral animal, algal symbionts, and associated microbial community. These microbes help maintain the holobiont homeostasis; thus, sustaining robust mutualistic microbial communities is a fundamental part of long-term coral reef survival. Coastal pollution is one major threat to reefs, and intensive fish farming is a rapidly growing source of this pollution.We investigated the susceptibility and resilience of the bacterial communities associated with a common reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica, to coastal pollution by performing a clonally replicated transplantation experiment in Bolinao, Philippines adjacent to intensive fish farming. Ten fragments from each of four colonies (total of 40 fragments) were followed for 22 days across five sites: a well-flushed reference site (the original fragment source); two sites with low exposure to milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture effluent; and two sites with high exposure. Elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll a, total heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria abundance, virus like particle (VLP) abundances, and culturable Vibrio abundance characterized the high effluent sites. Based on 16S rRNA clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, we observed rapid, dramatic changes in the coral-associated bacterial communities within five days of high effluent exposure. The community composition on fragments at these high effluent sites shifted towards known human and coral pathogens (i.e. Arcobacter, Fusobacterium, and Desulfovibrio) without the host corals showing signs of disease. The communities shifted back towards their original composition by day 22 without reduction in effluent levels.This study reveals fish farms as a likely source of pathogens with the potential to proliferate on corals and an unexpected short-term resilience of coral-associated bacterial communities to eutrophication pressure. These data highlight a need for improved aquaculture practices that can achieve both sustainable industry goals and long-term coral reef survival."
https://openalex.org/W2096309094,"Sensory information is represented in the brain in the form of topographic maps, in which neighboring neurons respond to adjacent external stimuli. In the visual system, the superior colliculus receives topographic projections from the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) that are aligned. Alignment may be achieved through the use of a gradient of shared axon guidance molecules, or through a retinal-matching mechanism in which axons that monitor identical regions of visual space align. To distinguish between these possibilities, we take advantage of genetically engineered mice that we show have a duplicated functional retinocollicular map but only a single map in V1. Anatomical tracing revealed that the corticocollicular projection bifurcates to align with the duplicated retinocollicular map in a manner dependent on the normal pattern of spontaneous activity during development. These data suggest a general model in which convergent maps use coincident activity patterns to achieve alignment."
https://openalex.org/W2166002240,"Neural conversion from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been demonstrated in a variety of systems including chemically defined suspension culture, not requiring extrinsic signals, as well as in an adherent culture method that involves dual SMAD inhibition using Noggin and SB431542 (an inhibitor of activin/nodal signaling). Previous studies have also determined a role for activin/nodal signaling in development of the neural plate and anterior fate specification. We therefore sought to investigate the independent influence of SB431542 both on neural commitment of hESCs and positional identity of derived neural progenitors in chemically defined substrate-free conditions.We show that in non-adherent culture conditions, treatment with SB431542 alone for 8 days is sufficient for highly efficient and accelerated neural conversion from hESCs with negligible mesendodermal, epidermal or trophectodermal contamination. In addition the resulting neural progenitor population has a predominantly caudal identity compared to the more anterior positional fate of non-SB431542 treated cultures. Finally we demonstrate that resulting neurons are electro-physiologically competent.This study provides a platform for the efficient generation of caudal neural progenitors under defined conditions for experimental study."

We reported distinct STRA8 localization in germ and stem cell types and a heterogeneous protein distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus of such cells suggesting that the protein can shuttle between these two compartments. Moreover, we identified specific protein motifs determining its nuclear import/export. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in transfected cell lines the nuclear import of STRA8 is an active process depending on an N-terminal basic nuclear localization signal. Moreover, its nuclear export is mainly mediated by the Exportin1 (XPO1) recognition of a nuclear export signal. Significantly, we also demonstrated that STRA8 associates with DNA and possesses transcriptional activity.

Although all these studies reinforce the importance of Stra8 in gametogenesis and perhaps in stem cell physiology, the molecular functions of this protein remain unknown. Intracellular localization and its dynamics represent important information to identify protein functions. Apart from the study by Oulad-Abdelghani et al. (8.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Décimo D.

Movement of ions, metabolites, and other small molecules through the nuclear pore complex occurs via passive diffusion, but the translocation of cargoes larger than ∼40 kDa generally requires specific transport receptors (14.Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These transport receptors are central to the nuclear import and export steps of recognizing signal-bearing cargoes, interacting with the nuclear pore complex, and delivering the cargo to its destination compartment. The largest group of transport receptors includes structurally related members of the karyopherin-β/importin-β (Kapβ/Impβ) protein family (importins, exportins, or transportins) that usually bind to specific signals within the cargo protein termed nuclear localization signals (NLS) or nuclear export signals (NES), respectively. These have classically been defined as primary amino acid motifs that are both necessary and sufficient for transport. Importin-α recognizes the NLS and forms a ternary complex with importin-β to enter into the nucleus, whereas exportins recognize the NES in the cargo protein, and the complex is exported from the nucleus by binding with the GTP-bound form of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ran (RanGTP) (15.Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The classical NES sequence, a short leucine-rich motif, is specifically bound by the exportin known as exportin 1 (XPO1 or CRM1) (16.Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling plays an important role in regulating the activity of several proteins involved in cell proliferation, transformation and tumorigenesis, and signal transduction (19.Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 20.Gama-Carvalho M. Carmo-Fonseca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, numerous transcription factors are held inactive in the cytoplasm until adequate signals trigger their import to the nucleus and allow activation or repression of their respective target genes. Moreover, the nuclear export machinery also counteracts the slow but steady leakage of cytoplasmic proteins into the nuclear compartment. It was hypothesized that in germ cells and stem cells the regulation of nuclear transport of transcription factors and machinery components could represent an important driver for differentiation (21.Yasuhara N. Shibazaki N. Tanaka S. Nagai M. Kamikawa Y. Oe S. Asally M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Yoneda Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, importin proteins show a distinct localization pattern through ovary and testis development (22.Hogarth C.A. Jans D.A. Loveland K.L. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that Importin13 (Ipo13), a member of importin-β gene family, plays a stage-specific role in nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of cargoes that accompanies meiotic differentiation of the mouse germ cells (23.Yamaguchi Y.L. Tanaka S.S. Yasuda K. Matsui Y. Tam P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 297: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). STRA8 protein has a predicted 46-kDa mass and from the cytoplasmic compartment could passively enter the nucleus. Here, however, we show that this in not the case. In fact, we describe for the first time distinct cellular localizations of this protein in female and male premeiotic germ cells and in embryonic stem and embryonic carcinoma cell lines and identified specific protein motifs regulating its nuclear import/export. The observation that STRA8, previously described as a prevalently cytoplasmic protein, may actually shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus with apparent different dynamics in the cell types analyzed suggests that this protein can exert distinct functions in different cellular compartments. Interestingly, we found that STRA8 can be efficiently cross-linked to DNA, and after binding to DNA, it shows robust transcriptional capability. For immunocytochemical studies, PGCs were obtained from testes and ovary of 13.5 dpc CD-1 mouse embryos following MiniMACS immunomagnetic cell sorter method (PGCs purity >90%) (24.Pesce M. De Felici M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Spermatogonia were obtained from 7 days postpartum CD-1 mice, as reported previously (25.Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESD3, ATCC) were cultured in the presence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 10−4 m 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Immunological Science, Naples, Italy) on gelatin-coated dishes. When indicated, leukemia inhibitory factor was substituted with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for 24 h. Mouse F9 embryonic carcinoma cells (ECF9, ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. PGCs and spermatogonia were left to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated slides before fixation. All cell types were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After a 1-h block in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, rabbit IgG or a polyclonal antibody against STRA8 (Abcam) was added at a 1:250 dilution in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. A goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 or 568, Molecular Probes) was added to the samples for 1 h, and nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33349 (1 μg/ml). Samples were visualized under a Leica CTR600 microscope. The coding region of mouse Stra8 (GenBankTM accession number NM0092921) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from 1 μg of total RNA obtained from 13.5 dpc ovaries using primers 1–3 and 2–3 listed in Table 1. Plasmids expressing the fusion protein GFP-STRA8 and myc-STRA8 were constructed by subcloning the coding sequence of mouse Stra8 to the C terminus of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pCDNA3-N2myc (Stratagene) using restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI. GFP-HLH-STRA8 and myc-HLH-STRA8 (aa 1–84), GFP-ΔHLH-STRA8 (aa 99–393), GFP-NES1 (aa 34–207), GFP-NES2 (aa 174–348), and GFP-NES3 (aa 219–393) fragments were amplified by PCR by using pEGFP-C1-STRA8 as template and primers indicated in Table 1 (1–4, 2–4, 5–3, 6–7, 8–9, and 10–3, respectively) and subcloned in pEGFP-C1 and pCDNA3-N2myc. For the GAL4 binding assay, we constructed the pBIND-STRA8-WT (aa 1–393), pBIND-HLH-STRA8 (aa 1–84), pBIND-NH2-STRA8 (aa 1–207), and pBIND-COOH-STRA8 (aa 209–393) vectors. The STRA8 fragments were amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 1 (primers 11–3, 11–14, 11–7, and 12–3), digested with BamHI and SalI, and inserted into the pBIND vector (Promega) to express fusion protein with GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD). The sequences of cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padova, Italy). The plasmid encoding yellow fluorescent protein-XPO1 (YFP-XPO1) was generously provided by Dr. J. A.

Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min. For myc-STRA8 detection, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Following a blocking step with 10% goat serum in PBS for 45 min, the c-Myc antibody (1:500; 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Nuclei were labeled as above. In the case of leptomycin B (LMB) treatment, at 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 6 ng/ml LMB for 3 h at 37 °C before fixation. Three samples each of about 100 fluorescent cells were counted and scored for subcellular localization in three independent experiments. The WoLF PSORT program (26.Horton P. Keun-Joon P. Takeshi O.

For generation of basic amino acid mutation (Arg to Ala) of pEGFP-STRA8 (Fig. 5B, GFP-STRA8-NLSmut), a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol with specific primers as follows: NLSR28A_R31A, 5′-tgcagaagcttgagcctgcggtggtcgccgcagccctgtcacaggcccg-3′, and NLSR28A_R31A_antisense, 5′-cgggcctgtgacagggctgcggcgaccaccgcaggctcaagcttctgca-3′. NES motif prediction was achieved by using a Web-based NES motif predictor, NES Finder 0.2 (see Fig. 6B). A QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was also used for generation of hydrophobic amino acids mutation to Ala of pEGFP-STRA8 (GFP-STRA8-NES1mut, GFP-STRA8-NES2mut, GFP-STRA8-NES3mut, Fig. 7A) with specific primers as follows: NES1F92A_L94A, 5′-ttgctgaagctcaaagcatccgccaacgcgcaagatgggaatcccaacag-3′, and NES1F92A_L94A_antisense, 5′-ctgttgggattcccatcttgcgcgttggcggatgctttgagcttcagcaa-3′; NES2L216A_F218A, 5′-acctcatggaatttgaacggtatgccaacgcttacaagcagaccatggacctc-3′, and NES2L216A_F218A_antisense, 5′-gaggtccatggtctgcttgtaagcgttggcataccgttcaaattccatgaggt-3′; NES3:I356A_F358A, 5′-ggagaaatttcagctctacatacaggccattgaggctttcaaaagccttggctgtgttaac-3′, and NES3:I356A_F358A_antisense, 5′-gttaacacagccaaggcttttgaaagcctcaatggcctgtatgtagagctgaaatttctcc-3′.

ESD3 and ECF9 cells were treated with ATRA (1 μm) for 24 h before lysis. GC-1 or HEK293 cells were lysed 24 h after transfection. Protein cellular extraction was performed in Lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 15 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mix (Sigma)) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. For cellular protein fractionation, 24 h after transfection cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mix (Sigma)). The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm to pellet nuclei. The supernatants were collected and used as cytosolic fractions. Nuclear fractions were extracted with buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 600 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mix), followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 21,000 × g. Equal cellular amounts of each fraction were used for Western blot analysis. The indicated antibodies were diluted in TBST buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and added to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at room temperature. All proteins were detected with ECL Plus detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by chemiluminescence. GC-1 cells cultured 24 h after transfection with pCDNA3-N2 myc-STRA8 were washed with cold PBS and lysed (20 min at 4 °C) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3% glycerol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mix (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation was carried with 1 μg of c-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-XPO1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibodies. ECF9 and ESD3 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes in the presence of 1 μm ATRA, and 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pEGFP-STRA8. After 24 h, cells were treated or not for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde in the culture medium to cause molecular cross-linking according to a standard protocol. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol solution (Invitrogen). Following the protocol described in Ref. 27.Di Agostino S. Fedele M. Chieffi P. Fusco A. Rossi P. Geremia R. Sette C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, the aqueous phase that contains RNAs was discarded, and DNA (with or without cross-linked proteins) and protein fractions were recovered in the interphase and phenol phase, respectively, after sequential precipitation following the manufacturer's instruction. To isolate DNA-bound proteins, the DNA fraction was resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) and treated with 30 μg/ml DNase for 30 min at 37 °C and sonicated. Total and DNA-bound protein fractions were then diluted in SDS-sample buffer for Western blot analysis with either anti-ERK42/44 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-STRA8 antibodies. 4 × 104 HEK 293 cells were seeded in 24 wells and co-transfected with 200 ng of GAL4 reporter plasmid (pG5-luc, Fig. 9B), 200 ng of each pBIND fusion construct, and 200 ng of pCDNA-3 to make final 600 ng of DNA. For positive control experiments, cells were transfected with 200 ng of pACT-myoD containing the VP16 activation domain and 200 ng of pBIND-Id control vector of CheckMateTM mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega) instead of pBIND vector. Each well also received 10 ng of a pRL-TK vector (Promega) to normalize for transfection efficiency. At 48 h after transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in 20 μl of the cell extracts was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Each extract was assayed three times with a Fluoroskan Ascent FL luminometer. The Firefly luciferase activity was divided by the Renilla luciferase activity, and transcriptional activity was expressed as fold increase over the pBIND (GAL4-DBD alone) control group. Cellular immunolocalization showed positivity for STRA8 in about 30% of PGCs freshly isolated from 13.5-dpc ovaries, whereas male PGCs of the same age were immunonegative. Somatic cells of both sexes were STRA8-negative (Fig. 1A). These observations are consistent with the notion that at this age female PGCs are entering into meiosis, whereas male PGCs are undergoing a mitotic block in G0/G1 (2.Hilscher B. Hilscher W. Bülthoff-Ohnolz B. Krämer U. Birke A. Pelzer H. Gauss G. Cell Tissue Res. 1974; 154: 443-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although in about 55% of the STRA8-positive PGCs, STRA8 was evenly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1, A, upper panel, and C), the protein appeared prevalently nuclear in the rest of the cells (Fig. 1, A, upper panel, and C). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). In 7 days postpartum spermatogonia, distinctive STRA8 immunolocalization was observed (Fig. 1, A, lower panel, and C). About 70% of spermatogonia in the whole population were STRA8-positive, and of these 41% showed the protein immunopositivity exclusively in the cytoplasm, whereas in the remaining a diffuse distribution both in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartment was detected. No STRA8 immunopositivity in somatic cells was observed. Because STRA8 protein was first identified as a retinoic acid-responsive protein in various stem cell types (8.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Décimo D. Gansmuller A. Heyberger S. Dollé P. Bronner S. Lutz Y. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we performed intracellular immunolocalization of the protein also in ESD3 and ECF9 cells cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 μm ATRA. As expected, STRA8 protein was immunodetectable only when cells were stimulated with ATRA (Fig. 2, A and B). In both ECF9 and ESD3 cells, STRA8 was exclusively nuclear, and prolonged ATRA incubation for 48 or 72 h did not change the protein localization (data not shown). To verify whether STRA8 can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm and to identify the localization signals, we produced a GFP-STRA8 fusion protein and transiently expressed the construct in different cell types. In GC-1 cells, the only available germ cell line (SV40 T-large antigen immortalized spermatogonia-like cells (28.Hofmann M.C. Narisawa S. Hess R.A. Millán J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)), in which no STRA8 expression was detectable (data not shown), we observed that GFP-STRA8 localization was heterogeneous with a prevalent presence in the cytoplasm (45%) or throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (38%) and with the 17% of the transfected cells showing the protein exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B). A similar heterogeneous GFP-STRA8 compartmentalization was observed in other transfected non-germ cell types (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting of transfected GC-1 cell cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction lysates probed with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3C) and anti-STRA8 antibody (data not shown) confirmed the heterogeneous distribution of STRA8 in such cells. Because the fusion with GFP may change the biological function of STRA8 because of larger molecular mass (70 kDa instead 46 kDa) and the fusion with a tag could affect the localization of several proteins (29.Birbach A. Bailey S.T. Ghosh S. Schmid J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3615-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we constructed N-terminal Myc-tagged STRA8 expression vector and transfected the construct into both GC-1 cells and HEK293 cells (cells showing very high transfection efficiency). Immunolocalization (supplemental Fig. S1) and immunoblotting analysis (data not shown) gave results comparable with those obtained with the GFP-STRA8 construct. The N-terminal HLH domain is a well conserved region of the Stra8 sequence (NCBI GeneID 20899, aa 17–84; see also supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Fig. S3 in Ref. 12.Baltus A.E. Menke D.B.

Subjects were allocated randomly (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six study groups at each study site, each defining which vaccine should be given and by which schedule (0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-months). For the 0,1,2-month schedule participants received RTS,S/AS01(E) or rabies vaccine at one center and RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/AS02(D) at the other. For the other schedules at both study sites, they received RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/AS02(D). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 10 months post dose 1.The number of serious adverse events reported across groups was balanced. One child had a simple febrile convulsion, which evolved favourably without sequelae, considered to be related to RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccination. Low grade reactions occurred slightly more frequently in recipients of RTS,S/AS than rabies vaccines; grade 3 reactions were infrequent. Less local reactogenicity occurred with RTS,S/AS01(E) than RTS,S/AS02(D). Both candidate vaccines were highly immunogenic for anti-circumsporozoite and anti-Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen antibodies. Recipients of RTS,S/AS01(E) compared to RTS,S/AS02(D) had higher peak anti-circumsporozoite antibody responses for all 3 schedules. Three dose schedules were more immunogenic than 2 dose schedules. Area under the curve analyses for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies were comparable between the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01(E) schedules.Both candidate malaria vaccines were well tolerated. Anti-circumsporozoite responses were greater with RTS,S/AS01(E) than RTS,S/AS02(D) and when 3 rather than 2 doses were given. This study supports the selection of RTS,S/AS01(E) and a 3 dose schedule for further development in children and infants.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00360230."
https://openalex.org/W2091916032,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and the principal source of NADPH, a major cellular reductant, and is central to cell survival. Our previous work showed that diabetes and increased aldosterone are acquired forms of G6PD deficiency, leading to decreased G6PD activity and NADPH levels and damage to kidney tissue and endothelial cells. In this study, G6PD-deficient mice were studied to test the hypothesis that decreased G6PD activity per se can cause changes similar to those seen in the acquired conditions of G6PD deficiency. Results show that as compared with control mice, G6PD-deficient mice had increased oxidative stress, as manifested by decreased NADPH levels and decreased GSH levels, and increased markers of lipid peroxidation. G6PD-deficient mice had increased protein kinase C activity, increased nuclear factor-κΒ activity, and increased urinary albumin levels, all of which is similar to changes seen in diabetic mice. Changes persisted as the mice aged, as old G6PD-deficient mice (17–20 mo) had higher urine albumin levels and also had evidence for increased apoptosis in the renal cortex.

Here, we report that ERK1/2 also utilizes its noncatalytic function to mediate certain signal transductions. Sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway induces growth arrest, accompanied by changes in cell cycle regulators (decreased retinoblastoma phosphorylation, E2F1 down-regulation, and/or p21CIP1 up-regulation) and cell type-specific changes in morphology and expression of c-Myc or RET in the human tumor lines LNCaP, U251, and TT.

https://openalex.org/W2149384857,"The Cocoseae is one of 13 tribes of Arecaceae subfam. Arecoideae, and contains a number of palms with significant economic importance, including the monotypic and pantropical Cocos nucifera L., the coconut, the origins of which have been one of the ""abominable mysteries"" of palm systematics for decades. Previous studies with predominantly plastid genes weakly supported American ancestry for the coconut but ambiguous sister relationships. In this paper, we use multiple single copy nuclear loci to address the phylogeny of the Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae, and resolve the closest extant relative of the coconut.We present the results of combined analysis of DNA sequences of seven WRKY transcription factor loci across 72 samples of Arecaceae tribe Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae, representing all genera classified within the subtribe, and three outgroup taxa with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, producing highly congruent and well-resolved trees that robustly identify the genus Syagrus as sister to Cocos and resolve novel and well-supported relationships among the other genera of the Attaleinae. We also address incongruence among the gene trees with gene tree reconciliation analysis, and assign estimated ages to the nodes of our tree.This study represents the as yet most extensive phylogenetic analyses of Cocoseae subtribe Attaleinae. We present a well-resolved and supported phylogeny of the subtribe that robustly indicates a sister relationship between Cocos and Syagrus. This is not only of biogeographic interest, but will also open fruitful avenues of inquiry regarding evolution of functional genes useful for crop improvement. Establishment of two major clades of American Attaleinae occurred in the Oligocene (ca. 37 MYBP) in Eastern Brazil. The divergence of Cocos from Syagrus is estimated at 35 MYBP. The biogeographic and morphological congruence that we see for clades resolved in the Attaleinae suggests that WRKY loci are informative markers for investigating the phylogenetic relationships of the palm family."

The cells under these conditions over express selective receptors for assimilation of factors essential for growth and transformation. Such receptors would serve as potential targets for the specific ligand mediated transport of pharmaceutically active molecules. The present study demonstrates the specificity and efficacy of protein nanoparticle of apotransferrin for targeted delivery of doxorubicin.Apotransferrin nanoparticles were developed by sol-oil chemistry. A comparative analysis of efficiency of drug delivery in conjugated and non-conjugated forms of doxorubicin to apotransferrin nanoparticle is presented. The spherical shaped apotransferrin nanoparticles (nano) have diameters of 25-50 etam, which increase to 60-80 etam upon direct loading of drug (direct-nano), and showed further increase in dimension (75-95 etam) in conjugated nanoparticles (conj-nano). The competitive experiments with the transferrin receptor specific antibody showed the entry of both conj-nano and direct-nano into the cells through transferrin receptor mediated endocytosis. Results of various studies conducted clearly establish the superiority of the direct-nano over conj-nano viz. (a) localization studies showed complete release of drug very early, even as early as 30 min after treatment, with the drug localizing in the target organelle (nucleus) (b) pharmacokinetic studies showed enhanced drug concentrations, in circulation with sustainable half-life (c) the studies also demonstrated efficient drug delivery, and an enhanced inhibition of proliferation in cancer cells. Tissue distribution analysis showed intravenous administration of direct nano lead to higher drug localization in liver, and blood as compared to relatively lesser localization in heart, kidney and spleen. Experiments using rat cancer model confirmed the efficacy of the formulation in regression of hepatocellular carcinoma with negligible toxicity to kidney and liver.The present study thus demonstrates that the direct-nano is highly efficacious in delivery of drug in a target specific manner with lower toxicity to heart, liver and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2025882132,"Neuronal damage is correlated with vascular dysfunction in the diseased retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain controversial because of the lack of suitable models in which vasoregression related to neuronal damage initiates in the mature retinal vasculature. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal link between neuronal damage and vascular patency in a transgenic rat (TGR) with overexpression of a mutant cilia gene polycystin-2.Vasoregression, neuroglial changes and expression of neurotrophic factors were assessed in TGR and control rats in a time course. Determination of neuronal changes was performed by quantitative morphometry of paraffin-embedded vertical sections. Vascular cell composition and patency were assessed by quantitative retinal morphometry of digest preparations. Glial activation was assessed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Expression of neurotrophic factors was detected by quantitative PCR.At one month, number and thickness of the outer nuclear cell layers (ONL) in TGR rats were reduced by 31% (p<0.001) and 17% (p<0.05), respectively, compared to age-matched control rats. Furthermore, the reduction progressed from 1 to 7 months in TGR rats. Apoptosis was selectively detected in the photoreceptor in the ONL, starting after one month. Nevertheless, TGR and control rats showed normal responses in electroretinogram at one month. From the second month onwards, TGR retinas had significantly increased acellular capillaries (p<0.001), and a reduction of endothelial cells (p<0.01) and pericytes (p<0.01). Upregulation of GFAP was first detected in TGR retinas after 1 month in glial cells, in parallel with an increase of FGF2 (fourfold) and CNTF (60 %), followed by upregulation of NGF (40 %) at 3 months.Our data suggest that TGR is an appropriate animal model for vasoregression related to neuronal damage. Similarities to experimental diabetic retinopathy render this model suitable to understand general mechanisms of maturity-onset vasoregression."
https://openalex.org/W2085768119,"L-forms have been shown to occur among many species of bacteria and are suspected to be involved in persistent infections. Since their discovery in 1935, numerous studies characterizing L-form morphology, growth, and pathogenic potential have been conducted. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and survival of L-forms remain unknown. Using unstable L-form colonies of Escherichia coli as a model, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis and screened a deletion mutant library to study the molecular mechanisms involved in formation and survival of L-forms. Microarray analysis of L-form versus classical colonies revealed many up-regulated genes of unknown function as well as multiple over-expressed stress pathways shared in common with persister cells and biofilms. Mutant screens identified three groups of mutants which displayed varying degrees of defects in L-form colony formation. Group 1 mutants, which showed the strongest defect in L-form colony formation, belonged to pathways involved in cell envelope stress, DNA repair, iron homeostasis, outer membrane biogenesis, and drug efflux/ABC transporters. Four (Group 1) mutants, rcsB, a positive response regulator of colanic acid capsule synthesis, ruvA, a recombinational junction binding protein, fur, a ferric uptake regulator and smpA a small membrane lipoprotein were selected for complementation. Complementation of the mutants using a high-copy overexpression vector failed, while utilization of a low-copy inducible vector successfully restored L-form formation. This work represents the first systematic genetic evaluation of genes and pathways involved in the formation and survival of unstable L-form bacteria. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying L-form formation and survival and have implications for understanding the emergence of antibiotic resistance, bacterial persistence and latent infections and designing novel drugs and vaccines."

In vitro models suggest that dysregulation of VEGF mRNA stability contributes to that decline. Here, we show that the major RNA stabilizer, Hu Antigen R (HuR), and TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) colocalize with mutant SOD1 in mouse spinal cord extracts and cultured glioma cells. The colocalization was markedly reduced or abolished by RNase treatment. Immunoanalysis of transfected cells indicated that colocalization occurred in insoluble aggregates and inclusions. RNA immunoprecipitation showed a significant loss of VEGF mRNA binding to HuR and TIAR in mutant SOD1 cells, and there was marked depletion of HuR from polysomes. Ectopic expression of HuR in mutant SOD1 cells more than doubled the mRNA half-life of VEGF and significantly increased expression to that of wild-type SOD1 control. Cellular effects produced by mutant SOD1, including impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, were reversed by HuR in a gene dose-dependent pattern. In summary, our findings indicate that mutant SOD1 impairs post-transcriptional regulation by sequestering key regulatory RNA-binding proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2011637350,"Mounting evidence underscores the importance of protein-protein interactions in the functional regulation of drug-metabolizing P450s, but few studies have been conducted in membrane environments, and none have examined P450s catalyzing sex steroid synthesis. Here we report specific protein-protein interactions for full-length, human, wild type steroidogenic cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes: 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450c17, CYP17) and aromatase (P450arom, CYP19), as well as their electron donor NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)(3) in live cells, coupled with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies on phosphatidyl choline +/- cholesterol (mammalian) biomimetic membranes were used to investigate steroidogenic P450 interactions. The FRET results in living cells demonstrated that both P450c17 and P450arom homodimerize but do not heterodimerize, although they each heterodimerize with CPR. The lack of heteroassociation between P450c17 and P450arom was confirmed by QCM, wherein neither enzyme bound a membrane saturated with the other. In contrast, the CPR bound readily to either P450c17- or P450arom-saturated surfaces. Interestingly, N-terminally modified P450arom was stably incorporated and gave similar results to the wild type, although saturation was achieved with much less protein, suggesting that the putative transmembrane domain is not required for membrane association but for orientation. In fact, all of the proteins were remarkably stable in the membrane, such that high resolution AFM images were obtained, further supporting the formation of P450c17, P450arom, and CPR homodimers and oligomers in lipid bilayers. This unique combination of in vivo and in vitro studies has provided strong evidence for homodimerization and perhaps some higher order interactions for both P450c17 and P450arom."
https://openalex.org/W2102071270,"In West Africa two rice species (Oryza glaberrima Steud. and Oryza sativa L.) co-exist. Although originally it was thought that interspecific hybridization is impossible without biotechnological methods, progenies of hybridization appear to occur in farmer fields. AFLP analysis was used to assess genetic diversity in West Africa (including the countries The Gambia, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Togo) using 315 rice samples morphologically classified prior to analysis. We show evidence for farmer interspecific hybrids of African and Asian rice, resulting in a group of novel genotypes, and identify possible mechanisms for in-field hybridization. Spontaneous back-crossing events play a crucial role, resulting in different groups of genetic diversity in different regions developed by natural and cultural selection, often under adverse conditions. These new groups of genotypes may have potential relevance for exploitation by plant breeders. Future advances in crop development could be achieved through co-operation between scientists and marginalized farmer groups in order to address challenges of rapid adaptation in a world of increasing socio-political and climatic uncertainty."

Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) establish that proteins with macrodomains bind poly-ADP-ribose to mediate the cellular response to DNA damage. ADP-ribosyltransferases take the ADP-ribose group from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and add it to protein substrates. These enzymes include mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify their substrates with a single ADP-ribose moiety and poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) that can generate polymers of ADP-ribose. The biological functions for mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation are diverse and growing. Several bacterial toxins, including cholera and diphtheria toxins, inactivate intracellular proteins by the addition of mono-ADP-ribose. In higher eukaryotes PARP1 has a well-established role in DNA repair and in the regulation of chromatin and gene transcription (Schreiber et al., 2006Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been reported that PARP1 inhibitors provide substantial benefit for cancer patients bearing mutations in the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Fong et al., 2009Fong P.C. Boss D.S. Yap T.A. Tutt A. Wu P. Mergui-Roelvink M. Mortimer P. Swaisland H. Lau A. O'Connor M.J. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). Thus PARP1 inhibitors prove to be synthetically lethal with certain defects in DNA repair mechanisms. Despite the important functions of ADP-ribosylation, it remains poorly understood how these posttranslational modifications are read by other proteins.

Their findings provide insight into the action of an ADP-ribose interaction domain, called a macrodomain, in the process of DNA repair. In previous work macrodomains have been shown to interact in vitro with mono- and poly-ADP-ribose (Karras et al., 2005Karras G.I. Kustatscher G. Buhecha H.R. Allen M.D. Pugieux C. Sait F. Bycroft M.

USA. 2009; 106: 13770-13774Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar demonstrates that macrodomains interact with poly-ADP-ribose in cells. To show this, the authors use a laser-microirradiation procedure to introduce DNA breaks at discrete locations. The DNA breaks stimulate PARP1 activity leading to the local synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose. The main substrate for modification is PARP1 itself, but other proteins, including histones, are also thought to be modified. In cells that express fluorescently tagged macrodomains from different proteins, staining accumulates at the site of laser-induced damage. This accumulation is dependent on poly-ADP-ribose formation and is disrupted by mutations that impact the capacity of the macrodomains to bind poly-ADP-ribose (Timinszky et al., 2009Timinszky G. Till S. Hassa P.O. Hothorn M. Kustatscher G. Nijmeijer B. Colombelli J. Altmeyer M. Stelzer E.H. Scheffzek K. et al.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In particular, the histone variant macroH2A1.1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage resulting in alteration of chromatin structure. This recruitment most likely occurs through poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP1, which binds directly to the macrodomain of macroH2A1.1 (Figure 1A). Another macrodomain protein examined in the recent reports is an oncoprotein called ALC1 (Amplified in Liver Cancer 1). ALC1 contains a helicase domain and is a member of the SNF2 ATPase superfamily of chromatin-remodeling proteins. Like macroH2A1.1, ALC1 interacts with poly-ADP-ribose through its macrodomain (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N. Polo S.E. Garcia-Wilson E. Ahel I. Flynn H. Skehel M. West S.C. Jackson S.P. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, Gottschalk et al., 2009Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P.

Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and through this interaction it is recruited to sites of poly-ADP-ribose formation. In addition to recruitment, binding to poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 is shown to stimulate the nucleosomal remodeling activity of ALC1 (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N. Polo S.E. Garcia-Wilson E. Ahel I. Flynn H. Skehel M. West S.C. Jackson S.P. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, Gottschalk et al., 2009Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G.

Thus in response to DNA damage, the recruitment and activation of PARP1 and the generation of local poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins results in the reorganization and remodeling of chromatin. Furthermore, ALC1 interacts with other DNA repair proteins, including XRCC1, and these interactions are also dependent on poly-ADP-ribose formation (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N. Polo S.E. Garcia-Wilson E. Ahel I. Flynn H. Skehel M. West S.C. Jackson S.P. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The relevance of recruiting active ALC1 is illustrated by the finding that expression of a helicase-dead mutant or overexpression of only the macrodomain results in prolonged XRCC1 staining at the site of DNA damage, indicating delayed DNA repair (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N. Polo S.E. Garcia-Wilson E. Ahel I. Flynn H. Skehel M. West S.C. Jackson S.P. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Together, these findings show that poly-ADP-ribosylation by PARP1 at sites of DNA damage orchestrates a complex array of events. These include interactions mediated by macrodomains to support processes associated with DNA repair (Figure 1A). How widespread is the interaction of macrodomains with poly-ADP-ribose? So far only 10 human proteins containing macrodomains have been reported (according to the InterPRO database). This low number suggests that other domains that bind poly-ADP-ribose may exist. Indeed, in addition to macrodomains, several groups have defined poly-ADP-ribose-interacting proteins and derived potential consensus sequences for proteins with this capacity; the most refined of these is an 8 amino acid motif (Figure 1B) (Gagne et al., 2008Gagne J.P. Isabelle M. Lo K.S. Bourassa S. Hendzel M.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Poirier G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6959-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), which is found in many proteins linked to DNA repair and chromatin regulation. However, it is important to note that poly-ADP-ribose resembles polymers of nucleic acids and that basic residues are the main determinants of the consensus sequence. Hence it is uncertain whether the binding of poly-ADP-ribose is indeed a specific feature of the proteins with the 8 amino acid motif or whether the preponderance of basic residues reflects their general affinity for DNA or RNA. Another characterized motif is the poly-ADP-ribose-binding zinc finger (PBZ), which is also associated with DNA repair proteins (Ahel et al., 2008Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In total, three different protein motifs have been identified that specify interaction with poly-ADP-ribose. The functional differences between these three motifs are unclear, and it is currently unknown whether any of them interact in cells with unanchored mono- or poly-ADP-ribose, which could serve as second messengers (Figure 1C). Do these interaction motifs display specificity for particular modified substrates? Given that the generation of poly-ADP-ribose is typically observed only under restricted circumstances, including in response to DNA damage and at the spindle apparatus during mitosis (Schreiber et al., 2006Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), there might be no need for specificity of these motifs beyond recognition of the modification. Does this mean that DNA repair proteins with poly-ADP-ribose-binding domains are recruited to the spindle apparatus in mitosis? One might speculate that these proteins are subject to additional regulation to prevent unscheduled binding, an aspect that will need clarification. With the recent demonstration that certain PARP family members are not polymerases but mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (Kleine et al., 2008Kleine H. Poreba E. Lesniewicz K. Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Litchfield D.W. Shilton B.H. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), it is possible that mono-ADP-ribosylation is a widely used posttranslational modification. Might these three motifs also recognize mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates? Crystallographic studies do suggest that the macrodomain binds to the terminal ADP-ribose of poly-ADP-ribose, and the recent work shows that this binding is efficiently competed by an excess of free mono-ADP-ribose. Yet, there is no clear-cut evidence that eukaryotic macrodomains bind to mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins. At least for PARP1 a single ADP-ribose is not sufficient for interaction with macroH2A1.1; Timinszky et al., 2009Timinszky G. Till S. Hassa P.O. Hothorn M. Kustatscher G. Nijmeijer B. Colombelli J. Altmeyer M. Stelzer E.H. Scheffzek K. et al.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar show that the PARP1-E988K mutant, which lacks polymerase activity but is capable of auto-mono-ADP-ribosylation, fails to recruit macroH2A1.1. However, a recent report suggests that a macrodomain from a thermophilic archaeon can potentially interact with mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins (Dani et al., 2009Dani N. Stilla A. Marchegiani A. Tamburro A. Till S. Ladurner A.G. Corda D. Di Girolamo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). If indeed mono-ADP-ribosylation is a broadly used posttranslational modification, it seems probable that a domain interacting with it will also recognize the surrounding amino acid sequence. Can macrodomains or any of the other poly-ADP-ribose-binding elements interact with a protein sequence motif that carries mono-ADP-ribose? So far no evidence supports this notion. Thus it seems likely that separate domains read mono- versus poly-ADP-ribosylation. The recent findings are an important step forward in understanding how ADP-ribosylation is used in the cellular response to DNA-damage stress. A challenge for future work is to explore how ADP-ribosylation impinges on other processes and to determine how cell physiology is impacted by PARP family members other than PARP1."
https://openalex.org/W2042353462,"Background NF-κB is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in many key organismal processes, including innate immunity, development, and stress responses. NF-κB proteins contain a highly conserved DNA-binding/dimerization domain called the Rel homology domain. Methods/Principal Findings We characterized two NF-κB alleles in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis that differ at nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Ten of these SNPs result in amino acid substitutions, including six within the Rel homology domain. Both alleles are found in natural populations of Nematostella. The relative abundance of the two NF-κB alleles differs between populations, and departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within populations indicate that the locus may be under selection. The proteins encoded by the two Nv-NF-κB alleles have different molecular properties, in part due to a Cys/Ser polymorphism at residue 67, which resides within the DNA recognition loop. In nearly all previously characterized NF-κB proteins, the analogous residue is fixed for Cys, and conversion of human RHD proteins from Cys to Ser at this site has been shown to increase DNA-binding ability and increase resistance to inhibition by thiol-reactive compounds. However, the naturally-occurring Nematostella variant with Cys at position 67 binds DNA with a higher affinity than the Ser variant. On the other hand, the Ser variant activates transcription in reporter gene assays more effectively, and it is more resistant to inhibition by a thiol-reactive compound. Reciprocal Cys<->Ser mutations at residue 67 of the native Nv-NF-κB proteins affect DNA binding as in human NF-κB proteins, e.g., a Cys->Ser mutation increases DNA binding of the native Cys variant. Conclusions/Significance These results are the first demonstration of a naturally occurring and functionally significant polymorphism in NF-κB in any species. The functional differences between these alleles and their uneven distribution in the wild suggest that different genotypes could be favored in different environments, perhaps environments that vary in their levels of peroxides or thiol-reactive compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2154763826,"Parkinson disease (PD) involves progressive neurodegeneration, including loss of dopamine (DA) neurons from the substantia nigra. Select genes associated with rare familial forms of PD function in cellular pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), involved in protein degradation. The misfolding and accumulation of proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, into inclusions termed Lewy Bodies represents a clinical hallmark of PD. Given the predominance of sporadic PD among patient populations, environmental toxins may induce the disease, although their nature is largely unknown. Thus, an unmet challenge surrounds the discovery of causal or contributory neurotoxic factors that could account for the prevalence of sporadic PD. Bacteria within the order Actinomycetales are renowned for their robust production of secondary metabolites and might represent unidentified sources of environmental exposures. Among these, the aerobic genera, Streptomyces, produce natural proteasome inhibitors that block protein degradation and may potentially damage DA neurons. Here we demonstrate that a metabolite produced by a common soil bacterium, S. venezuelae, caused DA neurodegeneration in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which increased as animals aged. This metabolite, which disrupts UPS function, caused gradual degeneration of all neuronal classes examined, however DA neurons were particularly vulnerable to exposure. The presence of DA exacerbated toxicity because neurodegeneration was attenuated in mutant nematodes depleted for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA production. Strikingly, this factor caused dose-dependent death of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, a dopaminergic line. Efforts to purify the toxic activity revealed that it is a highly stable, lipophilic, and chemically unique small molecule. Evidence of a robust neurotoxic factor that selectively impacts neuronal survival in a progressive yet moderate manner is consistent with the etiology of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Collectively, these data suggest the potential for exposures to the metabolites of specific common soil bacteria to possibly represent a contributory environmental component to PD."
https://openalex.org/W2113456913,"Nucleolus-like bodies (NLBs) are characteristic structures found in the germinal vesicles of mammalian oocytes. Although these structures are essential for embryonic development, their composition, precise function, and mechanism of formation have not been elucidated. Here, we used immunoblotting and EGFP fusion protein fluorescence to demonstrate that murine nucleoplasmin 2 (NPM2) is a component of mouse NLBs and that the targeting of NPM2 to NLBs is regulated by a lysine-rich, 16-aa C-terminal motif (K-rich motif). When the K-rich motif was fused to another nuclear protein, MafG, the resultant fusion protein accumulated in NLBs but not in the nucleoli of somatic cells, suggesting that the K-rich motif functions to target NPM2 specifically to NLBs. To investigate the role of the K-rich motif in NLB formation, we replaced the endogenous NPM2 in growing oocytes with a mutant NPM2 protein lacking the K-rich motif (NPM2C16del). Growing oocytes surrounded by granulosa layers were coinjected with NPM2C16del mRNA and with small-interfering RNA targeting NPM2 (siNpm2), which was used to degrade the endogenous NPM2 mRNA. After culture in vitro, the NLBs in the resulting full-grown oocytes were significantly smaller than those in control oocytes that had been coinjected with siNpm2 and NPM2 mRNA, indicating that the K-rich motif is necessary for NLB development. Together, these results suggest that NPM2 targeting of NLBs is regulated by the K-rich motif and is essential for the formation of NLBs.—Inoue, A., Aoki, F.

https://openalex.org/W2039060799,"Endophilins participate in membrane scission events that occur during endocytosis and intracellular organelle biogenesis through the combined activity of an N-terminal BAR domain that interacts with membranes and a C-terminal SH3 domain that mediates protein binding. Endophilin B1 (Endo B1) was identified to bind Bax, a Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis, through yeast two-hybrid protein screens. Although Endo B1 does not bind Bax in healthy cells, during apoptosis, Endo B1 interacts transiently with Bax and promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria. To explore the molecular mechanism of action of Endo B1, we have analyzed its interaction with Bax in cell-free systems. Purified recombinant Endo B1 in solution displays a Stokes radius indicating a tetrameric quarternary structure. However, when incubated with purified Bax, it assembles into oligomers more than 4-fold greater in molecular weight. Although Endo B1 oligomerization is induced by Bax, Bax does not stably associate with the high molecular weight Endo B1 complex. Endo B1 oligomerization requires its C-terminal Src homology 3 domain and is not induced by Bcl-xL. Endo B1 combined with Bax reduces the size and changes the morphology of giant unilamellar vesicles by inducing massive vesiculation of liposomes. This activity of purified Bax protein to induce cell-free assembly of Endo B1 may reflect its activity in cells that regulates apoptosis and/or mitochondrial fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2046609814,"The structure and unfolding of metal-free (apo) human wild-type SOD1 and three pathogenic variants of SOD1 (A4V, G93R, and H48Q) that cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been studied with amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry. The results indicate that a significant proportion of each of these proteins exists in solution in a conformation in which some strands of the beta-barrel (i.e. beta2) are well protected from exchange at physiological temperature (37 degrees C), whereas other strands (i.e. beta3 and beta4) appear to be unprotected from hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Moreover, the thermal unfolding of these proteins does not result in the uniform incorporation of deuterium throughout the polypeptide but involves the local unfolding of different residues at different temperatures. Some regions of the proteins (i.e. the ""Greek key"" loop, residues 104-116) unfold at a significantly higher temperature than other regions (i.e. beta3 and beta4, residues 21-53). Together, these results show that human wild-type apo-SOD1 and variants have a partially unfolded beta-barrel at physiological temperature and unfold non-cooperatively."
https://openalex.org/W2046696981,"Protein complexes are key molecular machines executing a variety of essential cellular processes. Despite the availability of genome-wide protein-protein interaction studies, determining the connectivity between proteins within a complex remains a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a method that is able to predict the relationship of proteins within a stable protein complex. We employed a combination of computational approaches and a systematic collection of quantitative proteomics data from wild-type and deletion strain purifications to build a quantitative deletion-interaction network map and subsequently convert the resulting data into an interdependency-interaction model of a complex. We applied this approach to a data set generated from components of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes, which consists of two distinct small and large complexes that are held together by a module consisting of Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1. The resulting representation reveals new protein-protein interactions and new submodule relationships, providing novel information for mapping the functional organization of a complex."
https://openalex.org/W2045971973,"Cross-presentation is now recognized as a major mechanism for initiating CD8 T cell responses to virus and tumor antigens in vivo. It provides an elegant mechanism that allows relatively few Dendritic cells (DCs) to initiate primary immune responses while avoiding the consumptive nature of pathogenic infection. CD8 T cells play a major role in anti-bacterial immune responses; however, the contribution of cross-presentation for priming CD8 T cell responses to bacteria, in vivo, is not well established. Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria) is the causative agent of Listeriosis, an opportunistic food-borne bacterial infection that poses a significant public health risk. Here, we employ a transgenic mouse model in which cross-presentation is uniquely inactivated, to investigate cross-priming during primary Listeria infection. We show that cross-priming deficient mice are severely compromised in their ability to generate antigen-specific T cells to stimulate MHC I-restricted CTL responses following Listeria infection. The defect in generation of Listeria-elicited CD8 T cell responses is also apparent in vitro. However, in this setting, the endogenous route of processing Listeria-derived antigens is predominant. This reveals a new experimental dichotomy whereby functional sampling of Listeria-derived antigens in vivo but not in vitro is dependent on cross-presentation of exogenously derived antigen. Thus, under normal physiological circumstances, cross-presentation is demonstrated to play an essential role in priming CD8 T cell responses to bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1983104392,"Background New experimental approaches to the study of the neutrophil phagosome and bacterial killing prompted a reassessment of the usefulness of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-differentiated HL-60 cells as a neutrophil model. HL-60 cells are special in that they possess azurophilic granules while lacking the specific granules with their associated oxidase components. The resulting inability to mount an effective intracellular respiratory burst makes these cells more dependent on other mechanisms when killing internalized bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work phagocytosis and phagosome-related responses of ATRA-differentiated HL-60 cells were compared to those earlier described in human neutrophils. We show that intracellular survival of wild-type S. pyogenes bacteria in HL-60 cells is accompanied by inhibition of azurophilic granule–phagosome fusion. A mutant S. pyogenes bacterium, deficient in M-protein expression, is, on the other hand, rapidly killed in phagosomes that avidly fuse with azurophilic granules. Conclusions/Significance The current data extend our previous findings by showing that a system lacking in oxidase involvement also indicates a link between inhibition of azurophilic granule fusion and the intraphagosomal fate of S. pyogenes bacteria. We propose that differentiated HL-60 cells can be a useful tool to study certain aspects of neutrophil phagosome maturation, such as azurophilic granule fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2029676176,"The regulation of apoptosis under basal (non-stress) conditions is crucial for normal mammalian development and also for normal cellular turnover in different tissues throughout life. Deficient regulation of basal apoptosis, or its perturbation, can result in impaired development and/or disease states including cancer. In contrast to stress-induced apoptosis the regulation of apoptosis under basal conditions is poorly understood. To address this issue we have compared basal- and stress-induced apoptosis in human epithelial cells of normal and cancerous origins. For this purpose we focussed our study on the opposing pro-apoptotic JNK/anti-apoptotic NFkappaB pathways.Combinatorial RNAi plus gene knockout were employed to access and map basal regulatory pathways of apoptosis. Follow-on, in-depth analyses included exogenous expression of phosphorylation mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We demonstrate that basal apoptosis is constitutively suppressed by JNK2 in a range of human cancer cell lines. This effect was not observed in non-cancer cells. Silencing JNK2 by RNAi resulted in JNK1-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells via up-regulation of the AP-1 factor c-Jun. Unexpectedly we discovered that JNK1 and c-Jun promote basal apoptosis in the absence of ""activating phosphorylations"" typically induced by stress. Hypo-phosphorylated c-Jun accumulated to high levels following JNK2 silencing, auto-regulated its own expression and suppressed expression of Bcl-3, an unusual IkappaB protein and regulator of NFkappaB. Basal apoptosis was mediated by components of the TNFalpha response pathway but was mechanistically distinct from TNFalpha-induced apoptosis.Our results demonstrate that mechanistically distinct pathways operate to regulate apoptosis in mammalian cells under basal (physiological) versus stress-induced conditions. We also describe a novel apoptotic network which governs the basal survival of cancer cells. Such information is crucial for understanding normal cellular turnover during mammalian development and subsequently throughout life. This information also opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in human proliferative disease states including cancer."

Previous studies indicated that the epithelial cells in the lung are an active participant in host immunity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the innate immune responses of lung epithelial cells against B. pseudomallei. Methodology and Principal Findings Using a murine lung epithelial cell line, primary lung epithelial cells and an inhalational murine infection model, we characterized the types of innate immunity proteins and peptides produced upon B. pseudomallei infection. Among a wide panel of immune components studied, increased levels of major pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα, chemokine MCP-1, and up-regulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) were observed. Inhibition assays using specific inhibitors suggested that NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways were responsible for these B. pseudomallei-induced antimicrobial peptides. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the respiratory epithelial cells, which form the majority of the cells lining the epithelial tract and the lung, have important roles in the innate immune response against B. pseudomallei infection."
https://openalex.org/W1981814704,"The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 has several features that make it an attractive antibody-based vaccine target, but eliciting an effective gp41 MPER-specific protective antibody response remains elusive. One fundamental issue is whether the failure to make gp41 MPER-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies like 2F5 and 4E10 is due to structural constraints with the gp41 MPER, or alternatively, if gp41 MPER epitope-specific B cells are lost to immunological tolerance. An equally important question is how B cells interact with, and respond to, the gp41 MPER epitope, including whether they engage this epitope in a non-canonical manner i.e., by non-paratopic recognition via B cell receptors (BCR). To begin understanding how B cells engage the gp41 MPER, we characterized B cell-gp41 MPER interactions in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Surprisingly, we found that a significant (∼7%) fraction of splenic B cells from BALB/c, but not C57BL/6 mice, bound the gp41 MPER via their BCRs. This strain-specific binding was concentrated in IgMhi subsets, including marginal zone and peritoneal B1 B cells, and correlated with enriched fractions (∼15%) of gp41 MPER-specific IgM secreted by in vitro-activated splenic B cells. Analysis of Igha (BALB/c) and Ighb (C57BL/6) congenic mice demonstrated that gp41 MPER binding was controlled by determinants of the Igha locus. Mapping of MPER gp41 interactions with IgMa identified MPER residues distinct from those to which mAb 2F5 binds and demonstrated the requirement of Fc CH regions. Importantly, gp41 MPER ligation produced detectable BCR-proximal signaling events, suggesting that interactions between gp41 MPER and IgMa determinants may elicit partial B cell activation. These data suggest that low avidity, non-paratopic interactions between the gp41 MPER and membrane Ig on naïve B cells may interfere with or divert bnAb responses."

TRPV6 channels are homeostasis regulators, are upregulated in certain cancers, and show an unusual allelespecific evolution in humans. To understand how Ca2+ uptake can be adapted to changes in metabolic status, we investigate regulation of Ca2+-influx by ATP and phosphorylation. We show that ATP binds to TRPV6, reduces whole-cell current increments, and prevents channel rundown with an EC50 of 380 μΜ. By using both biochemical binding studies and patch-clamp analyses of wild-type and mutant channels, we have mapped one relevant site for regulation by ATP to residues within the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and identify an additional C-terminal binding region. Stimulation of PKC largely prevented the effects of ATP. This regulation requires PKCβII and defined phosphorylation sites within the ARD and the C-terminus. Both regulatory sites act synergistically to constitute a novel mechanism by which ATP stabilizes channel activity and acts as a metabolic switch for Ca2+ influx. Decreases in ATP concentration or activation of PKCβII disable regulation of the channels by ATP, rendering them more susceptible to inactivation and rundown and preventing Ca2+ overload.—Al-Ansary, D., Bogeski, I., Disteldorf B.

Principal Findings Here, we described a novel natural allelic variant of human Polλ (hPolλ) characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), C/T variation in the first base of codon 438, resulting in the amino acid change Arg to Trp. In vitro enzyme activity assays of the purified W438 Polλ variant revealed that it retained both DNA polymerization and deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activities, but had reduced base substitution fidelity. Ectopic expression of the W438 hPolλ variant in mammalian cells increases mutation frequency, affects the DSB repair NHEJ pathway, and generates chromosome aberrations. All these phenotypes are dependent upon the catalytic activity of the W438 hPolλ. Conclusions The expression of a cancer-related natural variant of one specialized DNA polymerase can be associated to generic instability at the cromosomal level, probably due a defective NHEJ. These results establish that chromosomal aberrations can result from mutations in specialized DNA repair polymerases."

In this study, the role of FKBP12.6 in the control of insulin secretion and blood glucose is clarified using FKBP12.6−/− mice. FKBP12.6−/− mice showed significant fed hyperinsulinemia but exhibited normoglycemia, fasting normoinsulinemia, and normal body weight compared with wild-type (WT) littermate control mice. Deletion of FKBP12.6 resulted in enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) both in vivo and in vitro, a result that is due to enhanced glucose-induced islet Ca2+ elevation. After a high-fat dietary challenge (HF diet) for 3 mo, FKBP12.6−/− mice displayed higher body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and lower fed blood glucose concentrations compared with WT mice. FKBP12.6−/− mice displayed hyperinsulinemia, and resistance to HF diet-induced hyperglycemia, suggesting that FKBP12.6 plays an important role in insulin secretion and blood glucose control, and raising the possibility that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.—Chen, Z., Li, Z., Wei, B., Yin, W., Xu, T., Kotlikoff, M.

https://openalex.org/W1974646328,"Background Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is neurodegenerative disease characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy due to progressive motoneuron loss. The death of motoneuron is preceded by the failure of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and axonal retraction. Thus, to develop an effective ALS therapy you must simultaneously preserve motoneuron somas, motor axons and NMJs. A conditioning lesion has the potential to accomplish this since it has been shown to enhance neuronal survival and recovery from trauma in a variety of contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings To test the effects of a conditioning lesion in a model of familial ALS we administered a tibial nerve crush injury to presymptomatic fALSG93A rats. We examined its effects on motor function, motoneuron somas, motor axons, and NMJs. Our experiments revealed a novel paradigm for the conditioning lesion effect. Specifically we found that the motor functional decline in fALSG93A rats that received a conditioning lesion was delayed and less severe. These improvements in motor function corresponded to greater motoneuron survival, reduced motor axonopathy, and enhanced NMJ maintenance at disease end-stage. Furthermore, the increased NMJ maintenance was selective for muscle compartments innervated by the most resilient (slow) motoneuron subtypes, but was absent in muscle compartments innervated by the most vulnerable (fast fatigable) motoneuron subtypes. Conclusions/Significance These findings support the development of strategies aimed at mimicking the conditioning lesion effect to treat ALS as well as underlined the importance of considering the heterogeneity of motoneuron sub-types when evaluating prospective ALS therapeutics."

Immun. 1997; 65: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Aeromonas infections.As in other Gram-negative bacteria, in the A. hydrophila LPS three domains are recognized: the highly conserved and hydrophobic lipid A; the hydrophilic and highly variable O-antigen polysaccharide (O-PS); and the core oligosaccharide, connecting lipid A and O-antigen. The core domain is usually divided into the inner and outer cores on the basis of sugar composition.The A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida core LPS structure were determined before (7.Knirel Y.A. Vinogradov E. Jimenez N. Merino S. Tomás J.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8.Wang Z. Li J. Vinogradov E. Altman E. Carbohydr. Res. 2006; 341: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The inner core is highly conserved as can be observed in Fig. 1. The genes (wa) coding the eleven glycosyltransferases involved in the A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida core LPS are clustered in three different regions of their respective chromosomes, and the functions for most of them have been elucidated (Fig. 1) (9.Jimenez N.

A common feature of both core LPS is the presence of a GlcN residue linked by an α-1,7 bond to an l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Fig. 1).The mechanism leading to the incorporation of the core GlcN residue in Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, requires two distinct enzymatic steps: the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the LPS core and the deacetylation of the core LPS containing the GlcNAc residue to GlcN. Two genes and their corresponding products were assigned for each function in K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens (11.Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Jimenez N. Piqué N. Corsaro M.M. Parrilli M. Naldi T.

By contrast only one A. hydrophila or A. salmonicida gene was found, which mutation precluded the incorporation of the core GlcN residue (Fig. 1) (9.Jimenez N. Canals R. Lacasta A. Kondakova A.N.

In this work we show that a bifunctional enzyme is responsible for the two enzymatic reactions needed to incorporate the core GlcN residue.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrated that a single A. hydrophila AH-3 gene encoded a bifunctional WahA protein. The WahA GT domain, expressed independently, appears to be responsible for the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc as shown by MALDI-TOF analysis of LPS from mutant AH-3ΔwaaL wahA overexpressing this domain (Fig. 5). The independently overexpressed WahA CE domain is responsible for the deacetylation of the GlcNAc residue incorporated to the core LPS by the action of the GT domain, as shown by the in vitro deacetylation assay (Table 2).By contrast, in the enterobacteria K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens containing GlcN in their core LPS the incorporation of GlcN to the core LPS requires two different enzymes encoded by two independent genes, a glycosyltransferase (wabH) and a deacetylase (wabN) (11.Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Jimenez N. Piqué N. Corsaro M.M. Parrilli M. Naldi T. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36648-36656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both the WabH and the WahA GT domain use UDP-GlcNAc but differ in the attachment site of GlcNAc residue in the inner core LPS of Aeromonas and K. pneumoniae or S. marcescens. In agreement with their function both enzymes belong to the CAZy GT4 family, and there is significant similarity between the WahA GT domain and the WabH glycosyltransferase (Fig. 3A). The WahA CE domain belongs to the CE4 family (CAZy and Ref. 26.Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Whiters S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Position-specific iterated BLAST (29.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) analysis of WabN suggests a distant relationship to CE4 family members, although this deacetylase does not belong to CAZy family CE4. These differences probably reflect the variation in the attachment site of GlcN residue in the inner core LPS between Aeromonas and K. pneumoniae. Not surprisingly, neither the wabH nor the wabN are able to complement the wahA mutation. In addition the WabN protein is unable to catalyze the deacetylation of the GlcNAc residue in A. hydrophila AH-3 core LPS (data not shown).The comparison between the in vitro His6-WahA Km for acceptor LPS and UDP-GlcNAc and those of His6-GTWahA and His6-CEWahA acting together shows that, as expected, the bifunctional enzyme is more efficient in catalyzing the GlcN incorporation into the core LPS of A. hydrophila AH-3 than the concerted action of the two domains expressed independently. Although we have used N- and C-terminal tags for the GT and CE domains, respectively, it cannot be ruled out that these tags could diminish a potential interaction between the GT and CE domains and enzyme substrates. On the other hand these in vitro data do not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation.The advantage in vivo of having these two activities in a single protein in A. hydrophila AH-3 while they are found in two different enzymes in K. pneumoniae is difficult to determine. It just can be hazardous or could be related to the different consequences of the lack of the GlcN residue in each model bacteria. Although wahA mutants still contain O-PS, because the GlcN residue is terminally located on a branch of core LPS (7.Knirel Y.A. Vinogradov E. Jimenez N. Merino S. Tomás J.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), wabH and wabN mutants are completely devoid of O-PS, because the GlcN residue is located in the main branch of core LPS in K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens (11.Regué M.

It is clear that a lack of O-antigen LPS in vivo jeopardizes the virulence in both Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, while transcriptional regulation of wahA expression in A. hydrophila should control both GlcNAc transferase and deacetylase reactions, in K. pneumoniae wabH and wabN are transcribed from different promoters, because these two genes are transcribed in opposite directions (11.Regué M.

This fact may suggest the possibility of a different regulation on the GlcNAc transferase and deacetylase reactions in the mentioned bacteria and similar ones.The WahA enzyme is found in members of the genus Aeromonas and Vibrio that contain the pentasaccharide α-d-GlcN-(1→7)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→2)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→5)-α-Kdo. From the results obtained it can be predicted that this pentasaccharide should also be present in the core LPS of V. shilonii AK1. The absence of WahA homologues in other Vibrio species suggests the absence of the above pentasaccharide.Previously it was shown that the E. coli HldE bifunctional protein is involved in the biosynthesis of the core LPS precursor ADP-l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose. This enzyme contains two functionally different domains, a heptokinase and an adenylyltransferase that could be expressed independently (30.Valvano M.A. Marolda C.L. Bittner M. Glaskin-Clay M.

The core domain is usually divided into the inner and outer cores on the basis of sugar composition.The A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida core LPS structure were determined before (7.Knirel Y.A.

The genes (wa) coding the eleven glycosyltransferases involved in the A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida core LPS are clustered in three different regions of their respective chromosomes, and the functions for most of them have been elucidated (Fig. 1) (9.Jimenez N.

A common feature of both core LPS is the presence of a GlcN residue linked by an α-1,7 bond to an l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Fig. 1).The mechanism leading to the incorporation of the core GlcN residue in Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, requires two distinct enzymatic steps: the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the LPS core and the deacetylation of the core LPS containing the GlcNAc residue to GlcN.

In this work we show that a bifunctional enzyme is responsible for the two enzymatic reactions needed to incorporate the core GlcN residue. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrated that a single A. hydrophila AH-3 gene encoded a bifunctional WahA protein. The WahA GT domain, expressed independently, appears to be responsible for the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc as shown by MALDI-TOF analysis of LPS from mutant AH-3ΔwaaL wahA overexpressing this domain (Fig. 5). The independently overexpressed WahA CE domain is responsible for the deacetylation of the GlcNAc residue incorporated to the core LPS by the action of the GT domain, as shown by the in vitro deacetylation assay (Table 2).By contrast, in the enterobacteria K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens containing GlcN in their core LPS the incorporation of GlcN to the core LPS requires two different enzymes encoded by two independent genes, a glycosyltransferase (wabH) and a deacetylase (wabN) (11.Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Jimenez N. Piqué N. Corsaro M.M. Parrilli M. Naldi T. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36648-36656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both the WabH and the WahA GT domain use UDP-GlcNAc but differ in the attachment site of GlcNAc residue in the inner core LPS of Aeromonas and K. pneumoniae or S. marcescens. In agreement with their function both enzymes belong to the CAZy GT4 family, and there is significant similarity between the WahA GT domain and the WabH glycosyltransferase (Fig. 3A). The WahA CE domain belongs to the CE4 family (CAZy and Ref. 26.Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Whiters S.G. Annu. Rev.

These differences probably reflect the variation in the attachment site of GlcN residue in the inner core LPS between Aeromonas and K. pneumoniae. Not surprisingly, neither the wabH nor the wabN are able to complement the wahA mutation. In addition the WabN protein is unable to catalyze the deacetylation of the GlcNAc residue in A. hydrophila AH-3 core LPS (data not shown).The comparison between the in vitro His6-WahA Km for acceptor LPS and UDP-GlcNAc and those of His6-GTWahA and His6-CEWahA acting together shows that, as expected, the bifunctional enzyme is more efficient in catalyzing the GlcN incorporation into the core LPS of A. hydrophila AH-3 than the concerted action of the two domains expressed independently.

Although wahA mutants still contain O-PS, because the GlcN residue is terminally located on a branch of core LPS (7.Knirel Y.A. Vinogradov E. Jimenez N. Merino S. Tomás J.M. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), wabH and wabN mutants are completely devoid of O-PS, because the GlcN residue is located in the main branch of core LPS in K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens (11.Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Jimenez N. Piqué N. Corsaro M.M. Parrilli M. Naldi T. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36648-36656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is clear that a lack of O-antigen LPS in vivo jeopardizes the virulence in both Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, while transcriptional regulation of wahA expression in A. hydrophila should control both GlcNAc transferase and deacetylase reactions, in K. pneumoniae wabH and wabN are transcribed from different promoters, because these two genes are transcribed in opposite directions (11.Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Jimenez N. Piqué N. Corsaro M.M. Parrilli M. Naldi T. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36648-36656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This fact may suggest the possibility of a different regulation on the GlcNAc transferase and deacetylase reactions in the mentioned bacteria and similar ones. The WahA enzyme is found in members of the genus Aeromonas and Vibrio that contain the pentasaccharide α-d-GlcN-(1→7)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→2)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hep-(1→5)-α-Kdo. From the results obtained it can be predicted that this pentasaccharide should also be present in the core LPS of V. shilonii AK1. The absence of WahA homologues in other Vibrio species suggests the absence of the above pentasaccharide. Previously it was shown that the E. coli HldE bifunctional protein is involved in the biosynthesis of the core LPS precursor ADP-l-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose. This enzyme contains two functionally different domains, a heptokinase and an adenylyltransferase that could be expressed independently (30.Valvano M.A. Marolda C.L. Bittner M. Glaskin-Clay M. Simon T.L. Klena J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The HldE kinase domain catalyzes the phosphorylation at the 1 position of the d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose 7-phosphate to generate d-glycero-α,β-d-manno-heptose 1,7-biphosphate (31.McArthur F. Andersson C.E. Loutet S. Mowbray S.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5292-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the GmhB phosphatase catalyzes the removal of the phosphate at the 7 position to form d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose 1-phosphate (32.Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the adenylyltransferase domain of HldE catalyzes the transfer of AMP to give ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose (30.Valvano M.A. Marolda C.L. Bittner M. Glaskin-Clay M. Simon T.L. Klena J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32.Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Genomic sequence comparisons show that, in some bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, the bifunctional HldE is replaced by two distinct enzymes, HldA and HldC, which perform their respective functions (32.Valvano M.A. Messner P. Kosma P. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Only one putative bifunctional glycosyltransferase involved in core LPS biosynthesis has been described. The E. coli Kdo transferase WaaA was proposed to be responsible for the transfer of two Kdo residues to the LPS precursor lipid IVA (33.Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but evidence is lacking about the possible existence of two different domains involved in the two reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. True bifunctional proteins catalyze two independent reactions at separate catalytic sites. This term has been used to describe a single polypeptide with two catalytic activities for which, in some organisms, there are two proteins that carry out the equivalent biochemical reaction (35.James C.L. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3720-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus the WahA is the first known glycosyltransferase bifunctional enzyme involved in core LPS biosynthesis.

Improvements in the sensitivity of mass spectrometry approaches are enabling more in-depth analyses of protein-protein networks and, in some cases, are providing surprising new insights into well established, longstanding problems. Here, we describe such a proteomic analysis that exploits MudPIT mass spectrometry and has led to the discovery of a physical and functional link between the orphan nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and transcription factor IID (TFIID). A systematic characterization of the HNF4α-TFIID link revealed that the HNF4α DNA-binding domain binds directly to the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and, through this interaction, can target TBP or TFIID to promoters containing HNF4α-binding sites in vitro. Supporting the functional significance of this interaction, an HNF4α mutation that blocks binding of TBP to HNF4α interferes with HNF4α transactivation activity in cells. These findings identify an unexpected role for the HNF4α DNA-binding domain in mediating key regulatory interactions and provide new insights into the roles of HNF4α and TFIID in RNA polymerase II transcription.

Preinitiation complex assembly begins with DNA sequence-specific binding of TFIID to the core promoter to provide a nucleoprotein recognition site for subsequent binding of polymerase II and the remaining general transcription factors. The TATA box-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID recognizes the TATA box element and can substitute for TFIID in transcription in vitro. Additional TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits of TFIID recognize the initiator (Inr) and other core promoter elements and contribute to functional interactions between the general transcription machinery and DNA-binding transcription factors and coregulators (1.Cler E.

Because of its central role in transcriptional regulation, there has been considerable interest in defining the repertoire of TBP-interacting proteins. Biochemical studies that led to definition of TFIID, SL1, TFIIIB, and other TBP-associated proteins have typically used conventional chromatography and/or immunoaffinity purification methods to purify TBP-containing complexes (17.Zhou Q.

Although these methods were very successful in identifying stoichiometric components of TBP-containing complexes, they are likely to have missed proteins that interact only weakly or transiently with TBP. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of TBP-interacting proteins using MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) mass spectrometry. MudPIT is a multidimensional chromatography-based proteomics method in which a mixture of proteins is digested into peptides and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry without prior isolation of individual proteins. MudPIT has proven to be an unbiased and exquisitely sensitive method for identifying proteins in complex mixtures because it does not suffer from the inevitable losses associated with the identification and elution of proteins from polyacrylamide gels or reverse-phase resins. The results of these experiments identified as TBP-interacting proteins most subunits of the previously known TBP-containing complexes. In addition, we identified a number of proteins not previously identified as TAFs, including several DNA-binding transcription factors. Among these was the DNA-binding transcription factor and orphan nuclear receptor HNF4α (27.Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), which plays an important role in early development and in hepatocyte and intestinal differentiation (28.Li J. Ning G.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In the adult mammal, HNF4α is expressed in liver, intestine, and pancreas, where it is responsible for the expression of genes that control glucose and lipid metabolism (30.Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 31.Bartoov-Shifman R. Hertz R. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. Bar-Tana J. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25914-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human HNF4α gene cause maturity onset diabetes in the young (type 1), a rare form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (32.Gupta R.K. Kaestner K.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 521-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, HNF4α possesses a DNA-binding domain with a conserved double zinc finger motif, an N-terminal transactivation domain called AF-1 (activation function 1), and a C-terminal domain called AF-2, which in other nuclear receptors functions as a ligand-dependent activation domain. Although HNF4α AF-2 is structurally homologous to other receptors and several reports have indicated that fatty acids or fatty acyl-CoA associates with HNF4α, no definitive ligand has been identified (33.Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse Jr., M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34.Wisely G.B.

Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the newly identified interaction between TBP and HNF4α, which we demonstrate is mediated via the HNF4α DNA-binding domain. Through this interaction, HNF4α can target the TFIID complex to promoters containing HNF4α-binding sites. In vitro, HNF4α recruits TFIID or TBP to an immobilized template through direct physical interactions between its DNA-binding domain and TBP. An HNF4α mutant that interferes with TBP binding also interferes with recruitment of TBP or TFIID to promoters in vitro and with HNF4α-dependent gene activation in cells. Taken together, these observations define a novel role for the HNF4α DNA-binding domain in mediating key regulatory interactions and are consistent with the model that the interaction of HNF4α with TBP contributes to HNF4α-induced transcription. Parental HeLa S3 cells and their derivatives were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm GlutaMAX, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For large scale cultures, HeLa cells were grown in spinner culture in Joklik medium with 5% calf serum.

Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (44.Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) with the following criteria set: peptide/spectrum matches were retained only if they had a DeltaCn of at least 0.08 and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly, 2.0 for doubly, and 3.0 for triply charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least 7 amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least two such peptides or one peptide with two independent spectra. With these criteria, the final false discovery rates at the protein and peptide levels were 0.47 and 0.063 ±0.026%, respectively.

Anti-FLAG (M2) beads were pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100). 2 μg of purified, bacterially expressed His-FLAG-HNF4α or HNF4α derivatives were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG beads for 30 min at 4 °C in 400 μl of binding buffer, washed three times, and resuspended in 400 μl of binding buffer. Purified recombinant HA-TBP was added to the beads and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C.

The beads were washed four times, and proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton-X-100 and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies. Immobilized templates were generated essentially as described (49.Johnson K.M. Wang J. Smallwood A. Carey M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To construct pRE×4-E4T and pRE×4-MLT, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing four tandemly repeated copies of the HNF4α-responsive element from the apolipoprotein A-I enhancer element (TGAACCCTTGACCCCTGC) (50.Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51.Malik S. Karathanasis S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was introduced between the PstI and BamHI sites of pG5-E4T and pG5-MLT (52.Carey M. Leatherwood J. Ptashne M. Science. 1990; 247: 710-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The BamHI site is located 13 or 27 bp upstream of the TATA boxes of the adenovirus major late (AdML) or E4 core promoter, respectively. Biotinylated fragments of pRE×4-E4T or pRE×4-MLT were amplified using a 27-nucleotide biotinylated primer positioned 204 bp upstream of the HNF4α-binding sites and a primer positioned 260 bp downstream of the transcription initiation site. Biotinylated TATA mutant DNA fragments were generated from pRE×4-E4T by two-step PCR mutagenesis. Conversion of TATATATAC to the NotI recognition site GCGGCCGC was confirmed by digestion with NotI. Biotinylated PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels, purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and bound to streptavidin-coupled DynabeadsTM M-280 (Dynal). The beads were resuspended in Buffer A to contain ∼90 fmol/μl DNA fragment. Promoter binding assays were performed as follows. Various combinations of proteins were incubated with 2.5 μl of Dynal bead suspension in 62 mm KCl, 12.5% glycerol, 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.06 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40 in a total volume of 60 μl. After 30 min at 30 °C, the beads were collected using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal), washed three times with the same buffer without bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Bound proteins were identified by Western blotting. 293T cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pG5-Luc (Promega), which encodes firefly luciferase driven by five Gal4-responsive elements upstream of the AdML core promoter; 100 ng of the control plasmid pRL-tk (Promega), which encodes Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter; and varying amounts of effector plasmid expressing wild-type or mutant Gal4-HNF4α using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Total effector plasmid in each transfection was adjusted to 1 μg with empty vector. After 48 h, Gal4-HNF4α transactivation activity was determined by measuring firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and normalizing firefly to Renilla luciferase. To define TBP-interacting proteins, HA epitope-tagged TBP and associated proteins were subjected to anti-HA immunopurification from a cell line stably expressing HA-TBP and analyzed by MudPIT mass spectrometry. This analysis identified many of the known TBP-associated proteins (supplemental Table 1). Among these were subunits of TBP-containing complexes needed for transcription by polymerases I, II, and III, respectively (8.Albright S.R. Tjian R.

We also detected large amounts of B-TAF1, the mammalian ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mot1, an Snf2 family ATPase that uses the energy of ATP to displace TBP from DNA and has been proposed to play a key role in the dynamics of TBP in cells (53.Auble D.T.

The proteasomal ATPases, but not other subunits of the 19 S regulatory particle of the proteasome, have been identified in previous proteomic analyses as TBP-interacting proteins (25.Makino Y. Yoshida T. Yogosawa S. Tanaka K. Muramatsu M. Tamura T.A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, all of the proteasomal ATPases copurified with our preparations of HA-TBP. In addition, however, we also identified all other subunits of the 19 S regulatory particle except for the human deubiquitinating enzyme UCH37 and human Rpn13 (also known as ADRM1), which links UCH37 to the 19 S regulatory particle (38.Yao T. Song L. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Cohen R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 58.Hamazaki J.

Prior proteomic analyses using TBP as a bait have not led to the identification of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, most likely because only a small fraction of TFIID or other TBP-containing complexes are associated with any one of the thousands of these transcription factors in the cell. Consistent with these prior results, we found very few DNA-binding transcription factors in our MudPIT data sets. Surprisingly, however, we did identify four DNA-binding transcription factors as abundant components of our preparations of TBP-associated proteins. These included a homeobox-containing protein (HMBOX1), the glucocorticoid receptor, a steroid-responsive nuclear receptor, and two closely related orphan nuclear receptors (HNF4α and HNF4γ). In the remainder of this work, we explored the functional consequences of the interaction of TBP with HNF4α. To confirm the interaction of HNF4α with TBP, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged TBP were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or control antibodies, and TBP and HNF4α were detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous HNF4α specifically coprecipitated with HA-TBP. In complementary experiments, we used anti-FLAG antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins from nuclear extracts from parental HeLa cells or a HeLa cell line stably expressing FLAG-tagged HNF4α. As shown in the Western blots of Fig. 1B, TBP and the TFIID subunits TAF1, TAF4, TAF6, and TAF7 all specifically coprecipitated with FLAG-HNF4α, indicating that HNF4α binds endogenous TBP and the TFIID complex. To determine whether endogenous HNF4α interacts with endogenous TFIID, we immunoprecipitated endogenous HNF4α from hepatocyte carcinoma HepG2 cells using an anti-HNF4α antibody. Endogenous HNF4α copurified with TBP and the TFIID subunit TAF6 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that HNF4α binds TFIID when both are expressed at physiological concentrations. Finally, to determine whether HNF4α can directly bind TBP or whether the interaction requires one or more of the TAF subunits, we performed GST pulldown assays using bacterially expressed, recombinant GST-tagged HNF4α and HA-tagged TBP. HA-tagged TBP interacted with GST-tagged HNF4α but not with GST (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that TBP can bind directly to HNF4α without the assistance of any accessory proteins. Nuclear receptors, including HNF4α, are composed of multiple subregions de"
https://openalex.org/W2141357772,"Motor proteins can organize posttranscriptional processes by transporting ribonucleoprotein complexes to specific locations. To investigate a possible role of myosin proteins in gene expression control, I have identified mRNAs associated with five myosin heavy chains in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, by purifying the proteins and identifying bound transcripts using DNA microarrays. Each myosin coimmunoprecipitated with 5–13 different mRNAs (~0.1–0.2% of all genes), including those encoding four different myosin heavy chains. Moreover, one of the myosins (Myol) interacted with mRNAs encoding components of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. These interactions were not observed in control immunoprecipitates. A myosin-specific chaperone (Rng3) that interacts cotranslationally with myosin mRNAs was essential for the association between myosin proteins and transcripts but not between Myol and other mRNAs. Finally, proteins encoded by the Myo1-associated mRNAs immunoprecipitated each other's transcripts, but not myosin mRNAs. These interactions suggest the existence of two distinct myosin-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes: those containing myosin mRNAs and those associated with Myo1. They are distinguished by their mRNA composition, requirement for the Rng3 chaperone and the presence of nonmyosin cytoskeletal proteins. I propose that these complexes represent specialized sites for the production of myosin proteins and the assembly of cytoskeletal components, respectively.—Mata, J.

https://openalex.org/W2056885403,"Navigation of cell locomotion by gradients of soluble factors can be desensitized if the concentration of the chemo-attractant stays unchanged. It remains obscure if the guidance by immobilized extracellular matrix (ECM) as the substrate is also adaptive and if so, how can the desensitized ECM guidance be resensitized. When first interacting with a substrate containing micron-scale fibronectin (FBN) trails, highly motile fish keratocytes selectively adhere and migrate along the FBN paths. However, such guided motion become adaptive after about 10 min and the cells start to migrate out of the ECM trails. We found that a burst increase of intracellular calcium created by an uncaging technique immediately halts the undirected migration by disrupting the ECM-cytoskeleton coupling, as evidenced by the appearance of retrograde F-actin flow. When the motility later resumes, the activated integrin receptors render the cell selectively binding to the FBN path and reinitiates signaling events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, that couple retrograde F-actin flow to the substrate. Thus, the calcium-resensitized cell can undergo a period of ECM-navigated movement, which later becomes desensitized. Our results also suggest that endogenous calcium transients as occur during spontaneous calcium oscillations may exert a cycling resensitization-desensitization control over cell's sensing of substrate guiding cues."

https://openalex.org/W2017855356,"Background Heterotrimeric G proteins and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are key downstream interacting partners in the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. The highly versatile GPCR transmembrane signaling system is a consequence of the coupling of a diverse set of receptors to downstream partners that include multiple subforms of G proteins and regulatory proteins including RGS proteins, among others. While the GPCR repertoire of Ciona intestinalis, representing the basal chordate is known, the repertoire of the heterotrimeric G proteins and RGS proteins is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we performed an in-silico genome-wide search of C. intestinalis for its complement of G proteins and RGS proteins. The identification of several one-to-one orthologs of human G proteins at the levels of families, subfamilies and types and of homologs of the human RGS proteins suggests an evolutionarily conserved structure function relationship of the GPCR signaling mechanism in the chordates. Conclusions The C. intestinalis genome encodes a highly conserved, albeit, limited repertoire of the heterotrimeric G protein complexes with the size of subunit types comparable with that in lower eukaryotes."
