https://openalex.org/W2066441178,"The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recently associated with a stem cell phenotype. In breast cancer cell lines and tumours, p53 directly targets the expression of microRNAs that have been shown to inhibit EMT and stem cells regulators. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has recently been linked to stem cell phenotype1,2. However, the molecular mechanism underlying EMT and regulation of stemness remains elusive. Here, using genomic approaches, we show that tumour suppressor p53 has a role in regulating both EMT and EMT-associated stem cell properties through transcriptional activation of the microRNA miR-200c. p53 transactivates miR-200c through direct binding to the miR-200c promoter. Loss of p53 in mammary epithelial cells leads to decreased expression of miR-200c and activates the EMT programme, accompanied by an increased mammary stem cell population. Re-expressing miR-200c suppresses genes that mediate EMT and stemness properties3,4 and thereby reverts the mesenchymal and stem-cell-like phenotype caused by loss of p53 to a differentiated epithelial cell phenotype. Furthermore, loss of p53 correlates with a decrease in the level of miR-200c, but an increase in the expression of EMT and stemness markers, and development of a high tumour grade in a cohort of breast tumours. This study elucidates a role for p53 in regulating EMT–MET (mesenchymal–epithelial transition) and stemness or differentiation plasticity, and reveals a potential therapeutic implication to suppress EMT-associated cancer stem cells through activation of the p53–miR-200c pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2046100445,"Cancer cells consume large quantities of glucose and primarily use glycolysis for ATP production, even in the presence of adequate oxygen. This metabolic signature (aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect) enables cancer cells to direct glucose to biosynthesis, supporting their rapid growth and proliferation. However, both causes of the Warburg effect and its connection to biosynthesis are not well understood. Here we show that the tumour suppressor p53, the most frequently mutated gene in human tumours, inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Through the PPP, p53 suppresses glucose consumption, NADPH production and biosynthesis. The p53 protein binds to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, and prevents the formation of the active dimer. Tumour-associated p53 mutants lack the G6PD-inhibitory activity. Therefore, enhanced PPP glucose flux due to p53 inactivation may increase glucose consumption and direct glucose towards biosynthesis in tumour cells."

We now show that, in males, bone acts as a regulator of fertility. Using coculture assays, we demonstrate that osteoblasts are able to induce testosterone production by the testes, though they fail to influence estrogen production by the ovaries. Analyses of cell-specific loss- and gain-of-function models reveal that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin performs this endocrine function. By binding to a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the Leydig cells of the testes, osteocalcin regulates in a CREB-dependent manner the expression of enzymes that is required for testosterone synthesis, promoting germ cell survival. This study expands the physiological repertoire of osteocalcin and provides the first evidence that the skeleton is an endocrine regulator of reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2008584420,"Huntington's disease is an inherited and incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in huntingtin (encoded by HTT). PolyQ length determines disease onset and severity, with a longer expansion causing earlier onset. The mechanisms of mutant huntingtin-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear; however, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key event in Huntington's disease pathogenesis. Here we tested whether mutant huntingtin impairs the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance and thereby causes neuronal injury. We show that mutant huntingtin triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in rat neurons and fibroblasts of individuals with Huntington's disease in vitro and in a mouse model of Huntington's disease in vivo before the presence of neurological deficits and huntingtin aggregates. Mutant huntingtin abnormally interacts with the mitochondrial fission GTPase dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) in mice and humans with Huntington's disease, which, in turn, stimulates its enzymatic activity. Mutant huntingtin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation, defects in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport and neuronal cell death are all rescued by reducing DRP1 GTPase activity with the dominant-negative DRP1 K38A mutant. Thus, DRP1 might represent a new therapeutic target to combat neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2113787438,"Bacteria are known to communicate primarily via secreted extracellular factors. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we visualized transfer of cytoplasmic fluorescent molecules between adjacent cells. Additionally, by coculturing strains harboring different antibiotic resistance genes, we demonstrated that molecular exchange enables cells to transiently acquire nonhereditary resistance. Furthermore, nonconjugative plasmids could be transferred from one cell to another, thereby conferring hereditary features to recipient cells. Electron microscopy revealed the existence of variously sized tubular extensions bridging neighboring cells, serving as a route for exchange of intracellular molecules. These nanotubes also formed in an interspecies manner, between B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and even between B. subtilis and the evolutionary distant bacterium Escherichia coli. We propose that nanotubes represent a major form of bacterial communication in nature, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within and between species."
https://openalex.org/W2028462978,"Rapid diagnosis of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains a clinical and laboratory challenge. We have analyzed the cytokine profile (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) of Mtb-specific T cells by polychromatic flow cytometry. We studied Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell responses in subjects with latent Mtb infection and active tuberculosis disease. The results showed substantial increase in the proportion of single-positive TNF-α Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells in subjects with active disease, and this parameter was the strongest predictor of diagnosis of active disease versus latent infection. We validated the use of this parameter in a cohort of 101 subjects with tuberculosis diagnosis unknown to the investigator. The sensitivity and specificity of the flow cytometry-based assay were 67% and 92%, respectively, the positive predictive value was 80% and the negative predictive value was 92.4%. Therefore, the proportion of single-positive TNF-α Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells is a new tool for the rapid diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease."

The major candidate for the epigenetic mark is chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Recent studies offer conflicting evidence for the structure of CENP-A-containing chromatin, including the histone composition and handedness of the DNA wrapped around the histones. We present a model for the assembly and deposition of centromeric nucleosomes that couples these processes to the cell cycle. This model reconciles divergent data for CENP-A-containing nucleosomes and provides a basis for how centromere identity is stably inherited. Centromeres direct chromosome inheritance, but in multicellular organisms their positions on chromosomes are primarily specified epigenetically rather than by a DNA sequence. The major candidate for the epigenetic mark is chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Recent studies offer conflicting evidence for the structure of CENP-A-containing chromatin, including the histone composition and handedness of the DNA wrapped around the histones. We present a model for the assembly and deposition of centromeric nucleosomes that couples these processes to the cell cycle. This model reconciles divergent data for CENP-A-containing nucleosomes and provides a basis for how centromere identity is stably inherited. The centromere is a specialized region on each chromosome that ensures the faithful inheritance of the chromosome during cell division. Specifically, the centromere mediates the chromosome's attachment to the mitotic spindle, and it also serves as the location of final cohesion between the duplicated copies of a chromosome (i.e., chromatids) prior to their complete separation and movement to opposite spindle poles near the end of mitosis. Centromeric DNA usually contains a repetitive sequence with a repeating unit, typically 160–180 bp, that is slightly smaller than the average spacing between nucleosomes on chromosomal arms (i.e., ∼200 bp). The repeating sequences found in centromeric DNA evolve rapidly relative to the rest of the chromosome (Figure 1), and they are likely to have a role in maintaining the large heterochromatin domains typically found at centromeres. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeric DNA is a single domain of 125 bp (bottom, Figure 1), and its position is specified by sequence-specific recruitment of a centromere binding complex, which contains four proteins (Ndc10, Cep3, Ctf13, and Skp1) (Lechner and Carbon, 1991Lechner J. Carbon J. A 240 kd multisubunit protein complex, CBF3, is a major component of the budding yeast centromere.Cell. 1991; 64: 717-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In all other species studied, centromeric DNA spans thousands to millions of base pairs and contains repetitive DNA motifs that sharply diverge between species, making these repeats sequence unique for each species. Surprisingly, however, the presence of these repeats does not specify centromere location, and they are not required for the general function of centromeres. Rather, the epigenetic information that specifies centromeres tracks with the chromatin underlying the mitotic kinetochore, the protein complex that physically connects each chromosome to the microtubule-based spindle apparatus. In all eukaryotes, a key component of the chromatin that specifies centromeres is the incorporation of a variant of histone H3, named CENP-A in mammals, CID in flies, and Cse4 in budding yeast. In all likely models of centromere inheritance, CENP-A or its homolog is what physically distinguishes centromeric chromatin from the rest of the chromosome. In addition, after DNA replication in S phase, the presence of CENP-A is also probably responsible for directing the deposition of newly expressed CENP-A and other centromere components, which in mammals include CENP-C, M, N, U, and T (Foltz et al., 2006Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E.T. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. The human CENP-A centromeric nucleosome-associated complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). A consistent observation is that centromere-specifying chromatin vacates “silenced” centromeres that no longer function (Earnshaw and Migeon, 1985Earnshaw W.C. Migeon B.R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 901-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The best examples of these “silenced” centromeres are produced by rare chromosomal translocations in which both initial centromeres end up on one chromosome (which has been called a “pseudodicentric” chromosome). Invariably, one of the centromeres is silenced and loses all centromere proteins, including CENP-A. In other examples in humans, centromere silencing (or loss through germline chromosomal rearrangement) at a normal chromosomal location has been accompanied by activation of a new centromere at a different position on the same chromosome, creating what is referred to as a neocentromere. Neocentromeres form at sites without the typical repetitive DNA found at the original centromeres and without any DNA sequence changes (Lo et al., 2001Lo A.W. Craig J.M. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Irvine D.V. Earle E. Magliano D.J. Choo K.H. A 330 kb CENP-A binding domain and altered replication timing at a human neocentromere.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even more remarkably, the locations of such neocentromeres are faithfully maintained through the human germline (Amor et al., 2004Amor D.J. Bentley K. Ryan J. Perry J. Wong L. Slater H. Choo K.H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 901-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, centromeric chromatin can spread linearly along DNA (Maggert and Karpen, 2001Maggert K.A. Karpen G.H. The activation of a neocentromere in Drosophila requires proximity to an endogenous centromere.Genetics. 2001; 158: 1615-1628PubMed Google Scholar). It is poorly understood how epigenetic information encoded by chromatin at specific sites is retained during major chromosomal events, including DNA replication and transcription. Of these epigenetic marks, the centromere mark is the longest lived (i.e., through evolutionary timescales). Nevertheless, there is no consensus on what are the most crucial questions to address concerning the epigenetic basis of centromere identity: What is the structure of centromeric chromatin? What is the likely epigenetic mark? Or, how is that mark replicated and maintained through centromere DNA duplication? Instead, a set of seemingly inconsistent models for the structure of CENP-A-containing chromatin have been proposed (Camahort et al., 2009Camahort R. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Li B. Nakanishi S.

Cell. 2009; 33: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reconciling the disparate data on the structure of centromeric chromatin and generating testable models—two primary goals of this essay—are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the self-propagation of the epigenetic mark underling centromere inheritance. Here we consider the merits (and weaknesses) of each model. Building on the discovery that in metazoans, the assembly of centromeric chromatin occurs only after exit from mitosis (i.e., half a cell cycle after centromeric DNA replication) (Jansen et al., 2007Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Cleveland D.W. Propagation of centromeric chromatin requires exit from mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Schuh et al., 2007Schuh M. Lehner C.F. Heidmann S. Incorporation of Drosophila CID/CENP-A and CENP-C into centromeres during early embryonic anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 237-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we propose a model for cell-cycle-dependent maturation of centromeric nucleosomes. Perhaps the most central, unresolved question regarding replication of centromere identity is how CENP-A already assembled into centromeric chromatin is retained at centromeres as nucleosomes are disrupted by DNA polymerase and then reassembled onto each daughter centromere after replication. A second, related question is when during the cell cycle is CENP-A deposited at centromeres. Surprisingly, this deposition is not contemporaneous with DNA replication. Evidence in human cells (Jansen et al., 2007Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Cleveland D.W. Propagation of centromeric chromatin requires exit from mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and fly embryos (Schuh et al., 2007Schuh M. Lehner C.F. Heidmann S. Incorporation of Drosophila CID/CENP-A and CENP-C into centromeres during early embryonic anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 237-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) indicates that deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A onto centromeric DNA starts late in mitosis and extends through the G1 phase of the following cycle. Temporal separation of the assembly of new CENP-A chromatin from the replication of centromeric DNA raises the likelihood that distinct forms of centromeric chromatin exist during different portions of the cell cycle. In particular, the current evidence suggests that restoration of complete loading of CENP-A occurs in G1. However, after DNA replication in S phase, despite complete reloading of previously centromere-bound CENP-A, there are twice as many centromeres, resulting in half as many CENP-A at each centromere (Jansen et al., 2007Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Cleveland D.W. Propagation of centromeric chromatin requires exit from mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Schuh et al., 2007Schuh M. Lehner C.F. Heidmann S. Incorporation of Drosophila CID/CENP-A and CENP-C into centromeres during early embryonic anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 237-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This CENP-A loading at half the maximal level persists through the G2 and mitosis phases. Such distinct forms of centromeric chromatin could include variations in the histone (or nonhistone) composition of nucleosomes or even alterations in higher-order chromatin structure. Regardless of the answers to these crucial questions, two steps must occur to separate the deposition of CENP-A at centromeres from pathways depositing bulk histones at noncentromeric chromatin: the sorting of newly synthesized CENP-A away from bulk H3 and the selective recognition of centromeric chromatin for assembling new CENP-A protein into it. Newly synthesized histones are thought to rapidly bind to their partners: H3 binds to H4 and H2A to H2B. In addition, prior to assembly, the histone complexes are bound by “chaperones” that prevent promiscuous association of the highly basic proteins with highly acidic nucleic acids (Ransom et al., 2010Ransom M. Dennehey B.K. Tyler J.K. Chaperoning histones during DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2010; 140: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The chaperone that sorts the (CENP-A:H4)2 heterotetramer away from bulk histone is called HJURP in humans (Dunleavy et al., 2009Dunleavy E.M. Roche D. Tagami H. Lacoste N. Ray-Gallet D. Nakamura Y.

This chaperone is part of the pathway that couples CENP-A deposition to the cell cycle and targets CENP-A to centromeres. Human HJURP forms a complex with newly synthesized CENP-A protein (i.e., before it integrates into a nucleosome) by recognizing the CENP-A Targeting Domain (CATD) on the CENP-A:H4 tetramer (Foltz et al., 2009Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E.T. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Bassett E.A. Wood S. Black B.E. Cleveland D.W. Centromere specific assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes is mediated by HJURP.Cell. 2009; 137: 472-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The CATD consists of 22 amino acid substitutions within the classic histone fold domain (Black et al., 2004Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Woods V.L. Cleveland D.W. Structural determinants for generating centromeric chromatin.Nature. 2004; 430: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). When it is substituted into histone H3, it not only is sufficient to confer centromere targeting capabilities to H3 (Black et al., 2004Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Woods V.L. Cleveland D.W. Structural determinants for generating centromeric chromatin.Nature. 2004; 430: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), but it also enables the hybrid H3-CATD to maintain centromere function when CENP-A is reduced (Black et al., 2007bBlack B.E. Jansen L.E.T. Maddox P.S. Foltz D.R. Desai A.B. Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Centromere identity maintained by nucleosomes assembled with histone H3 containing the CENP-A targeting domain.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Substantial structural differences distinguish CENP-A:H4 from its histone counterpart, H3:H4. These include several alterations in surface-exposed side chains; a bulged loop (loop L1) that generates a different shape and oppositely charged surface as found on H3; a rigid interface with H4; and a rotated CENP-A:CENP-A interface that compacts the overall size of the (CENP-A:H4)2 heterotetramers (Sekulic et al., 2010Sekulic N. Bassett E.A. Rogers D.J. Black B.E. The structure of (CENP-A-H4)2 reveals physical features that mark centromeres.Nature. 2010; 467: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Following incorporation into chromosomes, CENP-A must mark the chromatin as centromeric, thus distinguishing the centromere from the rest of the chromosome. One or a few nucleosomes with CENP-A substituting for the conventional H3 histone is apparently insufficient to generate a functional centromere, except in budding yeast in which a DNA sequence element is used for identifying centromeres (Figure 1). This view is built upon several observations. First, CENP-A accumulation at noncentromeric sites of DNA damage is transient (Zeitlin et al., 2009Zeitlin S.G. Baker N.M. Chapados B.R. Soutoglou E. Wang J.Y. Berns M.W. Cleveland D.W. Double-strand DNA breaks recruit the centromeric histone CENP-A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 15762-15767Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second, when CENP-A is massively overproduced, it deposits onto chromosomal arms, but these sites only occasionally recruit one or more kinetochore components even when incorporated into expansive ectopic loci (Heun et al., 2006Heun P. Erhardt S. Blower M.D. Weiss S. Skora A.D. Karpen G.H. Mislocalization of the Drosophila centromere-specific histone CID promotes formation of functional ectopic kinetochores.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 303-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that reinforce centromere identity probably rely on recognizing the foundational mark that CENP-A confers to nucleosomes. This could occur either by CENP-A nucleosomes recognizing other CENP-A nucleosomes in higher-order chromatin folding (Blower et al., 2002Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H.

Recent studies have uncovered additional mechanisms that prevent CENP-A from stably incorporating into chromosome arms. For example, in the budding yeast, ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Psh1, which specifically recognizes CENP-A through the CATD (Ranjitkar et al., 2010Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R.

Throughout the genome, epigenetic marks encoded by nucleosomes are generally thought to exist as posttranslational modifications of conventional histones, the incorporation of histone variants, or a combination of both. A major challenge has been to define how the variant CENP-A physically alters chromatin to specify and maintain centromere location on the chromosome. In fact, several recent studies have provided evidence that support seemingly contradictory models for the structure of chromatin containing CENP-A (Figure 2): (1) The most conventional view is of an octameric nucleosome with two copies of each histone, H2A, H2B, H4, and CENP-A (in place of H3) (Camahort et al., 2009Camahort R.

https://openalex.org/W2025772032,"Two major mechanisms have been causally implicated in the establishment of cellular senescence: the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Here we show that in human fibroblasts resistant to premature p16(INK4a) induction, SAHF are preferentially formed following oncogene activation but are not detected during replicative cellular senescence or on exposure to a variety of senescence-inducing stimuli. Oncogene-induced SAHF formation depends on DNA replication and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related). Inactivation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or p53 allows the proliferation of oncogene-expressing cells that retain increased heterochromatin induction. In human cancers, levels of heterochromatin markers are higher than in normal tissues, and are independent of the proliferative index or stage of the tumours. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of heterochromatin in oncogene-expressing cells increase DDR signalling and lead to apoptosis. In vivo, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) causes heterochromatin relaxation, increased DDR, apoptosis and tumour regression. These results indicate that heterochromatin induced by oncogenic stress restrains DDR and suggest that the use of chromatin-modifying drugs in cancer therapies may benefit from the study of chromatin and DDR status of tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2055035964,"The hair follicle bulge in the epidermis associates with the arrector pili muscle (APM) that is responsible for piloerection (""goosebumps""). We show that stem cells in the bulge deposit nephronectin into the underlying basement membrane, thus regulating the adhesion of mesenchymal cells expressing the nephronectin receptor, α8β1 integrin, to the bulge. Nephronectin induces α8 integrin-positive mesenchymal cells to upregulate smooth muscle markers. In nephronectin knockout mice, fewer arrector pili muscles form in the skin, and they attach to the follicle above the bulge, where there is compensatory upregulation of the nephronectin family member EGFL6. Deletion of α8 integrin also abolishes selective APM anchorage to the bulge. Nephronectin is a Wnt target; epidermal β-catenin activation upregulates epidermal nephronectin and dermal α8 integrin expression. Thus, bulge stem cells, via nephronectin expression, create a smooth muscle cell niche and act as tendon cells for the APM. Our results reveal a functional role for basement membrane heterogeneity in tissue patterning. PAPERCLIP:"

However, its functional roles in ESC maintenance and differentiation are not established. Here we show that mammalian Dpy-30, a core subunit of the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complexes, modulates H3K4 methylation in vitro, and directly regulates chromosomal H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) throughout the mammalian genome. Depletion of Dpy-30 does not affect ESC self-renewal, but significantly alters the differentiation potential of ESCs, particularly along the neural lineage. The differentiation defect is accompanied by defects in gene induction and in H3K4 methylation at key developmental loci. Our results strongly indicate an essential functional role for Dpy-30 and SET1/MLL complex-mediated H3K4 methylation, as a component of the bivalent mark, at developmental genes during the ESC fate transitions."

TNFAIP3, encoding the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, is an established susceptibility locus for SLE. By fine mapping and genomic re-sequencing in ethnically diverse populations, we fully characterized the TNFAIP3 risk haplotype and identified a TT>A polymorphic dinucleotide (deletion T followed by a T to A transversion) associated with SLE in subjects of European (P = 1.58 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.70) and Korean (P = 8.33 × 10(-10), odds ratio = 2.54) ancestry. This variant, located in a region of high conservation and regulatory potential, bound a nuclear protein complex composed of NF-κB subunits with reduced avidity. Further, compared with the non-risk haplotype, the haplotype carrying this variant resulted in reduced TNFAIP3 mRNA and A20 protein expression.

Mitotic kinases as regulators of cell division and its checkpoints.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). One pivotal step during mitotic entry in vertebrate cells is the disassembly of the nuclear envelope (NE). The process of NE breakdown (NEBD) starts in early prophase and culminates in the loss of NE integrity at the transition from prophase to prometaphase (Guttinger et al., 2009Guttinger S. Laurell E. Kutay U. Orchestrating nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly during mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 178-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The disassembly of the NE comprises a series of events including nuclear pore complex (NPC) disassembly, depolymerization of the nuclear lamina, and the retraction of NE membranes into the mitotic endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, microtubules emanating from centrosomes in the cytoplasm gain access to the condensed chromatin to allow for spindle formation. A decisive point of NEBD is the disassembly of NPCs and the resulting loss of the NE permeability barrier accompanied by the mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. In interphase cells, the permeability characteristics of the NE are determined by structural features of NPCs that restrict the passive diffusion of macromolecules >30 kDa and support receptor-mediated transport across the NE (Terry and Wente, 2009Terry L.J. Wente S.R. Flexible gates: dynamic topologies and functions for FG nucleoporins in nucleocytoplasmic transport.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 1814-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). NPCs consist of approximately 30 different proteins, so-called nucleoporins (Nups), that are present in multiple copies in each NPC, and many Nups are organized in nucleoporin subcomplexes (Brohawn et al., 2009Brohawn S.G.

Approximately one-third of nucleoporins contain various types of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats in unstructured domains. FG domains both aid receptor-mediated nuclear transport and establish the NPC permeability barrier (Terry and Wente, 2009Terry L.J. Wente S.R.

Therefore, it is assumed that NPC disassembly in metazoan cells is triggered by phosphorylation of certain nucleoporins. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested. Studies in several model systems including starfish oocytes, Drosophila embryos, and human cells demonstrated that NPC disassembly is a rapid process that starts in late prophase and is completed within minutes (Kiseleva et al., 2001Kiseleva E.

In mammalian somatic cells, the loss of the NE permeability barrier occurs concomitantly with the dispersion of most soluble nucleoporins from the NPC (Dultz et al., 2008Dultz E. Zanin E.

Nuclear envelope breakdown in starfish oocytes proceeds by partial NPC disassembly followed by a rapidly spreading fenestration of nuclear membranes.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but it is presently unclear if its timely removal is required for NPC disassembly and NEBD. Nup98 is a peripheral nucleoporin that localizes symmetrically to both sides of the NPC, where it is anchored through its C-terminal domain (Griffis et al., 2003Griffis E.R. Xu S. Powers M.A. Nup98 localizes to both nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the nuclear pore and binds to two distinct nucleoporin subcomplexes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Nup98 contains GLFG-type FG repeats, which are crucial for proper NPC function in yeast (Strawn et al., 2004Strawn L.A. Shen T. Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Wente S.R. Minimal nuclear pore complexes define FG repeat domains essential for transport.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The cohesive nature of GLFG repeats (Patel et al., 2007Patel S.S. Belmont B.J. Sante J.M. Rexach M.F. Natively unfolded nucleoporins gate protein diffusion across the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2007; 129: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) is thought to contribute to the formation of the NPC permeability barrier that restricts passive diffusion but allows transport receptor passage (Frey and Gorlich, 2009Frey S. Gorlich D. FG/FxFG as well as GLFG repeats form a selective permeability barrier with self-healing properties.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2554-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we considered it an attractive possibility that the removal of Nup98 at the onset of mitotic NPC disassembly might be involved in breaking the NE selectivity barrier. Here we show that phosphorylation of Nup98 presents a crucial step during NPC disassembly. Several protein kinases contribute to Nup98 phosphorylation and facilitate NE permeabilization during mitotic entry. Our data provide evidence for a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism underlying disintegration of NPCs during prophase. To study the role of mitotic kinases in NEBD, we modified a previously developed in vitro system that recapitulates nuclear disassembly on nuclei of semipermeabilized HeLa cells upon addition of CSF-arrested Xenopus egg extract (Muhlhausser and Kutay, 2007Muhlhausser P. Kutay U. An in vitro nuclear disassembly system reveals a role for the RanGTPase system and microtubule-dependent steps in nuclear envelope breakdown.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To avoid mixing of components derived from different species, we now employed mitotic extracts prepared from nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells. Further, to track NPC disassembly by live microscopy, we performed the reactions on nuclei derived from 2GFP-Nup58-expressing cells. In our assay, NPC disassembly can be scored by both dissociation of 2GFP-Nup58 from the nuclear rim and nuclear influx of a TRITC-labeled fluorescent dextran of 155 kDa that is too large to traverse intact NPCs (Figure 1). NE permeabilization started on average 35 min after addition of mitotic extract and was completed after about 50 min in most nuclei. NPC disassembly was not induced by extracts derived from interphase cells (data not shown). Because the assay makes use of fully activated mitotic extracts, it allows for assessing the contribution of mitotically active kinases to the process of NEBD independent of their general function during mitotic entry. Among all kinases involved in the G2/M transition, CDK1 plays a key role. Notably, many nucleoporins and inner nuclear membrane proteins are phosphorylated on CDK1 consensus sites during mitosis (Blethrow et al., 2008Blethrow J.D. Glavy J.S. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Covalent capture of kinase-specific phosphopeptides reveals Cdk1-cyclin B substrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We had previously observed that inhibition of CDK1 strongly decreases the rate of NE permeabilization when using CSF-arrested egg extracts (Muhlhausser and Kutay, 2007Muhlhausser P. Kutay U.

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test whether mitotic HeLa extract truly recapitulates this requirement for CDK1 activity, we monitored NEBD in vitro in the presence of the CDK1 inhibitor alsterpaullone (Schultz et al., 1999Schultz C. Link A. Leost M. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Sausville E.A. Meijer L. Kunick C. Paullones, a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors: synthesis, evaluation of CDK1/cyclin B inhibition, and in vitro antitumor activity.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Addition of 50 μM alsterpaullone strongly inhibited NPC disassembly, demonstrating that the mitotic activity of the extract leads to disassembly of the NE. 2GFP-Nup58 remained at the nuclear rim, and the integrity of the NPCs was kept intact as judged by the exclusion of dextran from most nuclei (Figure 1). Alsterpaullone, at the concentration applied in the NEBD experiment, strongly reduced H1 phosphorylation by the mitotic extract and by recombinant CDK1/cyclin B1. In conclusion, these data show that our experimental setup allows for dissecting the contribution of factors to early steps of NEBD and that CDK1 is essential for efficient NPC disassembly. The fungus Aspergillus nidulans undergoes a semi-open mitosis characterized by a partial disassembly of NPCs that depends on the activity of both CDK1 and the kinase Never in Mitosis A (NIMA) (De Souza et al., 2004De Souza C.P.

Overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of NIMA (K40M) (Lu et al., 1993Lu K.P. Osmani S.A. Means A.R. Properties and regulation of the cell cycle-specific NIMA protein kinase of Aspergillus nidulans.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8769-8776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth of Aspergillus and arrests cells in G2 without hindering p34cdc2 (CDK1) activation (Lu and Means, 1994Lu K.P. Means A.R. Expression of the noncatalytic domain of the NIMA kinase causes a G2 arrest in Aspergillus nidulans.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze a potential involvement of NIMA-related kinases (Neks, Nrks) in NPC disassembly in mammalian cells, we made use of this dominant-negative behavior of kinase-dead (KD) NIMA and tested its effect on NEBD in vitro. Wild-type NIMA (WT) and NIMA KD (K40M) were expressed in E. coli, purified, and tested for kinase activity (Figure S1 available online). As expected, only wild-type NIMA was active. Next, we added NIMA WT and NIMA KD to the mitotic HeLa cell extracts used for nuclear disassembly. Compared to addition of BSA, NIMA WT accelerated both Nup58 dissociation and dextran influx, whereas NIMA KD was dominant negative on nuclear disassembly (Figure 2). It can be excluded that these changes are due to indirect effects of NIMA WT or KD on CDK1 activity, as neither changed H1 phosphorylation by the mitotic extract. Quantitation of the time point t50 at which 50% of all quantified nuclei were dextran positive showed that NIMA WT accelerated NPC disassembly by ∼10 min and NIMA KD delayed the process by ∼15 min. These data support the idea that NIMA-related kinases might play a role in mitotic NPC disassembly. The dominant-negative effect of the NIMA mutant might be caused by competition between NIMA KD and certain Neks for the same substrate(s). Mammalian cells encode 11 Neks (O'Connell et al., 2003O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Never say never.

Fry A.M. Mitotic regulation by NIMA-related kinases.Cell Div. 2007; 2: 25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 are active during mitosis and implicated in the regulation of mitotic events. Nek9 activates Nek6 and Nek7 (Belham et al., 2003Belham C. Roig J. Caldwell J.A. Aoyama Y. Kemp B.E. Comb M. Avruch J. A mitotic cascade of NIMA family kinases. Nercc1/Nek9 activates the Nek6 and Nek7 kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34897-34909Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which aid mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis (O'Regan and Fry, 2009O'Regan L. Fry A.M. The Nek6 and Nek7 protein kinases are required for robust mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3975-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nek2 is most closely related to Aspergillus NIMA and known for its role in regulating centrosome cohesion (Fry et al., 1998Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. A centrosomal function for the human Nek2 protein kinase, a member of the NIMA family of cell cycle regulators.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Nek2, Nek6, or Nek7 play a role in triggering NEBD, we analyzed the effect of their RNAi-mediated depletion on progression into mitosis in HeLa cells (Figure S2). Consistent with published data based on flow cytometry (O'Regan and Fry, 2009O'Regan L. Fry A.M. The Nek6 and Nek7 protein kinases are required for robust mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3975-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the individual depletion of Nek6 and Nek7 clearly reduced the mitotic index of HeLa cells. The mitotic index of Nek2-depleted cells was slightly reduced. As Nek6 and Nek7 are very similar (81% identity, 90% similarity), we also tested whether their simultaneous downregulation would enhance the effect of individual depletion. Indeed, codepletion led to an even more pronounced decrease in the mitotic index (Figure S2). Altogether, these data demonstrate that presence of Nek6 and Nek7 is required for efficient progression through G2 into mitosis in mammalian cells. Many mitotic kinases are required for multiple events in mitotic progression. To test whether Nek6/7 promote NEBD, we next used a HeLa cell line coexpressing the chromatin marker H2B-mCherry and the nuclear efflux marker IBB-GFP to determine whether Nek6/7 depletion prolongs the time span between the onset of chromatin condensation and NE permeabilization (Figure 3). In control cells, it took an average of 9 min between the onset of chromatin condensation and nuclear efflux of IBB-GFP. Depletion of Nek6 alone already extended this time span by 4 min. In cells codepleted for Nek6/7, this time span was further prolonged to about 15 min. Thus, Nek6 and Nek7 might be required for timely NE permeabilization during mitotic entry in vivo. To analyze whether this delay reflects a contribution of Nek6 and Nek7 to NPC disassembly, we used our in vitro nuclear disassembly assay (Figure 4). Here, we combined immunodepletion of Nek6/7 from the mitotic extract with depletion of Nek6/7 from the nuclei of the semipermeabilized cells by RNAi. The necessity of depleting Nek6/7 from the cells is explained by a nuclear pool of Nek6/7 in interphase cells (O'Regan and Fry, 2009O'Regan L. Fry A.M. The Nek6 and Nek7 protein kinases are required for robust mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3975-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For depletion of Nek6/7 from the mitotic extract, we used an antibody that recognizes both Nek6 and Nek7. Immunodepletion was efficient as judged by western blotting. Like in vivo, depletion of Nek6 and Nek7 did not block nuclear disassembly but resulted in a significant delay of NE permeabilization, giving rise to an increase in t50 of about 7 min (Figure 4). Note that neither Nek6/7 siRNA treatment of the cells nor Nek6/7 depletion of the extracts alone significantly delayed NEBD (data not shown). Again, by monitoring H1 phosphorylation, we ensured that depletion of Nek6/7 did not affect the general mitotic activity of the extract. These data indicate that Nek6 and Nek7 indeed contribute to the loss of the NE permeability barrier during NEBD. An initial step of NEBD is the disassembly of NPCs—accompanied by changes in their transport and diffusion barrier properties. Confocal time-lapse microscopy of mammalian cells had previously revealed that the dissociation of the peripheral GLFG-repeat nucleoporin Nup98 preceeds the dispersal of other nucleoporins from the nuclear rim during mitotic entry (Dultz et al., 2008Dultz E. Zanin E. Wurzenberger C. Braun M. Rabut G. Sironi L. Ellenberg J. Systematic kinetic analysis of mitotic dis- and reassembly of the nuclear pore in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We analyzed the localization of nucleoporins in prophase cells by immunofluorescence. In all cells that had initiated NPC disassembly—indicated by the release of a nuclear 3GFP-NLS fusion protein to the cytoplasm—Nup98 was no longer detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against amino acids 581–880 of Nup98 (Figure 5, ab1). In contrast, other nucleoporins such as Nup107, Nup96, Nup62, and Nup205 were still detected at the nuclear rim. This could indicate either that Nup98 had been selectively removed from the NE and degraded or that Nup98 was not accessible to the antibody. In agreement with the latter we found that Nup98 was still detectable at the NE by a different, peptide-specific antibody (ab2). Immunoblot analysis revealed that both antibodies recognized Nup98 from interphase cells, whereas mitotic Nup98, which migrated slower in SDS-PAGE, was no longer recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibody. Collectively, these data suggest that Nup98 is specifically modified at the NPC during mitotic entry. Notably, reactivity of ab1 is regained in telophase cells concurrent with nuclear accumulation of 3GFP-NLS (Figure S5). Thus, there appears to be a strong correlation between Nup98 modification and the barrier/transport properties of NPCs. Xenopus Nup98 had earlier been noted to be highly phosphorylated in mitotic cells (Macaulay et al., 1995Macaulay C. Meier E. Forbes D.J. Differential mitotic phosphorylation of proteins of the nuclear pore complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mobility shift observed for Nup98 derived from nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells could be converted by phosphatase treatment, confirming mitotic phosphorylation of human Nup98 (Figure 6A ). The nucleoporin Rae1, a binding partner of Nup98 that remains associated with Nup98 during mitosis (Jeganathan et al., 2005Jeganathan K.B. Malureanu L. van Deursen J.M. The Rae1-Nup98 complex prevents aneuploidy by inhibiting securin degradation.Nature. 2005; 438: 1036-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was unaffected. Notably, phosphatase treatment also allowed ab1 to recognize mitotic Nup98 (Figure S5), indicating that Nup98 is phosphorylated at the NPC during mitotic entry. To determine the mitotic phosphorylation sites in Nup98, we immunoprecipitated Nup98 from mitotic cell extracts and analyzed tryptic or chymotryptic peptides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Table S1, Table S2, and Figure S3). The overall sequence coverage of Nup98 was 66%, with 59% coverage in the N-terminal FG domain (aa 1–505) and 76% in the C-terminal part of Nup98 (aa 506–863). Altogether 13 phosphorylation sites were detected in Nup98 isolated from mitotic cells (Figure 6B). In Nup98 isolated from interphase cells, 9 peptides containing these phopsphorylatable amino acids were detected in their unphosphorylated form. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was used to quantify and compare the occurrence of phosphosites in mitotic and interphase Nup98 for the most abundant phosphopeptides of our LC-MS/MS analysis. This confirmed the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of these sites (Table S1, Figure S4).Figure S4Mass Spectrometric Comparison of Phosphorylation Levels of Nup98 (S591 and S595) during G1 and Mitosis using the SILAC Method, Related to Figure 6Show full captionHeLa cells were grown in medium with arginine and lysine that either contained heavy isotopes (13C, 15N) or light isotopes (12C, 14N).

Compared to the peptide ion derived from mitotic Nup98 found at 824.85 m/z, the interphase form of this peptide ion has a predicted mass increase of 10 Da resulting in a 5 m/z shift for the doubly charged peptide ion between the mitotic and the interphase form (red arrow).

The epitope of ab1 is masked at the end of prophase because of mitosis-specific modifications of Nup98, whereas ab2 still recognizes Nup98 at the nuclear rim. The loss of Nup98 detection by ab1 correlates with cytoplasmic appearance of 3GFP-NLS. In late telophase, the nuclear accumulation of 3GFP-NLS is restored, coinciding with a regain of ab1 reactivity toward Nup98. Note that at this stage the signal generated by ab1 is weaker than in typical interphase cells. This might correlate with the observation that the permeability properties of NPCs are only fully established 2 hr after mitotic exit (Dultz et al., 2009Dultz, E., Huet, S., and Ellenberg, J. (2009).

https://openalex.org/W2109716976,"The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 is a constituent of several different protein complexes and is required for homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The most recently discovered BRCA1-RAP80 complex is recruited to ubiquitin structures on chromatin surrounding the break. Deficiency of any member of this complex confers hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents by undefined mechanisms. In striking contrast to other BRCA1-containing complexes that are known to promote HDR, we demonstrate that the BRCA1-RAP80 complex restricts end resection in S/G(2) phase of the cell cycle, thereby limiting HDR. RAP80 or BRCC36 deficiency resulted in elevated Mre11-CtIP-dependent 5' end resection with a concomitant increase in HDR mechanisms that rely on 3' single-stranded overhangs. We propose a model in which the BRCA1-RAP80 complex limits nuclease accessibility to DSBs, thus preventing excessive end resection and potentially deleterious homology-directed DSB repair mechanisms that can impair genome integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2068134926,"In the eukaryotic 26S proteasome, the 20S particle is regulated by six AAA ATPase subunits and, in archaea, by a homologous ring complex, PAN. To clarify the role of ATP in proteolysis, we studied how nucleotides bind to PAN. Although PAN has six identical subunits, it binds ATPs in pairs, and its subunits exhibit three conformational states with high, low, or no affinity for ATP. When PAN binds two ATPγS molecules or two ATPγS plus two ADP molecules, it is maximally active in binding protein substrates, associating with the 20S particle, and promoting 20S gate opening. However, binding of four ATPγS molecules reduces these functions. The 26S proteasome shows similar nucleotide dependence. These findings imply an ordered cyclical mechanism in which two ATPase subunits bind ATP simultaneously and dock into the 20S. These results can explain how these hexameric ATPases interact with and ""wobble"" on top of the heptameric 20S proteasome."

The microtubule (MT)–based motors driving these movements are kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, which use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate along MT tracks in plus-end (anterograde) and minus-end (retrograde) directions. Cytoplasmic dynein consists of a core processive dynein heavy chain (DHC) motor that interacts with a large assembly of accessory subunits and with dynactin, to drive most retrograde transport (Kardon and Vale, 2009Kardon J.R.

Biol. 2004; 14: R525-R537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). An important question in transport regulation is how motor activity is controlled in cells to achieve bidirectionality. Because Kinesin-1 and dynein are unidirectional motors, coordination could occur either by the alternating association/dissociation of motors of either polarity to/from cargo, which generates motor activation by cargo binding, by the modulation of activity of both types of motors that simultaneously bind to cargo, or by generation of opposing forces of simultaneously cargo-bound motors in a tug of war (TOW) (Gross, 2004Gross S.P. Hither and yon: a review of bi-directional microtubule-based transport.Phys. Biol. 2004; 1: R1-R11Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Welte, 2004Welte M.A. Bidirectional transport along microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R525-R537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that motor regulation by association/dissociation might be a generalized mechanism of transport regulation because motors can exist in inactive, unbound forms, and autoinhibition can be released by binding to cargo (Akhmanova and Hammer, 2010Akhmanova A. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Linking molecular motors to membrane cargo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Verhey and Hammond, 2009Verhey K.J. Hammond J.W. Traffic control: regulation of kinesin motors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there is evidence that certain neuronal cargoes in vitro or nonneuronal cargoes in vivo experience opposing TOW forces such that the total number of motors associated with cargo determines activity (Hendricks et al., 2010Hendricks A.G. Perlson E. Ross J.L. Schroeder 3rd, H.W. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Motor coordination via a tug-of-war mechanism drives bidirectional vesicle transport.Curr.

A. 2009; 106: 19381-19386Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, in coordination models of axonal transport, the extent of plus- and minus-end motor association with cargo and whether cargo association relates to changes in motor activity remain unclear. To test whether motor-cargo association modulates motor activity in axons and to build an in vivo model of bidirectional transport, it is imperative to characterize the steady-state composition of total motor assemblies on a single type of vesicular cargo and to relate this analysis to live movement data for the same cargo. Analyzing motor composition of cargo in vivo has been experimentally challenging because of the difficulty in isolating populations of a single type of cargo and the absence of quantitative methods to characterize motor composition on them. Biochemical purifications of heterogeneous membrane populations or of melanosomes have yielded estimates of cofractionating plus- and minus-end motors (Gross et al., 2002Gross S.P. Tuma M.C.

However, these represent indirect estimates of average levels of bound motors, because motor-cargo associations could vary from cargo to cargo and over time. Likewise, stall-force measurements have provided estimates of numbers of active motors (Kural et al., 2005Kural C. Kim H. Syed S. Goshima G. Gelfand V.I. Selvin P.R.

A. 2009; 106: 19381-19386Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether bidirectionality is dictated by the rapid association/dissociation of these active motors or whether these engaged motors represent a subgroup of a regulated but stable assembly of cargo-bound motors. Thus, the steady-state composition of motor assemblies on any single type of cargo remains undefined. To distinguish between regulatory versus association/dissociation models of bidirectional transport, we characterized the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles containing the cellular mammalian prion protein (PrPC). PrPC is a neuronally enriched glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)–anchored protein that follows the secretory pathway inside the lumen of vesicles toward the cell surface (Caughey et al., 2009Caughey B.

Bull. 2003; 66: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PrPC can convert to a pathogenic form called PrP-scrapie (PrPSc), which has been implicated in neurological disorders, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (Caughey et al., 2009Caughey B. Baron G.S. Chesebro B. Jeffrey M. Getting a grip on prions: oligomers, amyloids, and pathological membrane interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The function of PrPC is unclear, but evidence suggests that while it is at the cell surface it can interact with proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling (Malaga-Trillo et al., 2009Malaga-Trillo E.

Thus, trafficking of PrPC to the plasma membrane via an intact transport system might be relevant to PrPC function and for the initiation of neurodegenerative pathologic abnormalities. Although PrPC is transported in nerves (Butowt et al., 2006Butowt R. Abdelraheim S. Brown D.R. von Bartheld C.S.

A novel cellular prion protein isoform present in rapid anterograde axonal transport.Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 3639-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the mechanism of intracellular PrPC vesicular transport is unknown. Here, we developed assays to characterize relative motor subunit composition on individual PrPC vesicles and used live imaging to identify Kinesin-1C/KLC1 and DHC1 as the major axonal motor complexes driving PrPC vesicle transport. Live tracking and motor composition analyses demonstrate that opposing motors positively coordinate each other's activities independently of cargo-association mechanisms. This coordination mechanism requires the formation and vesicle association of an intact Kinesin-1 complex composed of heavy and light chains. Previous studies showed that mammalian and avian PrPC are transported along peripheral and central nervous system nerves in anterograde and retrograde directions (Borchelt et al., 1994Borchelt D.R.

A novel cellular prion protein isoform present in rapid anterograde axonal transport.Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 3639-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We confirmed these observations using a protein accumulation paradigm in mouse sciatic nerves (see Figures S1A and S1B available online). To characterize the intracellular transport of PrPC vesicles in live neurons, we tracked individual moving vesicles in 10-day-old cultured mouse hippocampal axons from neurons transfected with a YFP-PrPC fusion construct (Borchelt et al., 1996Borchelt D.R. Davis J. Fischer M. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Regard J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. et al.A vector for expressing foreign genes in the brains and hearts of transgenic mice.Genet. Anal. 1996; 13: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Figures S1C–S1E). We restricted analyses to axons at day 10 after plating, which have a largely uniform microtubule polarity with plus ends directed toward axonal termini and minus ends toward cell bodies (Baas et al., 1988Baas P.W. Deitch J.S. Black M.M. Banker G.A. Polarity orientation of microtubules in hippocampal neurons: uniformity in the axon and nonuniformity in the dendrite.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To quantify YFP-PrPC vesicular movement, we used a MATLAB-based custom particle tracking software (LAPTrack; G.F. Reis, G. Yang, L.S., S.B. Shah, J.T. Robinson, T.S. Hays, G. Danuser. L.S.B.G., unpublished data), to generate a comprehensive dataset of trajectories at a spatial and temporal resolution of 0.126 μm, and 10Hz, respectively. In wild-type neurons, YFP-PrPC vesicles moved in anterograde and retrograde directions, and a large percentage were stationary (Figures 1A and 1B ; Movie S1). The remaining vesicles reversed directions at a mean (± standard error of the mean [SEM]) frequency of 0.027 ± 0.004 switches/s. Vesicle trajectories were broken into segments, defined as uninterrupted periods of movement framed by pauses (Extended Experimental Procedures). Mean (± SEM) anterograde and retrograde segmental velocities were 0.85 ± 0.036 μm/s and 0.86 ± 0.06 μm/s (Figure 1C), respectively, similar to those reported for Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein in vitro (Howard, 2001Howard J. Mechanics of motor proteins and the cytoskeleton. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, Mazumdar et al., 1996Mazumdar M. Mikami A. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. In vitro motility from recombinant dynein heavy chain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analysis of segmental velocity distributions showed a wide range of anterograde and retrograde velocities that included maximal velocities of 2.8 and 2.6 μm/s, respectively (Figure 1D). Retrograde particles had shorter mean (± SEM) run lengths (4.8 ± 0.4 μm) than did anterograde ones (6.2 ± 0.5 μm), but paused as long and as frequently (Figures 1E–1G). These run lengths were longer than the 1–2 μm reported for Kinesin-1 and dynein in vitro (King et al., 2003King S.J. Brown C.L. Maier K.C. Quintyne N.J. Schroer T.A. Analysis of the dynein-dynactin interaction in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5089-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Thorn et al., 2000Thorn K.S. Ubersax J.A. Vale R.D. Engineering the processive run length of the kinesin motor.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, vesicles containing YFP-PrPC move bidirectionally en route to the synapse in primary hippocampal neurons with dynamics that are consistent with MT-dependent fast axonal transport mediated by kinesin and dynein motor proteins. To understand the mechanism of axonal transport of PrPC vesicles, we sought to identify the motor proteins moving these vesicles in axons. Because PrPC and Kinesin-1 are predominantly expressed in brain, we tested the hypothesis that Kinesin-1 is a PrPC vesicle motor protein. We first tested whether the KLC1 cargo-binding subunit associated biochemically with PrPC vesicles in floated membrane fractions (Figure 2A ). Using an antibody against KLC1 to pull down associated membrane components, we found that PrPC and KHC (as detected by an antibody that recognizes primarily Kinesin-1C) immunoprecipitated with KLC1, as did the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which was previously identified in a complex with KLC1 (Kamal et al., 2000Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Axonal transport of amyloid precursor protein is mediated by direct binding to the kinesin light chain subunit of kinesin-I.Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Because PrPC is in the vesicular lumen, the reverse immunoprecipitation experiment using PrPC antibodies to pull down KLC1 was not possible without breaking vesicular membranes. To further test whether Kinesin-1 subunits interact with PrPC vesicles, we imaged fixed hippocampal cell axons stained with antibodies against PrPC and KLC1, Kinesin-1C or Kinesin-1A. The fluorescent signal observed was punctate, suggesting that these proteins were localized to vesicular structures (Figure 2C). We observed significant colocalization between PrPC and KLC1 (58% ± 1.5% PrPC vesicles colocalized with KLC1; Nvesicles = 510), and PrPC and Kinesin-1C (35% ± 1.5% PrPC vesicles colocalized with Kinesin-1C; Nvesicles = 80), but not between PrPC and Kinesin-1A. Complete colocalization was not expected as Kinesin-1 also mediates transport of other cargoes, and because other kinesin motors might also transport PrPC vesicles in addition to Kinesin-1. To test whether cytoplasmic dynein transports PrPC vesicles, we quantified YFP-PrPC vesicle movement in hippocampal cells cotransfected with YFP-PrPC and with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mCherry construct targeted to reduce the amount of dynein heavy chain 1 (DHC1; referred to as DHC1 shRNA). Imaging was restricted to axons coexpressing YFP and mCherry markers. Using the live imaging assay, we found that 2 days after cotransfection, reduction of DHC1 (mRNA reduced by 80%–90%, protein reduced by 66%) (Figures S2A and S2B and Figures S5D and S5E), disrupted bidirectional YFP-PrPC vesicle transport, decreasing run lengths and increasing the frequency of pauses (Figures 2D and 2E). Mean segmental velocities remained unchanged (Figure S2C). To confirm DHC1 association with PrPC vesicles, we stained hippocampal axons and found that DHC1 partially colocalized with PrPC vesicles (43% ± 2.9% PrPC vesicles colocalized with DHC1; Nvesicles = 388) (Figure 2C). Thus, KLC1, Kinesin-1C, and DHC1, but not Kinesin-1A, associate with PrPC vesicles in vivo. The interaction between Kinesin-1 and PrPC is not a direct one because immunoisolations from vesicular fractions using a KLC1 antibody in the presence of detergent did not pull down PrPC (data not shown). Furthermore, disruptions of dynein inhibited bidirectional transport, indicating that dynein is required for normal retrograde movement and is involved in the activation of the plus-end anterograde transport of these vesicles. Previous work showed that either of two KLCs can form complexes with any of the three KHCs (Rahman et al., 1998Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. Two kinesin light chain genes in mice. Identification and characterization of the encoded proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown what combinations of KLC and KHC subunits interact in vivo to transport any cargo. Having shown that KLC1 and Kinesin-1C interact with PrPC vesicles, we next tested whether these physical interactions translated into functional transport requirements. Thus, we systematically reduced the function of each Kinesin-1 subunit and assayed for defects in PrPC vesicle transport. We tested KLC1 by analyzing YFP-PrPC vesicle transport in hippocampal cells from mice homozygous for a gene-targeted KLC1 deletion (referred to as KLC1−/− neurons) (Rahman et al., 1999Rahman A. Kamal A. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Defective kinesin heavy chain behavior in mouse kinesin light chain mutants.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested KLC2 in wild-type hippocampal neurons cotransfected with YFP-PrPC and a KLC2 shRNA-mCherry construct, which reduced KLC2 by ∼83% (referred to as KLC2 shRNA neurons) (Extended Experimental Procedures). Reducing the function of each KLC subunit caused a significantly decreased percentage of anterograde-moving vesicles and a higher frequency of stalled particles (Figures 3A and 3B ). Noticeably, the percentage of retrograde moving PrPC particles was also reduced in the absence of KLC1, suggesting that this subunit might be involved in promoting dynein-based movement. Observed and estimated run lengths were reduced in KLC1−/− and shRNA KLC2 axons, respectively (Figures 3C and 3D; Extended Experimental Procedures), and vesicles paused more often (Figures 3E). Given the pronounced reductions of bidirectional movement, mean segmental velocities were surprisingly largely unaffected in KLC mutants, with the exception of slight increases in KLC1−/− neurons contributed solely by the small number of reversing vesicles (Figures S3A–S3C ). Thus, KLC1 and KLC2 mediate anterograde transport of YFP-PrPC vesicles and also activate retrograde motility.Figure S3Differential Requirements of Kinesin-1 Subunits in the Intracellular Transport of YFP-PrPC and Synaptophysin-mCherry or Synaptophysin-YFP Vesicles, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) Anterograde and retrograde mean segmental velocities for (A) all moving YFP-PrPC vesicles (bi- and uni-directional), (B) YFP-PrPC vesicles moving uni-directionally (anterograde or retrograde), and (C) only YFP-PrPC vesicles reversing at least once during the duration of our recording.(D–F) Anterograde and retrograde mean segmental velocities of synaptophysina vesicles in (D) KLC mutants, (E) Kinesin-1A and Kinesin-1C mutants, and (F) Kinesin-1B mutants.

Prolyl hydroxylation at two sites within a central degradation domain promotes association of HIF-α with the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin E3 ligase and destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Asparaginyl hydroxylation blocks the recruitment of p300/CBP co-activators to a C-terminal activation domain in HIF-α. These hydroxylations are catalyzed by members of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) oxygenase family. Activity of the enzymes is suppressed by hypoxia, increasing both the abundance and activity of the HIF transcriptional complex. We have used hydroxy residue-specific antibodies to compare and contrast the regulation of each site of prolyl hydroxylation (Pro402, Pro564) with that of asparaginyl hydroxylation (Asn803) in human HIF-1α. Our findings reveal striking differences in the sensitivity of these hydroxylations to hypoxia and to different inhibitor types of 2-OG oxygenases. Hydroxylation at the three sites in endogenous human HIF-1α proteins was suppressed by hypoxia in the order Pro402 > Pro564 > Asn803. In contrast to some predictions from in vitro studies, prolyl hydroxylation was substantially more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation to inhibition by iron chelators and transition metal ions; studies of a range of different small molecule 2-OG analogues demonstrated the feasibility of selectively inhibiting either prolyl or asparaginyl hydroxylation within cells.

The HIF transcriptional complex binds DNA as an α/β heterodimer and is centrally involved in many homeostatic responses to hypoxia, including regulation of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, energy metabolism, and cell growth and survival pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Pouysségur J.

Human HIF-α exists as three isoforms, the two best characterized of which (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) each contain two sites of prolyl hydroxylation and a single site of asparaginyl hydroxylation.

Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar and 17Loenarz C. Schofield C.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This provides a dual control system whereby in the presence of oxygen HIF-α subunits are both inactivated and destroyed, whereas in hypoxia catalysis of these hydroxylations is suppressed, enabling HIF-α subunits to escape von Hippel-Lindau-mediated proteolysis, recruit co-activators, and form a productive transcriptional complex. This action of hypoxia can be partially mimicked by a number of agents that inhibit 2-OG oxygenases including iron chelators, transition metal ions, and small molecule 2-OG analogues. There is widespread interest in the possibility of developing HIF hydroxylase inhibitors that activate HIF pathways therapeutically in ischemic/hypoxic disease (18Myllyharju J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Fraisl P. Aragonés J. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev.

In understanding the regulation of the transcriptional response by hypoxia and its potential manipulation by such agents, it is therefore important to understand the extent to which prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-α are differentially inhibited by hypoxia and hydroxylase inhibitors. Several studies have characterized the in vitro kinetic properties of the PHDs and FIH using full-length or truncated recombinant proteins and have reported differences in kinetics with respect to oxygen, iron, and small molecule inhibitors. In some studies, a lower apparent Km for oxygen has been reported for FIH than the PHDs (21Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 22Koivunen P. Hirsilä M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However extrapolation from these studies is not straightforward. For instance, it has been shown that the apparent Km for oxygen can depend on the HIF-α polypeptide used as the prime substrate and no studies have used full-length HIF-α polypeptide (23Koivunen P. Hirsilä M. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28712-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Ehrismann D. Flashman E. Genn D.N. Mathioudakis N. Hewitson K.S. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of many known and postulated alternative substrates for FIH and the PHDs, together with difficulty in measuring concentrations of the enzymes in the relevant cellular compartments make it extremely difficult to predict, from these in vitro measurements, how oxygen availability might restrict catalysis in vivo. We have therefore developed methods employing hydroxy residue-specific antibodies to monitor the regulation of hydroxylation at all three sites in human HIF-1α. Previous studies using hydroxy residue-specific antibodies have described important differences in the regulation of the two sites of prolyl hydroxylation in HIF-1α (25Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Yen S.E. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) but to date there have been no studies of the differential regulation of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. Here we report the results of utilizing highly specific antibodies recognizing all three sites of hydroxylation in human HIF-1α to analyze patterns of hydroxylation of HIF-1α in cells. Our results reveal major differences in the regulation of HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by hypoxia and different classes of chemical inhibitors of these hydroxylases. Cells were cultured in DMEM (MCF7, HeLa, HT1080, and human skin fibroblasts) or RPMI 1640 (PC3, OVCAR-3, HepG2, and K562), each supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Stable RCC4 transfectants expressing vector alone (RCC4/VA, referred to here as RCC4) or functional VHL (RCC4/VHL) have been described (26Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C.

Chemicals were dissolved in DMSO and added directly to culture medium at final DMSO concentrations of ≤2%. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was from Frontier Scientific and dissolved in PBS. MG132 was from Enzo Life Sciences. Exposure time was 4–5 h. HIF-α proteins were expressed as GAL4 (residues 1–147) fusions using the IVTT kit (Promega). Plasmids expressing GAL4/HIF-1α residues 28–826 (wild-type or Pro402, Pro564, and Asn803 mutants), or GAL4/HIF-2α residues 19–870 were constructed from pcDNA3 using standard recombinant methods. Cells were seeded at 40% confluence in antibiotic-free medium for 16 h prior to transfection with siRNAs directed against Drosophila SIMA (dHIF) (31Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouvès A. Volmat V. Roux D.

Cells were harvested 24 h after the second transfection. Rabbit anti-HIF-1α Hyp402 was developed in collaboration with Millipore Biosciences (catalog number 07-1585). Mouse mAb against HIF-1α hydroxy-Asn803 was as described (33Lee S.H. Jeong Hee M. Eun, Ah C. Ryu S.E. Myung Kyu L. J. Biomol. Screen. 2008; 13: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Cells were lysed in urea/SDS buffer (6.7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 1% SDS) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce) were used to visualize immunoreactive species. Signal intensities were measured by densitometry using the AutoChemi System with Labworks 4.6 Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP Inc. USA). Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance Dunnett's post hoc test using SPSS statistics 17.0; differences were considered significant if p values were <0.05. Doxycycline-inducible PK-tagged wild-type or mutant HIF-1α transfectants were incubated with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h, either in the presence of the 2-OG oxygenase inhibitor DMOG (1 mm) for the same duration, or with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm) for the last 4 h. Following anti-PK immunoprecipitation, separation by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion of the isolated bands with trypsin and Glu-C, samples were analyzed on a C18 nano-AcquityTM UPLCTM column coupled to a Waters Q-TOF Tandem mass spectrometer (Milford, MA) in positive ESI mode as described previously (34Cockman M.E.

Data acquisition was performed in high-low collision energy switching mode (MSE). MS/MS data base searches were carried out using ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS version 2.2.5) and MASCOT (version 2.2) on an in-house server (CBRG, University of Oxford). Studies of animal and human tissues were approved by the Universität Erlangen institutional review board for the care of animal subjects and the United Kingdom Ethical Committee (number C02.216), respectively. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River; 200–300 g) were treated with carbon monoxide (CO, 0.1%) for 6 h to achieve a functional anemia. Animals were sacrificed and kidneys were harvested immediately and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Human tissues were obtained from renal and breast cancer patients at operation and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were mashed into a paste in a dry ice-chilled metal chamber and immediately homogenized in urea/SDS buffer. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min the supernatants were heat-denatured in sample buffer and used in immunoblotting. Protein contents were measured using the Detergent Compatible Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Initially we carried out a series of experiments to determine the specificity of antibodies for the detection of different hydroxylated HIF-α species. We first prepared HIF-α polypeptides that were wild-type, or contained mutations at each of the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation sites, as GAL4-HIF-α fusion proteins using an IVTT system. Reactions were performed in the presence of iron chelator DFO or iron supplement (FeCl2) to inhibit or promote hydroxylation, respectively. Results are shown in Fig. 1. Antibodies directed against epitopes that encompass each of the hydroxyproline residues in HIF-1α (Hyp402 and Hyp564) or the hydroxyasparaginyl residue (HyAsn803) showed strong reactivity to HIF-1α that was produced in the presence of FeCl2, but little or no reactivity to that produced in the presence of DFO, suggesting that each of these antibodies is highly specific for the hydroxylated form (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). The antibodies were also highly specific for HIF-1α versus HIF-2α (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3, and supplemental Fig. S1). Substitution at each site of hydroxylation in HIF-1α ablated reactivity of the relevant antibody, indicating that the antibodies were highly specific to each site; anti-Hyp402 did not react against Hyp564 and vice versa. To further verify the specificity for hydroxylated forms of HIF-1α in cells, we expressed HIF-1α polypeptides in cells at levels that enabled direct analysis of hydroxylation by mass spectrometry (MS) and analyzed aliquots of cell extract in parallel by hydroxy residue-specific immunoblotting and MS. Under normoxic conditions, cells were exposed to DMOG to inhibit hydroxylation, or MG132 to inhibit the proteasome and cause accumulation of hydroxylated HIF-1α. To simplify the semi-quantitative analysis of Hyp564 by MS, neighboring methionine residues (Met561 and Met568) were mutated to alanines. The results of a typical set of experiments are shown in Fig. 2. Comparison with MS analysis confirmed that each antibody manifested a high degree of hydroxy residue specificity, demonstrating the complete absence of activity against the unhydroxylated epitope and enabling an estimate of the efficiency of detection of the hydroxylated form. Because asparaginyl hydroxylation regulates the activity of HIF transcription, it is important to understand whether and to what extent HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation persists under conditions that induce HIF-1α protein levels. We therefore examined a series of different cell types exposed to different levels of hypoxia or DMOG; in the first instance cultures were exposed in parallel to 1% oxygen, or DMOG, or maintained under normoxic conditions. As expected, strong up-regulation of the HIF-1α protein levels was observed, reflecting inhibition of the HIF prolyl hydroxylation/degradation pathway. However, in 1% oxygen HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylation persisted in all these cell types, although to a variable extent (Fig. 3A). Results obtained following exposure to DMOG were markedly different (Fig. 3B); despite similar levels of up-regulated HIF-1α, exposure of cells to DMOG almost totally suppressed asparaginyl hydroxylation. To provide more quantitative data on the effect of 1% oxygen, different quantities of cell extracts from two cell types showing different responses (PC3 cells and HSF cells) were blotted for total and asparaginyl hydroxylated HIF-1α and signals were compared with a calibration standard provided by extracts from the cells treated with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and analyzed by MS (Fig. 3C). These experiments revealed that HIF-1α induced by 1% oxygen in HSF cells was >90% hydroxylated, whereas in PC3 cells the region was 50% hydroxylated. To further investigate the regulation of asparaginyl hydroxylation by hypoxia, cultures of cells were exposed either to 1 or 0.2% oxygen (Fig. 3D). These experiments demonstrated that the asparaginyl hydroxylation that persisted at 1% oxygen was strongly suppressed at 0.2% oxygen. Finally to determine whether asparaginyl hydroxylation might persist under conditions that induce HIF proteins in intact tissues, we studied HIF-1α from kidneys of rats that had been exposed to 0.1% carbon monoxide to create functional anemia and from a range of human tumor samples (Fig. 3E). These studies demonstrate the existence of substantial levels of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation under these pathophysiological conditions. The above experiments indicated that despite strong accumulation of HIF-1α in cells cultured in 1% oxygen, high levels of asparaginyl hydroxylation persisted. Because accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxia is mediated by suppression of prolyl hydroxylation, these results suggest the existence of differential sensitivity of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation to hypoxia in vivo. We therefore sought to compare the sensitivity of different prolyl and asparaginyl sites to graded hypoxia directly in their endogenous context. Prolyl-hydroxylated HIF is degraded by the VHL E3 ligase pathway, confounding comparison of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation in VHL competent cells. We therefore conducted experiments in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells, in which this pathway is inactive. Immunoblotting of RCC4 extracts revealed strong signals with each of the hydroxy residue-specific HIF-1α antibodies, indicating that both HIF prolyl and HIF asparaginyl hydroxylations proceed efficiently in the absence of VHL. To confirm this, we compared hydroxy residue-specific and total HIF-1α signals in these cells with those obtained from MS-quantified samples. Although the accuracy of this comparison was limited by the need to introduce substitutions in the region of Pro564 to simplify MS analysis, which slightly impaired epitope recognition at that site (data not shown), HIF-1α hydroxylation was estimated to be complete or close to complete at each of the three sites in normoxic RCC4 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Preliminary experiments established that the half-life of HIF-1α in RCC4 cells was in the region of 60 min (supplemental Fig. S3); hence exposure to graded hypoxia for 4 h should be sufficient to allow HIF hydroxylation to achieve a new steady-state. In further pilot experiments we observed that suppression of hydroxylation occurred more rapidly in cells cultured in Lumox culture dishes (35Doege K. Heine S. Jensen I. Jelkmann W. Metzen E. Blood. 2005; 106: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in which the cell monolayer is grown on a gas-permeable base, thereby minimizing gradients between the atmosphere and the monolayer and inaccuracies arising from release of oxygen dissolved in plasticware (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, Lumox dishes were used for these and all other experiments involving short-term severe hypoxia (≤0.1% oxygen for ≤4 h). Exposure of RCC4 cells to different levels of hypoxia had markedly different effects on each site of hydroxylation (Fig. 4, panels A and B). These experiments revealed that prolyl hydroxylation was more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation to hypoxia and that Hyp402 was more sensitive than Hyp564. Whereas 0.1% oxygen almost completely suppressed prolyl hydroxylation at both sites, asparaginyl hydroxylation remained in the region of 40%; at 0.5% oxygen, levels of hydroxylation were ∼50, 75, and 100% at Pro402, Pro564, and Asn803, respectively. In understanding the physiological signaling of hypoxia, an important question is whether the specific activities of HIF hydroxylases alter in adaptation to chronic hypoxia. One possibility that has been considered is that increased specific activity in hypoxia might provide an adaptive response that would reset oxygen sensitivity in long-term hypoxia. Because two of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, PHD2 and PHD3, are themselves transcriptional targets of HIF that are strikingly up-regulated in hypoxia (12Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23482-23491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), assays of the effects of long-term hypoxia on the specific activity of the hydroxylases are complicated by large changes in enzyme abundance. However, in VHL-defective RCC4 cells HIF is constitutively activated, thus limiting changes in PHD abundance, and simplifying the interpretation of changes in HIF hydroxylation. We therefore exposed RCC4 cells for periods of hypoxia up to 7 days and monitored changes in hydroxylation at all three sites. Cells were plated so that levels of confluence were similar at the time of harvest. Results are shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Under these conditions, total HIF-1α levels declined slightly in relationship to the β-actin normalization control during the course of the experiment. As predicted in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells, we did not observe induction of PHD protein levels that occurs normally as a consequence of HIF activation; over the 7-day period, levels of immunoreactive PHD and FIH enzymes were either unchanged or modestly reduced. After 8 h hypoxia (1% oxygen), there were clear reductions in the extent of prolyl hydroxylation but not asparaginyl hydroxylation. After continued exposure to hypoxia over 7 days, there was no evidence that suppression of prolyl hydroxylation was less, as might be expected with increased PHD activation; rather the extent of HIF hydroxylation was either unchanged or modestly reduced at all sites. These experiments therefore do not support the existence of major HIF-independent increases in the specific activity of the hydroxylases in response to chronic hypoxia over this period of time. We next measured the effects of reoxygenation on each hydroxylation site. RCC4 cells were exposed to severe hypoxia (0.1% oxygen for 4 h) and then re-exposed to ambient (21%) oxygen. The results (Fig. 5A) reveal that although hydroxylation at Asn803 and Pro564 was essentially complete within 1 min but this was not the case for Pro402 where a significant delay in hydroxylation was observed. To further analyze these differences, we returned to study the induction of HIF-1α by hypoxia in VHL-competent cells in more detail. In preliminary experiments we observed differences between cell types in the behavior of Pro402 and Pro564 during induction of HIF-1α by hypoxia. In some cell types, but not others, during short periods of hypoxic exposure, subs"

During development, a polarized epidermal sheet undergoes stratification and differentiation to produce the skin barrier. Through mechanisms that are poorly understood, the process involves actin dynamics, spindle reorientation and Notch signalling. To elucidate how epidermal embryogenesis is governed, we conditionally targeted serum response factor (Srf), a transcription factor that is essential for epidermal differentiation. Unexpectedly, previously ascribed causative defects are not responsible for profoundly perturbed embryonic epidermis. Seeking the mechanism for this, we identified actins and their regulators that were downregulated after ablation. Without Srf, cells exhibit a diminished cortical network and in mitosis, they fail to round up, features we recapitulate with low-dose actin inhibitors in vivo and shRNA-knockdown in vitro. Altered concomitantly are phosphorylated ERM and cortical myosin-IIA, shown in vitro to establish a rigid cortical actomyosin network and elicit critical shape changes. We provide a link between these features and Srf loss, and we show that the process is physiologically relevant in skin, as reflected by defects in spindle orientation, asymmetric cell divisions, stratification and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2124931400,"Activation of inflammatory gene expression by toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways involves the removal of gene repression complexes such as NCoR. Coronin 2A, a component of the NCoR complex, is now shown to mediate TLR-induced NCoR turnover and de-repression of inflammatory genes by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin. This work points to a role for an actin-dependent mechanism in the de-repression of TLR target genes that is regulated by phosphorylation and nuclear receptor signalling pathways to differentially control inflammatory responses. Activation of inflammatory gene expression by toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways involves the removal of gene repression complexes such as NCoR. Here, coronin 2A, a component of the NCoR complex, is shown to mediate TLR-induced NCoR turnover and de-repression of inflammatory genes by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as initiators of inflammation through their ability to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns and products of tissue damage1,2. Transcriptional activation of many TLR-responsive genes requires an initial de-repression step in which nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complexes are actively removed from the promoters of target genes to relieve basal repression3,4. Ligand-dependent SUMOylation of liver X receptors (LXRs) has been found to suppress TLR4-induced transcription potently by preventing the NCoR clearance step5,6,7, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we provide evidence that coronin 2A (CORO2A), a component of the NCoR complex of previously unknown function8,9, mediates TLR-induced NCoR turnover by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin. SUMOylated LXRs block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO2/SUMO3-interaction motif in CORO2A and preventing actin recruitment. Intriguingly, the LXR transrepression pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIγ (CaMKIIγ)-dependent phosphorylation of LXRs, leading to their deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP3 and release from CORO2A. These findings uncover a CORO2A–actin-dependent mechanism for the de-repression of inflammatory response genes that can be differentially regulated by phosphorylation and by nuclear receptor signalling pathways that control immunity and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2089488785,"Corneal cross-linking using riboflavin and ultraviolet-A (RFUVA) is a clinical treatment targeting the stroma in progressive keratoconus. The stroma contains keratocan, lumican, mimecan, and decorin, core proteins of major proteoglycans (PGs) that bind collagen fibrils, playing important roles in stromal transparency. Here, a model reaction system using purified, non-glycosylated PG core proteins in solution in vitro has been compared with reactions inside an intact cornea, ex vivo, revealing effects of RFUVA on interactions between PGs and collagen cross-linking. Irradiation with UVA and riboflavin cross-links collagen α and β chains into larger polymers. In addition, RFUVA cross-links PG core proteins, forming higher molecular weight polymers. When collagen type I is mixed with individual purified, non-glycosylated PG core proteins in solution in vitro and subjected to RFUVA, both keratocan and lumican strongly inhibit collagen cross-linking. However, mimecan and decorin do not inhibit but instead form cross-links with collagen, forming new high molecular weight polymers. In contrast, corneal glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, in isolation from their core proteins, are not cross-linked by RFUVA and do not form cross-links with collagen. Significantly, when RFUVA is conducted on intact corneas ex vivo, both keratocan and lumican, in their natively glycosylated form, do form cross-links with collagen. Thus, RFUVA causes cross-linking of collagen molecules among themselves and PG core proteins among themselves, together with limited linkages between collagen and keratocan, lumican, mimecan, and decorin. RFUVA as a diagnostic tool reveals that keratocan and lumican core proteins interact with collagen very differently than do mimecan and decorin."
https://openalex.org/W2018917075,"Aneuploidy is common in human tumours and is often indicative of aggressive disease. Aneuploidy can result from cytokinesis failure, which produces binucleate cells that generate aneuploid offspring with subsequent divisions. In cancers, disruption of cytokinesis is known to result from genetic perturbations to mitotic pathways or checkpoints. Here we describe a non-genetic mechanism of cytokinesis failure that occurs as a direct result of cell-in-cell formation by entosis. Live cells internalized by entosis, which can persist through the cell cycle of host cells, disrupt formation of the contractile ring during host cell division. As a result, cytokinesis frequently fails, generating binucleate cells that produce aneuploid cell lineages. In human breast tumours, multinucleation is associated with cell-in-cell structures. These data define a previously unknown mechanism of cytokinesis failure and aneuploid cell formation that operates in human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2091960020,"Cell growth can be suppressed by stressful environments, but the role of stress pathways in this process is largely unknown. Here we show that a cascade of p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38-regulated/activated kinase (PRAK) plays a role in energy-starvation-induced suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and that energy starvation activates the p38β-PRAK cascade. Depletion of p38β or PRAK diminishes the suppression of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and reduction of cell size induced by energy starvation. We show that p38β-PRAK operates independently of the known mTORC1 inactivation pathways--phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2) and Raptor by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)--and surprisingly, that PRAK directly regulates Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a key component of the mTORC1 pathway, by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Rheb at Ser 130 by PRAK impairs the nucleotide-binding ability of Rheb and inhibits Rheb-mediated mTORC1 activation.

Binding of IL-17 to its receptor leads to recruitment of adaptor protein CIKS/Act1 via heterotypic association of their respective SEFIR domains and activation of transcription factor NF-κB; it is not known whether CIKS and/or NF-κB are required for all gene induction events. Here we report that CIKS is essential for all IL-17-induced immediate-early genes in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts, whereas NF-κB is profoundly involved. We also identify a novel subdomain in the N terminus of CIKS that is essential for IL-17-mediated NF-κB activation. This domain is both necessary and sufficient for interaction between CIKS and TRAF6, an adaptor required for NF-κB activation. The ability of decoy peptides to block this interaction may provide a new therapeutic strategy for intervention in IL-17-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

The discovery of the inflammatory T helper cell type-17 (Th17), a subset distinct from the classical Th1 and Th2 populations, has revolutionized our understanding of T-cell mediated immunity (1Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 2Weaver C.T. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Harrington L.E. Annu. Rev.

Th17 cells are critical in host defense against many pathogens, in particular extracellular bacteria and fungi. When improperly controlled, however, Th17 responses can also feature prominently in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis (reviewed in Refs. 4Annunziato F.

Med. 2009; 361: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The discovery of the Th17 cell type has also focused attention on its signature cytokine IL-17 (also known as IL-17A). A critical, although by no means exclusive biologic corollary of IL-17 expression is the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (7Korn T. Bettelli E. Oukka M. Kuchroo V.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 485-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (3859) Google Scholar, 8Xu S. Cao X. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2010; 7: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). IL-17A is a member of a family of cytokines that also includes IL-17B, -C, -D, -E (also known as IL-25), and -F. IL-17A signals via a receptor composed of the IL-17RA and RC chains; these receptor chains are members of a family that also includes RB, RD, and RE (reviewed by Ref. 9Gaffen S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). All receptor polypeptides encode a so-called SEFIR domain (similar expression to fibroblast growth factor genes and IL-17Rs) in their cytoplasmic tails (10Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2008; 43: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 11Novatchkova M. Leibbrandt A. Werzowa J. Neubüser A. Eisenhaber F. Trends Biochem.

Such a domain is also present on the adaptor protein CIKS 2The abbreviations used are: CIKS, connection to IκB kinase and stress-activated protein kinases; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; IP, immunoprecipitate; AA, amino acid; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

IL-17A and -F, as well as IL-25 have been shown to signal by recruitment of CIKS to their cognate receptors, mediated via heterotypic SEFIR domain associations (14Chang S.H. Park H. Dong C. J. Biol.

A number of downstream effectors can be activated by IL-17, the best studied member of this cytokine family, including the transcription factors NF-κB, C/EBP, and AP-1, as well as MAP kinases; in addition, IL-17 can potently stabilize mRNAs, although mechanisms remain to be discovered (reviewed by Ref. 9Gaffen S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mere overexpression of CIKS profoundly activates p50/p65 NF-κB complexes via the classical activation pathway (12Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Li X. Commane M. Nie H. Hua X. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wald D. Haag M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 2003; 309: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By contrast, stimulation of cells with IL-17, which signals via CIKS, activates NF-κB quite weakly (15Qian Y. Liu C. Hartupee J. Altuntas C.Z. Gulen M.F. Jane-Wit D. Xiao J. Lu Y. Giltiay N. Liu J. Kordula T. Zhang Q.W. Vallance B. Swaidani S. Aronica M. Tuohy V.K. Hamilton T. Li X. Nat.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 5337-5344PubMed Google Scholar), calling into question the physiologic significance of NF-κB activation. Indeed, IL-17 can synergize with TNFα, which has been ascribed to the fact that TNFα, unlike IL-17, strongly activates NF-κB, whereas IL-17 stabilizes some short-lived mRNAs induced by TNFα (20Hartupee J. Liu C. Novotny M. Li X. Hamilton T. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This in turn has fostered the notion that mRNA stabilization may be a primary function of IL-17. Another unsettled question concerning IL-17 signaling is whether the CIKS adaptor is essential for expression of all target genes, especially since some reports suggest the possibility of CIKS-independent signaling events (15Qian Y. Liu C. Hartupee J. Altuntas C.Z. Gulen M.F. Jane-Wit D. Xiao J. Lu Y. Giltiay N. Liu J. Kordula T. Zhang Q.W. Vallance B. Swaidani S. Aronica M. Tuohy V.K. Hamilton T. Li X. Nat.

Signal. 2009; 2: ra8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Precisely how CIKS transmits signals to its downstream effectors, including NF-κB, is only beginning to be elucidated. Recently a central domain of CIKS has been reported to function as an E3-ubiqutin ligase, capable of adding Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains to the adaptor protein TRAF6 (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TRAF6 have previously been found essential for IL-17/CIKS-mediated activation of NF-κB (14Chang S.H. Park H. Dong C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35603-35607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Qian Y. Liu C. Hartupee J. Altuntas C.Z. Gulen M.F. Jane-Wit D. Xiao J. Lu Y. Giltiay N. Liu J.

Suzuki H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The E3-ubiquitin ligase function was also reported necessary for mRNA stabilization, but in this case via a TRAF6 independent mechanism (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Hartupee J. Liu C. Novotny M. Sun D. Li X. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of TRAF6 is secondary to recruitment to CIKS, and CIKS reportedly encodes two TRAF6 binding sites; these sites may be redundant because signaling was only impaired when both sites on CIKS were rendered non-functional through mutagenesis (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Kanamori M. Kai C. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Once polyubiquitinated by CIKS, the TRAF6 adaptor may activate NF-κB via mechanisms already established for signaling by Toll, IL-1, and CD40 receptors, i.e. by activation of Tak1 and IKK (9Gaffen S.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 26Li X. Cytokine. 2008; 41: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we investigate initial transcriptional responses of IL-17 and its molecular signaling mechanisms with the use of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. We demonstrate that CIKS is absolutely essential for all initial IL-17-induced transcription and we, furthermore, show that classical activation of NF-κB is especially critical for these responses. We also identify a novel domain in the N terminus of CIKS that is required for interaction with TRAF6 and activation of NF-κB. We discuss these findings in terms or their potential to open new avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases dependent on IL-17 cytokines. Primary mouse embryo fibroblast cultures (MEFs) were established from wild-type (WT) and CIKS-deficient (knockout) mice as described previously (16Claudio E. Sønder S.U. Saret S. Carvalho G. Ramalingam T.R. Wynn T.A. Chariot A. Garcia-Perganeda A. Leonardi A. Paun A. Chen A. Ren N.Y. Wang H. Siebenlist U. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 1617-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mice were bred and housed in National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facilities, and all experiments were done with approval of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with all relevant institutional guidelines. Immortalized NEMO-deficient MEFs were kindly donated by Dr. Manolis Pasparakis. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma; SB203580, JNK inhibitor II, JAK inhibitor I, and PD98059 were from Calbiochem; and MLN120b was kindly supplied by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. FITC-tagged cell penetrating peptides, TAT wild-type CIKS, GRKKRRQRRRPPQMNRSIPVEVDESEPYP, and TAT E17A CIKS, GRKKRRQRRRPPQMNRSIPVAVDESEPYP, were purchased from American Peptide. MEFs were treated for 30 min with these peptides in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. Uptake of FITC-labeled cell penetrating peptide was confirmed by FACS analysis. Recombinant IL-17 (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and/or TNFα (2 ng/ml, Peprotech) were used for stimulation. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) and SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Expression of Iκbζ, Ccl2, c/Ebpδ, Zc3h12a, Il-6, Cxc1, and β-actin was quantified by TaqMan qPCR using primers from Applied Biosystems. All gene expression results are expressed as 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = (Ct,target − Ct,β-actin) for stimulated samples − (Ct,target − Ct,β-actin) for unstimulated controls. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. For the mRNA stability experiment, expression of Cxcl1 was calculated as 2−ΔCt, where ΔCt = (Ct,Cxcl1 − Ct,β-actin). Expression at 0 h was set to 100% and the remaining samples were normalized accordingly. RNAs were extracted and DNA microarray targets were prepared as described previously (27Shea P.R. Virtaneva K.

An analysis of variance was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek, Inc., St. Louis, MO, version 6.3 6080414) to obtain multiple test corrected p values using the false discovery rate method at the 0.05 significance level combined with a fold-change value of 1.5.

Whole cell extracts were isolated, loaded on to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to PVDF (Millipore) membranes. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (Sigma); anti-HA, anti-TRAF6, anti-β-actin, and anti-IκBα (all from Santa Cruz); and anti-NF-κB p65, anti-phospho-Ser536 NF-κB p65, anti-ERK, and anti-phospho-ERK (all from Cell Signaling).

Full-length human CIKS and CIKS deletion/point mutants were cloned into a Gateway Entry vector (Invitrogen) and subcloned into a lentiviral vector or into pcDNA3.1 HA or FLAG Tag destination vectors by Gateway LR recombination using the manufacturer's protocols to generate expression clones. In these vectors the standard cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced by the PolII promoter to ensure low level constitutive expression, with the exception of the vectors used in Fig. 2A and the IL-17RA vector used in Fig. 4B. The TRAF6 expression vector has been described previously (31Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol.

Lentivirus preparations used for transduction of wild-type and mutant CIKS proteins into CIKS-deficient primary MEFs were generated with the ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.FIGURE 4The N-terminal domain of CIKS is essential for interaction with TRAF6, but not for interaction with self or with IL-17RA.

Cell lysates were IP to evaluate association of co-expressed CIKS proteins in immunoblots (IB) as indicated. B, FLAG-tagged wild-type or one of several mutant CIKS constructs were co-transfected together with HA-tagged IL-17RA.

Analyses shown in A and B are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Whole cell extracts were isolated 48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were carried out using IP kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. For luciferase assays, HeLa cells were co-transfected with the IgκB Luc reporter as described previously (18Mauro C. Vito P. Mellone S. Pacifico F. Chariot A. Formisano S. Leonardi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined 24 h later using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to an ER Renilla internal control (Promega). To understand the significance of NF-κB and CIKS in the cellular response to IL-17 we made use of freshly isolated primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. We first re-examined whether and, if so, to what extent this cytokine can activate NF-κB in primary, freshly isolated, wild-type or CIKS-deficient MEFs. IL-17 induced the degradation of IκBα in wild-type cells, albeit much less so than TNFα, and only TNFα, not IL-17 was able to do so in CIKS-deficient cells (Fig. 1A). Thus IL-17 was able to liberate NF-κB in a CIKS-dependent manner in primary cells. The transcriptional activity of the dimeric NF-κB complexes in the nucleus is also determined by phosphorylation, especially of p65/RelA. Various potential phosphorylation sites have been reported for p65; their occurrence, relative significance, and precise function are not fully understood and appear to be context-dependent (32Neumann M. Naumann M. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2642-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Perkins N.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6717-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Here we show that both IL-17 and TNFα were able to induce phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 in wild-type MEFs, which was fully dependent on CIKS in the case of IL-17 but not TNFα, as expected. No synergistic effect was observed when stimulating with both IL-17 and TNFα (Fig. 1B). To further explore the role of NF-κB and CIKS in the transcriptional response to IL-17 in primary MEFs, we first performed a genome-wide microarray analysis to identify genes that were significantly induced by IL-17 within 2 h (see supplemental Fig. S1 for full results). After applying stringent criteria to the results from 6 independently performed experiments, we identified 9 such genes in primary wild-type MEFs; by contrast, IL-17 failed to induce any genes in CIKS-deficient MEFs. These results were confirmed with qPCR analyses (supplemental Fig. S1C). A set of 9 genes encodes for chemokines Cxcl1, Ccl2, and Ccl7, the cytokines Lif and Il-6, transcription factors Iκbζ, c/Ebpδ, and RelB, and RNA-binding protein Zc3hl2a; most of these genes have been identified previously in various screens for IL-17-induced genes (21Huang F. Kao C.Y. Wachi S. Thai P. Ryu J. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6504-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 34Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), although Zc3h12a has been noted only once in a recent screen of liver cells (36Sparna T. Rétey J. Schmich K. Albrecht U. Naumann K. Gretz N. Fischer H.P. Bode J.G. Merfort I. BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas RelB has never been identified previously. Whereas Iκbζ, c/Ebpδ, and Zc3h12a were induced only with IL-17, not TNFα, the remaining genes were induced with either cytokine and are all known potential targets of NF-κB (37Ueda A. Okuda K.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Within the latter group, Cxcl1, Lif, and Il-6 appeared to be synergistically induced by the two cytokines, which may be due to post-transcriptional regulation (20Hartupee J. Liu C. Novotny M. Li X. Hamilton T. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40Schluns K.S. Cook J.E. Le P.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2704-2712PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the early time point after stimulation chosen in our analyses, Il-6 and c/Ebpδ are not immediate-early genes; they have previously been reported to depend on induced expression of IκBζ, and their peak of expression occurred well after 2 h (41Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Chem. 2008; 283: 32404-32411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental Fig. S2A). We conclude that CIKS is essential for expression of all IL-17-induced genes in primary MEFs within 2 h. The expression profiling study also identified immediate-early targets of IL-17 in primary cells that could be investigated further for their dependence on NF-κB. To address what downstream effectors may contribute to immediate-early IL-17-induced gene expression, we pre-treated primary wild-type MEFs with inhibitors for NF-κB, JAK, and MAP kinases p38, JNK, and ERK prior to stimulation with IL-17. Induced expression of immediate-early genes Cxcl1, Ccl2 and, to a lesser extent Iκbζ and Zc3h12a, was dependent on NF-κB, but was not significantly dependent on p38, JNK, JAK, or ERK (Fig. 1C, see also supplemental Fig. S2B). To verify the role of NF-κB, we also investigated the IL-17-induced expression of the above genes in NEMO-deficient MEFs, as the classical NF-κB activation pathway is completely abrogated in these cells. Consistent with the inhibitor studies, Ccl2 and Cxcl1 failed to be induced in the absence of NEMO, whereas induced expression of Iκbζ and Zc3h12a was significantly decreased, albeit not abolished (Fig. 1D). We conclude that NF-κB is critically involved in the IL-17-induced expression of immediate-early genes, albeit to a variable degree. To identify novel domains within CIKS critical for activation of NF-κB we generated and initially screened a number of CIKS mutants by assessing their ability to induce expression from an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid upon overexpression in HeLa cells (18Mauro C.

Commun. 2003; 309: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or the central region (Δ200–400), which carries the E3 ubiquitin-ligase domain (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), significantly reduced the ability of exogenously introduced CIKS to activate NF-κB (Fig. 2A). By contrast, deletion of one of the two purported TRAF6 binding sites on CIKS (Δ38–42) had no effect on NF-κB activation (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of the N-terminal 50 amino acids (ΔN50) completely abolished NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). We therefore generated additional mutants to identify sequences within the N terminus that may be required for NF-κB activation. Deletion of amino acids 1–35 (Δ1–35), 1–15 (Δ1–15), and 10–25 (Δ10–25) all completely eliminated the ability of overexpressed CIKS to activate NF-κB (numbering is based on the longer of the two human CIKS isoforms; the shorter isoform starts at position 10, but is otherwise identical) (Fig. 2B). Deletion of amino acids 20–35 (Δ20–35) resulted in partial impairment of CIKS to activate NF-κB, whereas deletion of amino acids 35–50 (Δ35–50), which contains a site previously thought to bind TRAF6 (23Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Kanamori M. Kai C. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) failed to impair this CIKS function. This suggested that a previously unknown N-terminal domain, most likely contained between positions 10 and 25, was crucial for activation of NF-κB. A comparison of CIKS sequences from various species showed a remarkable conservation of amino acids in the interval between positions 10 and 21; there is little or no conservation elsewhere in the larger N-terminal region of CIKS when more divergent species are compared (Fig. 2C). To further delimit the critical sequences, we generated four point mutations in the domain between positions 10 and 21, replacing Ser13, Val16, Glu17, or Asp19 with Ala (S13A, V16A, E17A and D19A); in addition we generated a combined mutant in which all four positions were replaced (“Quad”). As shown in Fig. 2D, the E17A mutation completely abrogated the ability of CIKS to activate NF-κB and the D19A mutation partially interfered, whereas the S13A and V16A mutations had no significant effect in this assay. Consistent with this, the Quad mutation completely blocked CIKS from activating NF-κB as well. We conclude that the N terminus of CIKS harbors a previously unidentified domain likely located between amino acid positions 10 and 21 that is required for activation of NF-κB in CIKS-transfected cells. To understand the importance of this newly identified N-terminal domain in a physiologic context, we employed a lentivirus transduction strategy to reconstitute CIKS-deficient primary MEFs with minimal levels of wild-type and mutant CIKS proteins (Δ10–25, E17A, and ΔN50), or with a GFP control, and then assayed for responses to stimulation with IL-17. We first tested for IL-17-induced expression of the immediate-early target test genes investigated above: Iκbζ, Zc3h12a, Cxcl1, and Ccl2. Reconstitution with the ΔN50, Δ10–25, and E17A CIKS mutants significantly impaired induction of Cxcl1, Ccl2, and Zc3h12a, and to a lesser extent Iκbζ, when compared with cells reconstituted with wild-type CIKS (Fig. 3, A and B) (see supplemental Fig. S2C for Il-6 and c/Ebpδ). To directly evaluate the ability of IL-17 to activate NF-κB in the primary MEFs reconstituted with the wild-type and CIKS mutants shown above (Fig. 3, A and B), we measured IL-17-induced degradation of IκBα. As shown in Fig. 3C, only CIKS-deficient MEFs reconstituted with wild-type CIKS were able to degrade IκBα in response to IL-17, whereas those reconstituted with CIKS mutants that crippled the critical N-terminal domain failed to respond to IL-17, as did those reconstituted with GFP only. Together these data demonstrate that the newly identified N-terminal CIKS domain is essential for IL-17-induced degradation of IκBα and thus for activation of NF-κB-dependent target genes. The ability of the N-terminal mutants to partially restore induced expression of, in particular, Iκbζ,"

However, existing gene delivery techniques do not allow researchers to electrophysiologically characterize cells and to thereby establish an experimental link between physiology and genetics for understanding neuronal function. In the mouse brain in vivo, we found that neurons remained intact after 'blind' whole-cell recording, that DNA vectors could be delivered through the patch-pipette during such recordings and that these vectors drove protein expression in recorded cells for at least 7 d. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we recorded visually evoked synaptic responses in primary visual cortical cells while delivering DNA plasmids that allowed retrograde, monosynaptic tracing of each neuron's presynaptic inputs. By providing a biophysical profile of a cell before its specific genetic perturbation, this combinatorial method captures the synaptic and anatomical receptive field of a neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2028586759,"<h2>Summary</h2> TAp63α, a homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor, is a quality control factor in the female germline. Remarkably, already undamaged oocytes express high levels of the protein, suggesting that TAp63α's activity is under tight control of an inhibitory mechanism. Biochemical studies have proposed that inhibition requires the C-terminal transactivation inhibitory domain. However, the structural mechanism of TAp63α inhibition remains unknown. Here, we show that TAp63α is kept in an inactive dimeric state. We reveal that relief of inhibition leads to tetramer formation with ∼20-fold higher DNA affinity. In vivo, phosphorylation-triggered tetramerization of TAp63α is not reversible by dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that a helix in the oligomerization domain of p63 is crucial for tetramer stabilization and competes with the transactivation domain for the same binding site. Our results demonstrate how TAp63α is inhibited by complex domain-domain interactions that provide the basis for regulating quality control in oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2026765958,"APC/C-Cdc20 ubiquitylates different substrates at distinct times during the cell cycle. This substrate specificity is now shown to depend on the differential binding of Cdc20 to APC subunits in response to the state of activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Progress through mitosis requires that the right protein be degraded at the right time. One ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) targets most of the crucial mitotic regulators by changing its substrate specificity throughout mitosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) acts on the APC/C co-activator, Cdc20 (cell division cycle 20), to block the degradation of metaphase substrates (for example, cyclin B1 and securin), but not others (for example, cyclin A). How this is achieved is unclear. Here we show that Cdc20 binds to different sites on the APC/C depending on the SAC. Cdc20 requires APC3 and APC8 to bind and activate the APC/C when the SAC is satisfied, but requires only APC8 to bind the APC/C when the SAC is active. Moreover, APC10 is crucial for the destruction of cyclin B1 and securin, but not cyclin A. We conclude that the SAC causes Cdc20 to bind to different sites on the APC/C and this alters APC/C substrate specificity."

Although MMPs in general are differentially regulated, promoters of most MMPs contain binding sites for both AP-1 and polyoma enhancer A-binding protein (PEA) 3. Furthermore, cooperation between both nuclear factors seems to be essential for the transcriptional activation of those MMPs (29Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E.

In the present work, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of DDR expression and to identify DDR-associated signaling pathways and transcriptional targets. Our results show a novel mechanism by which collagen I is able to induce DDR1 and MMP-10 expression through integrin independent activation of DDR2 in primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs). Furthermore, we show that collagen I-induced DDR1 gene expression requires recruitment of phospho-JAK2 to DDR2 and ERK1/2 activation and involves the recruitment of the nuclear factor PEA3 to the DDR1 promoter. NHLFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. DDR-overexpressing HEK293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.25 mg/ml geneticin (all reagents from Invitrogen). DDR-overexpressing HEK293 cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Sigma-Aldrich) and allowed to attach overnight in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Prior to treatment, the cells were starved overnight with medium containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were stimulated with collagen I from rat tail (25 μg/ml) or collagen IV from human placenta (25 μg/ml) (both from Sigma-Aldrich). Dose-dependent experiments were performed with collagen I or IV in a concentration range of 5–100 μg/ml. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated for 1 h prior to treatment with neutralizing anti-β1-integrin antibody (10 μg/ml; Millipore), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm), the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm), the JAK inhibitor AG409 (25 μm) (all reagents from Calbiochem), or AMN107 (1 μm). The generation of DDR1 and DDR2-overexpressing cells has been described (31Day E. Waters B. Spiegel K. Alnadaf T. Manley P.W. Buchdunger E. Walker C. Jarai G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 599: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length cDNAs encoding DDR1a, DDR1b, and DDR2 in pENTR/d-TOPO vectors were transferred into pcDNA-DEST40 using LR recombination reactions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and the resulting recombinant constructs used for the transfection of HEK293 cells. 48 h after transfection, geneticin was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Single cell clones were isolated by cell sorting into 96-well plates using a MoFlo cell sorter and characterized for DDR expression using real time quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and FACS analysis. RNA from NHLFs or DDR-overexpressing HEK293 cells was extracted using RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse transcription, 100 ng of total RNA was added to 50 μl of reaction buffer containing RT-PCR buffer, MgCl2 (5.5 mm), desoxyribonucleoside triphosphate mixture (500 μm), random hexamers (2.5 μm), RNase inhibitors (0.4 unit/μl), and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (1.25 units/μl) (all of the reagents were from Applied Biosystems) and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C followed by 30 min at 48 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. Real time PCR was performed using TaqMan system 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes and primers used for the reaction are provided in Table 1. For real time quantitative RT-PCR, 1 μl of cDNA was added to a total volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer containing TaqMan Fast Universal master mix (Applied Biosystems), TaqMan probes (0.3 μm), and forward and reverse primers (0.9 μm). PCR was performed by denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 20 s. The expression changes (fold increases) were calculated relative to unstimulated control cells using the crossing points of the log linear portion of the amplification curve after normalizing with GAPDH endogenous control (VIC/MGB) (Applied Biosystems).

The sequence of DDR2 siRNA is as follows: 5′-GCACUGUCAGUUACACCAATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUGGUGUAACUGACAGUGCGT-3′ (antisense). JAK2- and ERK1/2-specific siRNAs were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. For siRNA delivery, NHLFs were reverse transfected with 10 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were starved for 24 h prior to treatment with collagen I (25 μg/ml) or vehicle (AcH, 0.1 m). NHLFs collected by EDTA treatment were washed in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-DDR1 antibody or isotype control biotinylated normal goat IgG (both from R & D Systems) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing 1% BSA, the cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (R & D Systems) for another 1 h at 4 °C. The data were acquired on FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software. NHLFs or DDR-overexpressing HEK293 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate acid, 0.1% SDS, proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were denaturated at 94 °C in 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. 20 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–10% Bis-Tris (MOPS) NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. Immunodetection was carried out using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (T185+Y187) (Invitrogen), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-phospho-JAK2 (Y1007/Y1008) (Abcam), anti-JAK2 (Santa Cruz), anti-DDR1 (R & D Systems), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz). The bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using anti-DDR2 (R & D Systems). Immunocomplexes were collected with 100 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein was extracted by 5 min of incubation in 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 94 °C prior to Western blot analysis. Densitometry of bands was performed using Image J. The concentration of MMP-10 in NHLFs culture supernatants was determined by MMP-10 Quantikine ELISA (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the treatment of NHLFs cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed by using the ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C using 10 μl of anti-PEA3 (Abcam), anti-c-Fos (Abcam), and anti-c-Jun (Active Motif) antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with magnetic beads for 1 h. DNA cross-links of the immune complexes were reverted by heating followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA isolated from an aliquot of the total nuclear extract was used as a loading control for the PCR (input control). PCR was performed with total DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA using the following promoter-specific primers, DDR1 promoter-binding site for PEA3: 5′-TGTTCTTACTTCCTGGTGCTTCTCT-3′ (forward), 5′-AATTAAAAATGCACATCCTCTTCGA-3′ (reverse), and 6-FAM-TCGAGGGAATGCTGG-MGB (TaqMan probe) (67 bp); DDR1 promoter-binding site for AP-1: 5′-GGCCCATTCTGTCTGTTGCT-3′ (forward), 5′-TGGGTGGTGCGTAAGTTAATCA-3′ (reverse), and 6-FAM-AGCTATGACTCAGTCCC-MGB (TaqMan Probe) (63 bp); MMP-10 promoter-binding site for PEA3: 5′-TGTAAACAAGGACTCAAGAAGTGAAATAT-3′ (forward), 5′-TAGGTCAACGGAAATAAATTCCAAA-3′ (reverse), and 6-FAM-ATATCTTTGTAAATAACAACTCCCAC-MGB (TaqMan Probe) (106 bp); and MMP-10 promoter-binding site for AP-1: 5′-AATACTGATGTAGGCTGTATCACCATTAC-3′ (forward), 5′-ATCACCAACAGTATGATTCATGCA-3′ (reverse), and 6-FAM-CATTCAGACTTAAAAAACAC-MGB (TaqMan Probe) (90 bp). The PCR products (10 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. The data were expressed as the means ± S.D. of nine or more independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey test. Significance was set as p < 0.05. To determine whether collagen can induce the expression of DDR1 or DDR2 in NHLFs, we stimulated NHLFs with two structurally different collagens, fibrillar collagen I or network-forming collagen IV, for 16 h. Collagen I induced DDR1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner reaching maximal expression with 25 μg/ml (Fig. 1A), whereas constitutive DDR2 mRNA expression was not increased by collagen I (Fig. 1B). In contrast, network-forming collagen IV was unable to induce either DDR1 or DDR2 mRNA expression. Because DDR2 is not able to recognize collagen IV, whereas DDR1 can recognize both collagen I and collagen IV (3Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol.

Collagen I-induced DDR1 protein expression was then assessed using flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, the percentage of positive NHLFs expressing DDR1 on the cell surface increased significantly after 16 h of collagen I stimulation. To identify which of the five DDR1 isoforms generated by alternative splicing was responsible for the observed response, we first determined which isoforms were expressed in NHLFs. Real time quantitative RT-PCR performed using RNA isolated from untreated NHLFs showed that only the DDR1a and DDR1b isoforms were expressed (Fig. 1D). We then tested which of these two isoforms was induced by collagen I and showed that collagen I was able to induce mRNA expression of both isoforms in a time-dependent manner with maximal expression after 16 h (Fig. 1E). Collagen I has been shown to induce the expression of several genes including pro-inflammatory and fibro-proliferative factors as well as matrix-degrading enzymes in DDR1- and DDR2-overexpressing human fibrosarcoma cells and mouse fibroblasts (24Faraci E. Eck M. Gerstmayer B. Bosio A. Vogel W.F. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We examined a selection of these profibrotic factors to determine whether they were induced by collagen I in NHLFs. Our data demonstrated that MCP-1, BMP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-10 expression was induced in NHLFs in a time-dependent manner reaching maximum expression after 16 h of collagen I stimulation (Fig. 2, A–D), whereas the mRNA expression of the pro-fibrotic factors BMP-5 and MMP-9 was not increased upon collagen I stimulation (Fig. 2, E and F). To elucidate whether the induction of DDR1 and MMP-10 by collagen I was mediated by integrins or DDRs, NHLFs were preincubated with the neutralizing anti-β1 integrin antibody (32Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AMN107 (nilotinib) prior to collagen I stimulation. AMN107 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson kinase, and earlier work in our laboratory has shown that it is also a very potent inhibitor of DDR activation (31Day E. Waters B. Spiegel K. Alnadaf T. Manley P.W. Buchdunger E. Walker C. Jarai G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 599: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our data showed that collagen I-induced DDR1 and MMP-10 mRNA expression was completely abrogated in the presence of AMN107, whereas blocking β1 integrins had no effect on message level (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, collagen I-induced MMP-10 protein secretion was inhibited by AMN107, but not by the anti-β1 integrin blocking antibody (Fig. 3C). Expression of cyclin D1, a major regulator of G1 phase cell cycle progression, requires β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM (33Walker J.L. Assoian R.K. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Anti-β1 integrin antibody inhibited collagen I-induced cyclin D1 mRNA expression in NHLFs (Fig. 3D), showing that it is an effective blocking antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml.FIGURE 3Collagen I induces DDR1 and MMP-10 expression through DDR and independently of β1 integrin in NHLFs. A, B, and D, NHLFs were serum-starved overnight. The cells were then incubated with AMN107 (1 mm) or anti-human β1 integrin antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to 16 h stimulation with collagen I (25 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, and real time quantitative PCR was performed using the TaqMan system with specific primers and TaqMan Probes for human DDR1 (A), MMP-10 (B), Cyclin D1 (D), and GAPDH. The expression changes (fold increases) were calculated relative to unstimulated control (CTRL) cells after normalizing with GAPDH. The results are representative of mean fold increases ± S.D. of three independent experiments done in triplicate (n = 9; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). C, MMP-10 protein was measured in the culture supernatant of stimulated NHLFs by ELISA. The results are representative of mean fold increases ± S.D. of three independent experiments done in triplicate (n = 9; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the question as to whether DDR1, DDR2, or both receptors were involved in mediating collagen I induction of DDR1 and MMP-10, we utilized HEK293 stable transfected cell lines overexpressing the different DDRs (DDR1a, DDR1b, and DDR2) present in NHLFs. As shown in Fig. 4, collagen I was able to induce the mRNA expression of both DDR1 and MMP-10 in DDR2- but not DDR1a- or DDR1b-overexpressing HEK293 cells in a time-dependent manner, indicating a DDR2-mediated effect. Several pathways have been implicated in DDR signaling particularly for DDR1 (5Vogel W.F. Abdulhussein R. Ford C.E. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Yang K. Kim J.H. Kim H.J. Park I.S. Kim I.Y. Yang B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39058-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, signaling pathways activated by DDR2 have only been poorly elucidated. To identify key signaling pathways downstream of DDR2 in NHLFs, we tested the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of three important pathways, (JAK/STAT, MEK/ERK, and p38 MAPK) upon collagen I-induced MMP-10 expression. Both NHLFs and DDR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells were incubated with AG490, PD98059, and SB203580, selective pharmacological inhibitors of JAK2, MEK1, and p38 MAPK, respectively, prior to 16 h of collagen I stimulation. Collagen I-induced MMP-10 mRNA expression was significantly inhibited in the presence of JAK2 and MEK1, but not p38 MAPK inhibitors in both NHLFs (Fig. 5A) and DDR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that both JAK2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are involved in collagen I-induced MMP-10 mRNA expression. Time course experiments revealed that collagen I induced ERK1/2 MAPK and JAK2 phosphorylation in a time-dep"

Allergy to cat has increased substantially in recent years and has been shown to be positively associated with asthma. We have recently shown that the mannose receptor (MR), a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells, recognizes various glycoallergens from diverse sources and is involved in promoting allergic responses to a major house dust mite allergen in vitro. Here we investigated the potential role of MR in allergic responses to Fel d 1, a major cat allergen. Fel d 1 binding to MR was confirmed by ELISA. Using blocking, gene silencing (siRNA) experiments, and MR knock-out (MR(-/-)) cells, we have demonstrated that MR plays a major role in internalization of Fel d 1 by human and mouse antigen-presenting cells. Intriguingly, unlike other glycoallergens, recognition of Fel d 1 by MR is mediated by the cysteine-rich domain, which correlates with the presence of sulfated carbohydrates in natural Fel d 1. WT and MR(-/-) mice were used to study the role of MR in allergic sensitization to Fel d 1 in vivo. MR(-/-) mice sensitized with cat dander extract and Fel d 1 produced significantly lower levels of total IgE, Fel d 1-specific-IgE and IgG1, the hallmarks of allergic response, compared with WT mice. Our data show for the first time that Fel d 1 is a novel ligand of the cysteine-rich domain of MR and that MR is likely to play a pivotal role in allergic sensitization to airborne allergens in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2010387488,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system (CNS) and may induce cytotoxicity through persistent activation of glutamate receptors and oxidative stress. Its extracellular concentration is maintained at physiological concentrations by high affinity glutamate transporters of the solute carrier 1 family (SLC1). Glutamate is also present in islet of Langerhans where it is secreted by the α-cells and acts as a signaling molecule to modulate hormone secretion. Whether glutamate plays a role in islet cell viability is presently unknown. We demonstrate that chronic exposure to glutamate exerts a cytotoxic effect in clonal β-cell lines and human islet β-cells but not in α-cells. In human islets, glutamate-induced β-cell cytotoxicity was associated with increased oxidative stress and led to apoptosis and autophagy. We also provide evidence that the key regulator of extracellular islet glutamate concentration is the glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1). GLT1 localizes to the plasma membrane of β-cells, modulates hormone secretion, and prevents glutamate-induced cytotoxicity as shown by the fact that its down-regulation induced β-cell death, whereas GLT1 up-regulation promoted β-cell survival. In conclusion, the present study identifies GLT1 as a new player in glutamate homeostasis and signaling in the islet of Langerhans and demonstrates that β-cells critically depend on its activity to control extracellular glutamate levels and cellular integrity."

Unattached kinetochores or the absence of tension between the paired kinetochores activates a surveillance mechanism termed the spindle-assembly checkpoint. A fundamental principle of the checkpoint is the activation of mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2). MAD2 then forms a diffusible complex called mitotic checkpoint complex (designated as MAD2(MCC)) before it is recruited to APC/C (designated as MAD2(APC/C)). Large gaps in our knowledge remain on how MAD2 is inactivated after the checkpoint is satisfied. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of MAD2-containing complexes during mitotic progression. Using selective immunoprecipitation of checkpoint components and gel filtration chromatography, we found that MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) were regulated very differently during mitotic exit. Temporally, MAD2(MCC) was broken down ahead of MAD2(APC/C). The inactivation of the two complexes also displayed different requirements of proteolysis; although APC/C and proteasome activities were dispensable for MAD2(MCC) inactivation, they are required for MAD2(APC/C) inactivation. In fact, the degradation of CDC20 is inextricably linked to the breakdown of MAD2(APC/C). These data extended our understanding of the checkpoint complexes during checkpoint silencing.

Activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) are key events that control entry and exit of mitosis, respectively. CDK1 activation is mediated by cyclin B binding and T-loop phosphorylation. On the other hand, CDK1 inactivation is triggered by the destruction of cyclin B, which is carried out by the ubiquitin ligase APC/C 2The abbreviations used are: APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; MCC, mitotic checkpoint complex; MAD2, mitotic arrest deficient 2; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein. in association with a targeting subunit called CDC20 (1Pesin J.A. Orr-Weaver T.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 475-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Activation of APC/C is initiated only when all the chromosomes have achieved bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindles. Unattached kinetochores or the absence of tension between the paired kinetochores activate a surveillance mechanism termed the spindle-assembly checkpoint (2Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In essence, unattached kinetochores attract components of the checkpoint machinery, which then catalyzes the formation of a diffusible complex called the MCC (mitotic checkpoint complex); components include MAD2, BUBR1, BUB3, and CDC20. This leads to the inhibition of APC/C by MAD2 (3Vigneron S. Prieto S. Bernis C. Labbé J.C. Castro A. Lorca T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4584-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). According to this model, at least three populations of MAD2 are present during mitosis, including free MAD2, those serving as components of MCC, and those that bind to APC/C (4Nilsson J. Yekezare M. Minshull J. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Binding to CDC20 requires a conformational change in MAD2 from a less stable open conformation (O-MAD2) to a closed conformation (C-MAD2) (7Luo X. Tang Z. Rizo J. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). According to a currently favored MAD2 template model, the C-MAD2 that bound to MAD1 at the kinetochores serves as a template for the conversion of the cytosolic pool of O-MAD2 into C-MAD2. The newly activated C-MAD2 then leaves the kinetochore to inhibit CDC20 (8De Antoni A. Pearson C.G. Cimini D. Canman J.C. Sala V. Nezi L. Mapelli M. Sironi L. Faretta M. Salmon E.D. Musacchio A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 214-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The MAD2-CDC20 complexes also autoamplify the checkpoint signal by converting more O-MAD2 into C-MAD2 (7Luo X. Tang Z. Rizo J. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After all kinetochores are properly attached, the checkpoint is terminated to allow sister chromatid separation. The essential question regarding exactly how the checkpoint is silenced remains incompletely understood. A number of mechanisms have been proposed. These include the stripping of checkpoint components from the kinetochore by a dynein motility-dependent mechanism, the dissociation of MAD2-CDC20 by APC/C-dependent mechanisms, and the neutralization of MAD2 by a MAD2-binding protein called p31comet (2Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). More recently, PP1 is also implicated in reversing the phosphorylation critical for maintaining the checkpoint (9Pinsky B.A. Nelson C.R. Biggins S. Curr.

Our data revealed that MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) were regulated very differently during mitotic exit. Temporally, MAD2(MCC) was broken down ahead of MAD2(APC/C). In addition, the inactivation of the two complexes also displayed different requirements of proteolysis. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise.

Polyclonal antibodies against and APC4 (ab72149, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), BUBR1 (A300-386A), CDC16 (A301-165A-1) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), CDC20 (sc-8358), phospho-histone H3Ser10 (sc-8656R), and securin (sc-56207) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibodies against CDC20 (sc-5296, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MAD2, and CDC27 (BD Transduction Laboratories) were obtained from the indicated suppliers. Polyclonal antiserum against MAD2 was raised against bacterially expressed GST-MAD2. Lysates (2 mg in 100 μl) were applied onto a Superose 6 GL column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and chromatography was conducted using an ÄKTATM FPLC system (GE Healthcare) using the buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and mixed with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer; 15 μl was then analyzed by immunoblotting. Time-lapse microscopy was performed exactly as described previously (11Ma H.T. Tsang Y.H. Marxer M. Poon R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6500-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At least three populations of MAD2 are present during mitosis: free MAD2, those serving as components of MCC (designated herein as MAD2(MCC)), and those that bind to APC/C (designated herein as MAD2(APC/C)) (see also Fig. 6B). To study these complexes during various stages of mitosis, HeLa cells were synchronized by a series of traps and releases. A summary of the synchronization procedures is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. All procedures began with a basic double thymidine block protocol. Releasing cells from the block (8 h) yielded G2 cells. Prometaphase cells were enriched by trapping cells with nocodazole followed by shake off. Lastly, metaphase cells were obtained by releasing cells from the nocodazole block in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The loss of MAD2 staining from kinetochores validated that the cells were trapped in a metaphase-like state (supplemental Fig. S2). The presence of MAD2(APC/C) and MAD2(MCC) was initially examined by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). As expected, MAD2 was present in CDC20 immunoprecipitates from prometaphase lysates (lane 6) (18Wassmann K. Benezra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11193-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, MAD2 was absent in the immunoprecipitates from G2 lysates (lane 5) despite similar concentrations of total MAD2 in the two lysates (lanes 1 and 2). Likewise, CDC20 was present in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation using an antiserum against MAD2 from prometaphase but not G2 lysates (lanes 9 and 10). These results verify that the spindle-assembly checkpoint was activated during prometaphase. To specifically detect MAD2(APC/C) complexes, two APC/C core subunits (APC4 and CDC27) were immunoprecipitated. Fig. 1B shows that MAD2 associated with APC/C during prometaphase (19Li Y. Gorbea C. Mahaffey D. Rechsteiner M. Benezra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12431-12436Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the disruption of the binding after CDC20 was depleted with siRNA (Fig. 1C, lane 7). As a control, this interaction was not affected after cyclin B1 depletion (lane 6). Although cyclin B1 could be down-regulated without affecting entry into mitosis (20Bellanger S. de Gramont A. Sobczak-Thépot J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7175-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation shifts of CDC27 were largely attenuated, suggesting that CDC27 phosphorylation was not required for APC/C-MAD2 interaction. Collectively, these data indicate that MAD2 interacted with APC/C during prometaphase in a CDC20-dependent manner. It has been reported that MAD2 dissociates from CDC20 during mitotic progression (18Wassmann K. Benezra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11193-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We generated checkpoint-satisfied mitotic cells by treating nocodazole-released cells with MG132 to inhibit proteolysis. These cells formed a metaphase plate but were unable to degrade an APC/C reporter (containing mRFP1 fused to the D-box region of cyclin B1) (supplemental Fig. S1, see also later in Fig. 4C). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation validated that MAD2-CDC20 dissociated during metaphase (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 12). Unexpectedly, MAD2 still remained bound to the APC/C (CDC27 and APC4 immunoprecipitates) in metaphase lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 12). As metaphase cells were prepared with MG132 treatment, we also incubated prometaphase cells with MG132 for the same amount of time for a more direct comparison (lanes 7 and 11). These experiments confirmed that although MAD2-CDC20 binding was detected only in prometaphase, MAD2(APC/C) was detected in both prometaphase and metaphase. Given that CDC20 is an integral component of both MAD2(APC/C) and MAD2(MCC), it is paradoxical that only MAD2(APC/C) was detected during metaphase by co-immunoprecipitation. To resolve this dilemma, we analyzed the MAD2 complexes by gel filtration chromatography, thereby excluding possible artifacts from immunoprecipitation. Previous studies indicate that free MAD2 (<100 kDa), MCC (∼670 kDa), and APC/C (>1.5 MDa) can be resolved by gel filtration chromatography (4Nilsson J. Yekezare M. Minshull J. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that in G2 lysates, MAD2 was exclusively eluted in fractions representing monomer and/or dimer of free MAD2 (21Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In contrast, marginal but detectable levels of MAD2 co-eluted with APC/C components (including CDC20, APC4, and CDC27) as well as with MCC in prometaphase lysates (Fig. 2B). More MAD2 was found in both fractions after proteins were stabilized with MG132 (Fig. 2C). Both fractions disappeared after CDC20 was depleted with siRNA (supplemental Fig. S3), confirming the CDC20 dependence of MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C). Significantly, metaphase lysates contained free MAD2 and MAD2(APC/C) but not MAD2(MCC) (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicated that although prometaphase contained both MAD2(APC/C) and MAD2(MCC), metaphase only contained MAD2(APC/C). Our data also indicated that antibodies against MAD2 selectively immunoprecipitated MAD2(MCC) but not MAD2(APC/C). It is possible that MAD2 became inaccessible when bound to the large APC/C complex. In further support of this, although the majority of total MAD2 could be immunodepleted with the MAD2 antiserum, the MAD2 that bound to APC4 was not depleted (supplemental Fig. S4). By contrast, antibodies against CDC27 and APC4 were able to immunoprecipitate MAD2(APC/C). Nonetheless, the selective recognition of MAD2(APC/C) and MAD2(MCC) by the antibodies provided a simple method to analyze the two complexes. Given that the disappearance of MAD2(MCC) appears to be correlated with checkpoint satisfaction, a prediction is that MAD2(MCC) should form again if the checkpoint is reactivated. For this purpose, metaphase cells were first prepared as above, before nocodazole was reintroduced to disrupt the spindles. Fig. 1D shows that as expected, MAD2(MCC) was detected in prometaphase but disappeared in metaphase. MAD2(MCC) was again detected immediately after nocodazole was reintroduced. These results indicate that formation of MAD2(MCC) was dynamically controlled by the spindle-assembly checkpoint. To ensure that the observed regulation of APC/C and MCC in checkpoint-satisfied samples was not simply due to a perturbation of ubiquitin equilibrium by MG132 (22Dantuma N.P. Groothuis T.A. Salomons F.A. Neefjes J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), an alternative method was also used to obtain checkpoint-satisfied cells without the use of proteasome inhibitors. A non-degradable cyclin B1 lacking the N-terminal destruction box was used to trap cells in a mitotic state. A cell line that expressed cyclin B1(NΔ) under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter was generated. The induction of cyclin B1(NΔ) was then coupled to the synchronization procedure to minimize the toxicity due to long term expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Non-degradable cyclin B1 can trap cells in an anaphase-like state with a satisfied checkpoint (23Chang D.C. Xu N. Luo K.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37865-37873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our data confirmed that cells expressing cyclin B1(NΔ) contained low amounts of APC/C substrates such as securin and cyclin B1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The dephosphorylation of BUBR1 also suggested that the spindle-assembly checkpoint was turned off. For a comparison, APC/C was not activated when cyclin B1(NΔ) was induced in prometaphase (lane 1). It is noteworthy that CDC20 remained stable when other APC/C substrates were degraded. As CDC20 is proposed to be degraded by autoubiquitination (24Pan J. Chen R.H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as well as by CDH1 (25Reis A. Levasseur M. Chang H.Y. Elliott D.J. Jones K.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is possible that CDH1 is suppressed by the cyclin B1(NΔ)-CDK1 (26Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the status of MAD2(MCC) by immunoprecipitation. Fig. 3B shows that significantly less MAD2(MCC) was present in cyclin B1(NΔ)-blocked cells than during prometaphase. In contrast, the abundance of MAD2(APC/C) was unchanged between prometaphase and cyclin B1(NΔ)-blocked cells. Collectively, these data indicate that MAD2(MCC) was unstable during the anaphase-like state induced by cyclin B1(NΔ), further substantiating the idea that MAD2(APC/C) persists at the time when MAD2(MCC) is already removed. To further verify the differential regulation of MAD2-containing complexes, we next examined their dissociation kinetics during mitotic exit. Cells were first trapped with nocodazole before being released by extensive washing. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that most cells entered G1 at 90 min (Fig. 4A). To determine the time of mitotic exit more precisely, individual cells were tracked with time-lapse microscopy. For this purpose, cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B and an mRFP-tagged APC/C reporter (27Chow J.P. Poon R.Y. Ma H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Fig. 4B shows that more than half of the cells had undergone anaphase at 60 min (a representative example is shown in Fig. 4C). As expected, the APC/C reporter was degraded at the time of anaphase onset. By contrast, cells released from nocodazole block in the presence of MG132 were trapped in metaphase without degradation of the APC/C reporter (Fig. 4C). To determine the kinetics of the breakdown of MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) during mitotic exit, MAD2 and CDC27 were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared at different time points after nocodazole release (Fig. 4D). Immunoblotting of the total lysates indicated that although cyclin B1 was destroyed abruptly at 90 min, the degradation of CDC20 started earlier and was more progressive. The CDC20 present in the MAD2 immunoprecipitates started to decrease from 30 min and was absent by 60 min. In contrast, a significant amount of MAD2 and CDC20 was still present in the CDC27 immunoprecipitates at up to 90 min. These results indicate that MAD2(MCC) dissociates before MAD2(APC/C) during mitotic exit. The above data demonstrated that MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) were broken down with different kinetics when cells were released from nocodazole block. However, using this method, cells exited mitosis heterogeneously over a window of ∼30 min (Fig. 4B). To obtain further evidence of the different dissociation kinetics of the MAD2 complexes, mitotic exit was triggered more sharply by using a CDK1 inhibitor (28D'Angiolella V. Mari C. Nocera D. Rametti L. Grieco D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both histone H3Ser10 and CDC27 were completely dephosphorylated and cyclin B1 was destroyed as quickly as 30 min after treatment with the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 (29Vassilev L.T. Tovar C. Chen S. Knezevic D. Zhao X. Sun H. Heimbrook D.C. Chen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10660-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The presence of MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) after RO3306 treatment was analyzed with immunoprecipitation. Fig. 5B shows that MAD2(MCC) was rapidly eliminated after RO3306 treatment (lanes 1–3). MAD2(APC/C) was likewise removed, albeit with slower kinetics (Fig. 5C). A caveat of these results is that they may be caused by the significant reduction of total CDC20 after RO3306 treatment (Fig. 5A). To exclude the contribution of CDC20 degradation, mitotic cells were incubated with MG132 before the RO3306 challenge. As expected, MG132 stabilized both cyclin B1 and CDC20 but did not interfere with mitotic exit (dephosphorylation of histone H3Ser10 and CDC27) (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–6). The slight delay in histone H3Ser10 dephosphorylation may be due to the delay in activation of proteasome-dependent phosphatases (30Skoufias D.A. Indorato R.L. Lacroix F. Panopoulos A. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Even after CDC20 was stabilized by MG132, MAD2(MCC) was still eliminated rapidly after RO3306 treatment (Fig. 5B). In contrast, CDC20 and MAD2 remained bound to CDC27 under the same conditions (Fig. 5C), indicating that MAD2(APC/C) was more stable than MAD2(MCC). We further confirmed the above results by analyzing the MAD2 complexes with gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 5D shows that MAD2 already disappeared from the MCC fractions at 30 min after treating prometaphase cells with RO3306. The level of MAD2(MCC) was significantly reduced even in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 5E, cf. cells without RO3306 treatment in Fig. 2C). These data suggest that MAD2(MCC) was eliminated after CDK1 inactivation in a proteasome-independent manner. To test more directly whether the inactivation of MAD2(MCC) was independent of protein degradation, the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/C was reduced by co-depletion of the CDC27 and APC2 (Fig. 5F). As expected, down-regulation of CDC27 and APC2 impaired APC/C activity, as indicated by the stabilization of prometaphase substrates including cyclin A2 and CDC20 (lanes 1 and 5). Degradation of cyclin B1 during RO3306-induced mitotic exit was also compromised (lanes 2 and 6). Using this system, we found that the breakdown of MAD2(MCC) did not require APC/C activity because CDC20 disappeared from MAD2 immunoprecipitates even in CDC27- and APC2-depleted cells (Fig. 5G, lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, CDC20 and MAD2 remained bound to APC4 under the same conditions, indicating that breakdown of MAD2(APC/C) was dependent on APC/C activity. In agreement with the above results using MG132 (Fig. 5G, lanes 3 and 4), these data indicate that removal of MAD2(APC/C) but not MAD2(MCC) was dependent on APC/C-dependent proteolytic activity. We propose a model in which both MAD2(MCC) and MAD2(APC/C) are present when the spindle-assembly checkpoint is active. After the checkpoint is satisfied during metaphase, MAD2(MCC) becomes destabilized, but MAD2(APC/C) remains intact. MAD2(APC/C) is finally also eliminated when CDC20 is degraded after anaphase. An alternative explanation of our data is nevertheless possible. It is conceivable that MAD2(APC/C) is actually broken down after checkpoint satisfaction but is then replenished by MAD2(MCC). The redistribution of MAD2 from MCC to APC/C may account for the selective disappearance of MAD2(MCC) during metaphase. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that down-regulation of the CDC16 could disrupt the recruitment of CDC20 and MAD2 to APC/C (31Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows that the recruitment of CDC20 and MAD2 to APC4 was significantly impaired after CDC16 was depleted with siRNA (lanes 15 and 16). It is interesting that the expression of CDC27 was also slightly reduced; we are currently unclear whether this was due to a specific effect of CDC16 depletion. After CDC16 depletion, MAD2(MCC) could still be detected in prometaphase extracts (lanes 7 and 11). The abundance of MAD2(MCC) was in fact higher than in control cells, probably due to the stabilization of CDC20 (lanes 3 and 4). As in control cells, MAD2(MCC) was eliminated in metaphase (lanes 8 and 12), indicating that MAD2(MCC) was still removed in the absence of CDC16. These data suggest that the disappearance of MAD2(MCC) after checkpoint satisfaction was not due to a redistribution to APC/C. One of the essential questions regarding mitotic exit is how the activated MAD2 is removed after the checkpoint is satisfied. In this report, we have focused our investigation on the dissociation of different MAD2 complexes. Our findings are consistent with the model that MAD2-containing complexes are removed in stages during mitotic progression (Fig. 6B). Three populations of MAD2 were present when the spindle-assembly checkpoint was activated and could readily be resolved on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2C). After the checkpoint was satisfied, MAD2 disappeared from the MCC population with a concomitant increase in the relative level of free MAD2 (Fig. 2D). Meanwhile, the position of CDC20 was also shifted from the MCC to a smaller, presumably monomeric, form. Several other pieces of evidence support the selective dismantling of MAD2(MCC) during metaphase, including (a) the loss of MAD2(MCC) as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 1A); (b) the immediate reappearance of the complex when the checkpoint was reactivated with nocodazole (Fig. 1D); (c) the instability of MAD2(MCC) during the anaphase-like state induced by cyclin B1(NΔ) (Fig. 3); and (d) the selective elimination of MAD2(MCC) after CDK1 inactivation (Fig. 5E). In contrast to MAD2(MCC), MAD2(APC/C) remained intact during metaphase (Figs. 1B and 2). Interestingly, the existence of MAD2(APC/C) after checkpoint satisfaction implies that additional mechanisms may be involved in activating the MAD2-bound APC/C. However, a simpler explanation is that the APC/C activity was due to the MAD2-free APC/C; the MAD2(APC/C) was only dismantled later in anaphase, presumably when CDC20 was finally degraded (Figs. 4D and 5, C and G). As checkpoint-satisfied extracts were prepared in the presence of MG132, our data suggest that MAD2(MCC) dissociation was independent of proteasome activity. Interestingly, these data are at odds with the recent results of Visconti et al. (32Visconti R. Palazzo L. Grieco D. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showing that MAD2-CDC20 complexes (co-immunoprecipitation of MAD2 with an antibody against CDC20) persisted when cells were released from a nocodazole block into MG132. Our gel filtration chromatography and other data strongly supported that MAD2(MCC) was absent after the checkpoint was satisfied (Fig. 2D). One possible explanation that could reconcile this discrepancy is that the anti-CDC20 immunoprecipitation procedure used by Visconti et al. (32Visconti R. Palazzo L. Grieco D. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) could isolate both MAD2(APC/C) and MAD2(MCC). Conceptually, the free MCC and APC/C-MCC should be disassembled for APC/C reactivation. In a HeLa cell extracts model, ubiquitination by APC/C can drive the dissociation of checkpoint components from APC/C (33Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our data. More recently, it was found that the cleavage of ATP at the β-γ position, which is not required for ubiquitination, is essential for the MCC dissociation in HeLa cell extracts (34Teichner A. Eytan E. Sitry-Shevah D. Miniowitz-Shemtov S. Dumin E. Gromis J. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3187-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our data also supported the differential regulation in MCC and APC/C-MCC dissociation. In addition, our data further suggested a temporal difference in disassembly of checkpoint components of the MCC and APC/C. Although the present work provided insights into a possible differential regulation of different MAD2-containing complexes during checkpoint inactivation, it raised several new questions. Foremost, what are the mechanisms involved in selectively dismantling MAD2(MCC)? Spatial differences with MAD2(APC/C) could be a possible mechanism. Given that both inactive and active APC/C in prometaphase and metaphase, respectively, appear to associate with MAD2, what is the molecular basis of the control of APC/C? A possible solution is that the relief of the inhibition of MAD2 on APC/C may not require dissociation. For example, the MAD2-binding protein p31comet is proposed to regulate the silencing of the spindle-assembly checkpoint by neutralizing the effect of MAD2 on CDC20, and p31comet can stimulate the activity of APC/C without disrupting the MAD2-CDC20 interaction (35Xia G. Luo X. Habu T. Rizo J. Matsumoto T. Yu H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3133-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). An alternative solution is that MAD2-independent mechanisms may be involved in turning off of APC/C activity, such as that proposed for MCF2 (36Eytan E. Braunstein I. Ganoth D. Teichner A. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9181-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2030801338,"Acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) generates the bioactive lipid ceramide (Cer) from hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM). However, its precise roles in regulating specific sphingolipid-mediated biological processes remain ill defined. Interestingly, the aSMase gene gives rise to two distinct enzymes, lysosomal sphingomyelinase (L-SMase) and secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) via alternative trafficking of a shared protein precursor. Previously, our laboratory identified Ser508 as a crucial residue for the constitutive and regulated secretion of S-SMase in response to inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrated a role for S-SMase in formation of select cellular Cer species (Jenkins, R. W., Canals, D., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Simbari, F., Roddy, P., Perry, D. M., Kitatani, K., Luberto, C., and Hannun, Y. A. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 35706–35718). In the present study using a chemokine/cytokine screen, we identified the chemokine CCL5 (formerly known as RANTES) as a candidate-specific downstream target for aSMase. Regulation of CCL5 by aSMase was subsequently validated using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function models indicating that aSMase is both necessary and sufficient for CCL5 production. Interestingly, cells deficient in acid ceramidase (aCDase) also exhibited defects in CCL5 induction, whereas cells deficient in sphingosine kinase-1 and -2 exhibited higher levels of CCL5, suggesting that sphingosine and not sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is responsible for the positive signal to CCL5. Consistent with this, co-expression of aSMase and aCDase was sufficient to strongly induce CCL5. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for aSMase (particularly S-SMase) in chemokine elaboration by pro-inflammatory cytokines and highlight a novel and shared function for aSMase and aCDase. Acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) generates the bioactive lipid ceramide (Cer) from hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM).

Previously, our laboratory identified Ser508 as a crucial residue for the constitutive and regulated secretion of S-SMase in response to inflammatory cytokines, and demonstrated a role for S-SMase in formation of select cellular Cer species (Jenkins, R. W., Canals, D., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Simbari, F., Roddy, P., Perry, D. M., Kitatani, K., Luberto, C., and Hannun, Y. A. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 35706–35718). In the present study using a chemokine/cytokine screen, we identified the chemokine CCL5 (formerly known as RANTES) as a candidate-specific downstream target for aSMase. Regulation of CCL5 by aSMase was subsequently validated using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function models indicating that aSMase is both necessary and sufficient for CCL5 production. Interestingly, cells deficient in acid ceramidase (aCDase) also exhibited defects in CCL5 induction, whereas cells deficient in sphingosine kinase-1 and -2 exhibited higher levels of CCL5, suggesting that sphingosine and not sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is responsible for the positive signal to CCL5. Consistent with this, co-expression of aSMase and aCDase was sufficient to strongly induce CCL5. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for aSMase (particularly S-SMase) in chemokine elaboration by pro-inflammatory cytokines and highlight a novel and shared function for aSMase and aCDase. Once considered inert structural components of biological membranes, sphingolipids (SPLs) 2The abbreviations used are: SPL, sphingolipid; aSMase, acid sphingomyelinase; S-SMase, secretory sphingomyelinase; L-SMase, lysosomal sphingomyelinase; aCDase, acid ceramidase; SphK1, sphingosine kinase 1; SphK2, sphingosine kinase 2; SM, sphingomyelin; Cer, ceramide; Sph, sphingosine; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; NPD, Niemann-Pick disease; FD, Farber disease; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ANOVA, analysis of variance; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription. are now recognized as biologically active molecules that have been implicated in the regulation of numerous cellular processes (1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). Ceramide (Cer, N-acylsphingosine) occupies a central position in SPL metabolism, serving as a metabolic precursor to more complex SPLs, such as sphingomyelin (SM) and the glycosphingolipids (1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 2Bartke N. Hannun Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S91-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Cer can also be deacylated by ceramidases (CDase) to form sphingosine (Sph) (3Mao C. Obeid L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which in turn can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SphK) to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (4Hait N.C. Oskeritzian C.A. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Although Cer has been shown to play an important role in cellular stress signaling and cell death (5Grassmé H. Riethmüller J. Gulbins E. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Gulbins E. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R11-R26Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), S1P acts primarily as a pro-survival signal promoting growth, migration, and angiogenesis (7Snider A.J. Alexa Orr Gandy K. Obeid L.M. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As such, enzymes of SPL metabolism determine the relative levels of Cer, Sph, and S1P; however, the precise roles and regulation of these enzymes are incompletely understood. Acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase, SMPD1) is a soluble acid hydrolase that cleaves the phosphodiester bond of SM to form Cer. Mutations in the gene encoding aSMase give rise to Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A and B, a lysosomal storage disease with multiorgan involvement (8Schuchman E.H. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2007; 30: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to its importance in preserving lysosomal function, aSMase has also been reported to be regulated by various cellular stressors to promote Cer formation (6Gulbins E. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R11-R26Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consequently, the aSMase/Cer pathway is considered a major component of the acute cellular stress response (9Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2010; 10: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although primarily a lysosomal protein, aSMase can also be secreted extracellularly through alternative trafficking of a shared protein precursor, giving rise to secretory aSMase (S-SMase) (10Schissel S.L.

Notably, S-SMase secretion is enhanced by inflammatory cytokines (10Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and serum levels of S-SMase are increased in mouse models of inflammation (12Wong M.L. Xie B.

However, the role for aSMase in inflammatory processes is less well understood; indeed, aSMase has been reported to exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. For example, peritoneal macrophages from aSMase−/− mice produce higher levels of TNF-α in response to LPS challenge (22Rozenova K.A. Deevska G.M. Karakashian A.A. Nikolova-Karakashian M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21103-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas T-lymphocytes from aSMase−/− mice exhibit defective elaboration of IFN-γ (23Herz J. Pardo J. Kashkar H. Schramm M. Kuzmenkina E. Bos E. Wiegmann K. Wallich R. Peters P.J. Herzig S. Schmelzer E. Krönke M. Simon M.M. Utermöhlen O. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and microglia from aSMase−/− mice are unable to produce IL-1β following purinergic stimulation (24Bianco F. Perrotta C. Novellino L. Francolini M. Riganti L. Menna E. Saglietti L. Schuchman E.H. Furlan R. Clementi E. Matteoli M. Verderio C. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells and tissues from NPD patients and aSMase−/− mice exhibit basal elevations in inflammatory markers (25Dhami R. Passini M.A. Schuchman E.H. Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Dhami R. He X. Gordon R.E. Schuchman E.H. Lab.

Dis. 2005; 28: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that chronic perturbation of the sphingolipid metabolism may underlie dysregulation of the inflammatory response. However, another contributing factor is that aSMase-null cells lack both S-SMase and L-SMase. In particular, the lack of tools available to address the contribution of S-SMase and L-SMase has limited study on the specific roles of these enzymes. Recently, we described a role for S-SMase in cellular Cer formation using a mutant form of aSMase (S508A) that retained L-SMase function in the absence of S-SMase secretion (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35706-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this novel S-SMase/Cer pathway was not explored. Here, we now identify the chemokine CCL5 (formerly known as RANTES) as a novel effector of the S-SMase/Cer pathway using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. Further analysis demonstrated a requirement for acid ceramidase (aCDase), but not SphK in the up-regulation of CCL5. Based on these findings, we demonstrate a novel role for the S-SMase/Cer pathway in the regulation of the chemokine CCL5 and highlight a novel and shared function of aSMase and aCDase in the inflammatory response. MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). RPMI culture medium, fetal bovine serum, and Blasticidin S HCl were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. HRP-labeled secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from ThermoScientific (Rockford, IL). Interleukin-1β was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Tumor necrosis factor-α was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Myriocin was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals/Enzo Life Sciences (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fumonisin B1 was obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). The sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI-II was from Calbiochem. Porcine brain sphingomyelin, d-erythro-sphingosine, and d-erythro-sphingosine-1-phosphate were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Desipramine, brefeldin A, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. MCF7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal transfectants were isolated as described previously (29Zeidan Y.H. Wu B.X. Jenkins R.W. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stable overexpression was verified by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Cells were maintained in 10% FBS/RPMI plus 7 μg/ml of Blasticidin S-HCl. Cells were maintained at less than 80% confluence under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Cells plated for experiments were cultured in the absence of Blasticidin. Control dermal fibroblasts (from the unaffected mother of a child with Lesch-Nyhan, Ctl, GM02226), Niemann-Pick type A dermal fibroblasts (NPD-1, GM13205, and NPD-2, GM16195), and Farber disease dermal fibroblasts (FD-1, GM02315, and FD-2, GM20017) were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository. Cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. Control (L-N), NPD-1, FD-1, and FD-2 fibroblasts were used from passage 10 to 16 and NPD-2 cells from passage 15 to 20. MCF7 cells were treated with IL-1β and TNF-α in serum-free conditions (unless otherwise indicated), whereas dermal fibroblasts and MEFs were cultured and treated in serum-replete media. MEFs were generated from SphK1+/−, and SphK2+/− littermate matings in a C57BL/6J/129Sv background. Primary MEFs were harvested from E13.5 embryos as described earlier (30Neumann C.A. Krause D.S.

Primary wild-type, SphK1−/−, and SphK2−/− MEFs (passages 3–4) were immortalized by retroviral infection with pBabe-hygro DD p53 expressing dominant-negative p53 (32Hahn W.C. Dessain S.K. Brooks M.W.

MEFs were maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. For genotyping, genomic DNA was extracted from MEFs using a DNAEasy kit (Qiagen). For each cell line, 2 μl of DNA was combined with 1 μl each of three primers for either SphK1 or SphK2 and 20 μl of PCR Platinum SuperMix (Invitrogen) for a total reaction volume of 25 μl for PCR. The following primers (10 μm) from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) were used for SphK1: 5′-TGTCACCCATGAACCTGCTGTCCCTG-3′, 5′-AGAAGGCACTGGCTCCTCCAGAGGA-3′, and 5′-TCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCCGCTCCC-3′, and the following primers were used for SphK2, 5′-GCACCCAGTGTGAATCGAGC-3′, 5′-TCTGGAGACGGGCTGCTTTA-3′, and 5′-CGCTATCAGGACATAGCGTT-3′. PCR was performed on a Biometra Thermocycler T3000 with the following reaction conditions: for SphK1, 94 °C, 0.5 min; 55 °C, 0.5 min; 72 °C, 6.5 min for 30 cycles; and for SphK2, 95 °C, 0.5 min; 55 °C, 0.5 min; 72 °C, 2 min for 40 cycles. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized via UV transillumination. For SphK1, a 310-bp band indicated the WT SphK1 allele, and a band at 390 bp represented a knockout or neo SphK1 allele. For SphK2, a 680-bp band indicated the WT SphK2 allele, and a band at 310 bp represented a knockout or neo SphK2 allele. pEF6.V5/His.aSMaseWT and pEF6.V5/His.aSMaseS508A were previously described (33Zeidan Y.H. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11549-11561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pEF6.V5/His.LacZ is the control plasmid for the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). pEF6.V5/His.aCDaseWT was generated using pEGFP-aCDase as a template (kindly provided by Dr. James Norris, MUSC). Using a 5′-GCTAGAGCGATGCCGGGCCGGAGTTGCGTCG-3′ primer containing nine nucleotides of the native 5′-untranslated region upstream of the initiation codon (AUG) that contains a purine (G) at −3 position, which is crucial for efficient initiation of translation and a 3′-CCAACCTATACAAGGGTCAGGGCA-5′ primer containing the last eight codons of the mRNA minus the stop codon. The amplified human aCDase fragment was then subcloned into the pEF6/V5-His TOPO-TA cloning vector. The orientation of insertion was verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. For transient transfections, cells were plated in 6-well trays (∼200,000 cells/well) and transfected with 0.25–1.0 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (3 μl/transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and were designed against the following target sequences: aSMase, 5′-AACTCCTTTGGATGGGCCTGG-3′; SphK1, 5′-AAGGGCAAGGCCTTGCAGCTC-3′; SphK2, 5′-AACGCTTTGCCCTCACCCTTA-3′; and aCDase, 5′-AATCAACCTATCCTCCTTCAG-3′. All-Star Negative Control siRNA was from Qiagen. For siRNA transfections, cells were plated in 6-well trays (∼50,000 cells/well) and transfected with 20 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) (4 μl/transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 60 h, siRNA-Oligofectamine was removed, and fresh medium was added before treatments. Human Protein Profiler Cytokine Panel A, human RANTES ELISA, and murine RANTES ELISA were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometry for the cytokine panel was performed with NIH Image J software using the integrated density analysis function. The integrated density for all analytes was then normalized to positive controls. V5-S-SMase and V5-S-aCDase were immunoprecipitated directly from conditioned medium, as a previously described secretion (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35706-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium was first cleared of floating cells by brief centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min (4 °C). The supernatant containing S-SMase was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of primary antibody (V5) and 1:20 protein A/G-agarose using a circular rotator. Bound protein was isolated by centrifugation (1 min, 12,000 × g), washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by addition of 2× Laemmli buffer after which samples were boiled for 5 min. Equal volumes were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% Tris-HCl) using the Bio-Rad Criterion system. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dried milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (V5–1:5,000) in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat dried milk. After overnight incubation with primary antibody, the blots were washed with PBS-T and incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) in 5% milk/PBS-T. After washing (3 times for 10 min in PBS-T), enhanced chemiluminescence was used to visualize bands. RNA was homogenized and extracted from cultured cells or mouse tissue using QIAShredder and RNeasy kits (Qiagen), respectively. cDNA was synthesized from 1.0 μg of RNA using Oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard RT-PCR included 12.5 μl of SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), 0.5 μl of 10 μm forward primer, 0.5 μl of 10 μm reverse primer, and 5.0 μl of diluted (1:10) cDNA adjusted to a final volume of 25.0 μl. The RT-PCR was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) as follows: 3 min at 95 °C, followed by cycles (n = 40) consisting of a 10-s melt at 95 °C, a 45-s annealing at 54 °C, and an extension step of 45 s at 68 °C. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Primers were designed using Beacon Primer Design Software and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primers used for real time PCR are as follows: forward human CCL5, 5′-GCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTACTG-3′, reverse human CCL5, 5′-TGGTGTAGAAATACTCCTTGATGTG-3′; forward human acid ceramidase (ASAH1), 5′-TCTTCCATGATCGCAGAACGCC-3′; reverse human acid ceramidase (ASAH1), 5′-ACGGTCAGCTTGTTGAGGAC-3′; forward human β-actin, 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′, human reverse β-actin, 5′-GGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACA-3′; forward mouse CCL5, 5′-ACTCCCTGCTGCTTTGCCTAC-3′; reverse mouse CCL5, 5′-ACTTGCTGGTGTAGAAATACT-3′; forward mouse β-actin, 5′-TAAGGCCAACCGTGAAAAGATG-3′; reverse mouse β-actin, 5′-CTGGATGGCTACGTACATGGCT-3′. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for target genes were normalized to the reference gene using Q-Gene software (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K.

The aSMase activity assay was performed as previously described (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, porcine brain sphingomyelin (0.2 mm) mixed with [14C]sphingomyelin (radiolabeled in the choline moiety, specific radioactivity = 1.5 × 105 cpm/μl) were presented to enzyme (conditioned media or cellular extracts) in Triton X-100 micelles in a buffer containing 250 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.00) and either 2.0 mm EDTA (L-SMase) or 0.2 mm ZnCl2 (S-SMase) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm SM with either 0.1 mm ZnCl2 (S-SMase) or 1.0 mm EDTA (L-SMase). The enzyme reaction was run for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated with the addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) followed by 0.4 ml of water. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged (5 min at 3,000 × g), and 0.8 ml of the aqueous/methanolic phase was removed for scintillation counting. Adherent cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cellular homogenates (0.1–1.0 mg) were frozen at −80 °C and then submitted for sphingolipidomic analysis by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization followed by separation by MS. Analysis of sphingoid bases, ceramides, and sphingomyelins was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction-monitoring positive ionization mode, as described (34Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Data are represented as mean ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Unpaired Student's t test, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post test, and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test statistical analyses were performed using Prism/GraphPad software with additional post test analysis using the Prism/GraphPad website. Previously, we demonstrated up-regulation of S-SMase in response to inflammatory cytokines (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35706-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assess the functional role of S-SMase in the inflammatory response, we utilized our previously characterized MCF7 breast carcinoma cells lines stably expressing vector control (V5-LacZ), wild-type human aSMase (V5-aSMaseWT), or the secretion-incompetent aSMase mutant (V5-aSMaseS508A). Following treatment with vehicle or IL-1β, conditioned medium was collected, and the levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines were analyzed utilizing a proteome profiler array (see “Experimental Procedures”). In resting cells, levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the medium were minimal. As expected, IL-1β (2.5 ng/ml, 18 h) increased the levels of several analytes including CCL5/RANTES, sICAM-1, IL-8/CXCL8, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Of these, only CCL5 was markedly elevated in aSMaseWT cells relative to LacZ cells following IL-1β treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, CCL5 levels were significantly increased in untreated aSMaseWT cells suggesting that aSMase overexpression was sufficient to promote CCL5 up-regulation. These results suggest a novel effect for aSMase in specifically regulating the elaboration of CCL5. Interestingly, the S508A aSMase-expressing cells failed to demonstrate the up-regulation of CCL5 in unstimulated cells, and did not enhance the IL-1β response (Fig. 1). Because the S508A mutant is not secreted but retains lysosomal targeting and activity, these results suggest that the effects on CCL5 are specific to S-SMase. To validate these results, an ELISA specific for CCL5 was performed. Importantly, this confirmed the up-regulation of CCL5 by wild-type, but not S508A acid SMase in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2A). As increased secretion of CCL5 in MCF7 has been reported to proceed in the absence of increased transcription (35Soria G. Yaal-Hahoshen N. Azenshtein E. Shina S. Leider-Trejo L. Ryvo L.

Cytokine. 2008; 44: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the effect of aSMase overexpression on CCL5 mRNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, CCL5 mRNA was elevated in untreated aSMaseWT cells compared with both LacZ and aSMaseS508A cells. Moreover, levels were further enhanced above control cells upon treatment with IL-1β (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, CCL5 mRNA levels in S508A cells were diminished compared with control cells, suggesting that the S508A aSMase mutant has a dominant-negative function. Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of WT but not S508A aSMase is sufficient to increase CCL5 mRNA and protein levels. This identifies a novel target not only of aSMase, but also specifically of S-SMase. To our knowledge, this is the first putative downstream effector of the S-SMase pathway. As up-regulation of S-SMase is a protracted event following inflammatory cytokine challenge (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C.

Accordingly, to establish a temporal relationship between S-SMase secretion and CCL5 elaboration, a time course of CCL5 release in MCF7 V5-aSMaseWT MCF7 was determined following inflammatory cytokine challenge (Fig. 3). Both TNF-α and IL-1β induced a time-dependent increase in CCL5, which became statistically significant after 12 h. However, the effect of TNF-α on CCL5 was much stronger than IL-1β, which became more apparent at 18 and 24 h. Importantly, the time course and extent of CCL5 elaboration following TNF-α and IL-1β treatment closely tracked that of S-SMase secretion and Cer generation (28Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Simbari F. Roddy P. Perry D.M. Kitatani K. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35706-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the kinetics and extent of CCL5 induction in response to TNF-α and IL-1β closely track the up-regulation of S-SMase. To complement the findings with aSMase overexpression, the requirement for endogenous aSMase in CCL5 regulation was evaluated. Initially, multiple inhibitors of SPL enzymes/pathways were employed to determine whether perturbation of the SPL metabolism in general could alter CCL5 elaboration (Fig. 4A). As can be seen, inhibition of de novo (myriocin (37Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Induction of cell differentiation using pharmaceutical agents has been clinically attempted for the treatment of these cancers. Epigenetic regulation may be one of the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling cell proliferation or differentiation. Here, we report on the use of proteomics-based differential protein expression analysis in conjunction with quantification of histone modifications to decipher the interconnections among epigenetic modifications, their modifying enzymes or mediators, and changes in the associated pathways/networks that occur during cell differentiation. During phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation of U937 cells, fatty acid synthesis and its metabolic processing, the clathrin-coated pit endocytosis pathway, and the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome degradation pathways were up-regulated. In addition, global histone H3/H4 acetylation and H2B ubiquitination were down-regulated concomitantly with impaired chromatin remodeling machinery, RNA polymerase II complexes, and DNA replication. Differential protein expression analysis established the networks linking histone hypoacetylation to the down-regulated expression/activity of p300 and linking histone H2B ubiquitination to the RNA polymerase II-associated FACT-RTF1-PAF1 complex.

Collectively, our approach has provided an unprecedentedly systemic set of insights into the role of epigenetic regulation in leukemia cell differentiation. Both histone acetylation and H2B ubiquitination are associated with gene activation as defined by the “histone code” and “cross-talk” theories (1Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously in Berk's laboratory (2Horwitz G.A. Zhang K. McBrian M.A. Grunstein M. Kurdistani S.K. Berk A.J. Science. 2008; 321: 1084-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated dual knockdown of CBP 5The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate; MRM, multiple reaction monitoring; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. and p300 resulted in specific histone H3 Lys-18 hypoacetylation in vivo in both IMR90 and HeLa cells, indicating that p300/CBP, possibly together with their closely associated protein PCAF, are the major histone acetyltransferases required for maintaining global H3 Lys-18 acetylation. On the other hand, the putative histone H2B ubiquitination enzyme, UBCH6 (also known as UBE2E1), physically interacts with RNF20/40 (homologs of Bre1, the E3 ligase in yeast) and PAF1 to form a trimeric complex, which colocalizes with RNA polymerase II at transcriptionally active genes (3Nordick K. Hoffman M.G. Betz J.L. Jaehning J.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RTF1, which has a function similar to Rad6 (mediates ubiquitination at lysine 123 of H2B in yeast) and is a component of the PAF1/RNA polymerase II complex, cooperatively interacts with RNF20/40, and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) to regulate H2B ubiquitination (4Ng H.H.

Clearly, a link between histone modifications, histone modification enzymes, and transcription machinery has been established (9Selth L.A. Sigurdsson S. Svejstrup J.Q. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 271-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, few reports have focused on illustrating protein pathways and networks involved in the facilitation of this linkage prior to the emergence of functional proteomics. Both loci and global changes in epigenetic modifications are associated with a variety of biological processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation (10Sharma S. Kelly T.K. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). A few lines of evidence have recently emerged to support the perspective that “epigenetic switches determine cell fate” (11Rivenbark A.G. Strahl B.D. Science. 2007; 318: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For instance, a decrease in histone H4 acetylation was found prior to and during neural stem cell differentiation (12Singh R.P. Shiue K. Schomberg D. Zhou F.C. Cell Transplant. 2009; 18: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and dysregulation of monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells due to oxidized phospholipids produced during an inflammatory reaction was accompanied by a reduction in histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation (13Blüml S. Zupkovitz G. Kirchberger S. Seyerl M. Bochkov V.N. Stuhlmeier K. Majdic O. Zlabinger G.J. Seiser C. Stöckl J. Blood. 2009; 114: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we have also demonstrated that histone H3 propionylation was significantly reduced in U937 cells treated with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (14Liu B.

PMA has been demonstrated as a model inflammatory stimulus that modulates cell differentiation (15Lee J.Y. Kim N.A. Sanford A. Sullivan K.E. J. Leuk. Biol. 2003; 73: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Adachi S. Rothenberg E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3200-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Follows G.A.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5496-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). During the process of cell differentiation, several genes responsive to inflammation or the induction of cell differentiation, including TNF-α, IL-2, c-FMS, and MMA-9, that were once silent or expressed proteins at a low level in undifferentiated cells, can be reactivated by PMA treatment, accompanied by an elevated histone H3/H4 acetylation (15Lee J.Y.

However, few efforts have been made to examine genome-wide gene expression and global chromatin modifications in cell differentiation. Following our previous work (14Liu B. Lin Y.H. Darwanto A. Song X.H. Xu G.L. Zhang K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32288-32295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we reported, in this study, to use mass spectrometric approaches to differentially quantify protein expression levels in U937 cells and PMA-induced differentiated U937 cells in order to elucidate protein pathways and networks that regulate epigenetic modifications. Our results demonstrated that hypoacetylation of H3/H4 and hypoubiquitination of H2B, which is regulated by an array of pathways, including fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, protein degradation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA replication, is associated with cell differentiation. U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories Inc.), 1 mm l- glutamine (Mediatech, Inc.), and 200 units/ml penicillin and 200 μg/ml streptomycin (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in a humid incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After cells grew to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, cells were split into two halves, in one of which the medium was replaced with freshly added 1.0 μm PMA. Cells grew for 72 h without further changes of medium before harvest. Cells were first rinsed with PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and then centrifuged (19Wang N. Xu M.G. Wang P. Li L. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 2262-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A BCA assay on the protein extracts (the supernatant of previous centrifugation) was performed to determine protein concentration. Proteins were precipitated by cold acetone (precooled to −20 °C). For histone isolation and purification, the nuclei were isolated and lysed in 0.4 n H2SO4 by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to the supernatant of the centrifugation to reach a final concentration of 33% (v/v) so that histones were precipitated out. The core histones were further fractionated into H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 by reversed-phase HPLC (14Liu B. Lin Y.H. Darwanto A. Song X.H. Xu G.L. Zhang K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32288-32295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Around 300 μg of protein sample in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) and 0.1% SDS buffer solution was reduced by incubation in 10 mm DTT at 50 °C for 1 h, followed by carboxymethylation with 25 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 2 h. Proteins were precipitated using cold acetone at −20 °C overnight. The protein pellet was generated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed using a glass Pasteur pipette. The protein pellet was dissolved in 80 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer. Proteins were subsequently digested using trypsin at a protein/enzyme ratio of 40:1 (by mass), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The tandem mass tags isobaric mass tagging kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for labeling the samples following the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The U937 control protein digests were labeled with the TMT labels 128 and 130, whereas the PMA-treated protein digests were labeled with TMT labels 127 and 129. Equal amounts of the labeled control and PMA-treated protein digests were combined for MS analysis. Peptides were separated by online RPLC using an Eksigent nanoLC Ultra 1D Plus and nanoLC AS-2 Autosampler (Eksigent Technologies) coupled online with the Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. This hybrid instrument features a dual pressure ion trap configuration along with the OrbitrapTM detector and a higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) collision cell (20Olsen J.V.

A 20-cm, 75-μm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, Magic C18 analytical column (Michrom Bioresources) was used for the RPLC separations. Approximately 1 μg of protein sample was injected, and experiments were run in triplicate. For the two-dimensional separations, 10 μl of NH4Cl salt bumps were applied (10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 120, and 400 mm), and around 1 μg of sample was loaded onto a 0.32 × 100-mm SCX column (5-μm particle size; Column Technology Inc.). A precolumn (DIONEX, Pep Map100 C18, 0.30 × 5 mm, 5-μm particle size) was brought inline with the analytical column, and a 3-h gradient (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) from 5 to 30% solvent B was used for separating the peptides. The Orbitrap mass analyzer was set to acquire data at a 60,000 FWHM resolution for the parent full-scan mass spectrum, followed by data-dependent HCD MS/MS spectra for the top 10 most abundant ions acquired at a 7,500 FWHM resolution. Dynamic exclusion was applied where MS/MS was triggered twice within a repeat duration of 30 s with an exclusion list size of 500 and exclusion duration of 90 s. Data were processed and searched using the Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software suite 1.1 with MascotTM search engine and the Human IPI data base. 10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance and 0.01 Da fragment ion tolerance and MUDPIT scoring was applied with a peptide cut-off score of 10 and peptide relevance score of 1. Peptides were filtered based on a false discovery rate cut-off of 1% (strict) and 5% (relaxed). Cysteine S-carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable modification, and up to two missing cleavages were considered during MASCOT searching. A total of 2,249 proteins were identified from the combined one- and two-dimensional experiments, and a total of 42,412 peptides, including 34,138 unique peptides, were detected within the selected filtering criteria. 98% of the total peptides detected were quantified. Protein ratios were reported as the mean values for the observed peptides. 85% of the proteins identified in the one-dimensional experiments and 72% of the proteins identified in the two-dimensional experiment were quantified with less than 20% variability in the protein quantitation ratios. Quantification of histone modifications was performed by using LC-MS/MS with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (22Darwanto A. Curtis M.P. Schrag M. Kirsch W. Liu P. Xu G.L. Neidigh J.W. Zhang K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21868-21876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing equal amount of total proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-p300 or anti-CALM and analyzed by Western blot using a generic protocol, including PVDF membrane transferring, blockage of the epitope, and incubation with primary antibodies. Membranes were washed, incubated with fluoro-conjugated secondary antibodies, and imaged. For a separate aliquot of each cell lysate, a Western blot was run using anti-GAPDH as the loading control. GADPH was demonstrated not to change expression between undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells on the basis of our proteomics-based differential protein expression analysis. Whole cell extracts containing equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) from U937 and HL60 cells and their PMA-induced differentiated counterparts were incubated for 30 min with 3 μg of human recombinant histone H3 in the presence of 14C-acetyl-CoA. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by radiochromatography to determine the acetylation activity of the whole cell extracts. For p300-specific acetylation activity analysis, the assay was performed with a p300/CBP immunoprecipitation-HAT assay kit with slight modifications. Briefly, p300 proteins from the whole cells (containing 500 μg of total proteins) were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-p300. After immunoprecipitation, the protein G-agarose beads were incubated for 30 min with 50 μl of HAT assay mixture (10 μl of 5× HAT assay buffer, 20 μl of D.I. water, 10 μl of biotin-conjugated H4 peptides, and 10 μl of 100 μm acetyl-CoA containing 0.5 μCi/μl 14C-acetyl-CoA). After centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to the P81 paper squares and equilibrated with the scintillation fluid overnight before the CMP was read by a scintillation counter. Global cytosine methylation was measured by GC/MS as previously described (23Herring J.L. Rogstad D.K. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To understand the correlation between chromatin modifications and protein expression pathways, we employed TMT coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis to assess the alteration of protein expression in U937 cells when they were induced to differentiate by PMA. In order to perform cell differentiation and mass spectrometric experiments with the optimal dose of PMA, we initially treated cells with 0, 0.3, 1, and 3.0 μm PMA for 72 h and monitored cell morphology by using microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, the morphology of differentiated cells changed from the premonocytic cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells that were larger and characterized by an increased cytoplasm/nucleus ratio, paler cytoplasm, more prominent granules, a greater degree of vacuolization in the cytoplasm, and ruffled plasma membranes. Occasionally, multinucleate giant cells were also observed (24Hattori T. Pack M. Bougnoux P. Chang Z.L. Hoffman T. J. Clin. Investig. 1983; 72: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that cells were not completely differentiated upon treatment with 0.3 μm PMA. Although treatment with 3.0 μm PMA resulted in complete differentiation, ∼25% of cells were dead following such treatment, as revealed by a trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were induced to full differentiation with 1.0 μm PMA, which resulted in less than 2% cell death. Therefore, 1 μm PMA was selected for subsequent cell culture experiments. Protein expression analysis was performed by TMT-LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos instrument as outlined in supplemental Fig. S1 and described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 2,249 proteins were identified from the combined one- and two-dimensional experiments. A total of 42,412 peptides, including 34,138 unique peptides, were detected when the selected filtering criteria (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) were applied. 98% of all the identified peptides were quantified. The protein expression ratios are the mean of three LC-MS/MS runs and the average of two repeated samples that were labeled with different TMT labeling agents (supplemental Fig. S1) followed by normalization of the overall protein expression ratio (ratios from proteins with significant changes were excluded for calculation) to minimize systemic inconsistency between two samples. The quantification reproducibility between the two sample preparations of a direct comparison was measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) between the replicate protein abundance ratios in log2 scale (protein log ratio) (Fig. 1B). The excellent reproducibility suggested that we did indeed achieve a reliable protein quantification for subsequent molecular pathway analysis. From the log2 curve, 13 proteins were outliners (data points beyond the two paralleling lines ± 1 from the central line) and were not included in the final quantification results. To obtain an overview of the cellular distribution, the identified proteins were classified according to cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes using the gene ontology annotation (Fig. 1C and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). With regard to the “cellular compartment,” the top three components were cytoplasm (1,663 proteins), membrane (1,137 proteins), and nucleus (945 proteins). The full distribution map is illustrated in Fig. 1C. Several pathways, including DNA replication and repair, lysosome, and cell cycle, were overrepresented in KEGG pathways (supplemental Fig. S4). Several overrepresented domains, including MCM (replication licensing factors), PWWP (typical in methyltransferase), fn2 (plasminogen-related), and ubiquitin, were characterized by the “Pfam domains” and “InterPro domains” analysis (supplemental Fig. S4). The distribution of the changes (treated/untreated) in protein expression levels induced by PMA is illustrated in Fig. 1D. Changes greater than 1.5-fold or less than 0.67-fold were considered significant. Based on this arbitrary criterion, the majority (86% of the total) of the 2,118 quantified proteins did not exhibit significant changes, whereas 306 (14% of the total) displayed significant changes upon PMA treatment, with 159 and 147 being up- and down-regulated, respectively. The quantification results for the proteins with significant changes are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Symbols of proteins, involved in the epigenetic network and used in the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis are specifically listed in a separate column and best kept consistent with nomenclatures frequently used in the literature. Protein markers associated with cell differentiation were positively confirmed by quantitative analysis of protein expressions (supplemental Table S2). The U937 cell line, derived from a diffuse histiocytic lymphoma, has a unique and reciprocal t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation, leading to the fusion of AF10 at 10p13 to CALM at 11q14. The rearrangement of the CALM and AF10 transcripts at their breakpoints leads to the generation of a large fusion protein with 1,595 amino acids, CALM/AF10, by the joining of a nearly full-length CALM sequence (truncated of only the C-terminal four amino acids) with nearly the full-length AF10 protein, starting from amino acid 81. It has been postulated that the CALM-AF10 fusion protein is critical for the malignant phenotype of U937 (25Dreyling M.H. Martinez-Climent J.A. Zheng M. Mao J. Rowley J.D. Bohlander S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 93: 4804-4809Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A well characterized functional domain in CALM is the clathrin-binding domain located next to the N terminus. CALM interacts with clathrin, particularly through its long chain (CLTC) and associates with adaptor proteins AP-1, AP-2, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form an active clathrin-coated pit responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis of molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (26Tebar F. Bohlander S.K. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The CALM-AF10 translocations might interfere with the expression and function of the wild-type CALM similarly to the knockdown of CALM expression by siRNA (27Meyerholz A. Hinrichsen L. Groos S. Esk P.C. Brandes G. Ungewickell E.J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A malfunctioning clathrin-coated pit has the potential to severely affect the efficient trafficking of signaling receptors for normal cell differentiation (28Planque N. Cell Commun. Signal. 2006; 4: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our mass spectrometric quantification results revealed an overexpression of CALM (1.65-fold change; supplemental Table S3). Although only one peptide, ATTLSNAVSSLASTGLSLTK, was identified by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2A) and quantified by the TMT reporter ions (Fig. 2B, top), the overexpression of CALM was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a CALM-specific antibody (Fig. 2B, bottom). Although the majority of the isoforms of the adapter proteins (AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3) associated with clathrin showed no significant changes in expression, AP-2β and AP-1γ exhibited changes in expression by 1.60- and 1.25-fold, respectively (supplemental Table S3). The PIP2 kinase responsible for PIP2 synthesis, PIP2-binding protein (GSN), proteins responsible for PIP2 transport (PITPNA and PITPNM1), and the PIP2-dependent ARF1 GTPase (PAP) (29Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin.

The increase in PIP2 concentration might also emanate from the rise in ceramide concentration in the PMA-treated cells (Fig. 3C) because ceramide was found to regulate positively the PIP2 synthesis (30Dasgupta U.

Collectively, our data from the differential protein expression analysis provided substantial evidence supporting the idea that the clathrin-coated pit endocytosis pathway is up-regulated during PMA-induced cell differentiation (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S5).FIGURE 3Regulated fatty acid synthesis and metabolism during cell differentiation.

Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 618-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Probably through elevating cellular de novo biotin synthesis, PMA positively regulates acetyl-CoA synthesis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which accounts for the PMA-induced stimulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis. The induction of fatty acid synthesis is a key requirement for phagocytic differentiation of human monocytes (32Ecker J. Liebisch G. Englmaier M. Grandl M. Robenek H. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Fatty acids channel through the transporter system to undertake their cellular missions by binding to the lipid chaperones (i.e. fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP4 and FABP5)) or being directly converted by long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL3, ACSL4, and ACSL5) into transportable acyl-CoA esters (33Mashek D.G.

As shown in supplemental Table S1, FABP4/5 (FABP5 is not listed in supplemental Table S1 because the ratio is 1.4) and ACSL4/5 are overexpressed in U937 cells treated with PMA for 72 h, demonstrating an active metabolic process of fatty acids that contributes to an elevated synthesis of ceramide. The latter is further supported by the observation of a concomitant overexpression, by 2.10-fold, of CerS2 (ceramide synthetase 2) (36Kolak M. Westerbacka J. Velagapudi V.R. Wågsäter D. Yetukuri L.

To confirm the predicted PMA-induced up-regulation of ceramide, we measured ceramide concentrations in treated and untreated cells (Fig. 3C).

https://openalex.org/W1978621360,"Expression of the Arabidopsis CGS1 gene, encoding the first committed enzyme of methionine biosynthesis, is feedback-regulated in response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) at the mRNA level. This regulation is first preceded by temporal arrest of CGS1 translation elongation at the Ser-94 codon. AdoMet is specifically required for this translation arrest, although the mechanism by which AdoMet acts with the CGS1 nascent peptide remained elusive. We report here that the nascent peptide of CGS1 is induced to form a compact conformation within the exit tunnel of the arrested ribosome in an AdoMet-dependent manner. Cysteine residues introduced into CGS1 nascent peptide showed reduced ability to react with polyethyleneglycol maleimide in the presence of AdoMet, consistent with a shift into the ribosomal exit tunnel. Methylation protection and UV cross-link assays of 28 S rRNA revealed that induced compaction of nascent peptide is associated with specific changes in methylation protection and UV cross-link patterns in the exit tunnel wall. A 14-residue stretch of amino acid sequence, termed the MTO1 region, has been shown to act in cis for CGS1 translation arrest and mRNA degradation. This regulation is lost in the presence of mto1 mutations, which cause single amino acid alterations within MTO1. In this study, both the induced peptide compaction and exit tunnel change were found to be disrupted by mto1 mutations. These results suggest that the MTO1 region participates in the AdoMet-induced arrest of CGS1 translation by mediating changes of the nascent peptide and the exit tunnel wall."
https://openalex.org/W2001380965,"Chlorella virus DNA ligase (ChVLig) has pluripotent biological activity and an intrinsic nick-sensing function. ChVLig consists of three structural modules that envelop nicked DNA as a C-shaped protein clamp: a nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain and an OB domain (these two are common to all DNA ligases) as well as a distinctive β-hairpin latch module. The NTase domain, which performs the chemical steps of ligation, binds the major groove flanking the nick and the minor groove on the 3′-OH side of the nick. Here we performed a structure-guided mutational analysis of the NTase domain, surveying the effects of 35 mutations in 19 residues on ChVLig activity in vivo and in vitro, including biochemical tests of the composite nick sealing reaction and of the three component steps of the ligation pathway (ligase adenylylation, DNA adenylylation, and phosphodiester synthesis). The results highlight (i) key contacts by Thr-84 and Lys-173 to the template DNA strand phosphates at the outer margins of the DNA ligase footprint; (ii) essential contacts of Ser-41, Arg-42, Met-83, and Phe-75 with the 3′-OH strand at the nick; (iii) Arg-176 phosphate contacts at the nick and with ATP during ligase adenylylation; (iv) the role of Phe-44 in forming the protein clamp around the nicked DNA substrate; and (v) the importance of adenine-binding residue Phe-98 in all three steps of ligation. Kinetic analysis of single-turnover nick sealing by ChVLig-AMP underscored the importance of Phe-75-mediated distortion of the nick 3′-OH nucleoside in the catalysis of DNA 5′-adenylylation (step 2) and phosphodiester synthesis (step 3).

Induced fit of the nicked DNA into a distorted conformation when bound within the ligase clamp may account for the nick-sensing capacity of ChVLig. DNA ligases are ubiquitous enzymes essential for DNA replication, recombination, and repair. They seal breaks in the phosphodiester backbone by joining the 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 termini. Ligation entails three sequential nucleotidyl transfer reactions (1Ellenberger T. Tomkinson A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17365-17369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the first step, nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ by ligase results in the release of PPi or NMN and the formation of a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate in which AMP is linked via a P–N bond to the Nζ of a lysine. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′-end of the 5′-phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form DNA-adenylate (AppDNA). 2The abbreviations used are: AppDNA, DNA-adenylate; NTase, nucleotidyltransferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; Lig, ligase; ChVLig, Chlorella virus DNA ligase; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by the 3′-OH of the nick on DNA-adenylate to join the polynucleotides and liberate AMP. DNA ligases function in Okazaki fragment joining, nucleotide and base excision repair, homologous recombination, and nonhomologous end joining. In eukarya, these chores are divided among multiple ATP-dependent ligase isozymes: LigI, LigIII, and LigIV in mammals; or LigI (Cdc9) and LigIV in yeast (1Ellenberger T. Tomkinson A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Eukaryal cellular ligases are large polypeptides consisting of a core catalytic unit, composed of a nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain and an OB domain and embellished by a large globular DNA-binding domain (DBD), plus additional isozyme-specific structural modules (3Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Cotner-Gohara E. Kim I.K. Hammel M. Tainer J.A. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6165-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Homologous ATP-dependent ligases composed of core plus DBD are present in all known archaeal taxa (2Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17365-17369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), consistent with a common ancestry for the archaeal/eukaryal DNA replication machinery. Several families of eukaryal DNA viruses (such as poxviruses and baculoviruses) also encode ATP-dependent ligases composed of core plus DBD. The minimal essential features of the ATP-dependent ligase clade are exemplified by Chlorella virus DNA ligase (ChVLig) (5Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J.

ChVLig is the smallest eukaryal ligase known (298 amino acids); it lacks the large globular DBD and accessory modules found in cellular DNA ligases. Notwithstanding its compact size, ChVLig has an intrinsic nick-sensing function whereby it binds stably and with high affinity to duplex DNA containing a single 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick but not to intact duplex DNA (the ligation reaction product) (6Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nick recognition depends on the nick 5′-PO4 and covalent adenylylation of the ligase (6Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Odell M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14032-14039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The most impressive feature of ChVLig is that it is able to sustain mitotic growth, excision repair, and nonhomologous end joining in budding yeast when it is the only source of ligase in the cell (13Odell M. Malinina L. Sriskanda V. Teplova M. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, ChVLig ligase represents a stripped down “pluripotent” eukaryal ligase that can recapitulate most of the biological functions performed by the two yeast ligases. Recent studies show that ChVLig can even fulfill the essential functions of mammalian DNA ligase III in mitochondrial physiology (17Simsek D. Furda A. Gao Y. Artus J. Brunet E. Hadjantonakis A.K. Van Houten B. Shuman S. McKinnon P.J. Jasin M. Nature. 2011; 471: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The basis for nick sensing by ChVLig is illuminated by the crystal structure of the ligase-AMP intermediate bound to a nicked duplex DNA, which shows that ChVLig encircles the DNA as a C-shaped protein clamp (14Nair P.A. Nandakumar J. Smith P. Odell M. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The NTase domain (amino acids 1–189) binds to the broken and intact DNA strands in the major groove flanking the nick and also in the minor groove on the 3′-OH side of the nick (Fig. 1). The OB domain, composed of a five-stand antiparallel β-barrel and an α-helix, binds across the minor groove on the face of the duplex behind the nick (Fig. 1A). A distinctive “latch” module, consisting of a β-hairpin loop (amino acids 203–231) that emanates from the OB domain, occupies the major groove flanking the nick and completes the circumferential clamp via contacts between the tip of the loop and the surface of the NTase domain (Fig. 1, A and C). The latch is a key determinant of nick sensing (14Nair P.A. Nandakumar J. Smith P. Odell M. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The NTase domain performs the chemical steps of nick sealing. The active site is composed of a cage of β-strands and interstrand loops that includes the six peptide motifs (I, Ia, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that define the covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. The superfamily embraces ATP-dependent DNA ligases, NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, ATP-dependent RNA ligases, and GTP-dependent RNA-capping enzymes, all of which are polynucleotide 5′-end-modifying enzymes that act through a lysyl-Nζ-NMP intermediate (18Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Motif I (25TPKIDGIR32 in ChVLig) contains the lysine to which AMP becomes covalently linked in the first step of the DNA ligase reaction. The motif I lysine nucleophile is located in a loop between the two antiparallel β-sheets that form the adenylate-binding pocket. Other amino acids in motifs I, Ia, III, IIIa, IV, and V contact AMP or the DNA nick and are thought to play essential roles in one or more steps of the ligation pathway, as surmised from the mutational effects on ChVLig activity in vitro or in vivo (6Sriskanda V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Initial mutational analyses of the NTase domain of ChVLig focused on amino acids within the conserved peptide motifs. Ten individual residues of the NTase domain were identified as critical for ChVLig function: Lys-27 (the site of covalent AMP attachment), Asp-28, Gly-30, and Arg-32 in motif I; Arg-42 in motif Ia; Asp-65 and Glu-67 in motif III; Phe-98 in motif IIIa; Glu-161 in motif IV; and Lys-186 and Lys-188 in motif V (6Sriskanda V.

Reference to the crystal structures of free and nick-bound ChVLig-adenylate (10Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D.B. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 14: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) revealed atomic contacts with AMP or other critical amino acids that could plausibly account for the essentiality of these side chains (Fig. 1A). Here, we used the ChVLig-AMP·DNA crystal structure to guide a new round of mutational analysis of the NTase domain, focusing on the side chains that make atomic contacts to the nicked DNA duplex. We also interrogated the roles of residues that interact with the adenine of lysyl-AMP and of the side chains comprising the kissing interface of the NTase domain with the latch. We thereby identified amino acid functional groups essential for nick sealing in vitro and in vivo. New mechanistic insights were gleaned from an analysis of mutational effects on individual steps of the ligation pathway. Missense mutations were introduced by PCR into the pET-ChVLig expression plasmid as described previously (6Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The entire ChVLig insert was sequenced in every case to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during PCR amplification and cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Mutant and wild-type ligases were purified from the soluble lysates of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells by nickel-agarose chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography as described (6Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations for the recombinant WT and mutant ChVLig preparations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots (nominally 6 μg as measured by dye binding) of the ChVLig preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), and polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue dye (supplemental Fig. S1). The gels were then scanned with a Kodak ImagePro 4000R instrument. Image Gauge software was then used to obtain a densitometric profile of each ChVLig electropherogram as follows: (i) full-length scans of individual lanes were collected through the centers of the lanes using a bandwidth of ∼60% of the total lane width; (ii) the intensity profile for each lane was base line-corrected; and (iii) the areas under the peaks corresponding to ChVLig and any contaminating peptides were determined. The percent purity of each preparation was then calculated as the ratio of the ChVLig peak to the sum off all peak intensities in the lane. The results are as follows: WT, 83%; K5A, 79%; T25A, 84%; S41A, 86%; R42A, 83%; R42K, 82%; R42Q, 89%; T43A, 80%; F44A, 87%; F44L, 83%; T43A/K45A, 82%; F75A, 80%; F75L, 94%; M83A, 91%; M83K, 83%; M83Q, 70%; T84A, 94%; T84S, 94%; T84V, 95%; F98A, 94%; F98L, 83%; R166A, 94%; R166K, 92%; R166Q, 94%; K173A, 94%; K173Q, 95%; K173R, 95%; R176A, 93%; R176K, 96%; and R176Q, 93%; T178A, 87%. The WT purity value was then used to determine the amount of WT ChVLig protein corresponding to the integrated area under the ChVLig polypeptide peak. The amounts of the mutant ChVLig protein were calculated by scaling the integrated areas under the mutant ChVLig polypeptide peaks to that of WT ChVLig. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 pmol of singly nicked 36-bp duplex DNA substrate (5′ 32P-labeled at the nick, prepared as described (19Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)), and wild-type or mutant ChVLig as specified were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. Single-turnover nick ligation mixtures lacked exogenous ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ChVLig and quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 90% formamide, 40 mm EDTA. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 45 mm Tris borate, 1.25 mm EDTA. The extent of ligation was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Ligation was plotted as a function of input ChVLig, with each datum being the average of three separate enzyme titration experiments. The specific activities of the wild-type and mutant ligases were determined from the slopes of the titration curves. The activities of the mutant ligases were normalized to the specific activity of wild-type ChVLig protein that was purified in parallel with that mutant and assayed in parallel using the same preparation of radiolabeled DNA substrate. NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing the wild-type and mutated ChVLig ORFs were excised from their respective pET-ChVLig plasmids and inserted into the yeast expression plasmid pYX1 (CEN TRP1), wherein the ChVLIG gene is driven by the yeast TPI1 promoter. The pYX1-ChVLig plasmids were transformed into a yeast cdc9Δ strain bearing a CEN URA3 CDC9 plasmid (16Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Trp+ isolates were streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Lethal mutations were those that formed no FOA-resistant colonies at 18, 30, or 37 °C (scored as minus (−) at all temperatures in Table 1). The viable cdc9Δ ChVLIG yeast strains were tested for growth on YPD agar at 18, 30, and 37 °C. In Table 1, +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from a cdc9Δ strain expressing wild-type ChV ligase, ++ indicates smaller colony size, and − indicates no growth.TABLE 1Mutational effects on ChVLig activity in vivo and in vitroMutantNick sealingcdc9Δ complementation18 °C30 °C37 °C% WTK5A108+++++++++T25A64+++++++++S41A20−−−R42A0.7−−−R42K60+++++++++R42Q0.5−−−T43A139+++++++++F44A20−−−F44L71+++++++++K45A111+++++++++T43A/K45A28−−−R48A160+++++++++F75A4−−−F75L61−−−Q76A/T79A55+++++++++S80A166+++++++++T79A/S80A128+++++++++M83A20−−−M83Q28++++++++M83K3++−−T84A15−−−T84S39+++++++++T84V15−−−F98A0.6+++−−F98L5−−−R166A0.1+++−−R166K14−−−R166Q<0.1−−−K173A13−−−K173R8−−−K173Q11−−−R176A8−−−R176K3−−−R176Q15++++++T178A69++++++ Open table in a new tab The ChVLig NTase domain binds along the face of the DNA helix overlying the nick. An interstrand loop, 173KFGRST178, engages the major groove on the 5′-PO4 side of the nick. The outer limit of the ligase footprint on the 5′-PO4 side of the nick is demarcated by contacts from Thr-178 Oγ and Lys-173 Nζ to two vicinal phosphates along the major groove of the template DNA strand (Fig. 1, A and C). The nick terminal 5′-PO4 is coordinated by Arg-176 (Fig. 1, A and C). Here we mutated Lys-173, Arg-176, and Thr-178 to alanine. An α-helix of the NTase domain (75FQDTTSAVMTG85) inserts into the minor groove on the 3′-OH side of the nick, making contacts to the phosphates and nucleoside sugars (Fig. 1, A and B). At the proximal end of the α-helix, Phe-75 makes van der Waals contacts to the 3′-terminal sugar that impart an A-like conformation to the terminal base pair. Gln-76, Thr-79, Met-83, and Thr-84 also make van der Waals interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the strands across the minor groove (Fig. 1B). The α-helix donates hydrogen bonds from Ser-80 Oγ and the Gly-85 amide to two adjacent phosphates of the template DNA strand remote from the nick (Fig. 1, A and B). The Arg-48 side chain (motif Ia) is situated near the distal end of the α-helix; Arg-48 projects into the minor groove and makes water-mediated contacts to a sugar and an adjacent nucleobase of the 3′-OH strand (Fig. 1, A and B). Here we probed the roles of residues Arg-48, Phe-75, Gln-76, Thr-79, Ser-80, Met-83, and Thr-84 by replacing them with alanine singly or in pairs. The rest of the 41SRTFKPIR48 motif Ia surface loop comprises a major component of the DNA-binding site. Residues Ser-41, Thr-43. and Lys-45 donate hydrogen bonds to the second and third phosphates of the broken 3′-OH strand flanking the nick; the phosphate of the terminal nucleotide on the 3′-OH side of the nick is engaged by Arg-42 in the major groove (Fig. 1, B and C). Here we introduced mutations at Ser-41, Arg-42, Thr-43, and Lys-45. The clamp-closing interface between the tip of the latch loop and the NTase domain is shown in Fig. 1C. It entails a network of van der Waals contacts from Phe-215 and Tyr-217 of the latch and Phe-44 (in motif Ia) and Lys-5 of the NTase domain. Here we mutated Lys-5 and Phe-44 to alanine. We also extended the mutational analysis to three residues of the adenylate-binding pocket that engage the adenine nucleobase: Phe-98 (motif IIIa), which forms a π-stack on the purine ring; Thr-25 (motif I), which makes a hydrogen bond to adenine-N6 and a water-mediated contact to adenine-N1; and Arg-166 (motif IV), which coordinates the same bridging water to adenine-N1 as does Thr-25 and which also tethers the motif IV β-strand to the nearby motif IIIa β-strand via a salt bridge to Asp-99 (Fig. 1C). A deletion of the gene encoding the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP-dependent DNA ligase Cdc9 can be complemented by expression of ChVLig (16Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Viability of the yeast cdc9Δ strain is contingent on maintenance of an extrachromosomal CDC9 gene on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Hence, cdc9Δ cells cannot grow on medium containing FOA (a drug that selects against the URA3 CDC9 plasmid), but they can grow on FOA if the cells have been transformed with a CEN TRP1 plasmid expressing wild-type ChVLIG under the control of the constitutive yeast TPI1 promoter. Here we tested by the plasmid shuffle assay (16Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) whether the 20 ChVLig-Ala mutants were functional in yeast. We found that eight single-alanine mutations were lethal in vivo, i.e. the ChVLIG-Ala alleles were unable to support growth of cdc9Δ on FOA at 18, 30, or 37 °C (scored as minus (−) in Table 1). The lethal changes were S41A, R42A, F44A, F75A, M83A, T84A, K173A, and R176A, of which all but F44A entailed subtraction of atomic contacts between ChVLig and the nicked DNA. Nine of the ChVLIG-Ala alleles supported growth of cdc9Δ cells on FOA at one or more of the selection temperatures. Six of the viable cdc9Δ ChVLIG-Ala strains grew as well as the “wild-type” cdc9Δ ChVLIG strain on YPD agar medium at 18, 30, and 37 °C as gauged by colony size (scored as +++ in Table 1). The fully functional single-Ala mutants were K5A (at the latch-NTase interface), T25A (in the adenine pocket), and T43A, K45A, R48A, and S80A (at the DNA interface). Double-Ala mutants Q76A/T79A and T79/S80A were also fully active in yeast as gauged by growth on rich medium at 18–37 °C (Table 1). By contrast, combining the benign T43A and K45A mutations resulted in lethality at all temperatures tested (Table 1). We surmise that Thr-43 and Lys-45, which contact adjacent phosphates of the 3′-OH strand, are functionally redundant in vivo. Three of the viable mutants displayed hypomorphic growth phenotypes of varying severity. The mildest was ChVLIG-T178A, which formed smaller colonies than wild-type ChVLIG yeast at all temperatures (scored as ++ in Table 1). Severe conditional lethality was seen with strains ChVLIG-F98A and ChVLIG-R166A, which displayed +++ growth at 18 °C but failed to grow at 30 or 37 °C (Table 1). We tested the effects of conservative substitutions for nine of the 10 amino acids identified above in the alanine scan as essential or conditionally essential per se for ChVLig function in vivo: Arg-42, Phe-44, Phe-75, Met-83, Thr-84, Phe-98, Arg-166, Lys-173, and Arg-176. (We eschewed further mutation of the Ser-41, insofar as it is obvious that subtraction of the hydroxyl group accounts for the lethality of S41A.) Arg-42 and Arg-176 were replaced with lysine and glutamine; Phe-44, Phe-75, and Phe-98 with leucine; Met-83 with glutamine and lysine; Thr-84 with serine and valine; and Lys-173 with arginine and glutamine. The conservative mutants were tested for activity in yeast cdc9Δ complementation. The results are compiled in Table 1. Distinct structure-activity relationships were observed at the three essential arginines. At Arg-42, full cdc9Δ complementation activity was restored by lysine (+++ growth at all temperatures), but glutamine was lethal, implying that the ionic interaction of this side chain with the first phosphodiester of the 3′-OH strand seen in the crystal structure is the pertinent property, which can be fulfilled by either arginine or lysine. By contrast, Arg-166 could not be replaced functionally by either lysine or glutamine. Indeed, the R166K and R166Q alleles were less active in vivo than R166A, insofar as they did not support the growth of cdc9Δ cells at 18 °C (Table 1). Introducing glutamine in lieu of Arg-176 restored in vivo activity, seen as ++ growth of ChVLIG-R176Q cells at 18–37 °C, whereas the conservative R176K change was lethal (Table 1). We surmised that neutral hydrogen bond donation from this residue to the nick 5′-PO4 was the relevant property. Distinct structure-activity relationships were also seen at the three essential phenylalanines. Full activity in vivo was restored when Phe-44 was replaced by leucine (Table 1), signifying that the aromatic ring is not critical. The aliphatic γ-branched leucine is a partial isostere of Phe and should be capable of sustaining the van der Waals contacts to its Cγ and Cδ atoms (from latch residue Phe-215) that apparently stabilize the DNA ligase clamp (Fig. 1C). By contrast, leucine was inactive in lieu of Phe-98 (Table 1), which attests to the essentiality of the aromatic π-stacking interaction with the adenine base of the lysyl-AMP adduct (Fig. 1C). Leucine was also inactive in place of Phe-75, thereby underscoring the importance of the van der Waals contacts of the Phe-75 Cζ atom with the 3′-terminal nucleoside sugar at the nick (Fig. 1B). Lys-173 was strictly essential for ChVLig activity in vivo, i.e. the K173R and K173Q alleles were lethal (Table 1). These results stress the importance of the ionic contacts of Lys-173 with the DNA phosphodiester backbone and the prospect that the bulkier arginine side chain imposes steric hindrance at the protein-DNA interface. The bifurcated contacts of Thr-84 Oγ with the DNA backbone appear to be the pertinent factors at this essential position, insofar as serine substitution restored full activity, whereas valine (an apolar isostere) was lethal (Table 1). Finally, replacing Met-83 with glutamine revised ligase activity, whereas lysine did not (Table 1). We speculate that Met and Gln, which have similar side chain lengths, can sustain pertinent van der Waals contacts to DNA (Fig. 1B), whereas the longer lysine side chain creates a steric clash at the DNA interface. The wild-type and mutated ChVLig proteins were produced as N-terminal His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose and phosphocellulose chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The extent of ligation of a singly nicked 36-bp DNA substrate (labeled with 32P at the 5′-PO4 of a centrally placed 3′-OH/5′PO4 nick) by wild-type ChVLig and each mutant was gauged as a function of input enzyme. To determine specific activities, the nick sealing data from three independent enzyme titration experiments were averaged, and the mean values for ligation (fmol of nicks sealed) were plotted versus fmol of input ChVLig. The specific activities were calculated (in Prism) from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence and then normalized to the wild-type specific activity of 70 fmol of nicks sealed/fmol of ChVLig (defined as 100%). The results are compiled in Table 1. Our operational definition of a functionally important residue is one at which alanine substitution reduced specific activity in nick joining to ≤25% of wild-type ChVLig. An essential residue is one at which alanine mutatio"
https://openalex.org/W1975019100,"A number of recent studies have shown that heparan sulfate can control several important biological events on the cell surface through changes in sulfation pattern. The in vivo modification of sugar chains with sulfates, however, is complicated, and the discrimination of different sulfation patterns is difficult. Heparin, which is primarily produced by mast cells, is closely approximated by the structural analog heparan sulfate. Screening of heparin-associating peptides using phage display and antithrombin-bound affinity chromatography identified a peptide, heparin-associating peptide Y (HappY), that acts as a target of immobilized heparin. The peptide consists of 12 amino acid residues with characteristic three arginines and exclusively binds to heparin and heparan sulfate but does not associate with other glycosaminoglycans. HappY recognizes three consecutive monosaccharide residues in heparin through its three arginine residues. HappY should be a useful probe to detect heparin and heparan sulfate in studies of glycobiology."
