https://openalex.org/W2105694586,"RNA-binding proteins are key regulators of gene expression, yet only a small fraction have been functionally characterized. Here we report a systematic analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by RNA-binding proteins, encompassing 205 distinct genes from 24 diverse eukaryotes. The sequence specificities of RNA-binding proteins display deep evolutionary conservation, and the recognition preferences for a large fraction of metazoan RNA-binding proteins can thus be inferred from their RNA-binding domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in vitro correlate well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of post-transcriptional regulation, enabling new insights into the functions of RNA-binding proteins both in normal physiology and in human disease. These data provide an unprecedented overview of RNA-binding proteins and their targets, and constitute an invaluable resource for determining post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes."

However, gene therapy has been challenging to translate to the clinic, often because the therapeutic gene is expressed at insufficient levels in the patient or because the gene delivery vector integrates near protooncogenes, which can cause leukemia (see the Perspective by Verma ). Biffi et al. ( 1233158 , published online 11 July) and Aiuti et al. ( 1233151 ; published online 11 July) report progress on both fronts in gene therapy trials of three patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a neurodegenerative disorder, and three patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an immunodeficiency disorder. Optimized lentiviral vectors were used to introduce functional MLD or WAS genes into the patients' hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ex vivo, and the transduced cells were then infused back into the patients, who were then monitored for up to 2 years. In both trials, the patients showed stable engraftment of the transduced HSC and high expression levels of functional MLD or WAS genes. Encouragingly, there was no evidence of lentiviral vector integration near proto-oncogenes, and the gene therapy treatment halted disease progression in most patients. A longer follow-up period will be needed to further validate efficacy and safety."
https://openalex.org/W2037417031,"Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that light can be confined within a planar dielectric photonic crystal slab even though the frequency of this optical bound state is inside the continuous spectrum of extended states from the same symmetry group. The confinement of light has many practical applications — in optical fibres, waveguides and photonics for instance — but current methods of confinement all use materials or systems such as metallic mirrors that forbid outgoing waves. Here Chia Wei Hsu et al. demonstrate a new approach to confinement that does not rely on mirrors. The authors calculate and go on to show experimentally that for a patterned dielectric slab certain stable optical 'bound states' exist that trap light even though outgoing waves are allowed in the surrounding medium. This new method of trapping electromagnetic waves has wavevector and wavelength selectivity, so is suitable for optical filters, modulators and waveguides. In addition, it can be used with electronic and mechanical waves as well as light. The ability to confine light is important both scientifically and technologically. Many light confinement methods exist, but they all achieve confinement with materials or systems that forbid outgoing waves. These systems can be implemented by metallic mirrors, by photonic band-gap materials1, by highly disordered media (Anderson localization2) and, for a subset of outgoing waves, by translational symmetry (total internal reflection1) or by rotational or reflection symmetry3,4. Exceptions to these examples exist only in theoretical proposals5,6,7,8. Here we predict and show experimentally that light can be perfectly confined in a patterned dielectric slab, even though outgoing waves are allowed in the surrounding medium. Technically, this is an observation of an ‘embedded eigenvalue’9—namely, a bound state in a continuum of radiation modes—that is not due to symmetry incompatibility5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Such a bound state can exist stably in a general class of geometries in which all of its radiation amplitudes vanish simultaneously as a result of destructive interference. This method to trap electromagnetic waves is also applicable to electronic12 and mechanical waves14,15."

https://openalex.org/W2104007338,"Obesity is highly prevalent, and its incidence is increasing. The previous study showing a major effect of paternal obesity on metabolic health of offspring is confounded by comorbidity with diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of diet-induced paternal obesity, in the absence of diabetes, on the metabolic health of two resultant generations and the molecular profiles of the testes and sperm. Founder (F0) male C57BL6 mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a control diet (CD); n = 10/diet for a period of 10 wk. Testis expression of mRNA/microRNAs was analyzed by microarray and qPCR and sperm microRNA abundance by qPCR. Two subsequent generations were generated by mating F0 and then F1 mice to CD mice, and their metabolic health was investigated. All mice, other than F0 males, were maintained on a CD. HFD feeding induced paternal obesity with a 21% increase in adiposity, but not overt diabetes, and initiated intergenerational transmission of obesity and insulin resistance in two generations of offspring. This distinct phenotypic constellation is either partially or fully transmitted to both female and male F1 offspring and further transmitted through both parental lineages to the F2 generation, with a heightened effect on female F1 offspring (+67% in adiposity) and their F2 sons (+24% in adiposity). Founder male obesity altered the testes expression of 414 mRNAs by microarray and 11 microRNAs by qPCR, concomitant with alterations in sperm microRNA content and a 25% reduction in global methylation of germ cell DNA. Diet-induced paternal obesity modulates sperm microRNA content and germ cell methylation status, which are potential signals that program offspring health and initiate the transmission of obesity and impaired metabolic health to future generations. This study implicates paternal obesity in the transgenerational amplification of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2066171290,"Whence the “Eat Me” Signal? Cells are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, the composition of which is asymmetrical and serves as a marker of the physiological status of the cell. The phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), is normally found only on the inner leaflet of the membrane, but in dying cells it appears on the cell surface, thus providing the phagocytes tasked with cleaning up such cellular debris with a way to recognize cells undergoing cell death. Such movement of phospholipids within the membrane requires an elusive enzyme known as a scramblase. Suzuki et al. (p. 403 ; published online 11 July) identified an enzyme, Xkr8, which appears to act as a scramblase that promotes exposure of PtdSer on the surface of dying mammalian cells. Consistent with such a role, Xkr8 was activated after cleavage by caspase 3, a key protease that promotes apoptotic cell death. Genetic studies with the homolog of Xkr8 expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans indicated that the protein played a similar role in tagging dead cells in the nematode worm during development."
https://openalex.org/W2021845634,"Icosahedral order has been suggested as the prevalent atomic motif of supercooled liquids and metallic glasses for more than half a century, because the icosahedron is highly close-packed but is difficult to grow, owing to structure frustration and the lack of translational periodicity. By means of angstrom-beam electron diffraction of single icosahedra, we report experimental observation of local icosahedral order in metallic glasses. All the detected icosahedra were found to be distorted with partially face-centered cubic symmetry, presenting compelling evidence on geometric frustration of local icosahedral order in metallic glasses."
https://openalex.org/W2093486460,"Cell-surface receptors frequently use scaffold proteins to recruit cytoplasmic targets, but the rationale for this is uncertain. Activated receptor tyrosine kinases, for example, engage scaffolds such as Shc1 that contain phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding (PTB) domains. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, here we show that mammalian Shc1 responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation through multiple waves of distinct phosphorylation events and protein interactions. After stimulation, Shc1 rapidly binds a group of proteins that activate pro-mitogenic or survival pathways dependent on recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor to Shc1 pTyr sites. Akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation of Shc1 Ser 29 then recruits the Ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase. This is followed by a sub-network of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, trafficking and signal termination that binds Shc1 with delayed kinetics, largely through the SgK269 pseudokinase/adaptor protein. Ptpn12 acts as a switch to convert Shc1 from pTyr/Grb2-based signalling to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. The Shc1 scaffold therefore directs the temporal flow of signalling information after EGF stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1966587629,"The narrow rings seen in some debris disks, thought to be evidence for hidden exoplanets, might instead be caused by gas–dust interaction and a recently identified photoelectric instability. Structures seen in debris disks around young stars — in their equivalents of the Kuiper Belt in our Solar System — are usually taken as evidence for the gravitational influence of unseen planets. Here Wladimir Lyra and Marc Kuchner demonstrate that interactions between dust and gas alone can account for the narrow eccentric rings and other features that were thought diagnostic for the presence of planets. Previous analyses largely ignored the fact that debris disks contain small quantities of gas. This model may explain why a pair of planets predicted in the debris disk around a nearby star called Fomalhaut has so far not been found: if the system contains sufficient gas it may be that, and not unseen planets, causing the observed ring patterns. ‘Debris disks’ around young stars (analogues of the Kuiper Belt in our Solar System) show a variety of non-trivial structures attributed to planetary perturbations and used to constrain the properties of those planets1,2,3. However, these analyses have largely ignored the fact that some debris disks are found to contain small quantities of gas4,5,6,7,8,9, a component that all such disks should contain at some level10,11. Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio of about unity4,5,6,7,8,9, at which the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk cannot be ignored12,13. Here we report linear and nonlinear modelling that shows that dust–gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns attributed to planets. We find a robust clumping instability that organizes the dust into narrow, eccentric rings, similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk14. The conclusion that such disks might contain planets is not necessarily required to explain these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2013852459,"In 2012 a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, associated with severe respiratory disease emerged in the Arabian Peninsula. To date, 55 human cases have been reported, including 31 fatal cases. Several of the cases were likely a result of human-to-human transmission. The emergence of this novel coronavirus prompts the need for a small animal model to study the pathogenesis of this virus and to test the efficacy of potential intervention strategies. In this study we explored the use of Syrian hamsters as a small animal disease model, using intratracheal inoculation and inoculation via aerosol. Clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological lesions, cytokine upregulation nor seroconversion were observed in any of the inoculated animals, indicating that MERS-CoV does not replicate in Syrian hamsters."

Brodsky and Lajoie (p. 543 , published online 11 July) compared the historical rates of seismicity—after correcting for the occurrence of aftershocks—to operational parameters at the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in southern California. The net volume of fluid extracted and injected was correlated with recent seismicity. However, since the 1980s, when the first plant came online, the rate of earthquakes induced with additional increments of volume injected has decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2090859123,"Ventricular tachycardia, a life-threatening regular and repetitive fast heart rhythm, frequently occurs in the setting of myocardial infarction. Recently, the peri-infarct zones surrounding the necrotic scar (termed gray zones) have been shown to correlate with ventricular tachycardia inducibility. However, it remains unknown how the latter is determined by gray zone distribution and size. The goal of this study is to examine how tachycardia circuits are maintained in the infarcted heart and to explore the relationship between the tachycardia organizing centers and the infarct gray zone size and degree of heterogeneity. To achieve the goals of the study, we employ a sophisticated high-resolution electrophysiological model of the infarcted canine ventricles reconstructed from imaging data, representing both scar and gray zone. The baseline canine ventricular model was also used to generate additional ventricular models with different gray zone sizes, as well as models in which the gray zone was represented as different heterogeneous combinations of viable tissue and necrotic scar. The results of the tachycardia induction simulations with a number of high-resolution canine ventricular models (22 altogether) demonstrated that the gray zone was the critical factor resulting in arrhythmia induction and maintenance. In all models with inducible arrhythmia, the scroll-wave filaments were contained entirely within the gray zone, regardless of its size or the level of heterogeneity of its composition. The gray zone was thus found to be the arrhythmogenic substrate that promoted wavebreak and reentry formation. We found that the scroll-wave filament locations were insensitive to the structural composition of the gray zone and were determined predominantly by the gray zone morphology and size. The findings of this study have important implications for the advancement of improved criteria for stratifying arrhythmia risk in post-infarction patients and for the development of new approaches for determining the ablation targets of infarct-related tachycardia."
https://openalex.org/W1965073175,"The overall antibiotic resistance of a bacterial population results from the combination of a wide range of susceptibilities displayed by subsets of bacterial cells. Bacterial heteroresistance to antibiotics has been documented for several opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria, but the mechanism of heteroresistance is unclear. We use Burkholderia cenocepacia as a model opportunistic bacterium to investigate the implications of heterogeneity in the response to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B (PmB) and also other bactericidal antibiotics. Here, we report that B. cenocepacia is heteroresistant to PmB. Population analysis profiling also identified B. cenocepacia subpopulations arising from a seemingly homogenous culture that are resistant to higher levels of polymyxin B than the rest of the cells in the culture, and can protect the more sensitive cells from killing, as well as sensitive bacteria from other species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Communication of resistance depended on upregulation of putrescine synthesis and YceI, a widely conserved low-molecular weight secreted protein. Deletion of genes for the synthesis of putrescine and YceI abrogate protection, while pharmacologic inhibition of putrescine synthesis reduced resistance to polymyxin B. Polyamines and YceI were also required for heteroresistance of B. cenocepacia to various bactericidal antibiotics. We propose that putrescine and YceI resemble ""danger"" infochemicals whose increased production by a bacterial subpopulation, becoming more resistant to bactericidal antibiotics, communicates higher level of resistance to more sensitive members of the population of the same or different species."
https://openalex.org/W2026338038,"The upper respiratory tract microbiome has an important role in respiratory health. Influenza A is a common viral infection that challenges that health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia. Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics. We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60 universal target amplification and sequencing. Profiles were examined at the phylum and nearest neighbor “species” levels using the characteristics of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences. At the nearest neighbor “species” level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 “species” and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age. Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota. A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables. To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study. A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute bacterial quantification was observed. This study represents the first examination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome using a target other than the 16S rRNA gene and to our knowledge, the first thorough examination of this microbiome during a viral infection."

https://openalex.org/W2134023514,"Transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins have been adopted worldwide, notably in developing countries. In spite of their success in controlling target pests while allowing a substantial reduction of insecticide use, the sustainable control of these pest populations is threatened by the evolution of resistance. The implementation of the “high dose/refuge” strategy for managing insect resistance in transgenic crops aims at delaying the evolution of resistance to Bt crops in pest populations by promoting survival of susceptible insects. However, a crucial condition for the “high dose/refuge” strategy to be efficient is that the inheritance of resistance should be functionally recessive. Busseola fusca developed high levels of resistance to the Bt toxin Cry 1Ab expressed in Bt corn in South Africa. To test whether the inheritance of B. fusca resistance to the Bt toxin could be considered recessive we performed controlled crosses with this pest and evaluated its survival on Bt and non-Bt corn. Results show that resistance of B. fusca to Bt corn is dominant, which refutes the hypothesis of recessive inheritance. Survival on Bt corn was not lower than on non-Bt corn for both resistant larvae and the F1 progeny from resistant × susceptible parents. Hence, resistance management strategies of B. fusca to Bt corn must address non-recessive resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2002905649,"Prion diseases are unique pathologies in which the infectious particles are prions, a protein aggregate. The prion protein has many particular features, such as spontaneous aggregation, conformation transmission to other native PrP proteins and transmission from an individual to another. Protein aggregation is now frequently associated to many human diseases, for example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or type 2 diabetes. A few proteins associated to these conformational diseases are part of a new category of proteins, called prionoids: proteins that share some, but not all, of the characteristics associated with prions. The p53 protein, a transcription factor that plays a major role in cancer, has recently been suggested to be a possible prionoid. The protein has been shown to accumulate in multiple cancer cell types, and its aggregation has also been reproduced in vitro by many independent groups. These observations suggest a role for p53 aggregates in cancer development. This study aims to test the «prion-like» features of p53. Our results show in vitro aggregation of the full length and N-terminally truncated protein (p53C), and penetration of these aggregates into cells. According to our findings, the aggregates enter cells using macropinocytosis, a non-specific pathway of entry. Lastly, we also show that once internalized by the cell, p53C aggregates can co-aggregate with endogenous p53 protein. Together, these findings suggest prion-like characteristics for p53 protein, based on the fact that p53 can spontaneously aggregate, these aggregates can penetrate cells and co-aggregate with cellular p53."

Subjects were either naïve or had watched a conspecific demonstration, and either faced all devices at once or incrementally. One naïve subject solved the problem without demonstration and with all locks present within the first five sessions (each consisting of one trial of up to 20 minutes), while five others did so after social demonstrations or incremental experience. Performance was aided by species-specific traits including neophilia, a haptic modality and persistence. Most birds showed a ratchet-like progress, rarely failing to solve a stage once they had done it once. In most transfer tests subjects reacted flexibly and sensitively to alterations of the locks' sequencing and functionality, as expected from the presence of predictive inferences about mechanical interactions between the locks."

However, the lack of appropriate combined functional and structural assays has generally hindered attempts to elucidate patterns of positively selected sites and their effects on enzyme activity and substrate specificity.

However, the lack of appropriate combined functional and structural assays has generally hindered attempts to elucidate patterns of positively selected sites and their effects on enzyme activity and substrate specificity. Glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18) comprise a large, ubiquitous gene family of multifunctional proteins that mainly catalyze the conjugation of intracellular glutathione (GSH) to a wide variety of electrophilic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic molecules of endogenous or exogenous origin. Detoxification of xenobiotics is considered to be the main function of plant GSTs, but other functions include protecting cells from diverse biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pathogens, heavy metal toxins, oxidative agents, and UV radiation (12.Loyall L. Uchida K. Braun S. Furuya M. Frohnmeyer H.

Because of the diversity of potential xenobiotics and stressors, functional divergence of this enzyme family has major adaptive significance. Accordingly, the supergene GST family displays extensive functional diversification in gene expression, enzymatic activities, and substrate specificities (2.Lan T. Yang Z.L. Yang X. Liu Y.J.

Extensive functional diversification of the Populus glutathione S-transferase supergene family.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3749-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3.Dixon D.P. Hawkins T.

Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, although much is known about the biochemistry of GST, little attention has been paid to the patterns of selective pressures that have directed its evolutionary divergence and acquisition of novel activities. The molecular mechanisms that create structural modifications of protein copies and the subsequent evolutionary genetic processes that fix mutations, alter functions, and improve adaptation should differ among plant lineages due to differences in selective pressures associated with differences in their life history traits. Gymnosperms are a large group of plants with a long evolutionary history. Many are important coniferous components of northern ecosystems and valuable forestry trees. Unlike annual plants, the perennial conifers have long generation times, large effective population sizes, and wide distributions over heterogeneous mountainous regions. These life history traits could theoretically favor mutations that facilitate adaptation to changing environments. However, due to the lack of genome information, knowledge of the functional, structural, and selective aspects of natural enzyme family evolution in conifers is limited. In this study we used a combined evolutionary and experimental approach to elucidate evolution and selection in the GST gene family in Pinus tabuliformis, a pine that is widely distributed from northern to central China including cold temperate and drought regions. It grows from 0 to 2700 m above sea level and forms extensive forests (16.Mao J.F. Wang X.R. Distinct niche divergence characterizes the homoploid hybrid speciation of Pinus densata on the Tibetan plateau.Am. Nat. 2011; 177: 424-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Through analyses of substitution and gene expression patterns, enzyme assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and structural comparisons, we examined 1) the selective context and functional divergence in the GST family in the pine and 2) the structural and functional importance of positively selected sites. Primers, based on putative Pinus taeda GST gene sequences identified from the GenBankTM EST database and listed in supplemental Table S1 were designed to amplify mRNA and genomic DNA of P. tabuliformis. Total RNA was isolated from fresh needles of P. tabuliformis using an Aurum Total RNA kit (Bio-Rad), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) Version 3.0 (TaKaRa). PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1–2 μg of template DNA, 0.1 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 200 μm each of dNTP (Invitrogen), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 pmol of each primer. Optimized PCR conditions consisted of 3-min initial denaturation at 94 °C, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C followed by a 3-min final extension step at 72 °C. PCR products were separated and recovered from a 1% agarose gel using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences), then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced in both directions to verify the gene sequences and structures. The sequences were further analyzed by the NCBI conserved domain database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to confirm the presence of typical GST N- and C-terminal domains in the putative encoded proteins. Following Edwards et al. (17.Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Plant glutathione S-transferases. Enzymes with multiple functions in sickness and in health.Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), we assigned a univocal name to each P. tabuliformis GST gene (supplemental Table S2), consisting of Pta followed by a letter denoting the subfamily class (e.g. GSTU, -F, -T, -Z, and -L corresponding to Tau, Phi, Theta, Zeta and Lambda, respectively) then a progressive number for each gene of that class (e.g. PtaGSTU1). To investigate expression patterns of GST gene family members during growth under normal conditions, we sampled five mature P. tabuliformis trees in the Beijing Botanical Garden and five 3-month-old P. tabuliformis seedlings grown in a greenhouse. We isolated total RNA from top bud, needle, root tip, and phloem (stem and root) tissues of each mature P. tabuliformis tree and young needle, stem, and root tissues of each seedling. We then amplified GST sequences in the samples using PCR, as described above, and primers listed in supplemental Table S3. The GST protein sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program (18.Edgar R.C. MUSCLE. Multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30435) Google Scholar), with subsequent manual adjustment using BioEdit (19.Hall T.A. BioEdit: a user-friendly biological sequence alignment editor and analysis program for Windows 95/98/NT.Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree of Pinus GSTs was then reconstructed using a maximum likelihood (ML) procedure by PHYML (20.Guindon S. Gascuel O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood.Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14226) Google Scholar) with the JTT (Jones, Taylor, and Thornton) amino acid substitution model. For analysis of Tau-class GSTs, members of the sister class Lambda of GSTs were used as an outgroup. One thousand bootstrap replicates were performed in each analysis to calculate the support for identified clades and nodes. We identified two major clades of P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs (Fig. 1A). To evaluate variation in selective pressure between them, we used CODEML branch models in PAML (21.Yang Z. PAML 4. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (8276) Google Scholar) to estimate the ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions (ω = dN/dS) under two a priori assumptions: a one-ratio model in which one ω value was assumed for the entire tree and a two-ratio model in which ω values were allowed to vary between the two major clades (Fig. 1A). To verify which of the models best fitted the data, likelihood ratio tests were applied by comparing twice the difference in log-likelihood values between pairs of the models using a χ2 distribution, with the degrees of freedom equal to the differences in the number of parameters between the models (22.Yang Z. Nielsen R. Estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates under realistic evolutionary models.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The branch model tests indicated that selective pressures significantly differed between the two major clades of P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs and that one clade (clade A in Fig. 1A) has undergone relaxed negative selection. Thus, we used two branch-site models (A0 and A) to test whether positive selection has occurred at some amino acid sites in clade A. Clades A and B were assigned as foreground and background branches, respectively, and Model A allowed ω to vary among sites in foreground branches, whereas Model A0 did not allow for positive selection; instead ω was fixed at a value of 1. The positive selection (A) and neutral (A0) branch-site models were evaluated using likelihood ratio tests, then the Bayes Empirical Bayes method (23.Yang Z. Wong W.S. Nielsen R. Bayes empirical bayes inference of amino acid sites under positive selection.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 1107-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) was applied to the results from Model A to identify candidate positively selected sites. To investigate the enzymatic functions of P. tabuliformis Tau GST proteins, the P. tabuliformis Tau GST genes were subcloned into pET30a expression vectors (Novagen) to obtain an N-terminal His6 tag. The primers used to construct the GST expression vectors are listed in supplemental Table S4. Colonies containing appropriate inserts were identified by sequencing. The likelihood ratio test and Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis identified five positive-selection sites with posterior probabilities >0.99. To investigate whether these sites are important for catalysis, we selected protein PtaGSTU17 as a model, subcloned PtaGSTU17 cDNA into protein vector pET30a (Novagen), then performed site-directed mutagenesis using the pET30a/PtGSTU17 plasmid as a template, the mutagenesis primers listed in supplemental Table S4, and methods described by Zeng and Wang (24.Zeng Q.Y.

Catalytic properties of glutathione-binding residues in a Tau class glutathione transferase (PtGSTU1) from Pinus tabulaeformis.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2657-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 and verified by sequencing. Expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant PtaGSTU17 proteins followed the procedures presented by Zeng et al. (25.Zeng Q.Y. Lu H. Wang X.R.

To assess the specificity of the wild-type and mutant GST enzymes, we used the following six substrates: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) and 4-nitrobenzyl chloride (NBC), as described by Habig et al. (26.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. glutathione S-transferases. The first enzymatic step in mercapturic acid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl), as described by Ricci et al. (27.Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Pastore A. Piemonte F. Federici G. Colorimetric and fluorometric assays of glutathione transferase based on 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); and the diphenyl ethers (Fluorodifen) and cumene hydroperoxide (Cum-OOH), as described by Edwards and Dixon (28.Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Plant glutathione transferases.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These substrates were frequently used to determine the enzymatic characteristics of plant GSTs (28.Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Plant glutathione transferases.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 25 °C. Protein concentrations in the enzyme preparations were determined by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm. The fluorescent dye ANS is a sensitive probe for detecting and analyzing structural changes in proteins (29.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Structural basis for the interaction of the fluorescence probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) with the antibiotic target MurA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To detect protein-folding differences between the mutant and wild-type enzymes, we obtained fluorescence measurements using a HITACHI F-4500 FL spectrophotometer after adding 100 μl of 2 mm ANS to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml enzyme (sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) in 1-ml reaction mixtures. A total of three scans each for blank and sample were collected and averaged for each enzyme. Reported spectra are the means from at least three independent experiments. Three-dimensional structures of P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs were constructed using the InsightII software package (Accelrys) and x-ray structure of a soybean Tau GST (Protein Data Bank accession number 2VO4) as template. The P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs showed 34–50% of protein sequence identity to the template protein. Initially, the sequences were aligned using the Align 2D program of the InsightII package Homology Module, structures were then automatically built using the Modeler Module, and the resulting models were evaluated by the profile-3D program. Substrate binding sites are detected as cavities present on the surface of the protein. In this study the binding sites were identified by grid analysis using the Binding-site Analysis module in InsightII. Based on the P. taeda EST database, we cloned 44 full-length genes encoding putative GST proteins from P. tabuliformis (supplemental Table S2). This list is most likely incomplete due to gaps in the currently available genome information. The predicted proteins encoded by these 44 genes were initially classified based on the NCBI conserved domain analysis, which divided them into eight classes: Tau, Phi, Theta, Zeta, DHAR, Lambda, TCHQD and EF1Bγ. The Tau GSTs were most numerous (26 members) followed by the Phi and Lambda classes (seven and three, respectively), then Zeta, DHAR, and EF1Bγ classes (two members each), and finally Theta and TCHQD classes (just one member each). Phylogenetic analysis of these P. tabuliformis GSTs with the GST family from Populus trichocarpa showed that GSTs of each subfamily class from both genomes grouped as a single clade with high bootstrap support (data not shown), which further supports the subfamily designations among the 44 P. tabuliformis GSTs. The expression patterns of 44 P. tabuliformis GST genes were examined in the radicle, seedlings, and mature tree in normal conditions. Seven Phi GSTs and all minor classes GSTs (PtaGSTL1, -2, and -3, PtaGSTZ1 and -2, PtaGSTT1, PtaDHAR1 and -2, PtaEF1Bγ1 and -2, and PtaTCHQD1) were expressed in all tissues or organs examined (Fig. 1B). But expression divergences were observed among the Tau GSTs. The phylogenetic tree showed the 26 Tau GSTs were divided into distinct two clades (clades A and B, Fig. 1A). The six genes (PtaGSTU1, -14, -25, -24, -17, and -26) in clade B were expressed in all of the tissues examined. In contrast, of the 20 Tau GSTs in clade A, only nine were expressed in all tissues. Another two (PtaGSTU11 and -19) were not detectably expressed in any tissue under normal growth and development conditions, possibly because they are expressed at sub-detectable levels. Alternatively, they may only be induced in response to treatments and/or in tissues not examined in our study, or they may be pseudogenes. The other nine Tau GSTs in clade A were selectively expressed in specific tissues (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that functional divergence is more pronounced among the Tau GST genes in clade A than in clade B. Tau class GSTs were the most numerous in plant GST gene family. Our previous study showed the moss Physcomitrella patens did not contain any Tau GST, whereas the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii had 47 Tau GSTs (30.Liu Y.J. Han X.M. Ren L.L. Yang H.L.

The GST gene families in Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, and P. trichocarpa have been previously characterized (2.Lan T. Yang Z.L. Yang X. Liu Y.J. Wang X.R. Zeng Q.Y.

Plant glutathione transferases.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (REVIEWS3004)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they reportedly contain 52, 28, and 58 Tau members, respectively. Our search of the NCBI EST database identified 35 Tau GSTs from four additional gymnosperm species: P. taeda, Gnetum gnemon, Ginkgo biloba, and Cycas rumphii (supplemental Table S5). Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of Tau GST genes in the above nine land plant species revealed two major clades (A and B, Fig. 2). Clade A contained Tau GSTs of eight seed plant species but not lycophyte, indicating that this group of GSTs might have been lost in lycophyte (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The 20 P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs of clade A in Fig. 1A grouped with other gymnosperms and formed a separate group (A2b, Fig. 2) that was diverged from angiosperm GSTs. The clade B can be divided into two major groups, B1 and B2. B1 contained GSTs from all species, whereas B2 contained only lycophyte and gymnosperm GSTs (Fig. 2). This phylogeny suggests that the B2 GSTs might have been lost in angiosperms (Fig. 3). All the six P. tabuliformis Tau GSTs of clade B in Fig. 1A were placed in clade B of Fig. 2.FIGURE 3Schematic representation of the duplication history of Tau GSTs in land plants. Gene loss events are indicated by dashed lines. The designation of each clade corresponds to the Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for significant differences in selective pressures between clades A and B in Fig. 1A, we performed a two-ratio branch model test using PAML, in which different ω (= dN/dS) values were assigned to the two clades (Table 1). The log likelihood values under the one-ratio and two-ratio models were ln L = −9394.796577 and ln L = −9378.129047, respectively. A likelihood ratio test indicated that the one-ratio model should be rejected (p < 0.001); hence, selective pressures differed between the two clades. The mean ω values for clades A and B were 0.43 and 0.20, respectively, indicating that clade B has been under stronger purifying selection, whereas some amino acid changes in clade A might have been preserved by positive selection. To test this hypothesis, we applied a branch-site test (33.Zhang J. Nielsen R. Yang Z. Evaluation of an improved branch-site likelihood method for detecting positive selection at the molecular level.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) to identify target sites that are potentially under positive selection in clade A (Table 1). For this, we assigned clades A and B as foreground and background branches, respectively, and obtained log likelihood values under the positive selection model A and the null model A0 of ln L = −9186.073757 and ln L = −9188.425166, respectively. The likelihood ratio test indicated that the null model should be rejected (p < 0.03), corroborating the hypothesis that some amino acid sites in clade A have been under positive selection. Further analysis using a Bayes empirical Bayes procedure identified five sites (alignment positions 17, 43, 87, 129, and 183; Fig. 4) that are under positive selection with posterior probabilities >0.99. The two clades differed markedly in amino acid composition at these five sites, and at two of the five sites they shared no common residues (Fig. 4). Further PAML evaluation by including Tau GSTs of P. taeda also supported the positive selection on these five sites (data not shown).TABLE 1Results of CODEML analyses of selective pattern for P. tabuliformis Tau GSTsModelEstimates of parametersaThe proportion of sites (p0, p1, …)"

The α6 subunit is closely related to the α3 subunit, and this presents a problem in designing ligands that discriminate between α6β2* and α3β2* nAChRs. We used positional scanning mutagenesis of α-conotoxin PeIA, which targets both α6β2* and α3β2*, in combination with mutagenesis of the α6 and α3 subunits, to gain molecular insights into the interaction of PeIA with heterologously expressed α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 receptors. Mutagenesis of PeIA revealed that Asn(11) was located in an important position that interacts with the α6 and α3 subunits. Substitution of Asn(11) with a positively charged amino acid essentially abolished the activity of PeIA for α3β2 but not for α6/α3β2β3 receptors. These results were used to synthesize a PeIA analog that was >15,000-fold more potent on α6/α3β2β3 than α3β2 receptors. Analogs with an N11R substitution were then used to show a critical interaction between the 11th position of PeIA and Glu(152) of the α6 subunit and Lys(152) of the α3 subunit. The results of these studies provide molecular insights into designing ligands that selectively target α6β2* nAChRs."
https://openalex.org/W1975640258,"Understanding the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses in tuberculosis is extremely important in tailoring a macrophage innate response to promote anti-tuberculosis immunity in the host. Although the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the regulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses is known, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria modulate these innate responses are not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that M. tuberculosis heat shock protein 60 (Mtbhsp60, Cpn60.1, and Rv3417c) interacts with both TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, but its interaction with TLR2 leads to clathrin-dependent endocytosis resulting in an increased production of interleukin (IL)-10 and activated p38 MAPK. Blockage of TLR2-mediated endocytosis inhibited IL-10 production but induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and activated ERK1/2. In contrast, upon interaction with TLR4, Mtbhsp60 remained predominantly localized on the cell surface due to poorer endocytosis of the protein that led to decreased IL-10 production and p38 MAPK activation. The Escherichia coli homologue of hsp60 was found to be retained mainly on the macrophage surface upon interaction with either TLR2 or TLR4 that triggered predominantly a pro-inflammatory-type immune response. Our data suggest that cellular localization of Mtbhsp60 upon interaction with TLRs dictates the type of polarization in the innate immune responses in macrophages. This information is likely to help us in tailoring the host protective immune responses against M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985717735,"The anion exchanger 1 (AE1), a member of bicarbonate transporter family SLC4, mediates an electroneutral chloride/bicarbonate exchange in physiological conditions. However, some point mutations in AE1 membrane-spanning domain convert the electroneutral anion exchanger into a Na(+) and K(+) conductance or induce a cation leak in a still functional anion exchanger. The molecular determinants that govern ion movement through this transporter are still unknown. The present study was intended to identify the ion translocation pathway within AE1. In the absence of a resolutive three-dimensional structure of AE1 membrane-spanning domain, in silico modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis experiments was done. A structural model of AE1 membrane-spanning domain is proposed, and this model is based on the structure of a uracil-proton symporter. This model was used to design cysteine-scanning mutagenesis on transmembrane (TM) segments 3 and 5. By measuring AE1 anion exchange activity or cation leak, it is proposed that there is a unique transport site comprising TM3-5 and TM8 that should function as an anion exchanger and a cation leak."

The underlying mechanisms are, however, not well understood yet. In this work, we asked if DOR activation protects the brain against ischemic injury through a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) -TrkB pathway.We exposed adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to focal cerebral ischemia, which was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). DOR agonist TAN-67 (60 nmol), antagonist Naltrindole (100 nmol) or artificial cerebral spinal fluid was injected into the lateral cerebroventricle 30 min before MCAO. Besides the detection of ischemic injury, the expression of BDNF, full-length and truncated TrkB, total CREB, p-CREB, p-ATF and CD11b was detected by Western blot and fluorescence immunostaining.DOR activation with TAN-67 significantly reduced the ischemic volume and largely reversed the decrease in full-length TrkB protein expression in the ischemic cortex and striatum without any appreciable change in cerebral blood flow, while the DOR antagonist Naltrindole aggregated the ischemic injury. However, the level of BDNF remained unchanged in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus at 24 hours after MCAO and did not change in response to DOR activation or inhibition. MCAO decreased both total CREB and pCREB in the striatum, but not in the cortex, while DOR inhibition promoted a further decrease in total and phosphorylated CREB in the striatum and decreased pATF-1 expression in the cortex. In addition, MCAO increased CD11b expression in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus, and DOR activation specifically attenuated the ischemic increase in the cortex but not in the striatum and hippocampus.DOR activation rescues TrkB signaling by reversing ischemia/reperfusion induced decrease in the full-length TrkB receptor and reduces brain injury in ischemia/reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W1985528216,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc dependent endopeptidases that can be released from neurons in an activity dependent manner to play a role in varied forms of learning and memory. MMP inhibitors impair hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), spatial memory, and behavioral correlates of drug addiction. Since MMPs are thought to influence LTP through a β1 integrin dependent mechanism, it has been suggested that these enzymes cleave specific substrates to generate integrin binding ligands. In previously published work, we have shown that neuronal activity stimulates rapid MMP dependent shedding of intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM-5), a synaptic adhesion molecule expressed on dendrites of the telencephalon. We have also shown that the ICAM-5 ectodomain can interact with β1 integrins to stimulate integrin dependent phosphorylation of cofilin, an event that occurs with dendritic spine maturation and LTP. In the current study, we investigate the potential for the ICAM-5 ectodomain to stimulate changes in α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR) dependent glutamatergic transmission. Single cell recordings show that the ICAM-5 ectodomain stimulates an increase in the frequency, but not the amplitude, of AMPA mini excitatory post synaptic currents (mEPSCs). With biotinylation and precipitation assays, we also show that the ICAM-5 ectodomain stimulates an increase in membrane levels of GluA1, but not GluA2, AMPAR subunits. In addition, we observe an ICAM-5 associated increase in GluA1 phosphorylation at serine 845. Concomitantly, ICAM-5 affects an increase in GluA1 surface staining along dendrites without affecting an increase in dendritic spine number. Together these data are consistent with the possibility that soluble ICAM-5 increases glutamatergic transmission and that post-synaptic changes, including increased phosphorylation and dendritic insertion of GluA1, could contribute. We suggest that future studies are warranted to determine whether ICAM-5 is one of a select group of synaptic CAMs whose shedding contributes to MMP dependent effects on learning and memory."

Compared with parental NU/Mock3, NU/Cap12, and NU/Cap32 cells: 1) induced higher tumor angiogenesis than NU/Mock3 cells accompanied by infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in mouse dorsal air sac assay and Matrigel plug assay; 2) showed much higher expression of CXC chemokines, MMP-1, and the potent angiogenic factor VEGF-A; 3) increased the expression of the representative inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α; 4) augmented JNK phosphorylation and nuclear expression of activator protein 1 (AP-1). Further analysis demonstrated that knockdown of AP-1 (Jun and/or Fos) resulted in down-regulation of the expression of VEGF-A, CXC chemokines, and MMP-1, and also suppressed expression of IL-1α in NDRG1-overexpressing cell lines. Treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) resulted in down-regulation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation, and the expression of VEGF-A, CXC chemokines, and MMP-1 in NU/Cap12 and NU/Cap32 cells. Finally, administration of IL-1ra suppressed both tumor angiogenesis and infiltration of macrophages by NU/Cap12 in vivo. Together, activation of JNK/AP-1 thus seems to promote tumor angiogenesis in relationship to NDRG1-induced inflammatory stimuli by gastric cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055880939,"Miscanthus is an intriguing cellulosic bioenergy feedstock because its aboveground productivity is high for low amounts of agrochemical inputs, but soil temperatures below −3.5°C could threaten successful cultivation in temperate regions. We used a combination of observed soil temperatures and the Agro-IBIS model to investigate how strategic residue management could reduce the risk of rhizome threatening soil temperatures. This objective was addressed using a historical (1978–2007) reconstruction of extreme minimum 10 cm soil temperatures experienced across the Midwest US and model sensitivity studies that quantified the impact of crop residue on soil temperatures. At observation sites and for simulations that had bare soil, two critical soil temperature thresholds (50% rhizome winterkill at −3.5°C and −6.0°C for different Miscanthus genotypes) were reached at rhizome planting depth (10 cm) over large geographic areas. The coldest average annual extreme 10 cm soil temperatures were between −8°C to −11°C across North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. Large portions of the region experienced 10 cm soil temperatures below −3.5°C in 75% or greater for all years, and portions of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin experienced soil temperatures below −6.0°C in 50–60% of all years. For simulated management options that established varied thicknesses (1–5 cm) of miscanthus straw following harvest, extreme minimum soil temperatures increased by 2.5°C to 6°C compared to bare soil, with the greatest warming associated with thicker residue layers. While the likelihood of 10 cm soil temperatures reaching −3.5°C was greatly reduced with 2–5 cm of surface residue, portions of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin still experienced temperatures colder than −3.5°C in 50–80% of all years. Nonetheless, strategic residue management could help increase the likelihood of overwintering of miscanthus rhizomes in the first few years after establishment, although low productivity and biomass availability during these early stages could hamper such efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2090171084,"Increased incidences of infectious and septic complications during post-burn courses represent the main contributor to burn injury mortality. Sustained increases in catecholamine levels, especially norepinephrine (NE), contribute to immune disturbances in severely burned patients. The precise mechanisms underlying NE-mediated immunoregulation are not fully understood. Here we hypothesize that persistently elevated NE levels are associated with immunodysfunctions. We examined the effects of NE on the phenotype and functions of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Whole mouse bone marrow cells were treated in vitro with 40 ng/mL of M-CSF and with 1 x 10-6 M or 1 x 10-8 M of NE or without NE for 7 days; cells were collected and stained with antibodies for CD11b, F4/80, MHC II and the inflammatory CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). We found 1 x 10-6 M of NE inhibited MHC II and CCR2 expression on CD11b+/F4/80+ BMM cells. It also inhibited BMM proliferation by inhibiting CSF-1R expression. On the contrary, 1 x 10-8 M of NE slightly increased both MHC II and CCR2 expression on CD11b+/F4/80+ BMM cells but inhibited CD11b+/F4/80+ BMM proliferation. MCP-1 based migration assay showed that the migration of 1 x 10-6 M of NE-treated BMM toward MCP-1 was significantly decreased compared to BMM without NE treatment. Both 1 x 10-8 M and 1 x 10-6 M of NE enhanced TNF-α production and phagocytosis of FITC-Dextran. Intracellular staining of transcriptional factor MafB showed that 1 x 10-6 M of NE treatment enhanced its expression, whereas 1 x 10-8 M of NE decreased expression. Stimulation with LPS in the last 24-hours of BMM culture further decreased CCR2 and MHC II expression of these BMM, suggesting the synergistic effect of LPS and NE on macrophage. Our results demonstrate that NE regulates macrophage differentiation, proliferation and function, and may play a critical role in the dysfunctional immune response post-burn."

Significance: Our results facilitate the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors blocking cell division. The Escherichia coli divisome is a macromolecular complex formed by at least 10 essential proteins that assemble at midcell in defined steps (1.Aarsman M.E. Piette A. Fraipont C. Vinkenvleugel T.M.

When fully assembled, this complex effects cell division through synthesis of the septal wall, cell constriction, and, ultimately, cell scission. Recruitment of the proteins to midcell occurs in a concerted, hierarchical process, starting with formation of the FtsZ ring in the cytoplasm and anchoring of the ring to the inner membrane by FtsA and ZipA (2.Vicente M. Rico A.I. The order of the ring. Assembly of Escherichia coli cell division components.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is followed by recruitment of the cell division proteins FtsK, FtsQ, FtsB, FtsL, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN (in order of dependence), all of them membrane proteins (1.Aarsman M.E. Piette A.

The FtsQBL subcomplex thus appears to connect the cytoplasmic and periplasmic events during divisome assembly through a multitude of transient interactions (2.Vicente M. Rico A.I.

Considering its essential nature, its low abundance (∼20–100 copies/cell), and its multiple interactions in the relatively accessible periplasm, FtsQ is a particularly attractive target for the development of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions that block bacterial cell division (19.Carson M.J.

The periplasmic domain is essential both for FtsQ localization and for recruitment of downstream cell division proteins to the divisome (22.Guzman L.M. Weiss D.S. Beckwith J.

It consists of two domains, designated α and β (Fig. 1A). The α domain is located directly downstream from the membrane-spanning domain and corresponds to a so-called POTRA motif that has been implicated in transient protein interactions in transporter proteins (21.van den Ent F.

The β domain is located at the C terminus and has been suggested to be involved in multiple other interactions (21.van den Ent F. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Ind A. West P. Veprintsev D.

FtsB and FtsL are small (103 and 121 residues, respectively), bitopic, inner-membrane proteins with a topology similar to FtsQ. In the absence of FtsQ, they interact, presumably, through coiled-coil regions because both proteins contain a leucine zipper motif in their periplasmic domain (25.Robichon C. Karimova G. Beckwith J.

To examine the dominant negative effect of FtsQSH8 Y248*, E. coli LMC531 cells harboring vector pMedium, pMed-SH8ftsQ, or pMed-SH8ftsQ 248amber were grown overnight at 30 °C in medium supplemented with 55 mm glycerol. The same medium without or 1 mm L-rhamnose was inoculated 1:500 with the overnight cultures and incubated for 5 h at 30 °C. The cells were treated further as described above. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring vectors pSUP-BpaRS-6TRN, pCDF-ftsBLmat, and one of the p29SENX-SH8ftsQ variants were grown in 25 ml of growth medium, and when an A600 of ∼0.3 was reached, Bpa was added to 0.5 mm. After 20 min of continued growth, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and the cells were grown for a further 1.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of PBS. The cell suspension was exposed to 1.5 J/cm2 of 365-nm light (taking ∼5 min) in 12 × 12-cm dishes in a Bio-Link BLX-365 (Vilber Lourmat). The cells were harvested and resuspended in 6 ml of PBS containing 1 mm of PMSF. The cells were disrupted by a single passage through a One Shot cell disruptor (Constant Systems) at 2.14 kbar. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was centrifuged at 293,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of 100 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (pH 8.0, NaOH). After overnight incubation at ambient temperature (agitated), 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added, and the suspension was incubated at ambient temperature (agitated) for a further 2 h. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 100 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (pH 8.0, NaOH), followed by elution with 80 μl of 100 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Proteins eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting for detection of adducts or by colloidal Coomassie staining for crude quantitation. On immunoblot FtsQ, FtsB and FtsL were detected using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Colloidal Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels were scanned on a gel scanner (Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer). Using ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health), a profile of each lane along the electrophoresis path was plotted. To crudely determine the relative amount of protein, the surface of a peak in the profile was approximated by a triangular shape and corrected for local background. To calculate the fraction of cross-linked FtsQSH8, the amounts of adduct were corrected for the contribution of FtsB and FtsL to the staining (according to protein mass, FtsQSH8 = 34.2/45.8 × FtsQSH8-FtsB and FtsQSH8 = 34.2/47.8 × FtsQSH8-FtsL). Codons resulting in FtsQ Q232C, FtsQ G255C, FtsQ S250C, FtsB S76C, FtsB M77C, FtsB T78C, and FtsB V88C were introduced using overlap PCR. The SH8ftsQ variants were cloned into the p29SENX-SH8ftsQ vector. The ftsB variants were cloned into the pCDF-ftsBLmat vector. The FtsB mutants were shown to be functional by complementation of the E. coli FtsB depletion strain NB946 (expressing the ftsB mutants from vector pSAV057 (31.Alexeeva S. Gadella Jr., T.W. Verheul J. Verhoeven G.S. den Blaauwen T. Direct interactions of early and late assembling division proteins in Escherichia coli cells resolved by FRET.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 384-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). The FtsQSH8 mutants were shown to be functional by complementation of the E. coli strain LMC531. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring combinations of the p29SENX-SH8ftsQ and pCDF-ftsBLmat vectors were grown in 25 ml of growth medium to an A600 of ∼0.7. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.02 mm, the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 12.5 ml of PBS containing 50 mm of EDTA and 20 mm of N-ethylmaleimide and incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. The cell samples were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, omitting the reducing agent. The NCBI protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to find 250 protein amino acid sequences in the non-redundant protein sequence database limited to the taxid 1236 set (Gammaproteobacteria) using the E. coli K12 FtsQ sequence (UniProt P06136) as a query sequence. From the resulting 250 hits, four truncated sequences were removed. The remaining 246 hits were aligned using the NCBI Constraint-based Multiple Protein Alignment Tool. From the alignment, a sequence logo was created using the weblogo.berkeley.edu tool (32.Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo. A sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8237) Google Scholar). Similarly, for FtsB, the NCBI protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool was used to find 250 protein amino acid sequences in the non-redundant protein sequence database limited to the taxid 1236 set using the E. coli K12 FtsB sequence (UniProt P0A6S5) as a query sequence. From the resulting 250 hits, nine truncated sequences and one sequence that apparently resulted from a frameshift were removed. The remaining 240 hits were aligned as described above. To determine the protein-protein interaction sites of E. coli FtsQ, an in vivo cross-linking technique was used (33.Liu C.C. Schultz P.G. Adding new chemistries to the genetic code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 413-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). An orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair enables the incorporation of Bpa at a specific site encoded in the ftsQ gene by an amber codon (TAG). Upon synthesis of the photo probe-modified mutant of FtsQ, the cells were irradiated with long-wave UV light to activate the probe. This induces a covalent link between FtsQ and any protein that is in close (≤ 3.1 Å) proximity of the photo probe (34.Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Benzophenone photophores in biochemistry.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Guided by the crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of E. coli FtsQ, we selected 50 surface-exposed positions throughout the periplasmic domain for analysis of molecular contacts using this approach (Fig. 1) (21.van den Ent F. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Ind A. West P. Veprintsev D. Nanninga N. den Blaauwen T. Löwe J. Structural and mutational analysis of the cell division protein FtsQ.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Together, this analysis provides an extensive coverage of the FtsQ periplasmic surface, considering that approximately every fifth residue is modified. Initially, we attempted to determine the FtsQ interactome by expressing His-tagged photo cross-linking FtsQ mutants at near endogenous levels as bait and the endogenous interacting proteins as prey. Although we achieved the required low-level expression of the photo cross-linking FtsQ mutants, we did not succeed in affinity-purifying the protein to a degree we would consider sufficient for reliable identification of adducts by mass spectrometry or for immunodetection of the known interaction partners FtsK, FtsB, and FtsL. It should be noted that, roughly estimated at 20 to 100 copies/cell, the endogenous level of FtsQ is very low (19.Carson M.J. Barondess J. Beckwith J.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that the cross-linking efficiency typically does not exceed 40% (35.Zhang M. Lin S. Song X. Liu J. Fu Y. Ge X. Fu X. Chang Z. Chen P.R. A genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals chaperone cooperation in acid resistance.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 36.Mori H.

We therefore decided to focus on the interactions of FtsQ with its main, biochemically verified interaction partners FtsB and FtsL upon induced expression of the three proteins. To attain tunable expression of full-length FtsB and FtsL, the corresponding genes were coexpressed from a T7 Duet vector. Upon induction, FtsB could be clearly distinguished in the membrane fraction of cells upon SDS-PAGE followed by total protein staining (Fig. 2). In comparison, FtsL was expressed at a much lower level and could only be detected by Western blotting. This disproportionate expression of FtsL relative to FtsB is undesirable because it might induce t"

We showed earlier that inhibition of PKC signaling maintains pluripotency in mouse ESCs. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the importance of protein kinase C signaling in the context of rat ESC (rESC) pluripotency.

Germ line-competent rESCs can be established using the small molecule inhibitors CHIR99021 and PD032590 (henceforth mentioned as 2i), which inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and MEK, respectively (2.Li P.

The addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) along with 2i further boosts self-renewal of rESCs (2.Li P. Tong C. Mehrian-Shai R. Jia L. Wu N. Yan Y. Maxson R.E. Schulze E.N. Song H. Hsieh C.L.

Another study implemented inhibition of Rho-associated kinase and TGF-β signaling along with 2i to establish pluripotent rat stem cells (6.Kawamata M. Ochiya T. Generation of genetically modified rats from embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14223-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both 2i and 2i/LIF culture conditions also efficiently maintain pluripotency in mESCs (8.Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). However, unlike mESCs, rESCs that are established and maintained in 2i and 2i/LIF express relatively high levels of trophoblast stem cell (TSC)-specific factors, like CDX2 (4.Hong J. He H. Weiss M.L.

Curiously, rESCs grown with Rho-associated kinase and TGF-β inhibitors also showed much higher levels of CDX2 expression (9.Hong J. He H. Bui P. Ryba-White B. Rumi M.A. Soares M.J. Dutta D. Paul S.

Also, the efficiency of germ line competence in 2i- or 2i/LIF-cultured rESCs is lower than that of mESC and random. Thus, to maximize the potential of rESCs as tools for genetic research, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that modulate rESC pluripotency versus differentiation is necessary. rat embryonic stem cell leukemia inhibitory factor mouse embryonic stem cell trophoblast stem cell induced pluripotent stem cell 3-[1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione rat induced pluripotent stem cell embryoid body Sprague-Dawley doxycycline microRNA quantitative RT-PCR CHIR99021 and PD032590 rat embryonic fibroblast Dark Agouti OCT4/SOX2/KLF4/c-MYC. In an earlier study (10.Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Larson M. Wolfe M.W. Paul S. Self-renewal versus lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells. Protein kinase C signaling shifts the balance.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we showed that inhibition of PKC signaling by a selective PKC inhibitor, 3-[1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (Gö6983, henceforth mentioned as PKCi) is sufficient to maintain, derive, and propagate pluripotent mESCs. Our mechanistic analyses indicated that, among the PKC isoforms, the atypical PKC isoform PKCζ is crucial for inducing multilineage differentiation in mESCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the PKCi culture condition facilitates reprogramming of differentiated mouse cells to iPSCs. Therefore, in this study, we tested whether inhibition of PKC signaling by PKCi maintains rESC self-renewal and pluripotency. We found that the PKCi culture condition maintains self-renewal of established rESCs without affecting their complete developmental potential. We also found that the PKCi culture condition enables the derivation of new ESC lines from rat blastocysts and reprogramming of differentiated rat cells to riPSCs. Also, our molecular analyses revealed that, unlike the 2i/LIF culture condition, PKCi-maintained rESCs do not express TSC-specific genes. Collectively, our results indicate that PKC signaling is an important regulatory pathway in balancing self-renewal versus lineage commitment in rESCs and could be exploited to establish and maintain germ line-competent pluripotent rat stem cells. PKCi (Gö6983) was purchased from Tocris Biosciences (catalog no. 2285, Ellisville, MO) and was used at a concentration of 5 μm unless stated otherwise. PD0325901 (1 μm, catalog no. 444966) and CHIR99021 (3 μm, catalog no. 04-0004) were purchased from Stemgent (Cambridge, MA). LIF (used at 100 IU/ml) was purchased from Millipore (ESGRO, Millipore, Temecula, CA). For regular maintenance, derived rESCs were cultured with either 2i/LIF or PKCi on irradiated feeder REF in N2B27 medium containing DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, catalog no. 10565), neurobasal medium (catalog no. 21103, Invitrogen), 1% B27 supplement (catalog no. 17504-044, Invitrogen), 0.5% N2 supplement (catalog no. 17502-048, Invitrogen), 25 μg/ml BSA fraction V (catalog no. 15260, Invitrogen), and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (catalog no. M7522-100ML, Sigma). For in vitro differentiation studies, rESCs were cultured without PKCi in monolayer culture for 5–6 days or allowed to form embryoid bodies (EBs). RNA was extracted from different cell samples with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 5:1 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers heated at 68 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (50 units) (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm DTT, RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. Reactions were diluted to a final volume of 100 μl and heat-inactivated at 97 °C for 5 min. 20-μl PCR reactions contained 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and corresponding primer sets. Relative expression levels were determined from a standard curve generated from serial dilution of rat universal reference cDNA samples and were normalized to the expression of 18 S. At least three independent experiments were done for each set of data. Primers used in this study are mentioned in the supplemental information. Whole cell lysates were prepared in SDS gel loading buffer, and Western blot analyses were performed following procedures described earlier (10.Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Larson M. Wolfe M.W. Paul S. Self-renewal versus lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells. Protein kinase C signaling shifts the balance.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for this study are included in the supplemental information. Immunostaining to detect expression of OCT4, NANOG, and CDX2 in rESCs was performed using standard protocols (10.Dutta D. Ray S. Home P. Larson M. Wolfe M.W. Paul S. Self-renewal versus lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells. Protein kinase C signaling shifts the balance.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, rESCs were cultured on feeder layer-coated coverslips under different culture conditions. After 5 days, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA, and cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200. Fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568, Molecular Probes and Invitrogen) were used at a 1:200 dilution. Coverslips were mounted on slides with DAPI mounting media (Invitrogen) and observed using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). To generate EBs, rESCs and riPSCs were grown in the absence of PKCi/LIF/2i in a differentiation medium containing 15% FBS (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), 1% l-glutamine, 1% ascorbic acid (Stemcell Technologies), and 3 μl/ml methylthioglycolate (Sigma). Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized (0.05% trypsin EDTA for 5 min), and made into single-cell suspensions. To generate day 5–6 EBs, 4000 cells/ml were added to differentiation medium in a low-adherent tissue culture plate (catalog no. 3471 Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) with intermittent shaking. For teratoma formation, 1–2 million riPSCs were mixed with 30% Matrigel (BD Biosciences), injected into the kidneys of 6-week-old male SCID-beige mice (Charles River Laboratories), and tumors were collected 3–4 weeks post-injection. Tumor tissues were fixed with 10% Formalin overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm serial sections, and H&E-stained. Six-week-old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were mated overnight to intact SD stud males. Uteri were collected 4.5 days post-coitum and flushed with M2 medium (Millipore) for the collection of blastocysts. Ten to 12 ESCs were injected into the blastocoel of each blastocyst. After injection, the blastocysts were transferred surgically into recipient SD females that were pseudopregnant by mating with vasectomized males. Chimeras with DA rESCs were determined from coat color. Chimeras were generated from F344 rESCs, and iPSCs were determined via microsatellite analyses. Male chimeras, generated from PKCi-maintained DA rESCs, were mated with SD female adult rats to test for germ line transmission. Rat ESCs were derived using our protocol described previously (5.Tong C. Li P. Wu N.L. Yan Y. Ying Q.L. Production of p53 gene knockout rats by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, blastocysts from F344 and DA rats were isolated and plated on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Globalstem, Rockville, MD) or an REF feeder layer in medium containing either 2i/LIF, PKCi, or PKCi/PD0325901. As a control, medium without any inhibitors or with PD0325901 alone was also used. To obtain rESC colonies, blastocyst outgrowths were disaggregated either mechanically or using trypsin and replated on the feeder layer. rESC colonies were expanded by replating with PKCi at clonal or higher density. For in vitro analysis, cells were cultured following the same protocol mentioned earlier. REFs were reprogrammed using a lentiviral vector expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, or c-Myc (OSKM) in a single virus (polycistronic expression from a single promoter) (11.Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J. Saha K. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming of murine and human somatic cells using a single polycistronic vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) under the control of the doxycycline (Dox)-inducible tetO operator. REFs derived from embryos collected at days 14–16 of pregnancy were isolated from F344 and DA rats, expanded in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen), and passaged at confluency using standard methods. At passage 3, REFs were infected overnight with lentiviral particles expressing OSKM and tetracycline-controllable transactivator, and then the culture medium was replaced with PKCi (5 μm) or PKCi + PD032801 and Dox (2 μg/ml). After 48 h, cells were cultured in medium without Dox. 12 days after Dox removal, several nascent iPSC-like colonies were observed. A few of those colonies were analyzed for endogenous OCT4 and NANOG expression. Other colonies were cultured up to 21 days. For further analysis, iPSC colonies were picked manually at different days, starting on day 18 after Dox removal. Cells were trypsinized and replated at clonal or higher density in medium with PKCi. Expression of the pluripotent markers in riPSCs, cultured for multiple passages with PKCi, was analyzed by qRT-PCR as well as immunofluorescence. For NF-κB activity analysis, rESCs (5 × 104) were transfected with 1 μg of a plasmid expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of canonical NF-κB binding motifs (PathDetect NF-κB cis-Reporting System, Stratagene, catalog no. 219077). Transfection was performed using a nucleofector device (Lonza) following the protocol of the manufacturer and seeded on feeder REF on 24-well plates with rESC medium with or without PKCi. After 48 h, rESC colonies were picked up manually, whole cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured in a Veritas microplate luminometer using the luciferase assay buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was calibrated relative to total protein present in the whole cell lysate. miRNA expression was determined using a miRCURY LNATM Universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exicon, Woburn, MA) using the protocol of the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from rESCs, riPSCs, and REFs using an RNA isolation kit (catalog no. 74104, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using a miRCURY LNATM Universal RT microRNA PCR, polyadenylation, and cDNA synthesis kit (catalog no. 203300, Exicon). Expression of a specific miRNA was measured using UniRT LNATM PCR primer sets. For miR-21, hsa-miR-21 primer sets (catalog no. 204230, Exicon, target sequence UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA) were used, and for miR-29a, hsa-miR-29a primer sets (catalog no. 204698, Exicon, target sequence UAGCACCAUCUGAAAUCGGUUA) were used. Endogenous 18 S rRNA was used as the control. Real time PCR-based quantitative ChIP analysis was performed using our protocol described previously (12.Home P. Saha B. Ray S. Dutta D. Gunewardena S.

Briefly, cells were trypsinized, cross-linked with formaldehyde (1%), and sonicated to generate chromatin fragments. Antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA cross-linked fragments. Precipitated complexes were eluted and reverse-cross-linked. Enrichment of chromatin fragments was measured by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) fluorescence relative to a standard curve of input chromatin. The primer sequences and antibody information are included in the supplemental information. The promoter regions of Rno-miR-21 (-242 to +56 bp) and Rno-miR-29a (-413 to +15 bp) were cloned with or without deletion of conserved putative NF-κB motifs in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) containing a luciferase reporter gene. For transient transfection analysis, F344 rESCs were transfected with an equal amount of each plasmid (3 μg) using a nucleofector (Lonza). Cells were transferred on REF feeders and cultured without PKCi for 72–96 h. Cell lysates were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured in a Veritas microplate luminometer using the luciferase assay buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of the lysate. At least three independent preparations of each plasmid were analyzed, and the results were averaged. shRNAs targeting mouse PKCζ mRNA were cloned in pLKO1 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Lentiviral supernatants were produced in HEK293T cells as described previously (14.Dutta D. Ray S. Vivian J.L. Paul S. Activation of the VEGFR1 chromatin domain.

F344 rESCs were infected with lentiviral supernatants and selected by the addition of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). A construct with the target sequence ATCCCGGTAAGTTCTGTTG, corresponding to the 3′ UTR region of PKCζ mRNA, specifically knocked down PKCζ expression. For pre-miRNA expression, rat pre-miR-21 (Rno-miR-21, ENSEMBL gene ENSRNOG00000035480) and pre-miR-29a (Rno-miR-29a, ENSEMBL gene ENSRNOG00000035458) were cloned in pLKO1. For transduction, lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells, and rESCs were infected with viral particles. The transduced cells were cultured further for 5 days without PKCi. Cells from colonies were picked up manually, and RNA was isolated for gene expression analyses. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells cultured in PKCi or 2i/LIF. Isolated DNA was modified with a CpGenome Fast DNA modification kit (catalog no. S7824, Millipore) to convert the unmethylated cytosine to uracil according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The promoter region of Oct4 and Nanog was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase and primers described earlier (16.Chang M.Y. Kim D. Kim C.H. Kang H.C. Yang E. Moon J.I. Ko S. Park J. Park K.S.

PCR products were cloned into the pGMT vector (Promega) and sequenced with M13 reverse primer. To determine whether PKCi could maintain previously established rESC lines in an undifferentiated state, we cultured an F344 rESCs line that expresses EGFP under the control of a 3.1-kb portion of the rat Oct4 promoter/enhancer region (4.Hong J. He H. Weiss M.L.

We found that PKCi culture efficiently maintains undifferentiated colony morphology and OCT4-EGFP reporter expression of established rESC lines (Fig. 1A) when they are cultured with PKCi in the absence of 2i or 2i/LIF. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analyses in another F344 rESC line (without the OCT4-EGFP reporter) showed strong expression of endogenous OCT4 and NANOG proteins when cultured for five consecutive passages with PKCi (Fig. 1B). Thus, the morphology, the expression of OCT4-EGFP reporter, and the expression of endogenous pluripotency factors confirmed that culturing F344 rESC lines with PKCi could maintain their undifferentiated state. To test whether the PKCi culture condition inhibits differentiation of rESCs irrespective of rat strains, we cultured rESCs that were derived from DA rats. We found that, similar to F344 rESCs, the PKCi culture condition maintained an undifferentiated state and expression of pluripotency markers in DA rESCs (Fig. 1, C and D) for seven consecutive passages, indicating that PKCi-mediated maintenance of rESC self-renewal is not dependent upon rat strains. Next, we tested whether rESCs, cultured for multiple passages with PKCi, have the multilineage differentiation potential in vitro and complete developmental potential in vivo. Upon withdrawal of PKCi, rESCs readily formed EBs (Fig. 1E) with induction of lineage-specific genes (F). Furthermore, DA rESCs that were maintained for five to eight passages with PKCi readily yielded chimeric rats when injected into SD blastocysts (Fig. 1G and supplemental Table 1). Upon further crossing, those chimeras produced germ line offspring (Fig. 1H). These results confirmed that rESCs maintained in PKCi for multiple passages were pluripotent stem cells. To test whether inhibition of PKC signaling is sufficient for de novo derivation of rESCs, we isolated blastocysts at embryonic day 4.5 from F344 and DA females and cultured them on an REF feeder layer in the PKCi culture condition. We readily established several F344 rESC lines (Fig. 2A) and successfully propagated them for multiple passages. However, with the PKCi culture condition, the rate of proliferation of ESC-like colonies from DA blastocysts was poor and reduced further upon passaging (data not shown). Intriguingly, when we added the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 along with PKCi, we readily derived rESC colonies from DA blastocysts (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, with PD0325901 alone, we were unable to establish new rESC lines from either F344 or DA blastocysts (supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, when propagated with PKCi alone for multiple passages, the newly derived rESC lines successfully maintained undifferentiated colony morphology (Fig. 2C), expressed pluripotency markers (D), and maintained chromosomal stability (E). Our results indicate that PKC inhibition alone is sufficient to derive new rESCs lines from certain rat strains (such as F344). However, a combined inhibition of PKC and MEK signaling might be more efficient to derive new rESC lines from other rat strains. We also tested the differentiation potential of PKCi culture-derived F344 and DA rESC lines. We found that, in the absence of PKCi, the newly derived rESCs readily formed EBs (Fig. 2F) with induction of lineage-specific genes (data not shown). Furthermore we found that both F344 and DA rESCs, which were maintained for five and six consecutive passages, respectively, with PKCi alone, could generate chimeras upon blastocyst injection (Fig. 2, G and H). These results confirmed the multilineage developmental potency of PKCi-derived and -maintained rESCs, suggesting maintenance of their pluripotent state. We tested the efficacy of the PKCi culture condition in the derivation of iPSCs from REFs. For this analysis, we isolated REFs from the F344 and DA strains. We transduced REFs with lentiviral particles containing a tetracycline-inducible OKSM construct (Fig. 3A). Transduced REFs were transiently treated with Dox to induce the expression of pluripotency factors from the lentiviral construct. Later, cells were maintained without Dox in the PKCi culture condition. We also used the 2i/LIF culture condition as a positive control because earlier studies reported the successful establishment of riPSC cells with the 2i/LIF culture condition from differentiated rat cells (16.Chang M.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2089866217,"Turtles are one of the least explored clades regarding endocranial anatomy with few available descriptions of the brain and inner ear of extant representatives. In addition, the paleoneurology of extinct turtles is poorly known and based on only a few natural cranial endocasts. The main goal of this study is to provide for the first time a detailed description of the neuroanatomy of an extinct turtle, the Late Jurassic Plesiochelys etalloni, including internal carotid circulation, cranial endocast and inner ear, based on the first digital 3D reconstruction using micro CT scans. The general shape of the cranial endocast of P. etalloni is tubular, with poorly marked cephalic and pontine flexures. Anteriorly, the olfactory bulbs are clearly differentiated suggesting larger bulbs than in any other described extinct or extant turtle, and indicating a higher capacity of olfaction in this taxon. The morphology of the inner ear of P. etalloni is comparable to that of extant turtles and resembles those of slow-moving terrestrial vertebrates, with markedly low, short and robust semicircular canals, and a reduced lagena. In P. etalloni the arterial pattern is similar to that found in extant cryptodires, where all the internal carotid branches are protected by bone. As the knowledge of paleoneurology in turtles is scarce and the application of modern techniques such as 3D reconstructions based on CT scans is almost unexplored in this clade, we hope this paper will trigger similar investigations of this type in other turtle taxa."

https://openalex.org/W2010990659,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal disease that results in obliteration of the biliary tree. The murine model of BA, which mirrors the human disease, is based upon infection of newborn mice with rhesus rotavirus (RRV), leading to an obstructive cholangiopathy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the temporal relationship between viral infection and the induction of this model. BALB/c mice were infected with RRV on day of life (DOL) 0, 3, 5, and 7. Groups were characterized as early-infection (infection by DOL 3) or late-infection (infection after DOL 5). Early RRV infection induced symptoms in 95% of pups with a mortality rate of 80%. In contrast, late infection caused symptoms in only 50% of mice, and 100% of pups survived. The clinical findings correlated with histological analysis of extrahepatic biliary trees, cytokine expression, and viral titers. Primary murine cholangiocytes isolated, cultured, and infected with RRV yielded higher titers of infectious virus in those harvested from DOL 2 versus DOL 9 mice. Less interferon alpha and beta was produced in DOL 2 versus DOL 9 RRV infected primary cholangiocytes. Injection of BALB/c interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFN-αβR−/−) pups at DOL 7 showed increased symptoms (79%) and mortality (46%) when compared to late infected wild type mice. In conclusion, the degree of injury sustained by relatively immature cholangiocytes due to more robust RRV replication correlated with more severe clinical manifestations of cholangiopathy and higher mortality. Interferon alpha production by cholangiocytes appears to play a regulatory role. These findings confirm a temporal dependence of RRV infection in murine BA and begin to define a pathophysiologic role of the maturing cholangiocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2034774438,"The human importin (Imp)-β family consists of 21 nucleocytoplasmic transport carrier proteins, which transport thousands of proteins (cargoes) across the nuclear envelope through nuclear pores in specific directions. To understand the nucleocytoplasmic transport in a physiological context, the specificity of cargoes for their cognate carriers should be determined; however, only a limited number of nuclear proteins have been linked to specific carriers. To address this biological question, we recently developed a novel method to identify carrier-specific cargoes. This method includes the following three steps: (i) the cells are labeled by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC); (ii) the labeled cells are permeabilized, and proteins in the unlabeled cell extracts are transported into the nuclei of the permeabilized cells by a particular carrier; and (iii) the proteins in the nuclei are quantitatively identified by LC-MS/MS. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by the identification of transportin (Trn)-specific cargoes. Here, we applied this method to identify cargo proteins specific for Imp-β, which is a predominant carrier that exclusively utilizes Imp-α as an adapter for cargo binding. We identified candidate cargoes, which included previously reported and potentially novel Imp-β cargoes. In in vitro binding assays, most of the candidate cargoes bound to Imp-β in one of three binding modes: directly, via Imp-α, or via other cargoes. Thus, our method is effective for identifying a variety of Imp-β cargoes. The identified Imp-β and Trn cargoes were compared, ensuring the carrier specificity of the method and illustrating the complexity of these transport pathways."

Here, we report that Pellino1 interacts with the transcription factor Deformed Epidermal Autoregulatory Factor 1 (DEAF1). The interaction is independent of the E3 ligase activity of Pellino1, but weakened by the phosphorylation of Pellino1. We show that DEAF1 binds to the IFNβ promoter and to IRF3 and IRF7, that it is required for the transcription of the IFNβ gene and IFNβ secretion in MEFs infected with Sendai virus or transfected with poly(I:C). DEAF1 is also needed for TLR3-dependent IFNβ production. Taken together, our results identify DEAF1 as a novel component of the signal transduction network by which dsRNA of viral origin stimulates IFNβ production."

Aims This study investigates the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD) among at-risk mothers, and explores its associations with sociodemographic factors. Methods This population-based survey of mothers of children aged 0–36 months used the 14-item Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ). Mothers whose response was “yes” to 8 or more items on the scale were defined as “at risk of CMD.” Results Of the 1,922 mothers (15–48 years), 28.8% were at risk of CMD. Risk of CMD was associated with verbal abuse, physical abuse, a partner who did not help with the care of the child, being in a polygamous relationship, a partner with low levels of education, and a partner who smoked cigarettes. Cohabiting appeared to be protective. Conclusions Taken together, our results indicate the significance of the quality of relations with one’s partner in shaping maternal mental health. The high proportion of mothers who are at risk of CMD emphasizes the importance of developing evidence-based mental health programmes as part of the care package aimed at improving maternal well-being in Tanzania and other similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W2048024872,"Wnt5a plays an essential role in tissue development by regulating cell migration, though the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Our study investigated the pathways involved in Wnt5a-dependent cell motility during the formation of dentin and pulp. Over-expression of Wnt5a promoted cell adhesion and formation of focal adhesion complexes (FACs) in human dental papilla cells (hDPCs), while inhibiting cell migration. Instead of activating the canonical Wnt signal pathway in hDPCs, Wnt5a stimulation induced activation of the JNK signal in a RhoA-dependent or independent manner. Inhibiting JNK abrogated Wnt5a-induced FACs formation but not cytoskeletal rearrangement. Both dominant negative RhoA (RhoA T19N) and constitutively active RhoA mutants (RhoA Q63L) blocked the Wnt5a-dependent changes in hDPCs adhesion, migration and cytoskeletal rearrangement here too, with the exception of the formation of FACs. Taken together, our study suggested that RhoA and JNK signaling have roles in mediating Wnt5a-dependent adhesion and migration in hDPCs, and the Wnt5a/JNK pathway acts both dependently and independently of the RhoA pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2077829016,"Background Development of resistant variants to existing antifungal drugs continues to be the serious problem in Candida albicans-induced fungal pathogenesis, which has a considerable impact on animal and human health. Identification and characterization of newer drugs against C. albicans is, therefore, essential. MMGP1 is a direct cell-penetrating peptide recently identified from marine metagenome, which was found to possess potent antifungal activity against C. albicans. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the mechanism of antifungal action of MMGP1 against C. albicans. Agarose gel shift assay found the peptide to be having a remarkable DNA-binding ability. The modification of the absorption spectra and fluorescence quenching of the tryptophyl residue correspond to the stacking between indole ring and nucleotide bases. The formation of peptide–DNA complexes was confirmed by fluorescence quenching of SYTO 9 probe. The interaction of peptide with plasmid DNA afforded protection of DNA from enzymatic degradation by DNase I. In vitro transcription of mouse β-actin gene in the presence of peptide led to a decrease in the level of mRNA synthesis. The C. albicans treated with MMGP1 showed strong inhibition of biosynthetic incorporation of uridine analog 5-ethynyluridine (EU) into nascent RNA, suggesting the peptide’s role in the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis. Furthermore, the peptide also induces endogenous accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C. albicans. MMGP1 supplemented with glutathione showed an increased viability of C. albicans cells. The hyper-produced ROS by MMGP1 leads to increased levels of protein carbonyls and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and it also causes dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation in C. albicans cells. Conclusion And Significance: Therefore, the antifungal activity of MMGP1 could be attributed to its binding with DNA, causing inhibition of transcription followed by endogenous production of ROS, which triggers cascade of events that leads to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2008154656,"This paper deals with the effects of mixing time on the homogeneity and dispersion performance of adhesive mixtures for inhalation. Interactions between these effects and the carrier size fraction, the type of drug and the inhalation flow rate were studied. Furthermore, it was examined whether or not changes in the dispersion performance as a result of prolonged mixing can be explained with a balance of three processes that occur during mixing, knowing drug redistribution over the lactose carrier; (de-) agglomeration of the drug (and fine lactose) particles; and compression of the drug particles onto the carrier surface. For this purpose, mixtures containing salmeterol xinafoate or fluticasone propionate were mixed for different periods of time with a fine or coarse crystalline lactose carrier in a Turbula mixer. Drug detachment experiments were performed using a classifier based inhaler at different flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy and laser diffraction techniques were used to measure drug distribution and agglomeration, whereas changes in the apparent solubility were measured as a means to monitor the degree of mechanical stress imparted on the drug particles. No clear trend between mixing time and content uniformity was observed. Quantitative and qualitative interactions between the effect of mixing time on drug detachment and the type of drug, the carrier size fraction and the flow rate were measured, which could be explained with the three processes mentioned. Generally, prolonged mixing caused drug detachment to decrease, with the strongest decline occurring in the first 120 minutes of mixing. For the most cohesive drug (salmeterol) and the coarse carrier, agglomerate formation seemed to dominate the overall effect of mixing time at a low inhalation flow rate, causing drug detachment to increase with prolonged mixing. The optimal mixing time will thus depend on the formulation purpose and the choice for other, interacting variables."
https://openalex.org/W1965727032,"We hypothesized that prostacyclin (PGI2) protects vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) against apoptosis and phenotypic switch through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) activation and 14-3-3 upregulation. Here we showed that transfection of rat aortic VSMC, A-10, with PGI2-producing vectors, Ad-COPI, resulted in attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis accompanied by a selective increase in 14-3-3β and 14-3-3θ expression. Carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) and Wy14,643 exerted a similar effect. The effects of PGI2 were abrogated by MK886, a PPARα antagonist, but not GSK3787, a PPARδ antagonist. PPARα transfection upregulated 14-3-3β and θ expression and attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis. H2O2-induced 14-3-3β but not 14-3-3θ degradation was blocked by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Furthermore, 14-3-3β but not 14-3-3θ overexpression reduced, while 14-3-3β siRNA aggravated apoptosis. VSMC contractile proteins and serum response factor (SRF) were reduced in H2O2-treated A-10 cells which were concurrently prevented by caspase 3 inhibitor. By contrast, PGI2 prevented H2O2-induced SM22α and Calponin-1 degradation without influencing SRF. cPGI2 and Wy14,643 also effectively blocked VSMC phenotypic switch induced by growth factors (GFs). GFs suppressed 14-3-3β, θ, ε and η isoforms and cPGI2 prevented the decline of β, θ and η, but not ε. 14-3-3θ siRNA abrogated the protective effect of cPGI2 on SM22α and Calponin-1 while 14-3-3 θ or 14-3-3β overexpression partially restored SM22α. These results indicated that PGI2 protects VSMCs via PPARα by upregulating 14-3-3β and 14-3-3θ. 14-3-3β upregulation confers resistance to apoptosis whereas 14-3-3θ and β upregulation protects SM22α and Calponin-1 from degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1984803148,"Sodium measurement during hemodialysis treatment is important to preserve the patient from clinical events related to hypo- or hyper-natremia Usually, sodium measurement is performed through laboratory equipment which is typically expensive, and requires manual intervention. We propose a new method, based on conductivity measurement after treatment of dialysate solution through ion-exchange resin. To test this method, we performed in vitro experiments. We prepared 40 ml sodium chloride (NaCl) samples at 280, 140, 70, 35, 17.5, 8.75, 4.375 mEq/l, and some “mixed samples”, i.e., with added potassium chloride (KCl) at different concentrations (4.375-17.5 mEq/l), to simulate the confounding factors in a conductivity-based sodium measurement. We measured the conductivity of all samples. Afterwards, each sample was treated for 1 min with 1 g of Dowex G-26 resin, and conductivity was measured again. On average, the difference in the conductivity between mixed samples and corresponding pure NaCl samples (at the same NaCl concentration) was 20.9%. After treatment with the exchange resin, it was 14.7%, i.e., 42% lower. Similar experiments were performed with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride as confounding factors, with similar results. We also performed some experiments on actual dialysate solution during hemodialysis sessions in 15 patients, and found that the correlation between conductivity measures and sodium concentration improved after resin treatment (R=0.839 before treatment, R=0.924 after treatment, P<0.0001). We conclude that ion-exchange resin treatment coupled with conductivity measures may improve the measurement of sodium compared to conductivity measures alone, and may become a possible simple approach for continuous and automatic sodium measurement during hemodialysis."

Immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analyses reveal that the antigen processing compartments in NPC1(-/-) dendritic cells (DCs) have an abnormal ultrastructure in that the organelles are enlarged and the intraluminal vesicles are almost completely absent and those remaining are completely disorganized. MHC-II is restricted to the limiting membrane of these enlarged MVBs where it colocalizes with the peptide editor H2-DM. Curiously, proteolytic removal of the chaperone protein Invariant chain from MHC-II, degradation of internalized foreign antigens, and antigenic-peptide binding to nascent MHC-II are normal in NPC1(-/-) DCs. Antigen-pulsed NPC1(-/-) DCs are able to effectively activate antigen-specific CD4 T cells in vitro, and immunization of NPC1(-/-) mice reveals surprisingly normal CD4 T cell activation in vivo. Our data thus reveal that the localization of MHC-II on the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular antigen processing compartments is not required for efficient antigen presentation by DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2000401818,"Covalently linked carboxyl-terminal segments of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) were tested for their qualification as minimal conformational epitopes of the naturally occurring human autoantibodies against β-amyloid (nAbs-Aβ). nAbs-Aβ specifically recognize the toxic oligomers of Aβ and not the monomeric or the fibrillar forms of Aβ. The synthetic dimers of Aβ(28-40) described herein mimic the toxic Aβ oligomers but are not kinetic intermediates with uncertain compositions. CD spectra identified a surprisingly rich conformational behavior of selected miniamyloids. We observed a highly cooperative conformational transition of β-sheet to α-helix upon the addition of the helix enforcing co-solvent hexafluoroisopropanol. The CD curves of dimer 9 resembled, in a completely reversible manner, the CD spectra measured during the irreversible fibrillation of the parent Aβ(1-40). Synthetic peptide epitopes with high affinities for nAbs-Aβ are needed to identify the physiological roles of nAbs-Aβ and are promising epitopes for vaccination experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1983521580,"We present GStream, a method that combines genome-wide SNP and CNV genotyping in the Illumina microarray platform with unprecedented accuracy. This new method outperforms previous well-established SNP genotyping software. More importantly, the CNV calling algorithm of GStream dramatically improves the results obtained by previous state-of-the-art methods and yields an accuracy that is close to that obtained by purely CNV-oriented technologies like Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). We demonstrate the superior performance of GStream using microarray data generated from HapMap samples. Using the reference CNV calls generated by the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and well-known studies on whole genome CNV characterization based either on CGH or genotyping microarray technologies, we show that GStream can increase the number of reliably detected variants up to 25% compared to previously developed methods. Furthermore, the increased genome coverage provided by GStream allows the discovery of CNVs in close linkage disequilibrium with SNPs, previously associated with disease risk in published Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). These results could provide important insights into the biological mechanism underlying the detected disease risk association. With GStream, large-scale GWAS will not only benefit from the combined genotyping of SNPs and CNVs at an unprecedented accuracy, but will also take advantage of the computational efficiency of the method."
