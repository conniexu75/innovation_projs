https://openalex.org/W3183741867,"Fueling outbreaks The B.1.1.7 lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused fast-spreading outbreaks globally. Intrinsically, this variant has greater transmissibility than its predecessors, but this capacity has been amplified in some circumstances to tragic effect by a combination of human behavior and local immunity. What are the extrinsic factors that help or hinder the rapid dissemination of variants? Kraemer et al . explored the invasion dynamics of B.1.1.7. in fine detail, from its location of origin in Kent, UK, to its heterogenous spread around the country. A combination of mobile phone and virus data including more than 17,000 genomes shows how distinct phases of dispersal were related to intensity of mobility and the timing of lockdowns. As the local outbreaks grew, importation from the London source area became less important. Had B.1.1.7. emerged at a slightly different time of year, its impact might have been different. —CA"

Thus, the all-or-none definition of essentiality afforded by traditional genetic approaches fails to discern the most attractive bacterial targets: those whose incomplete inhibition results in major fitness costs. In contrast, gene ""vulnerability"" is a continuous, quantifiable trait that relates the magnitude of gene inhibition to the effect on bacterial fitness. We developed a CRISPR interference-based functional genomics method to systematically titrate gene expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and monitor fitness outcomes. We identified highly vulnerable genes in various processes, including novel targets unexplored for drug discovery. Equally important, we identified invulnerable essential genes, potentially explaining failed drug discovery efforts. Comparison of vulnerability between the reference and a hypervirulent Mtb isolate revealed incomplete conservation of vulnerability and that differential vulnerability can predict differential antibacterial susceptibility. Our results quantitatively redefine essential bacterial processes and identify high-value targets for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3187045755,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the sole output neurons that transmit visual information from the retina to the brain. Diverse insults and pathological states cause degeneration of RGC somas and axons leading to irreversible vision loss. A fundamental question is whether manipulation of a key regulator of RGC survival can protect RGCs from diverse insults and pathological states, and ultimately preserve vision. Here, we report that CaMKII-CREB signaling is compromised after excitotoxic injury to RGC somas or optic nerve injury to RGC axons, and reactivation of this pathway robustly protects RGCs from both injuries. CaMKII activity also promotes RGC survival in the normal retina. Further, reactivation of CaMKII protects RGCs in two glaucoma models where RGCs degenerate from elevated intraocular pressure or genetic deficiency. Last, CaMKII reactivation protects long-distance RGC axon projections in vivo and preserves visual function, from the retina to the visual cortex, and visually guided behavior."

This process is at the heart of many neuromorphic computing approaches but visualizing it in both space and time is tricky. del Valle et al . monitored the resistive switching in three different vanadium oxide compounds by measuring time- and space-resolved optical reflectivity (see the Perspective by Hilgenkamp and Gao). A characteristic conducting filament was quickly nucleated on the inhomogeneities in the sample and then propagated due to Joule heating. —JS"
https://openalex.org/W3186637316,"DNA repair amplifies transcriptional noise The potential role of noise, or stochastic variations in rates of gene expression, remains to be elucidated. Desai et al . used screens to identify a compound, 5′-iodo-2–-deoxyuridine (IdU), that increased gene expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells in culture without changing the overall rate of transcription of most genes. They propose a model by which the thymidine analog IdU promotes binding of the base excision repair protein AP endonuclease to DNA, thereby inducing helical distortion of DNA and modulating transcriptional bursting. Such modulation of noise enhanced reprogramming of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, variation in gene expression noise could influence developmental or disease processes. —LBR"
https://openalex.org/W3185690618,"The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is a key midbrain center with roles in locomotion. Despite extensive studies and clinical trials aimed at therapy-resistant Parkinson's disease (PD), debate on its function remains. Here, we reveal the existence of functionally diverse neuronal populations with distinct roles in control of body movements. We identify two spatially intermingled glutamatergic populations separable by axonal projections, mouse genetics, neuronal activity profiles, and motor functions. Most spinally projecting MLR neurons encoded the full-body behavior rearing. Loss- and gain-of-function optogenetic perturbation experiments establish a function for these neurons in controlling body extension. In contrast, Rbp4-transgene-positive MLR neurons project in an ascending direction to basal ganglia, preferentially encode the forelimb behaviors handling and grooming, and exhibit a role in modulating movement. Thus, the MLR contains glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations stratified by projection target exhibiting roles in action control not restricted to locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W3186079410,"The organization of genomic DNA into defined nucleosomes has long been viewed as a hallmark of eukaryotes. This paradigm has been challenged by the identification of ""minimalist"" histones in archaea and more recently by the discovery of genes that encode fused remote homologs of the four eukaryotic histones in Marseilleviridae, a subfamily of giant viruses that infect amoebae. We demonstrate that viral doublet histones are essential for viral infectivity, localize to cytoplasmic viral factories after virus infection, and ultimately are found in the mature virions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of viral nucleosome-like particles show strong similarities to eukaryotic nucleosomes despite the limited sequence identify. The unique connectors that link the histone chains contribute to the observed instability of viral nucleosomes, and some histone tails assume structural roles. Our results further expand the range of ""organisms"" that require nucleosomes and suggest a specialized function of histones in the biology of these unusual viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3184798017,"Hippocampal ripples are prominent synchronization events generated by hippocampal neuronal assemblies. To date, ripples have been primarily associated with navigational memory in rodents and short-term episodic recollections in humans. Here, we uncover different profiles of ripple activity in the human hippocampus during the retrieval of recent and remote autobiographical events and semantic facts. We found that the ripple rate increased significantly before reported recall compared to control conditions. Patterns of ripple activity across multiple hippocampal sites demonstrated remarkable specificity for memory type. Intriguingly, these ripple patterns revealed a semantization dimension, in which patterns associated with autobiographical contents become similar to those of semantic memory as a function of memory age. Finally, widely distributed sites across the neocortex exhibited ripple-coupled activations during recollection, with the strongest activation found within the default mode network. Our results thus reveal a key role for hippocampal ripples in orchestrating hippocampal-cortical communication across large-scale networks involved in conscious recollection."
https://openalex.org/W3183674885,"Since the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and within a year and a half has caused 3.56 million deaths globally. With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, end of the year data and 2021 revealed the gradual increase to prevalence of known variants of concern, particularly B.1.1.7, that have acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral genomes are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may become problematic when super-spreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence."
https://openalex.org/W3184856349,"The natural history of COVID-19 and predictors of mortality in older adults need to be investigated to inform clinical operations and healthcare policy planning. A retrospective study took place in 80 long-term nursing homes in Catalonia, Spain collecting data from March 1st to May 31st, 2020. Demographic and clinical data from 2,092 RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were registered, including structural characteristics of the facilities. Descriptive statistics to describe the demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics of our sample were prepared, both overall and by their symptomatology was performed and an analysis of statistically significant bivariate differences and constructions of a logistic regression model were carried out to assess the relationship between variables. The incidence of the infection was 28%. 71% of the residents showed symptoms. Five major symptoms included: fever, dyspnea, dry cough, asthenia and diarrhea. Fever and dyspnea were by far the most frequent (50% and 28%, respectively). The presentation was predominantly acute and symptomatology persisted from days to weeks (mean 9.1 days, SD = 10,9). 16% of residents had confirmed pneumonia and 22% required hospitalization. The accumulated mortality rate was 21.75% (86% concentrated during the first 28 days at onset). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a positive predictive value for mortality for some variables such as age, pneumonia, fever, dyspnea, stupor refusal to oral intake and dementia (p&lt;0.01 for all variables). Results suggest that density in the nursing homes did not account for differences in the incidence of the infection within the facilities. This study provides insights into the natural history of the disease in older adults with high dependency living in long-term nursing homes during the first pandemic wave of March-May 2020 in the region of Catalonia, and suggests that some comorbidities and symptoms have a strong predictive value for mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3184733665,"The microtubule-based mitotic spindle is responsible for equally partitioning the genome during each cell division, and its assembly is executed via several microtubule nucleation pathways. Targeting Protein for XKlp2 (TPX2) stimulates the branching microtubule nucleation pathway, where new microtubules are nucleated from preexisting ones within mitotic or meiotic spindles. TPX2, like other spindle assembly factors, is sequestered by binding to nuclear importins-α/β until the onset of mitosis, yet the molecular nature of this regulation remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that TPX2 interacts with importins-α/β with nanomolar affinity in a 1:1:1 monodispersed trimer. We also identify a new nuclear localization sequence in TPX2 that contributes to its high-affinity interaction with importin-α. In addition, we establish that TPX2 interacts with importin-β via dispersed, weak interactions. We show that interactions of both importin-α and -β with TPX2 inhibit its ability to undergo phase separation, which was recently shown to enhance the kinetics of branching microtubule nucleation. In summary, our study informs how importins regulate TPX2 to facilitate spindle assembly, and provides novel insight into the functional regulation of protein phase separation."
https://openalex.org/W3186487670,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to drive key cancer pathways but the functions of majority of lncRNAs are unknown making a case for comprehensive functional evaluation of lncRNAs. With an aim to identify lncRNAs dysregulated in human cancers, we analyzed the cancer patient database of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which revealed an upregulated lncRNA, LINC02381 (renamed HOXC10mRNA stabilizing factor or HMS in this study), whose depletion results in proliferation defects and inhibition of colony formation of human cancer cells. In order to identify the binding targets of HMS, we screened for cis-genes and discovered that HOXC10, an oncogene, is downregulated in the absence of HMS. Depletion of HMS does not affect the HOXC10 promoter activity but inhibits the HOXC10 3'-UTR-linked luciferase reporter activity. Since lncRNAs have been known to associate with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to stabilize mRNA transcripts, we screened for different RBPs and discovered that HuR, an ELAV family protein, stabilizes HOXC10 mRNA. Using RNA pull-down and deletion mapping experiments, we show that HuR physically interacts with the cytosine-rich stretch of HMS and HOXC10 3'-UTR to stabilize HOXC10 mRNA. HOXC10 is overexpressed in many human cancers, and our discovery highlights that lncRNA HMS sustains the HOXC10 mRNA levels to maintain the invasive phenotypes of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3183837655,"Anthropogenic activities accompanied by heavy metal waste threaten the environment. Heavy metal pollution alters the soil microbial community composition, and the microorganisms that adapt to this stress increase in abundance. The remediation process of contaminated soil not only reduces the concentration of heavy metals but also alters the bacterial communities. High-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing techniques were applied to understand the changes in soil microbial communities. Using the remediation approach of the soil mixing, the concentrations of heavy metals in the contaminated areas were diluted and the soil environment was changed. The change of soil environment as a disturbance contributed to the alteration of microbial diversity of the remediated areas. The pH and heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) were the most influential factors driving the changes in community structure. The bacterial community structure was significantly different among sample areas. The decrease of heavy metals in soil may be the important factors that changed the microbial composition. This study provides the better understanding of the changes in composition of microbial communities affected by the remediation process in heavy metal-contaminated soil."
https://openalex.org/W3185848749,"Background Frailty has been recognized as an independent risk factor for inferior outcomes, but its effect on emergency general surgery (EGS) is understudied. Objective The purpose of the present study was to define the impact of frailty on risk-adjusted mortality, non-home discharge, and readmission following EGS operations. Methods Adults undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, small bowel resection, large bowel resection, repair of perforated ulcer, or laparotomy within two days of an urgent admission were identified in the 2016–2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was defined using diagnosis codes corresponding to the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator. Multivariable regression was used to study in-hospital mortality and non-home discharge by operation, and Kaplan Meier analysis to study freedom from unplanned readmission at up to 90-days follow-up. Results Among 655,817 patients, 11.9% were considered frail. Frail patients most commonly underwent large bowel resection (37.3%) and cholecystectomy (29.2%). After adjustment, frail patients had higher mortality rates for all operations compared to nonfrail, including those most commonly performed (11.9% [95% CI 11.4–12.5%] vs 6.0% [95% CI 5.8–6.3%] for large bowel resection; 2.3% [95% CI 2.0–2.6%] vs 0.2% [95% CI 0.2–0.2%] for cholecystectomy). Adjusted non-home discharge rates were higher for frail compared to nonfrail patients following all operations, including large bowel resection (68.1% [95% CI 67.1–69.0%] vs 25.9% [95% CI 25.2–26.5%]) and cholecystectomy (33.7% [95% CI 32.7–34.7%] vs 2.9% [95% CI 2.8–3.0%]). Adjusted hospitalization costs were nearly twice as high for frail patients. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, frail patients had greater unplanned readmissions (log rank P&lt;0.001), with 1 in 4 rehospitalized within 90 days. Conclusions Frail patients have inferior clinical outcomes and greater resource use following EGS, with the greatest absolute differences following complex operations. Simple frailty assessments may inform expectations, identify patients at risk of poor outcomes, and guide the need for more intensive postoperative care."
https://openalex.org/W3184671811,"Drought is one of the most severe and unpredictable abiotic stresses, occurring at any growth stage and affecting crop yields worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to develop drought tolerant varieties to ensure sustainable crop production in an ever-changing climate. High-throughput digital phenotyping technologies in tandem with robust screening methods enable precise and faster selection of genotypes for breeding. To investigate the use of digital imaging to reliably phenotype for drought tolerance, a genetically diverse safflower population was screened under different drought stresses at Agriculture Victoria's high-throughput, automated phenotyping platform, Plant Phenomics Victoria, Horsham. In the first experiment, four treatments, control (90% field capacity; FC), 40% FC at initial branching, 40% FC at flowering and 50% FC at initial branching and flowering, were applied to assess the performance of four safflower genotypes. Based on these results, drought stress using 50% FC at initial branching and flowering stages was chosen to further screen 200 diverse safflower genotypes. Measured plant traits and dry biomass showed high correlations with derived digital traits including estimated shoot biomass, convex hull area, caliper length and minimum area rectangle, indicating the viability of using digital traits as proxy measures for plant growth. Estimated shoot biomass showed close association having moderately high correlation with drought indices yield index, stress tolerance index, geometric mean productivity, and mean productivity. Diverse genotypes were classified into four clusters of drought tolerance based on their performance (seed yield and digitally estimated shoot biomass) under stress. Overall, results show that rapid and precise image-based, high-throughput phenotyping in controlled environments can be used to effectively differentiate response to drought stress in a large numbers of safflower genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3183940643,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone cancer, with high rates of pulmonary metastasis. Osteosarcoma patients with pulmonary metastasis have worse prognosis than those with localized disease, leading to dramatically reduced survival rates. Therefore, understanding the biological characteristics of metastatic osteosarcoma and the molecular mechanisms of invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells will lead to the development of innovative therapeutic intervention for advanced osteosarcoma. Here, we identified that osteosarcoma cells commonly exhibit high platelet activation-inducing characteristics, and molecules released from activated platelets promote the invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells. Given that heat-denatured platelet releasate maintained the ability to promote osteosarcoma invasion, we focused on heat-tolerant molecules, such as lipid mediators in the platelet releasate. Osteosarcoma-induced platelet activation leads to abundant lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) release. Exposure to LPA or platelet releasate induced morphological changes and increased invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells. By analyzing publicly available transcriptome datasets and our in-house osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft tumors, we found that LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) is notably upregulated in osteosarcoma. LPAR1 gene KO in osteosarcoma cells abolished the platelet-mediated osteosarcoma invasion in vitro and the formation of early pulmonary metastatic foci in experimental pulmonary metastasis models. Of note, the pharmacological inhibition of LPAR1 by the orally available LPAR1 antagonist, ONO-7300243, prevented pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma in the mouse models. These results indicate that the LPA-LPAR1 axis is essential for the osteosarcoma invasion and metastasis, and targeting LPAR1 would be a promising therapeutic intervention for advanced osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W3184486323,"Objectives The Covid-19 pandemic is hitting societies hard, and people living in disadvantaged circumstances are among the most affected. We investigate the combined effects of the Covid-19 crisis and living in a deprived neighbourhood on two dimensions of subjective well-being: hedonic (i.e. mental health) and evaluative (i.e. life satisfaction) subjective well-being. Methods We use longitudinal data from the Understanding Society UK panel. We combine data gathered in the main survey between 2015 and 2019 with very recent data from the Covid-19 online survey between April and July 2020. Leveraging a sample of nearly 9,600 English individuals, we first run a set of cross-sectional OLS regressions to analyse changes over time in the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and subjective well-being. Then, as our main model of interest, we use a fixed effect difference-in-differences model to provide more robust evidence. Results Since the beginning of the crisis, both levels of hedonic and evaluative well-being have decreased as a result of the pandemic and lockdown. However, for those living in more deprived neighbourhoods the level of hedonic well-being decreased more than for those living in better areas. We found no such difference for evaluative well-being. Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of reducing neighbourhood inequalities as the spatial clustering of disadvantages has increased by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3186144038,"The potential risks of environmental nanoparticles (NPs), in particular Polystyrene Nanoparticles (PNPs), is an emerging problem; specifically, the interaction of PNPs with intestinal cells has not been characterized so far. The mechanism by which polystyrene particles are transferred to humans has not yet been clarified, whether directly through ingestion from contaminated food. We evaluated the interaction between PNPs and colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT116). Cells were exposed to different concentrations of PNPs, metabolic activity and the consequent cytotoxic potential were assessed through viability test; we evaluated the PNP genotoxic potential through the Cytokinesis-Block Micronucleus cytome (CBMN cyt) assay. Finally, we detected Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production after NPs exposure and performed Western Blot analysis to analyze the enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase) involved in the cell detoxification process that comes into play during the cell-PNPs interaction. This work analyzes the cyto and genotoxicity of PNPs in the colorectal HCT116 cell line, in particular the potential damage from oxidative stress produced by PNPs inside the cells related to the consequent nuclear damage. Our results show moderate toxicity of PNPs both in terms of ROS production and DNA damage. Further studies will be needed on different cell lines to have a more complete picture of the impact of environmental pollution on human health in terms of PNPs cytotoxicity and genotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3183722937,"Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), possibly due to loss of progranulin's neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects. Progranulin promotes neuronal growth and protects against excitotoxicity and other forms of injury. It is unclear if these neurotrophic effects are mediated through cellular signaling or through promotion of lysosomal function. Progranulin is a secreted proprotein that may activate neurotrophic signaling through cell-surface receptors. However, progranulin is efficiently trafficked to lysosomes and is necessary for maintaining lysosomal function. To determine which of these mechanisms mediates progranulin's protection against excitotoxicity, we generated lentiviral vectors expressing progranulin (PGRN) or lysosome-targeted progranulin (L-PGRN). L-PGRN was generated by fusing the LAMP-1 transmembrane and cytosolic domains to the C-terminus of progranulin. L-PGRN exhibited no detectable secretion, but was delivered to lysosomes and processed into granulins. PGRN and L-PGRN protected against NMDA excitotoxicity in rat primary cortical neurons, but L-PGRN had more consistent protective effects than PGRN. L-PGRN's protective effects were likely mediated through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. In control neurons, an excitotoxic dose of NMDA stimulated autophagy, and inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine reduced excitotoxic cell death. L-PGRN blunted the autophagic response to NMDA and occluded the protective effect of 3-methyladenine. This was not due to a general impairment of autophagy, as L-PGRN increased basal autophagy and did not alter autophagy after nutrient starvation. These data show that progranulin's protection against excitotoxicity does not require extracellular progranulin, but is mediated through lysosomes, providing a mechanistic link between progranulin's lysosomal and neurotrophic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3183522380,"Cancer is the most complex genetic disease known, with mutations implicated in more than 250 genes. However, it is still elusive which specific mutations found in human patients lead to tumorigenesis. Here we show that a combination of oncogenes that is characteristic of liver cancer (CTNNB1, TERT, MYC) induces senescence in human fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes. However, reprogramming fibroblasts to a liver progenitor fate, induced hepatocytes (iHeps), makes them sensitive to transformation by the same oncogenes. The transformed iHeps are highly proliferative, tumorigenic in nude mice, and bear gene expression signatures of liver cancer. These results show that tumorigenesis is triggered by a combination of three elements: the set of driver mutations, the cellular lineage, and the state of differentiation of the cells along the lineage. Our results provide direct support for the role of cell identity as a key determinant in transformation and establish a paradigm for studying the dynamic role of oncogenic drivers in human tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3185268947,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an especially aggressive and highly heterogeneous mature B-cell lymphoma. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is considered an attractive therapeutic target in a variety of cancers, including MCL, but no HSP90 inhibitors have succeeded in the clinical trials to date. Exploring fine mechanisms of HSP90 inhibition in cancer cells may shed light on novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that HSP90 knockdown and continuous inhibition with ganetespib inhibited growth of MCL cells in vitro and in vivo. To our surprise, transient exposure over 12 h was almost as efficient as continuous exposure, and treatment with ganetespib for 12 h efficiently inhibited growth and induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of MCL cells. Transcriptome analysis complemented by functional studies was performed to define critical MCL signaling pathways that are exceptionally sensitive to HSP90 inhibition and vital to cell fate. Six genes (cell division cycle 6, cell division cycle 45, minichromosome maintenance 4, minichromosome maintenance 7, RecQ-mediated genome instability 2, and DNA primase polypeptide 1) involved in DNA replication and repair were identified as consistently downregulated in three MCL cell lines after transient ganetespib treatment. E2F1, an important transcription factor essential for cell cycle progression, was identified as a ganetespib target mediating transcriptional downregulation of these six genes, and its stability was also demonstrated to be maintained by HSP90. This study identifies E2F1 as a novel client protein of HSP90 that is very sensitive and worthy of targeting and also finds that HSP90 inhibitors may be useful in combination therapies for MCL."
https://openalex.org/W3184795438,"Human immunoglobulin G subclass 3 (IgG3) possesses a uniquely long hinge region that separates its Fab antigen-binding and Fc receptor-binding regions. Owing to this hinge length, the molecular structure of full-length IgG3 remains elusive, and the role of the two conserved Fc glycosylation sites are unknown. To address these issues, we subjected glycosylated and deglycosylated human myeloma IgG3 to multidisciplinary solution structure studies. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, the elongated structure of IgG3 was determined from the reduced sedimentation coefficients s020,w of 5.82 to 6.29 S for both glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3. X-ray and neutron scattering showed that the Guinier RG values were 6.95 nm for glycosylated IgG3 and were unchanged after deglycosylation, again indicating an elongated structure. The distance distribution function P(r) showed a maximum length of 25 to 28 nm and three distinct maxima. The molecular structure of IgG3 was determined using atomistic modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations of the IgG3 hinge and Monte Carlo simulations to identify physically realistic arrangements of the Fab and Fc regions. This resulted in libraries containing 135,135 and 73,905 glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 structures, respectively. Comparisons with the X-ray and neutron scattering curves gave 100 best-fit models for each form of IgG3 that accounted for the experimental scattering curves. These models revealed the first molecular structures for full-length IgG3. The structures exhibited relatively restricted Fab and Fc conformations joined by an extended semirigid hinge, which explains the potent effector functions of IgG3 relative to the other subclasses IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4.

The structures exhibited relatively restricted Fab and Fc conformations joined by an extended semirigid hinge, which explains the potent effector functions of IgG3 relative to the other subclasses IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. Immunoglobulin IgG3 is one of the four subclasses IgG1 to IgG4 that make up the human IgG antibodies. It is the third most abundant IgG in serum and comprises 5% to 8% of serum IgG. IgG3 plays a role in protection against intracellular bacteria, parasites, and viruses. IgG3 is unique in the four subclasses, as it is the only subclass that has not as yet been exploited as a biotherapeutic. It is of particular interest because of its elongated hinge with 62 amino acids and 11 disulfide bonds that connects the Fab and Fc regions (Fig. 1A), which potentially gives the Fab and Fc regions in IgG3 a greater rotational freedom than in IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4, which have shorter hinges of lengths 15, 12, and 12 residues, respectively (1Damelang T.

IgG3 mediates a broad range of effector functions, including being the most effective activator of complement through the binding of C1q and able to initiate antibody effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The superior ability of IgG3 to bind to FcγR receptors and C1q was thought to be due to its elongated hinge (2Richardson S.I. Lambson B.E. Crowley A.R. Bashirova A. Scheepers C. Garrett N. Karim S.A.

Some IgG3 allotypes have a reduced half-life of about 7 days, compared with the longer 21-day half-life for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 (1Damelang T. Rogerson S.J. Kent S.J. Chung A.W. Role of IgG3 in infectious diseases.Trends Immunol. 2019; 40: 197-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This reduced half-life is attributed to a His435Arg substitution in the Fc region (EU numbering) (4Stapleton N.M. Andersen J.T. Stemerding A.M. Bjarnarson S.P. Verheul R.C. Gerritsen J. Zhao Y. Kleijer M. Sandlie I. de Haas M. Jonsdottir I. van der Schoot C.E. Vidarsson G. Competition for FcRn-mediated transport gives rise to short half-life of human IgG3 and offers therapeutic potential.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 599Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This His435Arg substitution is also critical as it blocks IgG3 from binding to a protein A column, thus allowing for IgG3 to be purified from IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 in human serum (5Van Loghem E. Frangione B. Recht B. Franklin E.C. Staphylococcal protein A and human IgG subclasses and allotypes.Scand. J. Immunol. 1982; 15: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of full-length human IgG3 is poorly understood, given that its elongated hinge has made structural studies difficult using methods such as X-ray crystallography. Nonetheless a high-resolution structure for the IgG3-Fc fragment (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 5W38) (6Shah I.S. Lovell S. Mehzabeen N. Battaile K.P. Tolbert T.J.

Several solution studies of full-length IgG3 using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) have been reported (7Liu X. Zhao Y. Shi H. Zhang Y. Yin X. Liu M.

By SAXS, IgG3 was found to have a more flexible hinge than IgG1 and IgG2 (7Liu X. Zhao Y. Shi H. Zhang Y. Yin X. Liu M. Zhang H. He Y. Lu B. Jin T. Li F. Human immunoglobulin G hinge regulates agonistic anti-CD40 immunostimulatory and antitumour activities through biophysical flexibility.Nat.

Computer models of the human immunoglobulins.Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 206-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). IgG3 also showed partial O-glycosylation at the IgG3 hinge region (11Plomp R. Dekkers G. Rombouts Y. Visser R. Koeleman C.A.M.M. Kammeijer G.S.M.M. Jansen B.C. Rispens T. Hensbergen P.J. Vidarsson G.

All four human IgG subclasses have a conserved N-linked glycosylation site in the Fc region, which plays a key functional role (Fig. 1B). A complex-type biantennary glycan with a Man3GlcNAc2 core and two NeuNAc.Gal.GlcNAc antennae is attached at Asn297 (EU numbering) on each CH2 domain (12Deisenhofer J.

This glycan is chemically heterogenous (13Wuhrer M. Stam J.C. Van De Geijn F.E. Koeleman C.A.M. Verrips C.T. Dolhain R.J.E.M. Hokke C.H. Deelder A.M.

Antibody therapeutics: Isotype and glycoform selection.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2007; 7: 1401-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The structural role of the two Fc glycans in IgG3 is not well understood, but deglycosylated IgG3 was shown to have impaired binding to FcγR receptors, leading to the conclusion that FcγR binding depended on the conformation of the Fc region in IgG3 (15Walker M.R. Lund J. Thompson K.M. Jefferis R. Aglycosylation of human IgG1 and IgG3 monoclonal antibodies can eliminate recognition by human cells expressing FcγRI and/or FcγRII receptors.Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The issues of the unknown IgG3 molecular structure and a role for its glycans were here addressed by a joint application of AUC, SAXS, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and atomistic modeling to myeloma human IgG3. This powerful solution structural strategy has recently provided molecular structures for glycosylated and deglycosylated monoclonal IgG1, and also human myeloma IgG2 (16Hui G.K. Gardener A.D. Begum H. Eldrid C. Thalassinos K. Gor J. Perkins S.J.

AUC provides overall solution structures for IgG3 as well as confirms its monodispersity in solution. Scattering provides low-resolution structural data on IgG3. Here, SAXS provides datasets measured in high positive solute–solvent contrast, in which the contribution of the hydrophilic surface regions of the glycoprotein are accentuated, whereas SANS measured with heavy water buffers provides datasets measured in high negative solute–solvent contrast, in which the contribution of the buried hydrophobic core of the glycoprotein is accentuated (18Perkins S.J.

Protein hydration in solution: Experimental observation by x-ray and neutron scattering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The tightly bound hydration layer is detected by SAXS because its electron density is similar to that of the protein and not to bulk water, whereas this same hydration layer is almost invisible by SANS measured in heavy water, because its nuclear density is almost the same as that of bulk water. The reproducibility of the SAXS and SANS datasets confirms the outcome of both methods, because experimental artefacts from radiation effects in SAXS and aggregation in heavy water by SANS may perturb the outputs of either method. SAXS and SANS datasets can now be represented as molecular structures by the relatively recent development of atomistic modeling using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods to fit the scattering curves (21Perkins S.J.

Crystallogr. 2016; 49: 1861-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we apply this joint AUC-SAXS-SANS approach to determine experimentally the first full-length IgG3 molecular structure for myeloma IgG3 in order to explain better its immune function. We also discuss the effect of the removal of the Fc glycans on the molecular structure of full-length IgG3. Human IgG3 was purified in high yields from human myeloma serum (Experimental procedures). In order to work with IgG3 with and without glycans, the deglycosylation of myeloma IgG3 was set up using peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digests according to the manufacturer's protocol (Experimental procedures). The completeness of deglycosylation was verified by a combination of size-exclusion gel filtration, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, and also by analytical ultracentrifugation (see below):(i)Deglycosylation of IgG3 was completed after 10 h. The elution of the IgG3 PNGase F-treated product from a gel filtration column slightly preceded that for native glycosylated IgG3 (Fig. 3A). Both forms eluted as a main symmetrical peak at 16.43 and 16.38 ml for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3, respectively (Fig. 3A). Trace amounts of a possible dimer just before 15 ml were discarded. This process ensured that the IgG3 sample was monodisperse with no aggregates present immediately before analytical ultracentrifugation or scattering experiments.(ii)When the IgG3 samples were submitted to nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE analyses at equimolar concentrations, purified glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 showed a single band above 140 kDa on 4% to 12% Bis Tris NuPage gel under nonreducing conditions, which is consistent with the assumed mass of ∼158 kDa for IgG3 (Fig. 3B). Under reducing conditions, two bands were present corresponding to the heavy chain (with an apparent mass of ∼50–70 kDa) and the light chain (with an apparent molecular mass of ∼25 kDa) (Fig. 3B). These apparent molecular masses were as expected from the known sequence (Fig. 2).(iii)Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry measurements showed a major peak and four minor peaks for glycosylated (in black) and deglycosylated (in magenta) IgG3 in a mass range of 160.2 to 169.5 kDa for glycosylated IgG3 and 156.6 to 166.0 kDa for deglycosylated IgG3 (Fig. 3C). These peaks were unaffected by longer PNGase F digestion times. The existence of five peaks is attributed to up to as many as six weakly occupied O-linked glycans of sizes 1.9 to 2.8 kDa in the IgG3 hinge (11Plomp R. Dekkers G. Rombouts Y. Visser R. Koeleman C.A.M.M. Kammeijer G.S.M.M. Jansen B.C. Rispens T. Hensbergen P.J. Vidarsson G. Wuhrer M. Hinge-region O-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3).Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14: 1373-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The impact of these O-linked glycans, if present, on the scattering data below is expected to be minimal because of their central location in the IgG3 structure and their low abundance and were not characterized further. The most intense IgG3 glycosylated population had an observed deconvoluted mass of 164,847 Da. For deglycosylated IgG3 (in magenta) the most intense population had an observed deconvoluted mass at 161,383 Da. The mass of each N-glycan chain was calculated by subtracting the glycosylated and deglycosylated masses and halving the outcome to give 1732 Da. This value agrees well with an assumed N-glycan composition of Gal2Man3GlcNAc4 that gives a mass of 1622 Da. Sedimentation velocity experiments characterized the masses and solution structures of glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3. The SEDFIT analyses of the boundaries involved fits of as many as 600 scans, and the good agreement between the experimental boundary scans and fitted lines is clear (left, Fig. 4A). From the c(s) analyses, the molecular masses of the IgG3 monomer peak were 108 (glycosylated) and 122 kDa (deglycosylated) in light water. In heavy water the molecular masses of the IgG3 monomer peak were 139 (glycosylated) and 156 kDa for deglycosylated. These values were comparable with the composition-calculated masses of 158 and 154 kDa for the glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 monomers, respectively. These also agree well with the values from mass spectrometry of 165 and 161 kDa for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3, respectively (Fig. 3C). In the resulting size distribution analyses c(s), a clear monomer peak that monitored the overall IgG3 solution structure was observed at average s20,w values of 5.82 ± 0.06 S for glycosylated IgG3 and 6.29 ± 0.05 S for deglycosylated IgG3 in light water (Fig. 4A; Table 1). Because the samples were dilute, the expected 0.2 S reduction (3%) in the s20,w values after deglycosylation to follow the 4 kDa reduction (3%) in the IgG3 mass was not seen because of noisy data at low concentrations. These s20,w values were consistent with previous AUC studies of glycosylated IgG3 that reported s20,w values of 6.11 ± 0.03 S (8Lu Y. Harding S.E. Michaelsen T.E. Longman E. Davis K.G. Ortega Á.

The calculation presumes that the IgG3 conformation (i.e., the frictional coefficient) is unchanged after deglycosylation. Variable minor peaks at 3 to 4 S were seen adjacent to the main monomer peak (M) (Fig. 4A); they were attributable to minor fragmentation of IgG3 and/or artefacts caused by small sample–buffer optical mismatches. In conclusion, given that no concentration dependences were seen in Figure 4B, these datasets showed that IgG3 was monomeric in solution, as required for scattering studies.Table 1Experimental data by X-ray and neutron scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3Small angle scattering dataConcentration (mg/ml)RG (nm)RXS-1 (nm)RXS-2 (nm)L (nm)X-ray data IgG3 glycosylated2.466.98 ± 0.621.41 ± 0.171.60 ± 0.10282.006.99 ± 0.631.41 ± 0.181.61 ± 0.10281.506.96 ± 0.671.41 ± 0.151.61 ± 0.22281.006.99 ± 0.821.41 ± 0.191.60 ± 0.27250.506.84 ± 0.901.32 ± 0.271.61 ± 0.3128 IgG3 deglycosylated1.007.05 ± 0.711.41 ± 0.191.59 ± 0.15280.506.98 ± 1.061.41 ± 0.291.58 ± 0.2528Neutron data IgG3 glycosylated1.856.26 ± 1.070.89 ± 0.301.15 ± 0.21280.706.20 ± 1.330.97 ± 0.2425 IgG3 deglycosylated1.216.24 ± 1.581.10 ± 0.351.22 ± 0.27250.656.33 ± 1.641.02 ± 0.4327AUC dataConcentration (mg/ml)s20,w (S)IgG3 glycosylated in light water0.395.800.345.900.195.78IgG3 deglycosylated in light water0.466.240.256.290.056.33 Open table in a new tab The solution structures of glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 samples were characterized by X-ray and neutron scattering. The two methods provided different perspectives of the same solution structure.

The X-ray data collection at IgG3 concentrations between 0.5 and 2.46 mg/ml used time frame analyses to ensure the absence of radiation damage effects. The resulting RG and RXS-1/RXS-2 values monitor the elongation of the overall IgG3 structure and its approximate cross-sectional structures, respectively. Guinier analyses resulted in high-quality linear plots for all samples and revealed three distinctive regions of the I(Q) curves, which is seen in the scattering curves for antibodies (22Rayner L.E.

From these, the RG, RXS-1, and RXS-2 values from the individual scattering curves were obtained within satisfactory Q·RG and Q·RXS limits of 1.05 to 1.55, 0.52 to 0.71, and 0.78 to 1.74, respectively (Fig. 5A).

The RXS-1 values from the individual curves (Fig. 6A) is an approximate monitor of the cross-sectional Fab and Fc arrangement in glycosylated IgG3 and deglycosylated IgG3. The mean X-ray RXS-1 values for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 were both typically 1.41 ± 0.2 nm, showing that the spatial arrangement of the Fab and Fc regions was unchanged following glycan removal. These values were notably reduced from RXS-1 values of 2.5 (±0.1) nm measured for monoclonal IgG1 before and after deglycosylation (17Spiteri V.A. Doutch J. Rambo R.P. Gor J. Dalby P.A. Perkins S.J.

This difference is attributed to the effect of the long hinge region in IgG3 that separated the Fab and Fc regions. This also had the effect of reducing the Q range that could be used for the RXS-1 fits compared with IgG1. The RXS-2 values are an approximate monitor of the mean cross-sectional dimensions of the individual Fab and Fc regions. The mean RXS-2 values for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG3 were similar in a range of 1.59 to 1.61 (±0.2) nm. This indicates that the averaged cross-sections of the two Fab and one Fc region were unchanged before and after deglycosylation. Similar RXS-2 values of 1.4 (±0.1) nm were recently reported for monoclonal IgG1 before and after deglycosylation (17Spiteri V.A. Doutch J. Rambo R.P. Gor J. Dalby P.A. Perkins S.J.

No concentration dependences were seen for IgG3, this being seen from the Guinier values that remained unchanged within error (Fig. 6).

Again, the Guinier analyses revealed high-quality linear fits for the RG, RXS-1, and RXS-2 parameters (Fig. 5B). A concentration dependence was not observed for IgG3, this being seen from the I(0)/c values that remained unchanged within error (Fig. 6B). This difference between the neutron and X-ray datasets is attributable to the fewer data points obtained with neutrons, leading to reduced precision in the datasets.

https://openalex.org/W3185207840,"Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of kinases and shares a highly conserved kinase domain with other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members. The activation of NLK contributes to the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), reducing c-myb expression and mechanistic target of rapamycin activity, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target. Unlike other anemias, the hematopoietic effects of DBA are largely restricted to the erythroid lineage. Mutations in ribosomal genes induce ribosomal insufficiency and reduced protein translation, dramatically impacting early erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of patients with DBA. We sought to identify compounds that suppress NLK and increases erythropoiesis in ribosomal insufficiency. We report that the active component of ginseng, ginsenoside Rb1, suppresses NLK expression and improves erythropoiesis in in vitro models of DBA. Ginsenoside Rb1-mediated suppression of NLK occurs through the upregulation of miR-208, which binds to the 3'-UTR of NLK mRNA and targets it for degradation. We also compare ginsenoside Rb1-mediated upregulation of miR-208 with metformin-mediated upregulation of miR-26. We conclude that targeting NLK expression through miRNA binding of the unique 3'-UTR is a viable alternative to the challenges of developing small-molecule inhibitors to target the highly conserved kinase domain of this specific kinase."
https://openalex.org/W3175612154,"Background Following testing in clinical trials, the use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has been authorized for use in parts of the world, including the USA and Europe. Early authorizations were largely based on results from two clinical trials. A third study published by Wang et al. was underpowered and deemed inconclusive. Although regulators have shown an interest in interpreting the Wang et al. study, under a frequentist framework it is difficult to determine if the non-significant finding was caused by a lack of power or by the absence of an effect. Bayesian hypothesis testing does allow for quantification of evidence in favor of the absence of an effect. Findings Results of our Bayesian reanalysis of the three trials show ambiguous evidence for the primary outcome of clinical improvement and moderate evidence against the secondary outcome of decreased mortality rate. Additional analyses of three studies published after initial marketing approval support these findings. Conclusions We recommend that regulatory bodies take all available evidence into account for endorsement decisions. A Bayesian approach can be beneficial, in particular in case of statistically non-significant results. This is especially pressing when limited clinical efficacy data is available."
https://openalex.org/W3184396908,"Mycobacteria are responsible for a heavy global disease burden, but their relative genetic intractability has long frustrated research efforts. The introduction of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) has made gene repression in mycobacteria much more efficient, but limitations of the prototypical Cas9-based platform, for example, in multigene regulation, remain. Here, we introduce an alternative CRISPRi platform for mycobacteria that is based on the minimal type V Cas12a enzyme in combination with synthetic CRISPR arrays. This system is simple, tunable, reversible, can efficiently regulate essential genes and multiple genes simultaneously, and works as efficiently in infected macrophages as it does in vitro. Together, Cas12a-based CRISPRi provides a facile tool to probe higher-order genetic interactions in mycobacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which will enable the development of synthetically lethal drug targets and the study of genes conditionally essential during infection. Mycobacteria are responsible for a heavy global disease burden, but their relative genetic intractability has long frustrated research efforts. The introduction of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) has made gene repression in mycobacteria much more efficient, but limitations of the prototypical Cas9-based platform, for example, in multigene regulation, remain. Here, we introduce an alternative CRISPRi platform for mycobacteria that is based on the minimal type V Cas12a enzyme in combination with synthetic CRISPR arrays. This system is simple, tunable, reversible, can efficiently regulate essential genes and multiple genes simultaneously, and works as efficiently in infected macrophages as it does in vitro. Together, Cas12a-based CRISPRi provides a facile tool to probe higher-order genetic interactions in mycobacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which will enable the development of synthetically lethal drug targets and the study of genes conditionally essential during infection. The adaptive bacterial immune systems based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) have transformed genetic manipulation, and the ease with which they can be programmed has led to their wide use in gene editing in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Knott G.J. Doudna J.A. CRISPR-Cas guides the future of genetic engineering.Science. 2018; 361: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). One application of the CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), introduced a new way of gene regulation by coexpressing an inactive Cas9 nuclease with an engineered single guide RNA (sgRNA) that directs the inactive nuclease to a target gene where it blocks transcription rather than cleaves the DNA (2Qi L.S. Larson M.H. Gilbert L.A. Doudna J.A. Weissman J.S. Arkin A.P. Lim W.A. Repurposing CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression.Cell. 2013; 152: 1173-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The prototypical CRISPRi system is based on an inactive type 2-II Cas9 nuclease (dCas9) and has recently also been adapted for use in mycobacteria including Mtb (3Choudhary E. Thakur P. Pareek M. Agarwal N. Gene silencing by CRISPR interference in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M. Chase M.R.

Investigating essential gene function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an efficient CRISPR interference system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44e143Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), for which genetic manipulation has long been an experimental bottleneck. Genetic manipulation of Mtb poses many challenges. The slow growth of Mtb makes all manipulations requiring chromosomal changes time-consuming, and while the high rate of illegitimate recombination in Mtb has been overcome by expressing heterologous recombineering enzymes (6van Kessel J.C. Hatfull G.F. Recombineering in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), allelic exchange and possibly removal of selection markers can still take weeks to months. Tunable gene repression and repression of essential genes before the introduction of CRISPRi required the introduction of regulatable promoters such as the tetracycline- or pristinamycin-inducible promoters (7Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. Controlling gene expression in mycobacteria.Future Microbiol. 2006; 1: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or sequences for regulated protein degradation (8Wei J.R. Krishnamoorthy V. Murphy K. Kim J.H. Schnappinger D. Alber T. Sassetti C.M. Rhee K.Y. Rubin E.J. Depletion of antibiotic targets has widely varying effects on growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in the chromosomal copy of a target gene. These approaches had varying efficiency, and leaky expression or repression could lead to incomplete control of target genes. While these challenges already complicated the manipulation of single genes, they multiplied for the manipulation of multiple genes at once. As a result, our understanding of genetic interactions in Mtb is lagging behind that in other bacteria. For genome-wide studies in Mtb, transposon mutagenesis has become a powerful tool, but insertion of transposons produces libraries with undefined mutations that require sequencing for deconvolution. Also, transposon libraries do not include essential genes, the genes that are arguably the most relevant, for example, in drug discovery. CRISPRi genome-wide libraries have been developed for eukaryotes and have been used, for example, for probing the host genetic factors for Mtb infection (9Lai Y. Babunovic G.H. Cui L. Dedon P.C. Doench J.G. Fortune S.M. Lu T.K. Illuminating host-mycobacterial interactions with genome-wide CRISPR knockout and CRISPRi screens.Cell Syst. 2020; 11: 239-251.e237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). With their defined nature, tunability, and inclusion of essential genes, CRISPRi Mtb mutant libraries seem poised for global approaches to understand Mtb gene function. Despite the advantages of CRISPRi, however, knockdown efficiency can vary widely for different target genes, and simultaneous manipulation of more than one gene remains challenging. These limitations have hampered attempts to probe redundant genes, gene families, and higher-order genetic interactions. Natural CRISPR systems are inherently multigene regulatory systems that can principally also be reprogrammed to regulate multiple genes at once. One current limitation of the Cas9-based system, however, is the relatively large size of the sgRNA which requires a crRNA and a tracrRNA that are typically fused to produce the >100 bp long sgRNA. Expression of multiple sgRNAs for multigene knockdown requires stepwise cloning of large individual transcriptional units for each sgRNA and in mycobacteria has shown mostly moderate knockdown efficiency of 2- to 3-fold for most genes (10Agarwal N. Construction of a novel CRISPRi-based tool for silencing of multiple genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Plasmid. 2020; 110: 102515Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The natural diversity of CRISPR systems, however, may offer simpler solutions to CRISPRi in Mtb: Recently, the minimal type 2-V CRISPR enzyme Cas12a (previously Cpf1) has been described (11Zetsche B. Gootenberg J.S. Abudayyeh O.O. Slaymaker I.M. Makarova K.S. Essletzbichler P. Volz S.E. Joung J. van der Oost J. Regev A. Koonin E.V. Zhang F. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system.Cell. 2015; 163: 759-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Cas12a does not require a tracrRNA and combines pre-crRNA processing and interference functions in one enzyme (12Fonfara I. Richter H. Bratovic M. Le Rhun A. Charpentier E. The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA.Nature. 2016; 532: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The combination of these biochemical functions makes Cas12a a stand-alone enzyme that at least in some bacteria only requires a synthetic CRISPR array for the generation of mature crRNAs. This simplified system has been rapidly adapted for multiplex gene editing in mammalian cells (13Zetsche B. Heidenreich M. Mohanraju P. Fedorova I. Kneppers J. DeGennaro E.M. Winblad N.

Multiplex gene regulation by CRISPR-ddCpf1.Cell Discov. 2017; 3: 17018Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus (17Choi S.Y. Woo H.M. CRISPRi-dCas12a: A dCas12a-mediated CRISPR interference for repression of multiple genes and metabolic engineering in Cyanobacteria.ACS Synth.

Biol. 2020; 9: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Here, we adapted this system for CRISPRi in mycobacteria, creating a simple, highly tunable, reversible, multigene regulation platform. To test whether dCas12a in conjunction with a synthetic CRISPR array can be used for CRISPRi in mycobacteria, we stably introduced the gene for the inactive Francisella novicida Cas12a mutant Asp917Ala (dCas12a) into the Tweety recombination site of Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) strain mc2155 (19Pham T.T. Jacobs-Sera D. Pedulla M.L. Hendrix R.W. Hatfull G.F. Comparative genomic analysis of mycobacteriophage tweety: Evolutionary insights and construction of compatible site-specific integration vectors for mycobacteria.Microbiology (Reading). 2007; 153: 2711-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Asp917Ala mutant abrogates DNA cleavage activity but retains pre-CRISPR RNA processing activity (12Fonfara I. Richter H. Bratovic M. Le Rhun A. Charpentier E. The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA.Nature. 2016; 532: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Initially, we could not detect the Francisella-derived dCas12a enzyme in Msm by Western blot, even after expression from a strong constitutive promoter. The Francisella cas12a sequence is AT-rich (30% GC), while mycobacterial genomes are GC-rich (Mtb 66%, Msm 67% GC). To test whether these differences limit expression, we tested a Francisella cas12a gene that was previously codon-optimized for human expression and has a GC content of 46%. This construct was readily expressed in Msm and Mtb. We next sought to test whether Msm expressing dCas12a can process synthetic CRISPR arrays into functional crRNAs and repress transcription of target genes. We first created the Msm-luc-dCas12a strain by integrating an ATc-inducible dcas12a into the Tweety recombination site and integrating a constitutively expressed luxCDABE operon, which generates autoluminescence in mycobacteria (20Andreu N. Zelmer A. Fletcher T. Elkington P.T. Ward T.H. Ripoll J. Parish T. Bancroft G.J. Schaible U. Robertson B.D. Wiles S. Optimisation of bioluminescent reporters for use with mycobacteria.PLoS One. 2010; 5e10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), into the L5 recombination site. We then targeted the template strand of the luxCDABE operon by episomally expressing synthetic CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays contained the Francisella repeat sequence (GTCTAAGAACTTTAAATAATTTCTACTGTTGTAGAT) flanking each 22 bp spacer sequence complementary to the luxCDABE promoter and coding sequence (Fig. 2A). Each target region on luxCDABE was selected to be immediately downstream from the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) TTTV or TTN that licenses Francisella Cas12a binding to the target DNA (11Zetsche B. Gootenberg J.S. Abudayyeh O.O. Slaymaker I.M. Makarova K.S. Essletzbichler P. Volz S.E. Joung J. van der Oost J. Regev A. Koonin E.V. Zhang F.

Systematically investigating the key features of the DNase deactivated Cpf1 for tunable transcription regulation in prokaryotic cells.Synth. Syst. Biotechnol. 2019; 4: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The synthetic CRISPR arrays for production of pre-crRNA were expressed from an inducible mycobacterial expression plasmid under the control of ATc in the Msm-luc-dCas12a strain. After induction, we continuously measured luciferase activity for 16 h. As controls, we included a strain expressing a nontargeting array (NTA) containing three 22 bp spacer sequences that lack homology to Msm or Mtb sequences and compared luminescence in each strain with and without ATc. We observed reduction of luminescence in all dCas12a strains carrying arrays with lux spacers when compared with the noninduced strains and the NTA strain. Reduction in luminescence was dependent on the number of spacers targeting the operon, from 15-fold with one targeting spacer (1x) to ∼45-fold with three (3x) and six spacers (6x), indicating that three spacers may be sufficient for maximal knockdown. Maximal knockdown was reached after 8 to 12 h or 3 to 4 doubling times. To test the strand preference of dCas12a-mediated knockdown in mycobacteria, we next targeted the nontemplate strand of the lux promoter and sequences in luxB and luxD with a total of three spacers. Targeting the nontemplate strand reduced expression of lux genes, but to much lower degrees than the same number of spacers targeting the template strand (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous findings that the template strand is the main target for Francisella Cas12a (16Zhang X. Wang J. Cheng Q. Zheng X. Zhao G. Wang J. Multiplex gene regulation by CRISPR-ddCpf1.Cell Discov. 2017; 3: 17018Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Miao C. Zhao H. Qian L. Lou C. Systematically investigating the key features of the DNase deactivated Cpf1 for tunable transcription regulation in prokaryotic cells.Synth. Syst. Biotechnol. 2019; 4: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Growth of Msm was marginally slowed by expression of dCas12a and the NTA (Fig. 2B). To test whether the use of multiple spacers targeting a single transcript has an additive effect on knockdown, we tested the 3x array compared with each of its three spacers individually (Fig. 2C). The individual spacers knocked down luminescence with declining efficiency in the order in which they bind to the luxCDABE operon, and their combined effect was in fact larger than the sum of the individual effects, suggesting moderate synergy between spacers. When we expressed dCas12a from a strong constitutive promoter, we observed baseline knockdown of about tenfold even in the absence of array induction by ATc (data not shown), indicating that even small amounts of leaky expression of the array can lead to knockdown. Strains expressing both the array and dCas12a from ATc inducible promoters allowed for a wider range of induction and were used for this study. To explore the ATc dose response of knockdown, we tested the effect of a range of ATc concentrations on luminescence (Fig. 2D). Small concentrations of ATc as low as 4 ng/ml fully induced maximal knockdown, and lower concentrations induced partial knockdown. These data show that dCas12 can process pre-crRNA into mature crRNAs and repress endogenous genes in Msm. Although the reduction of luminescence was likely due to the simultaneous repression of several lux genes, the common final readout for all lux genes (luminescence) in these experiments could not conclusively distinguish between single or multigene knockdown. To test for functional multigene knockdown of endogenous genes, we next created a double auxotroph strain of Msm that carried a synthetic CRISPR array targeting two essential genes that are required for the synthesis of the amino acids Trp (trpD) and Pro (proC). We introduced two spacers for each gene into a single CRISPR array. After induction of the array in Msm expressing dCas12a, the strain showed no growth in medium lacking Trp and/or Pro (Fig. 2E). Complementation by the two amino acids fully restored growth to wild type levels, whereas complementation with either one of the two amino acids did not rescue growth (Fig. 2E). These data show that both genes were effectively silenced and that dCas12a can target multiple endogenous genes as well as essential genes. We next tested whether dCas12a-mediated CRISPRi can be adapted to Mtb. We introduced synthetic CRISPR arrays containing spacers targeting the luxCDABE operon into Mtb-luc-dCas12a, an Mtb strain carrying dCas12a in the Tweety recombination site, and the lux operon in the L5 recombination site. Induction of the arrays with ATc resulted in efficient reduction of luminescence (Fig. 3A). The degree of knockdown was dependent on the number of spacers targeting the operon, with one spacer resulting in 28-fold and three and six spacers resulting in 45-fold reduction of luminescence signal. Similar to Msm, three spacers were sufficient for maximal knockdown and knockdown was maximal after 3 to 4 doubling times. In contrast to Msm, targeting the nontemplate strand with three spacers did not reduce the luminescence signal. Expression of dCas12a and the NTA did not have an apparent effect on growth of Mtb (Fig. 3A). To test the reversibility of the system, we induced the Mtb strain carrying an array with three spacers targeting the lux operon for 4 days and removed the inducer ATc by washout and resuspension in fresh medium. When ATc was added back to the cultures immediately after washing, the luciferase activity remained repressed. Without ATc, luciferase signal completely recovered after 4 days (Fig. 3B). These data show that the system is highly responsive and can be turned off within four doubling times by removing the inducer ATc. To test the selectivity of spacer binding and knockdown, we measured global gene expression in the induced and uninduced strains carrying the 6x luciferase array by RNA sequencing. While there were no significant expression changes consistent with direct off-target effects of the six spacers, a small number of genes were moderately upregulated. None of these genes had detectable similarity to the spacer sequences, and their induction may be a cellular response to the higher consumption of ATP by luciferase in the uninduced strain (Fig. S1). Next, we sought to test for multigene regulation in Mtb. We designed an array targeting the genes pknH, fadD2, amiC, luxD, and rv0147 with two spacers for each gene—the 5g array. To detect knockdown of all targeted genes and determine the efficiency of multigene knockdown, we analyzed the knockdown strains by qRT-PCR. All five targeted genes were repressed, with between 3- and 14-fold reduction in mRNA (Fig. 3C). Transcript levels of the unrelated gene Rv0015c, which was not targeted by the array, were unchanged, indicating that expression of dCas12a and ten spacers had no general effects depressing global transcription. These data show that at least five genes can readily be repressed by dCas12a simultaneously. CRISPRi in mycobacteria has thus far only been used to regulate bacterial genes in vitro (3Choudhary E. Thakur P. Pareek M. Agarwal N. Gene silencing by CRISPR interference in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M.

Carette X. Potluri L.P. Sharp J.D. Xu R. Prisic S. Husson R.N. Investigating essential gene function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an efficient CRISPR interference system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44e143Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test whether the dCas12a-based system can also be used to regulate gene expression during infection, we infected activated human monocytic THP-1 cells, a macrophage-like cell line commonly used for Mtb infection (22Theus S.A. Cave M.D. Eisenach K.D. Activated THP-1 cells: An attractive model for the assessment of intracellular growth rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with a strain carrying an array with three spacers targeting the luxCDABE operon. CRISPRi was induced with ATc or mock-induced with DMSO after infection with Mtb. After 4 days, the CRISPRi strain carrying the array showed 40-fold knockdown of luminescence, comparable to the knockdown observed in vitro (Fig. 4). To rule out that CRISPRi led to increased THP-1 killing, which would affect Mtb survival and confound the luminescence readout, we measured THP-1 cell health with the Alamar Blue reagent. CRISPRi-mediated gene repression had no effect on THP-1 cell health, indicating that the reduction in luminescence was entirely due to luciferase gene repression (Fig. 4). The introduction of CRISPRi to the toolkit of mycobacterial genetics has greatly accelerated many areas of mycobacterial research. Yet, the canonical Cas9-based system has some limitations, and in particular multigene knockdown remains challenging. Here, we exploited the inherent multigene targeting capability of CRISPR systems, in particular the minimal Cas12a, to achieve more efficient multigene regulation in mycobacteria. Although the upper limit for the number of genes that can be repressed with this system remains to be determined, it is likely higher than the five tested here. To knock down five genes in our study, we used ten spacers that could also be directed at different targets, although fewer spacers per gene likely affect the efficiency of any individual knockdown. The natural Francisella CRISPR arrays contain up to 26 spacers, perhaps indicating the natural upper limit for the system. The degree of knockdown by CRISPRi can generally be tuned by varying the concentration of the inducer ATc, by the choice of spacers, and by using target sequences with different PAM strengths. The latter two are less predictable and require empirical testing. In our system, knockdown efficiency can further be tuned by varying the number of spacers targeting each gene, a more predictable approach as each additional spacer produces higher levels of knockdown. In general, an alternative CRISPRi system provides additional options for targeting genes that may be difficult to target in other systems. For multigene knockdown, we anticipate a trade-off between the efficiency of knockdown and the number of genes targeted that should be considered for optimal array design. The repetitive nature of the repeat sequences of the synthetic arrays also introduces challenges for gene synthesis, although we could readily obtain functional arrays with as many as 13 repeats. For facile multigene regulation, Cas12a has clear advantages over Cas9-based CRISPRi systems. The much shorter repeat and spacer sequences (∼36 bp and ∼22 bp, respectively) and the single transcriptional unit required for any number of spacers make the Cas12a-based system more practical than the current Cas9-based system, which requires crRNAs of >100 bases with individual promoter and terminator sequences. Another advantage of Cas12a-based CRISPRi is its genome coverage. The genome coverage of CRISPRi is determined by the PAM frequency for a given Cas enzyme and is a main factor for a CRISPRi system’s utility. The Cas12a PAM coverage of the Mtb genome is more complete than that of S. thermophilus Cas9, the currently most efficient Cas9 used in mycobacteria (4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M. Chase M.R. Gerrick E.R. Pritchard J.R. Church G.M. Rubin E.J. Sassetti C.M. Schnappinger D. Fortune S.M. Programmable transcriptional repression in mycobacteria using an orthogonal CRISPR interference platform.Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2: 16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The strongest PAM for S. thermophilus Cas9, AGAAG, is found in 34% of Mtb coding sequences, whereas the strongest Cas12a PAM, TTTV (V = A/C/G) is found in 89% of Mtb coding sequences and targets on average every 235 base pairs. Combined with less efficient PAMs for both enzymes (4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M. Chase M.R. Gerrick E.R. Pritchard J.R. Church G.M. Rubin E.J. Sassetti C.M. Schnappinger D.

Cell. 2016; 62: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), S. thermophilus Cas9 can target the Mtb genome every 45 bps on average for a given strand, Cas12a every 32 bp, and both can target 98% of genes. Although the S. pyogenes Cas9 uses a PAM that is more common, the enzyme is not as efficient in gene repression in mycobacteria (3Choudhary E. Thakur P. Pareek M. Agarwal N. Gene silencing by CRISPR interference in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M. Chase M.R. Gerrick E.R.

Schneider M.W. Yamano T. Nishimasu H. Nureki O. Crosetto N. Zhang F. Engineered Cpf1 variants with altered PAM specificities.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that recognizes the PAM sequence TYCV (Y = C/T), which could further increase genome coverage. While we did not directly compare the efficiency of Cas9 and Cas12a-based CRISPRi, Cas9-based CRISPRi in Msm reduced luminescence by 2.7- to 166-fold in one study (4Rock J.M. Hopkins F.F. Chavez A. Diallo M. Chase M.R. Gerrick E.R. Pritchard J.R. Church G.M. Rubin E.J. Sassetti C.M. Schnappinger D. Fortune S.M. Programmable transcriptional repression in mycobacteria using an orthogonal CRISPR interference platform.Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2: 16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), depending on the Cas9 ortholog used, compared with maximal reduction in luminescence of 45-fold in our study. The large differences between the efficiency of Cas9 orthologs suggest that other Cas12a orthologs may also yield improved repression. When compared to the canonical dCas9-based system, our system is particularly beneficial for dissecting redundancy between Mtb genes, which has impeded the study of many gene families such as the PE and PPE genes. Multidrug therapy is a bedrock of tuberculosis therapy and developing such therapies requires testing of complex gene–gene and drug–gene interactions. With our system, the testing of interactions between multiple genes to identify synergy and/or synthetic lethality is becoming tractable. The dCas12a-based CRISPRi system suppressed gene expression as efficiently in infected THP-1 cells as it did in vitro, which expands the system’s use to the study of genes conditionally essential during infection and to host–pathogen interactions. Because the tetracycline promoter–inducer system used here for the control of dCas12a and the synthetic arrays is also generally functional in mice, we anticipate that our system also works in vivo. In addition, the equal efficiency of knockdown in vitro and in macrophages will allow for the probing of host–pathogen interactions, for example, interactions between host-induced Mtb efflux pumps that currently limit the effectiveness of several tuberculosis drugs (26Adams K.N. Takaki K. Connolly L.E. Wiedenhoft H. Winglee K. Humbert O. Edelstein P.H. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Drug tolerance in replicating mycobacteria mediated by a macrophage-induced efflux mechanism.Cell. 2011; 145: 39-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Together, we introduce a new CRISPRi system for mycobacteria for tunable and efficient multigene regulation in vitro and in infected macrophages. This Cas12a-based system is versatile and the efficient multigene regulation will be particularly useful for the study of larger and redundant gene families and generally for the study of higher-order genetic and host–pathogen interactions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth or on 7H10 plates supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 10% OADC, 0.05% Tween80 (broth only) with appropriate selective antibiotics and amino acids. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ATc: 50 ng/ml (unless otherwise noted), Hyg: 100 ng/ml, Zeo: 25 μg/ml. L-tryptophan and L-proline were supplemented at 50 μg/ml. Spacer sequences were chosen by first identifying all Cas12a-compatible PAMs within a gene’s promoter and coding sequence. Target sequences containing the ideal PAM, TTTV, were prioritized over targets with the less effective PAM TTN, and target sequences within the promoter and nearest the 5′ end of the coding sequence were prioritized over downstream sequences. Off-target binding of spacers was predicted by Cas-OFFinder (27Bae S. Park J. Kim J.S.

The Renilla luciferase luxCDABE operon was expressed under the control of the constitutive MOPS promoter on an L5-integrating plasmid containing a Kan-selectable marker. The pNFCF vector was created by replacing the Uv15-Tet promoter in pDTCF (18Knoot C.J. Biswas S. Pakrasi H.B.

To clone crRNA arrays into pNFCF, sequences flanked by overhangs for Gibson Assembly matching the vector insertion site (5′-CCGCATGCTTAATTAAGAAGGAGATATACAT-3′) – array sequence – (5′-GACTACAAGGATGACGACGACAAG-3′) were synthesized (Genscript) and obtained in a pUC57-Kan vector. The inserts were amplified using standard PrimeStarHS PCR chemistry with 55 °C annealing temp and the forward primer (5′-CCGCATGCTTAATTAAGAAGGAGATATACAT-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTTGTCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAGTC-3′). The pNFCF vector was PCR linearized with forward (5′-ATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAATTAAGCATGCGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTACAAGGATGACGACGACAAG-3′) linearization primers and a touchdown thermocycler program using 60 to 55 °C annealing temperatures. Array inserts and linearized pNFCF vector were gel-purified and then assembled via Gibson Assembly. All vectors used in this study are described in Table S2. Strains in log phase were grown for at least two doublings and diluted to OD600 of 0.005, and expression of the crRNA array and dCas12a was induced with ATc or mock-induced with DMSO. To assess knockdown, 100 μl culture was dispensed into 96-well, white, flat-bottom plates, and luminescence was quantified using a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech), blanked against media. For M. smegmatis, cultures were incubated inside the plate reader at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. M. smegmatis cultures were grown to late log-phase in media supplemented with 50 μg/ml L-tryptophan and L-proline, then diluted to an OD600 of 0.4 and grown for 3 h in the dark. Cultures were washed twice in nonsupplemented media and diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 with ATc and Hyg to drive expression of and maintain selection for the CRISPRi system. Different combinations of amino acids were supplemented into the cultures, and growth was monitored after 12 h at 37 °C by measuring luminescence. Liquid cultures of Mtb-luc-dCas12a were induced in early log phase with 50 ng/ml ATc or mock-induced with DMSO and grown for 4 days to mid-log phase. RNA was extracted in Trizol, purified, and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScriptIV polymerase and random hexamer primers. mRNA expression levels for each gene were determined by qRT-PCR using SybrGreen iTaq chemistry and normalized to sigH mRNA expression and plotted as the ratio of mRNA levels (calculated as 2−ΔΔCq) in each strain relative to the mock-induced 5g strain. Msm-luc-dCas12a cultures were induced with ATc in triplicate and grown overnight to mid-log phase. RNA was extracted in Trizol, purified with QIAGEN RNeasy columns, and rRNA was depleted using the siTOOLs Pan-Prokaryote riboPOOL system. The cDNA library was generated using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit, and samples were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq High Output 75 platform with paired end reads. The genomic reads were assembled and mapped using the R package DuffyTools (28Lakshmanan V. Fishbaugher M.E. Morrison B. Baldwin M. Macarulay M. Vaughan A.M. Mikolajczak S.A. Kappe S.H.

Then q-values were calculated from the EdgeR p-values using the R package Bioconductor. Undifferentiated THP-1 cells were dispensed into a 96-well plate and differentiated with 100 nM PMA for 4 days, then infected with Mtb-luc-dCas12a strains at a multiplicity of infection of 1. The infection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either 100 ng/ml of the inducer ATc or DMSO for mock induction. Knockdown was assessed by monitoring Mtb auto-luminescence daily via plate reader, and THP-1 health was visually assessed daily. After 4 days postinfection, THP-1 survival was assessed by adding Alamar Blue at 10% v/v and measuring fluorescence (560 nm excitation, 590 nm emission) after incubation for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W3185091572,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the spine is a common pathological condition that causes intractable myelopathy and radiculopathy, mainly the result of an endochondral ossification-like process. Our previous genome-wide association study identified six susceptibility loci for OPLL, including the cell division cycle 5-like (CDC5L) gene region. Here, we found CDC5L to be expressed in type II collagen-producing chondrocyte-like fibroblasts in human OPLL specimens, as well as in differentiating ATDC5 chondrocytes. Cdc5l siRNA transfection in murine chondrocytes decreased the expression of the early chondrogenic genes Sox9 and Col2a1, diminished the cartilage matrix production, and enhanced the expression of parathyroid-hormone-related protein (a resting chondrocyte marker). We also showed that Cdc5l shRNA suppressed the growth of cultured murine embryonal metatarsal cartilage rudiments and that Cdc5l knockdown suppressed the growth of ATDC5 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that the G2/M cell cycle transition was blocked; our data showed that Cdc5l siRNA transfection enhanced expression of Wee1, an inhibitor of the G2/M transition. Cdc5l siRNA also decreased the pre-mRNA splicing efficiency of Sox9 and Col2a1 genes in both ATDC5 cells and primary chondrocytes; conversely, loss of Cdc5l resulted in enhanced splicing of Wee1 pre-mRNA. Finally, an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Cdc5l bound directly to these target gene transcripts. Overall, we conclude that Cdc5l promotes both early chondrogenesis and cartilage growth and may play a role in the etiology of OPLL, at least in part by fine-tuning the pre-mRNA splicing of chondrogenic genes and Wee1, thus initiating the endochondral ossification process."
https://openalex.org/W3183552928,"Digital credit is a recent innovation that raises hopes of improving credit access in developing countries. However, up until now, empirical research on the extent to which digital credit actually reaches people who are otherwise excluded from conventional credit markets and whether increased credit access is sustainable or threatened by high default and blacklisting rates is very scarce. Using representative data from Kenya, this article shows that digital credit increases borrowing opportunities, including for people less likely to otherwise have credit access in the conventional credit markets. However, we find that digital credit borrowing is also responsible for 90% of all blacklistings, which is partially driven by higher default rates in the digital credit market but also by a higher probability that digital credit defaults lead to blacklisting of the borrower, compared to defaults in other credit markets."
https://openalex.org/W3183656143,"The need for excess weight gain prevention in disadvantaged young children is widely recognised. Early Childhood Education and Care teachers are potential key actors in early interventions to prevent overweight and obesity. This study examines the effects of a preschool-based intervention for teachers in promoting healthy eating and physical activity in young children. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted at 41 preschools in a deprived area of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The intervention consisted of 2 programmes that were applied in succession: A Healthy Start and PLAYgrounds for TODdlers. The study period was 9 months. Primary outcomes were assessed via questionnaires and included teachers' knowledge, attitude, food/activity-related practices, and level of confidence in promoting healthy behaviours. Secondary outcomes in this study were teachers' and children's BMI (z-score), body composition, dietary intake and physical activity level. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models. In total, 115 teachers and 249 children (mean age 3.0 (0.2) years) were included. A positive effect on teachers' knowledge about the Dutch dietary guidelines was found after the programme A Healthy Start (difference = 1.38; 1-sided 95% CL = 0.29; p = 0.02). This effect was not sustained at 9 months (difference = 0.34; 1-sided 95% CL = -0.76; p = 0.31). The overall intervention had a positive effect on 3 of the 5 attitude statements regarding a healthy lifestyle (difference ranged from 0.34 to 0.55) and on the practice scale Activity-related-Modelling (difference = 0.16; 1-sided 95% CL = 0.06; p = 0.01). No intervention effects were observed on food-related practice scales and the level of confidence in promoting healthy behaviours. At this stage, no effects were seen on teachers' and children's BMI (z-score). This study contributes to the professional development of Early Childhood Education and Care teachers and addresses the call for interventions to prevent overweight/obesity and to minimise health inequalities in young children."

The basic composition of breast milk was determined using a MIRIS analyzer, cortisol concentration in samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent test and their total antioxidant status was assessed by DPPH and FRAP methods.It has been shown that the concentration of cortisol in samples of human milk in the group of women giving birth before 37 weeks was 13.95 ng / ml [4,71-86,84], while in the group of women giving birth after week 37 of pregnancy-10.31 ng / ml [2.35-39-02] (p = 0.014), while% inhibition of DPPH was 65.46% and 58.30%, respectively (p = 0.014).Milk from women giving birth prematurely is qualitatively different from the milk of women giving birth on time. The total antioxidant status of preterm milk is higher than term milk, which promotes the development of premature babies. Higher cortisol levels in samples from women giving birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy may stimulate the digestive system."
https://openalex.org/W3186684355,"The efficacy of extensive balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) beyond hemodynamic improvement in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients has been verified. However, the relationship between extensive BPA in CTEPH patients after partial hemodynamic improvement and exercise tolerance or quality of life (QOL) remains unclear. We prospectively enrolled 22 CTEPH patients (66±10 years, females: 59%) when their mean pulmonary artery pressure initially decreased to <30 mmHg during BPA sessions. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and QOL scores using the 36-item short form questionnaire (SF-36) were evaluated at enrollment (entry), just after the final BPA session (finish), and at the 6-month follow-up (follow-up). We analyzed whether extensive BPA improves exercise capacity and QOL scores over time. Moreover, the clinical characteristics leading to improvement were elucidated. The peak oxygen uptake (VO2) showed significant improvement at entry, finish, and follow-up (17.3±5.5, 18.4±5.9, and 18.9±5.3 mL/kg/min, respectively; P<0.001). Regarding the QOL, the physical component summary (PCS) scores significantly improved (32±11, 38±13, and 43±13, respectively; P<0.001), but the mental component summary scores remained unchanged. Linear regression analysis revealed that age and a low peak VO2 at entry were predictors of improvement in peak VO2, while low PCS scores and low TAPSE at entry were predictors of improvement in PCS scores. In conclusion, extensive BPA led to improved exercise tolerance and physical QOL scores, even in CTEPH patients with partially improved hemodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3183310493,"Air quality in China has gradually been improving in recent years; however, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region continues to be the most polluted area in China, with the worst air quality index. BTH and its surrounding areas experience high agglomeration of heavy-polluting manufacturers that generate electric power, process petroleum and coal, and carry out smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, raw chemical materials, chemical products, and non-metallic mineral products. This study presents evidence of the air pollution impacts of industrial agglomeration using the Ellison-Glaeser index, Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. This was based on data from 73,353 enterprises in ""2+26"" atmospheric pollution transmission channel cities in BTH and its surrounding areas (herein referred to as BTH ""2+26"" cities). The results showed that Beijing, Yangquan, Puyang, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Jinan had the highest Ellison-Glaeser index among the BTH ""2+26"" cities; this represents the highest enterprise agglomeration. Beijing, Langfang, Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan also showed a low Herfindahl-Hirschman index of pollutant emissions, which have a relatively high degree of industrial agglomeration in BTH ""2+26"" cities. There was an inverted U-shaped relationship between enterprise agglomeration and air quality in the BTH ""2+26"" cities. This means that air quality improved with increased industrial agglomeration up to a certain level; beyond this point, the air quality begins to deteriorate with a decrease in industrial agglomeration."
https://openalex.org/W3183971741,"Development of biotherapeutics is hampered by the inherent risk of immunogenicity, which requires extensive clinical assessment and possible re-engineering efforts for mitigation. The focus in the pre-clinical phase is to determine the likelihood of developing treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE-ADA) and presence of pre-existing ADA in drug-naïve individuals as risk-profiling strategies. Pre-existing ADAs are routinely identified during clinical immunogenicity assessment, but their origin and impact on drug safety and efficacy have not been fully elucidated. One specific class of pre-existing ADAs has been described, which targets neoepitopes of antibody fragments, including Fabs, VH, or VHH domains in isolation from their IgG context. With the increasing number of antibody fragments and other small binding scaffolds entering the clinic, a widely applicable method to mitigate pre-existing reactivity against these molecules is desirable. Here is described a structure-based engineering approach to abrogate pre-existing ADA reactivity to the C-terminal neoepitope of VH(H)s. On the basis of 3D structures, small modifications applicable to any VH(H) are devised that would not impact developability or antigen binding. In-silico B cell epitope mapping algorithms were used to rank the modified VHH variants by antigenicity; however, the limited discriminating capacity of the computational methods prompted an experimental evaluation of the engineered molecules. The results identified numerous modifications capable of reducing pre-existing ADA binding. The most efficient consisted of the addition of two proline residues at the VHH C-terminus, which led to no detectable pre-existing ADA reactivity while maintaining favorable developability characteristics. The method described, and the modifications identified thereby, may provide a broadly applicable solution to mitigate immunogenicity risk of antibody-fragments in the clinic and increase safety and efficacy of this promising new class of biotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3184645555,"Over the past two decades non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have steadily increased as a cause of worldwide disability and mortality with a concomitant decrease in disease burden from communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional conditions. Congenital anomalies, the most common NCD affecting children, have recently become the fifth leading cause of under-five mortality worldwide, ahead of other conditions such as malaria, neonatal sepsis and malnutrition. Genetic counseling has been shown to be an effective method to decrease the impact of congenital anomalies and genetic conditions but is absent in almost all sub-Saharan Africa countries. To address this need for counseling services we designed and implemented the first broad-based genetic counseling curriculum in Ethiopia, launching it at St. Paul's Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.The curriculum, created by Michigan Medicine and SPHMMC specialists, consisted of medical knowledge and genetic counseling content and was delivered to two cohorts of nurses. Curriculum evaluation consisted of satisfaction surveys and pre- and post-assessments covering medical knowledge and genetic counseling content. Following Cohort 1 training, the curriculum was modified to increase the medical knowledge material and decrease Western genetic counseling principles material.Both cohorts reported high levels of satisfaction but felt the workshop was too short. No significant improvements in assessment scores were seen for Cohort 1 in terms of total scores and medical knowledge and genetic counseling-specific questions. Following curriculum modification, improvements were seen in Cohort 2 with an increase in total assessment scores from 63% to 73% (p = 0.043), with medical knowledge-specific questions increasing from 57% to 79% (p = 0.01) with no significant change in genetic counseling-specific scores. Multiple logistic, financial, cultural and systems-specific barriers were identified with recommendations for their consideration presented.Genetics medical knowledge of Ethiopian nurses increased significantly following curriculum delivery though difficulty was encountered with Western genetic counseling material."
https://openalex.org/W3184670955,"Insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) encode endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins that regulate intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, some of which orchestrate lipid metabolism via interaction with INSIGs. Recently, it was reported that expression of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) was induced by certain oxysterols; the precise of mechanism is unclear. Herein, we show that INSIGs mediate ATF4 upregulation upon interaction with oxysterol. Oxysterols that possess a high affinity for INSIG, such as 27- and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), markedly induced the increase of ATF4 protein when compared with other oxysterols. In addition, ATF4 upregulation by these oxysterols was attenuated in INSIG1/2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and recovered by either INSIG1 or INSIG2 rescue. Mechanistic studies revealed that the binding of 25HC to INSIG is critical for increased ATF4 protein via activation of protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. Knockout of INSIG1 or INSIG2 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells attenuated ATF4 protein upregulation, indicating that only one of the endogenous INSIGs, unlike overexpression of intrinsic INSIG1 or INSIG2, was insufficient for ATF4 induction. Furthermore, ATF4 proactively upregulated the cell death-inducible gene expression, such as Chop, Chac1, and Trb3, thereby markedly reducing cell viability with 25HC. These findings support a model whereby that INSIGs sense an increase in oxysterol in the endoplasmic reticulum and induce an increase of ATF4 protein via the protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α pathway, thereby promoting cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3186280392,"Gene abnormalities, including mutations and fusions, are important determinants in the molecular diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms. The use of bone marrow (BM) smears as a source of DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables molecular diagnosis to be done with small amounts of bone marrow and is especially useful for patients without stocked cells, DNA or RNA. The present study aimed to analyze the quality of DNA and RNA derived from smear samples and the utility of NGS for diagnosing myeloid neoplasms. Targeted DNA sequencing using paired BM cells and smears yielded sequencing data of adequate quality for variant calling. The detected variants were analyzed using the bioinformatics approach to detect mutations reliably and increase sensitivity. Noise deriving from variants with extremely low variant allele frequency (VAF) was detected in smear sample data and removed by filtering. Consequently, various driver gene mutations were detected across a wide range of allele frequencies in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Moreover, targeted RNA sequencing successfully detected fusion genes using smear-derived, very low-quality RNA, even in a patient with a normal karyotype. These findings demonstrated that smear samples can be used for clinical molecular diagnosis with adequate noise-reduction methods even if the DNA and RNA quality is inferior."
https://openalex.org/W3186305950,"Over the past decades, Escherichia coli (E. coli) have acquired extensive resistance to antibiotics; especially β- lactams. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase producers among E. coli isolates and their correlation with serotypes, phylogenetic background, and pathogenicity associated islands. A total of 105 E. coli strains were isolated and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against β-lactam antibiotics. All isolates showed a high resistance profile. Resistant isolates were tested for ESBL and carbapenemase production. Fifty-three and 18 isolates were positive for ESBL and carbapenemase producers, respectively. ESBL and carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR. TEM gene was the most prevalent gene among all isolates followed by SHV and CTX-M15. In carbapenemase-producers, OXA-48 and IMP were the predominant genes. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were the major producers of ESBL and carbapenemase, respectively as indicated by serodiagnosis. They were further assessed for the presence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and phylogenetic background. The most predominant DEC PAI and ExPEC PAI were HPI and IICFT073. Most clinically ESBL-producers were group D and B2 while environmentally ones were group B1 and A. On contrary, clinically carbapenemase-producers belonged to group C and D. In conclusion, our study confirms the importance of phylogenetic group D, B2, and C origin for antibiotic resistance in E. coli. Ultimately, our findings support the fact that environmental isolates contribute to the local spread of E. coli pathogenicity in Egypt and these isolates maybe serve as reservoirs for transmission of resistance."

The pathogenesis of hypertension involves alteration in vascular resistance caused by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and renin angiotensin system (RAS). Susceptibility factors of hypertension vary with regions and ethnicities. In this study, we conducted target capture sequencing on 54 genes related to SNS and RAS derived from a collection of Han nationality, consisting of 151 hypertension patients and 65 normal subjects in Xinjiang, China. Six non-synonymous mutations related to hypertension were identified, including GRK4 rs1644731 and RDH8 rs1801058, Mutations are predicted to affect 3D conformation, force field, transmembrane domain and RNA secondary structure of corresponding genes. Based on protein interaction network and pathway enrichment, GRK4 is predicted to participate in hypertension by acting on dopaminergic synapse, together with interacting components. RDH8 is involved in vitamin A (retinol) metabolism and consequent biological processes related to hypertension. Thus, GRK4 and RDH8 may serve as susceptibility genes for hypertension. This finding provides new genetic evidence for elucidating risk factors of hypertension in Han nationality in Xinjiang, which in turn, enriches genetic resource bank of hypertension susceptibility genes."

Therefore, this paper introduces enterprises into the process of ecological compensation. Firstly, suppose the ecological compensation system composed of government and enterprises, the government is in the dominant position. The ecological compensation input of the government and enterprise will produce social reputation, and the ecological compensation of enterprise will also produce advertising effect. Consumer demand will be affected by social reputation and advertising effect. Then, the compensation strategies of the government and enterprise are analyzed by constructing the differential game model. The research shows that under certain conditions, the cost-sharing mechanism can realize the Pareto improvement of the benefits of government, enterprise and the whole system. Under the cooperative mechanism, the benefit of the government, enterprise and the whole system is optimal. Finally, the validity of the conclusion is verified by case analysis, and the sensitivity analysis of the relevant parameters is carried out. The conclusion can provide reference for government to establish sustainable watershed ecological compensation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3184424949,"Radial migration during cortical development is required for formation of the six-layered structure of the mammalian cortex. Defective migration of neurons is linked to several developmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. A unique swollen structure called the dilation is formed in migrating neurons and is required for movement of the centrosome and nucleus. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which this dilation forms is unclear. We report that CAMDI, a gene whose deletion is associated with psychiatric behavior, is degraded by cell division cycle protein 20 (Cdc20)-anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) cell-cycle machinery after centrosome migration into the dilation in mouse brain development. We also show that CAMDI is restabilized in the dilation until the centrosome enters the dilation, at which point it is once again immediately destabilized. CAMDI degradation is carried out by binding to Cdc20-APC/C via the destruction box degron of CAMDI. CAMDI destruction box mutant overexpression inhibits dilation formation and neuronal cell migration via maintaining the stabilized state of CAMDI. These results indicate that CAMDI is a substrate of the Cdc20-APC/C system and that the oscillatory regulation of CAMDI protein correlates with dilation formation for proper cortical migration."

Diet has a significant impact on the risk to develop MetS and T2D; in this regard, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and protein rich foods (from plant and animals) are important to prevent and manage these pathologies. There are limited studies regarding the potential association between Andean foods rich in proteins and the presence of cardio-metabolic conditions in Ecuador. It is necessary to develop new low-cost, local-culturally acceptable strategies to reduce the burden of cardio-metabolic diseases. We describe the prevalence (baseline data) of MetS and T2D in the Ecuadorian cohort of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study and their potential association with the consumption of protein rich foods, including beef, white meat, dairy and legumes. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed 1,997 individuals aged 35-70 years (mean age 51 years, 72% women), included in the Ecuadorian cohort of the PURE study, from February to December 2018. The prevalence of MetS was 42% for male and 44% for female participants; the prevalence of T2D was 9% for male and 10% for female. Metabolic syndrome and T2D were more common in women older than 50 years of age with primary education or less, low economic income, and with obesity; MetS was more frequent in the rural area while T2D was more frequent in the urban area. Using logistic regression analysis, we observed a significant protective effect of higher consumption of dairy and legumes in the prevalence of MetS and T2D compared with low consumption. It will be important to develop policies for ample production and consumption of protein rich foods such as legumes and dairy, part of traditional diets, to reduce the burden of cardio-metabolic diseases."

The varied ability of BLIP to bind different β-lactamases and the structural determinants for significant enhancement of BLIP variants with a point mutation are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the conformational dynamics of BLIP upon binding to three clinically prevalent class A β-lactamases (TEM1, SHV1, and PC1) with dissociation constants between subnanomolar and micromolar. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that the flexibility of the interdomain region was significantly suppressed upon strong binding to TEM1, but was not significantly changed upon weak binding to SHV1 or PC1. E73M and K74G mutations in the interdomain region improved binding affinity toward SHV1 and PC1, respectively, showing significantly increased flexibility of the interdomain region compared to the wild-type and favorable conformational changes upon binding. In contrast, more rigidity of the interfacial loop 135-145 was observed in these BLIP mutants in both free and bound states. Consistently, molecular dynamics simulations of BLIP exhibited drastic changes in the flexibility of the loop 135-145 in all complexes. Our results indicated for the first time that higher flexibility of the interdomain linker, as well as more rigidity of the interfacial loop 135-145, could be desirable determinants for enhancing inhibition of BLIP to class A β-lactamases. Together, these findings provide unique insights into the design of enhanced inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3183468815,"Breast cancer poses a serious health risk for women throughout the world. Among the Asian population, Pakistani women have the highest risk of developing breast cancer. One out of nine women is diagnosed with breast cancer in Pakistan. The etiology and the risk factor leading to breast cancer are largely unknown. In the current study the risk factors that are most pertinent to the Pakistani population, the etiology, molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, and therapeutic targets of breast cancer are studied. A correlative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and questionnaire-based study was designed to predict the risk factors in breast cancer patients. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (90%) and grade-II tumor (73.2%) formation are more common in our patient's data set. Clinical parameters such as mean age of 47.5 years (SD ± 11.17), disturbed menstrual cycle (> 2), cousin marriages (repeated), and lactation period (< 0.5 Y) along with stress, dietary and environmental factors have an essential role in the development of breast cancer. In addition to this in silico analysis was performed to screen the miRNA regulating the TGF-beta pathway using TargetScanHuman, and correlation was depicted through Mindjet Manager. The information thus obtained was observed in breast cancer clinical samples both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and biopsy through quantitative real-time PCR. There was a significant dysregulation (**P>0.001) of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway and the miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-140, and miR-148a) in patients' biopsy in grade and stage specifically, correlated with expression in blood samples. miRNAs (miR-29a and miR-140, miR-148a) can be an effective diagnostic and prognostic marker as they regulate SMAD4 and SMAD2 expression respectively in breast cancer blood and biopsy samples. Therefore, proactive therapeutic strategies can be devised considering negatively regulated cascade genes and amalgamated miRNAs to control breast cancer better."
https://openalex.org/W3183835216,"Joint attention, or sharing attention with another individual about an object or event, is a critical behaviour that emerges in pre-linguistic infants and predicts later language abilities. Given its importance, it is perhaps surprising that there is no consensus on how to measure joint attention in prelinguistic infants. A rigorous definition proposed by Siposova & Carpenter (2019) requires the infant and partner to gaze alternate between an object and each other (coordination of attention) and exchange communicative signals (explicit acknowledgement of jointly sharing attention). However, Hobson and Hobson (2007) proposed that the quality of gaze between individuals is, in itself, a sufficient communicative signal that demonstrates sharing of attention. They proposed that observers can reliably distinguish ""sharing"", ""checking"", and ""orienting"" looks, but the empirical basis for this claim is limited as their study focussed on two raters examining looks from 11-year-old children. Here, we analysed categorisations made by 32 naïve raters of 60 infant looks to their mothers, to examine whether they could be reliably distinguished according to Hobson and Hobson's definitions. Raters had overall low agreement and only in 3 out of 26 cases did a significant majority of the raters agree with the judgement of the mother who had received the look. For the looks that raters did agree on at above chance levels, look duration and the overall communication rate of the mother were identified as cues that raters may have relied upon. In our experiment, naïve third party observers could not reliably determine the type of look infants gave to their mothers, which indicates that subjective judgements of types of look should not be used to identify mutual awareness of sharing attention in infants. Instead, we advocate the use of objective behaviour measurement to infer that interactants know they are 'jointly' attending to an object or event, and believe this will be a crucial step in understanding the ontogenetic and evolutionary origins of joint attention."
https://openalex.org/W3184296646,"We evaluated how carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and the echogenicity of the intima-media (IM-GSM), measured by ultrasound, were related to body composition, evaluated by both traditional imaging techniques, as well as with a new voxel-based ""Imiomics"" technique.In 321 subjects all aged 50 years in the POEM study, IMT and IM-GSM were measured together with a DXA scan for determination of fat and lean mass. Also a whole-body MRI scan was performed and the body volume was divided into >1 million voxels in a standardized fashion. IMT and IM-GSM were related to each of these voxels to create a 3D-view of how these measurements were related to size of each part of the body.IM-GSM was inversely related to almost all traditional measurements of body composition, like fat and lean mass, liver fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat, but this was not seen for IMT. Using Imiomics, IMT was positively related to the intraabdominal fat volume, as well of the leg skeletal muscle in women. In males, IMT was mainly positively related to the leg skeletal muscle volume. IM-GSM was inversely related to the volume of the SAT in the upper part of the body, leg skeletal muscle, the liver and intraabdominal fat in both men and women.The voxel-based Imiomics technique provided a detailed view of how the echogenicity of the carotid artery wall was related to body composition, being inversely related to the volume of the major fat depots, as well as leg skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3186302369,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A Streptococcus, is a Gram-positive bacterium that can be both a human commensal and a pathogen. Central to this dichotomy are temperate bacteriophages that incorporate into the bacterial genome as prophages. These genetic elements encode both the phage proteins and the toxins harmful to the human host. One such conserved phage protein, paratox (Prx), is always found encoded adjacent to the toxin genes, and this linkage is preserved during all stages of the phage life cycle. Within S. pyogenes, Prx functions to inhibit the quorum-sensing receptor-signal pair ComRS, the master regulator of natural competence, or the ability to uptake endogenous DNA. However, the mechanism by which Prx directly binds and inhibits the receptor ComR is unknown. To understand how Prx inhibits ComR at the molecular level, we pursued an X-ray crystal structure of Prx bound to ComR. The structural data supported by solution X-ray scattering data demonstrate that Prx induces a conformational change in ComR to directly access its DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, electromobility shift assays and competition binding assays reveal that Prx effectively uncouples the interdomain conformational change required for activation of ComR via the signaling molecule XIP. Although to our knowledge the molecular mechanism of quorum-sensing inhibition by Prx is unique, it is analogous to the mechanism employed by the phage protein Aqs1 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Together, this demonstrates an example of convergent evolution between Gram-positive and Gram-negative phages to inhibit quorum-sensing and highlights the versatility of small phage proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3183371110,"Hemodynamic monitoring and cardiac output (CO) assessment in the ICU have been trending toward less invasive methods. Carotid blood flow (CBF) was suggested as a candidate for CO assessment. The present study aimed to test the value of carotid artery ultrasound analysis in prediction of mortality in pediatric patients with septic shock.Forty children with septic shock were included in the study. Upon admission, patients were subjected to careful history taking and thorough clinical examination. The consciousness level was assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Laboratory assessment included complete blood count, C-reactive protein, arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and liver and kidney function tests. Electrical cardiometry was used to evaluate hemodynamic parameters. Patients were also subjected to transthoracic 2-D echocardiography. CBF was evaluated using GE Vivid S5 ultrasound device through dedicated software. At the end of study, 14 patients (35.0%) died. It was found that survivors had significantly higher CBF when compared non-survivors [median (IQR): 166.0 (150.0-187.3) versus 141.0 (112.8-174.3), p = 0.033]. In addition, it was noted that survivors had longer ICU stay when compared with non-survivors [16.5 (9.8-31.5) versus 6.5 (3.0-19.5) days, p = 0.005]. ROC curve analysis showed that CBF could significantly distinguish survivors from non-survivors [AUC (95% CI): 0.3 (0.11-0.48), p = 0.035] (Fig 2). Univariate logistic regression analysis identified type of shock [OR (95% CI): 28.1 (4.9-162.4), p<0.001], CI [OR (95% CI): 0.6 (0.43-0.84), p = 0.003] and CBF [OR (95% CI): 0.98 (0.96-0.99), p = 0.031]. However, in multivariate analysis, only type of shock significantly predicted mortality.CBF assessment may be a useful prognostic marker in children with septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W3184810712,"Maternal and infant morbidities associated with pregnant women with cardiac conditions are a global issue contingent upon appropriate care. This study aimed to describe the clinical variables and their association with the adherence scores to perinatal guidelines for pregnant women with cardiac conditions. The clinical variables included cardiac, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes and complications.Using a retrospective cross-sectional medical record audit, data were abstracted and categorised as cardiac, obstetric, and neonatal predictors. Linear regression modelling was used to find the mean difference (MD) in adherence scores for each predictor, including a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a significance value for all the three categories' clinical outcomes.This maternal cohort's (n = 261) cardiac complications were primarily arrhythmias requiring treatment (29.9%), particularly SVT (28%), a new diagnosis of valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease (24%) and decompensated heart failure (HF) (16%). Women with HF had associated increased adherence scores (MD = 3.546, 95% CI: 1.689, 5.403) compared to those without HF. Elective LSCS mode of delivery was associated with a higher adherence score (MD = 5.197, 95% CI: 3.584, 6.811) than non-elective LSCS subgroups. Babies admitted to intensive /special care had greater adherence to the guidelines (MD = 3.581, 95% CI: 1.822, 5.340) than those not requiring the same care.Some pregnancy associated complications and morbidities were associated with higher adherence scores, reflecting that a diagnosis, identification of morbidities or risk factors, initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary involvement and adherence to guidelines were associated. Conversely, potentially avoidable major complications such as sepsis were associated with a low adherence score.ACTRN12617000417381."
https://openalex.org/W3184823771,"The objectives of this study were to identify the associated factors with cancerous and precancerous lesions of cervix. In Africa, the incidence of uterine cervical neoplasms varies from one region to another, where most women with uterine cervical neoplasms are seen at an advanced stage. For this reason, uterine cervical neoplasms mass screening reduces the incidence and mortality due to this disease, similar to what is being done in Europe. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted. Socio-demographic characteristics, gynaecological-obstetrical history, risk factors, data from visual inspection with acetic acid and visual inspection with Lugol, colposcopy impressions and results of cytological analysis were performed. A simple and multiple regression were performed to establish a statistically significant difference between certain factors and the presence of precancerous or cancerous lesions of uterine cervical. In this study, of 63 women diagnosed histologically, 43 had precancerous lesions and 20 had cancerous lesions. we found that being older than 35, having the first intercourse before 18, having an antecedent of STI, being a widow and using of tobacco were risk factors associated with precancerous lesions (p = 0.013 with OR = 3.44 (1.22-9.73), p = 0.009 with OR = 4.07 (1.69-13.08), p < 0.001 with OR = 3.80 (1.94-7.47), p < 0.001 with OR = 9.77 (3.87-24.70) and p < 0.001 with OR = 5.47 (2.60-11.52)) respectively. Only being older than 45, being a widow and using tobacco were risk factors associated with cancerous lesions (p = 0.021 with OR = 2.01 (1.58-3.56), p = 0.02 with OR = 2.96 (2.10-3.87), p = 0.041 with OR = 1.98 (1.46-2.44)) respectively. Among participants diagnosed with uterine cervical neoplasms, there was a significant association with the STI, marital status and smoking. Despite the integration of the detection of precancerous uterine cervical neoplasms lesions into health facilities in Gabon, uterine cervical neoplasms ranks second among women's cancers in terms of incidence and first in terms of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3185676450,"This study aims to describe the prevalence of depression and anxiety among a population sample of people at high risk for type 2 diabetes in Kerala, India, and examine the relationship between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) over a two-year period. We used data from the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program, a cluster-randomized controlled trial for diabetes prevention among 1007 high-risk individuals. The prevalence of depression and anxiety were estimated using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, respectively. We calculated proportions for depression and anxiety and performed generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the relationship between baseline mental health status and incident T2DM. The prevalence of depression and anxiety at baseline were 7.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Compared with those reporting none/low symptoms, the odds ratio for incident diabetes was 1.07 (95% CI 0.54–2.12) for participants with moderate to severe depression and 0.73 (95% CI 0.23–2.28) for participants with moderate to severe anxiety, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of depression and anxiety were higher than those previously reported in the general population in India. However, among this sample of community-based adults at high risk of developing T2DM, the presence of moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms was not significantly associated with the risk of developing T2DM.

https://openalex.org/W3186149518,"The alterations in neural activity related to the improvement of cognitive performance, which would be leading to better academic performance, remain poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed neural activity related to the improvement of task performance resulting from academic rewards. Twenty healthy male volunteers participated in this study. All participants performed four sessions of a 1-back-Stroop task under both target and control conditions. An image indicating that the task performance of each participant was above average and categorized as being at almost the highest level was presented immediately after each session under the target condition, whereas a control image did not indicate task performance. Neural activity during the 1-back-Stroop task was recorded by magnetoencephalography. The correction rate of the 1-back-Stroop task in the final session relative to that in the first under the target condition was increased compared with the control condition. Correlation analysis revealed that the decreases in alpha band power in right Brodmann's area (BA) 47 and left BA 7 were positively associated with the increased correction rate caused by the target condition. These findings are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the improvement of cognitive performance."
