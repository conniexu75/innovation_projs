https://openalex.org/W2419165202,"Oligodendrocytes make myelin and support axons metabolically with lactate. However, it is unknown how glucose utilization and glycolysis are adapted to the different axonal energy demands. Spiking axons release glutamate and oligodendrocytes express NMDA receptors of unknown function. Here we show that the stimulation of oligodendroglial NMDA receptors mobilizes glucose transporter GLUT1, leading to its incorporation into the myelin compartment in vivo. When myelinated optic nerves from conditional NMDA receptor mutants are challenged with transient oxygen-glucose deprivation, they show a reduced functional recovery when returned to oxygen-glucose but are indistinguishable from wild-type when provided with oxygen-lactate. Moreover, the functional integrity of isolated optic nerves, which are electrically silent, is extended by preincubation with NMDA, mimicking axonal activity, and shortened by NMDA receptor blockers. This reveals a novel aspect of neuronal energy metabolism in which activity-dependent glutamate release enhances oligodendroglial glucose uptake and glycolytic support of fast spiking axons."

However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation have not been elucidated. In blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC CML), we show that increased JAK2 signaling and BCR-ABL1 amplification activate ADAR1. In a humanized BC CML mouse model, combined JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition prevents LSC self-renewal commensurate with ADAR1 downregulation. Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-type, but not an editing-defective ADAR1(E912A) mutant, induces self-renewal gene expression and impairs biogenesis of stem cell regulatory let-7 microRNAs. Combined RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, CLIP-ADAR1, and pri-let-7 mutagenesis data suggest that ADAR1 promotes LSC generation via let-7 pri-microRNA editing and LIN28B upregulation. A small-molecule tool compound antagonizes ADAR1's effect on LSC self-renewal in stromal co-cultures and restores let-7 biogenesis. Thus, ADAR1 activation represents a unique therapeutic vulnerability in LSCs with active JAK2 signaling."

We demonstrate the existence of male mating drive in Drosophila, which is transiently and cumulatively reduced as reproductive capacity is depleted by copulations. Dopaminergic activity in the anterior of the superior medial protocerebrum (SMPa) is also transiently and cumulatively reduced in response to matings and serves as a functional neuronal correlate of mating drive. The dopamine signal is transmitted through the D1-like DopR2 receptor to P1 neurons, which also integrate sensory information relevant to the perception of females, and which project to courtship motor centers that initiate and maintain courtship behavior. Mating drive therefore converges with sensory information from the female at the point of transition to motor output, controlling the propensity of a sensory percept to trigger goal-directed behavior.

Mating drive therefore converges with sensory information from the female at the point of transition to motor output, controlling the propensity of a sensory percept to trigger goal-directed behavior. Most of our behaviors are flexible. Rather than being stereotyped responses to a given stimulus, our actions are contingent on internal states and external conditions. We eat primarily when we are hungry and can acquire quality food—not whenever we see food, and not regardless of quality. Even when hungry, we will not eat quality food if doing so exposes us to danger—unless we are hungry enough to accept the risk. Given the variety of potential inputs into these types of decisions, hardwired solutions for all possible situations are impractical, if not impossible. Instead, the nervous system creates drive states such as hunger to bias choices so that they reflect internal needs and capacities. These states determine how readily sensory stimuli trigger goal-directed motor output. In this work, we investigate where and how this regulation occurs in a novel, reductionist system. Male mating behavior in Drosophila has been studied for over a hundred years (Sturtevant, 1915Sturtevant A.H. Experiments on sex recognition and the problems of sexual selection in Drosophila.J. Anim. Behav. 1915; 5: 351-366Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), but the last decade has seen a dramatic increase in our knowledge of the underlying neural circuitry. Much of this progress has followed from gaining genetic access to neurons expressing the sexually dimorphic transcription factor Fruitless (Ito et al., 1996Ito H. Fujitani K. Usui K.

Here we adapt this system to ask where and how sensory-motor transformations are gated by internal state. We show that male sexual behaviors are transiently and cumulatively reduced as reproductive fluid stores are depleted by repeated matings. The activity of dopaminergic neurons that project to the anterior superior medial protocerebrum (SMPa) reflects the male’s recent mating history and is used to instruct mating drive. The dopamine signal is sensed and interpreted by a group of ∼40 Fruitless neurons called P1 (Kimura et al., 2008Kimura K. Hachiya T. Koganezawa M. Tazawa T. Yamamoto D.

Dopaminergic internal state input therefore gates courtship initiation through a numerically compact neuronal node that lies at the transition between sensory input and motor output. The coincidence of sensory and internal state information activates P1, driving levels of mating behavior that reflect the quality of the female percept and the reproductive capacity of the male. At P1, then, analog information about two fundamental and necessary conditions for behavioral selection (appropriate external object and internal state) converges to determine the propensity for a binary output: whether or not to court. This system may provide deep insight into the generation of motivational states and their impact on sensory-motor circuitry. To look for evidence of reproductive satiety in Drosophila, single males that had been isolated from females for 3–6 days were placed in food vials containing ∼25 virgin females and examined for mating behaviors (courtship or copulation) every 30 min. Initially, males spent ∼80% of their time engaged in mating behaviors (courtship and copulation), but the percentage gradually declined to ∼10% over 4 hr (Figures 1A and S1A, available online). During the assay, males mated an average of 3.3 ± 0.3 times with an average copulation duration of 24.6 ± 0.4 min that did not change with repeated matings. We use the term satiety to reflect the gradually diminishing propensity to engage in mating behaviors as the assay progresses. To quantify this change, we calculate a satiety index: the fraction by which mating behavior is reduced in the last 60 min relative to the first 60 min of the assay, which is 0.82 ± 0.02 for wild-type flies (Figures 1A and 1B; see Experimental Procedures). Robust reproductive satiety is seen at the level of both courtship (satiety index 0.96 ± 0.02; Figure 1C) and copulation (satiety index 0.82 ± 0.03; Figure 1D). Unlike other aspects of male mating behavior, satiety is not affected by the male’s prior social experience with other males (Dankert et al., 2009Dankert H. Wang L. Hoopfer E.D. Anderson D.J.

Satiety is not the result of habituation to the presence of females, but requires copulation. Preventing copulation through the use of low-receptivity females (Nakayama et al., 1997Nakayama S. Kaiser K. Aigaki T. Ectopic expression of sex-peptide in a variety of tissues in Drosophila females using the P[GAL4] enhancer-trap system.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or males that have physical defects in external genitalia (Castrillon et al., 1993Castrillon D.H. Gönczy P. Alexander S. Rawson R. Eberhart C.G. Viswanathan S. DiNardo S. Wasserman S.A. Toward a molecular genetic analysis of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: characterization of male-sterile mutants generated by single P element mutagenesis.Genetics. 1993; 135: 489-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in high levels of courtship that were maintained throughout the satiety assay (Figures 1E and S1D). The reduction in mating behavior seen at the end of the assay was not altered by placing the satiated male with fresh virgin females (Figure 1F), but gradually recovered over the course of 3–4 days if the male was removed from females (Figure 1F). The reduction in mating drive in satiated males was also seen in standard courtship assays (one male and one female in a 15 min assay, used throughout this study when assaying for hyposexuality; see Experimental Procedures) (Figures 1G and 1H). When satiated males did court, they spent a comparable proportion of courtship time performing unilateral wing vibration (“singing”), but their courtship was often transient (Figures 1G and 1I). Satiety is unlikely to be a consequence of physical exhaustion, because locomotor activity was not changed by completion of the satiety assay (Figure 1J). We conclude that, similar to mammals (Beach and Jordan, 1956Beach F.A. Jordan L. Sexual exhaustion and recovery in the male rat.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 1956; 8: 121-133Crossref Google Scholar), male Drosophila exhibit a transient reproductive satiety induced by mating, a hallmark of sexual motivation. Reproductive satiety parallels the male’s diminishing reproductive capacity after repeated matings. This reduced potency is evident in males that have recently completed the satiety assay, as their subsequent copulations result in few, if any, progeny (Figure 1K) (also see Crickmore and Vosshall, 2013Crickmore M.A. Vosshall L.B.

Wigby S. Chapman T. Ejaculate depletion patterns evolve in response to experimental manipulation of sex ratio in Drosophila melanogaster.Evolution. 2007; 61: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A physical basis of this diminishing fertility is found in the male’s ejaculatory bulb, which houses mature sperm and seminal fluid (Demerec, 1950Demerec M. Biology of Drosophila. Wiley, 1950Google Scholar). The volume of the bulb gradually decreases over the course of repeated matings, with kinetics redolent of the decline in mating behaviors (Figure 1L). By the end of the satiety assay, reproductive fluids are largely depleted and the lumen of the bulb has shrunken substantially, a presumptive cause of the impaired fertility of males in a state of reproductive satiety. The fullness of the bulb recovers after the satiety assay, though only to ∼75% after 3 days away from females (Figure 1M). Since mating drive roughly tracks ejaculatory bulb volume, we asked if information about the volume of the bulb is used to gate the execution of sexual behaviors. To allow copulation but prevent depletion of reproductive fluids from the bulb, we performed a modified satiety assay wherein copulations were artificially terminated 5 min after initiation—before reproductive fluids are transferred (Crickmore and Vosshall, 2013Crickmore M.A. Vosshall L.B.

USA. 2012; 109: 20697-20702Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected, the ejaculatory bulb remains full throughout this modified assay (Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, though, we find that truncated copulations trigger satiety to the same degree as normal copulations: the number of matings per male in the assay remained unchanged when copulations were disrupted at 5 min (Figure 2B), despite the cumulative time spent in copulation being dramatically reduced (Figure 2C). Normal satiety in males with truncated copulations is also seen in a courtship assay (Figure 2D). We then examined the consequences of artificially emptying the ejaculatory bulb without allowing the male to copulate. Thermogenetic activation of corazonin (crz) neurons causes repeated ejaculation, even in the absence of copulation (Tayler et al., 2012Tayler T.D. Pacheco D.A. Hergarden A.C. Murthy M. Anderson D.J. A neuropeptide circuit that coordinates sperm transfer and copulation duration in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 20697-20702Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ejaculatory bulbs of males in which the warmth-sensitive cation channel TrpA1 (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) was targeted to crz neurons (crz > TrpA1) were depleted after incubation at 30°C for 3 days, but this treatment had no effect on courtship behavior (Figure 2E). Moreover, recovery of mating drive after the satiety assay was unimpeded by artificially maintaining the empty status of the ejaculatory bulb (Figure 2E). The finding that ejaculatory bulb fullness is entirely dissociable from courtship vigor is consistent with the delayed recovery kinetics of bulb fullness compared to mating drive (Figure 1M). Together, these results argue against a direct role of sperm and seminal fluid accumulation or depletion in instructing mating drive. To ask whether reproductive organs have any role in the acute determination of mating drive, we surgically removed the posterior abdomen, which contains the internal and external reproductive organs. This surgery had no major detrimental effect on courtship in naive males, and did not stimulate courtship in satiated males (Figure 2F; Movie S1). These results show that though mating drive is calibrated to reflect reproductive capacity, the reproductive organs themselves have no acute influence on the male’s response to the presentation of a virgin female. Though sensory information from the genitalia may signal the onset of copulation, the resulting adjustments to and maintenance of mating drive are carried out within the CNS. To identify the genes and neurons that control mating drive in male Drosophila, we examined over 1,500 genetic manipulations (see Experimental Procedures) in the satiety assay in search of animals that maintained high levels of mating behaviors after repeated copulations. The only hit obtained in this screen resulted from thermogenetic activation of dopaminergic neurons. When dopaminergic neurons were stimulated at the end of the satiety assay using tyrosine hydroxylase-Gal4 (TH > TrpA1; TH is an enzyme required for dopamine synthesis), satiated males showed a dramatic rebound in mating behaviors (Figure 3A). The rebound is seen in both copulation (58% decrease in satiety) and courtship (84% decrease in satiety) (Figures S2A and S2B). This finding parallels previous work showing that dopaminergic neurons of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) promote the male’s motivation to sustain individual copulation bouts (Crickmore and Vosshall, 2013Crickmore M.A. Vosshall L.B. Opposing dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons control the duration and persistence of copulation in Drosophila.Cell. 2013; 155: 881-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In that study, dopaminergic function was localized to the VNC due to the ability of TshGal80 (which inhibits the activity of Gal4 in most VNC neurons) to block Gal4-mediated phenotypes. In contrast, TshGal80 has no effect on the reversal of satiety seen in TH > TrpA1 males (Figures 3A, S2A, and S2B). Together, these findings reveal two functionally and anatomically distinct roles for dopamine in promoting mating drive in flies. The initial drive to mate is set by dopamine neurons of the brain, and once copulation is initiated, dopaminergic neurons of the VNC determine the persistence and duration of the mating. To identify which brain dopaminergic neurons underlie mating drive, we thermogenetically activated four subsets of dopaminergic neurons using Gal4 lines derived from enhancer elements of the pale locus, which encodes TH (Liu et al., 2012Liu Q. Liu S. Kodama L. Driscoll M.R. Wu M.N. Two dopaminergic neurons signal to the dorsal fan-shaped body to promote wakefulness in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 2114-2123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Stimulation of either of two subsets of TH neurons (TH-C’ and TH-D’; Figures 3B and 3C) resulted in partial recovery from satiety. This reversal of satiety is not a secondary effect of increased locomotion, as stimulating either population does not significantly impact basal activity (Figure S3A). The activity of neurons within these populations is necessary for mating drive, as adult-specific silencing of TH-C’ or TH-D’ neurons with the potassium channel Kir2.1 decreased courtship (Figure 3D). Dopamine itself is likely the mating drive signal, as lowering TH production in TH-C’ or TH-D’ neurons with pale-RNAi dramatically reduced courtship (Figure S4). To ask whether the mating drive dopaminergic neurons lie within the Fruitless circuitry, we introduced a Gal80 transgene whose expression pattern is indirectly controlled by the cis-regulatory elements of fruitless (see Figure 3B legend). Thermogenetic stimulation in these flies (TH-C’ > TrpA1;FruGal80 and TH-D’ > TrpA1;FruGal80) fails to reverse satiety (Figure 3B), arguing that mating drive dopamine neurons are Fruitless positive. In both TH-C’ and TH-D’, FruGal80 blocked Gal4 activity in a single neuron per brain hemisphere, and in both cases this neuron was located in the PAL dopaminergic cluster (Mao and Davis, 2009Mao Z. Davis R.L. Eight different types of dopaminergic neurons innervate the Drosophila mushroom body neuropil: anatomical and physiological heterogeneity.Front. Neural Circuits. 2009; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Figures 3E and S5). In adults, no TH-C’ or TH-D’ neurons stain with Fruitless antibodies (data not shown), but in both populations, an FLP recombinase transgene inserted into the fruitless locus (FruFLP) identifies single dopaminergic neurons belonging to the PAL dopaminergic cluster (Figure 3F) (Keleman et al., 2012Keleman K.

https://openalex.org/W2432855159,"The availability of bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitors (BETi) has enabled translational epigenetic studies in cancer. BET proteins regulate transcription by selectively recognizing acetylated lysine residues on chromatin. BETi compete with this process leading to both downregulation and upregulation of gene expression. Hypoxia enables progression of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of breast cancer, partly by driving metabolic adaptation, angiogenesis and metastasis through upregulation of hypoxia-regulated genes (for example, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Responses to hypoxia can be mediated epigenetically, thus we investigated whether BETi JQ1 could impair the TNBC response induced by hypoxia and exert anti-tumour effects. JQ1 significantly modulated 44% of hypoxia-induced genes, of which two-thirds were downregulated including CA9 and VEGF-A. JQ1 prevented HIF binding to the hypoxia response element in CA9 promoter, but did not alter HIF expression or activity, suggesting some HIF targets are BET-dependent. JQ1 reduced TNBC growth in vitro and in vivo and inhibited xenograft vascularization. These findings identify that BETi dually targets angiogenesis and the hypoxic response, an effective combination at reducing tumour growth in preclinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2435180223,"Although activation of the STAT3 pathway has been associated with tumor progression in a wide variety of cancer types (including ovarian cancer), the precise mechanism of invasion and metastasis due to STAT3 are not fully delineated in ovarian cancer. We found that pSTAT3 Tyr705 is constitutively activated in patient ascites and ascites-derived ovarian cancer cells (ADOCCs), and the range of STAT3 expression could be very high to low. In vivo transplantation of ADOCCs with high pSTAT3 expression into the ovarian bursa of mice resulted in a large primary tumor and widespread peritoneal metastases. In contrast, ADOCCs with low STAT3 expression or ADOCCs with STAT3 expression knockdown, led to reduced tumor growth and an absence of metastases in vivo. Cytokines derived from the ADOCC culture medium activate the interleukin (IL)-6/STAT pathway in the STAT3 knockout (KO) cells, compensating for the absence of inherent STAT3 in the cells. Treatment with HO-3867 (a novel STAT3 inhibitor at 100 p.p.m. in an orthotopic murine model) significantly suppressed ovarian tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by targeting STAT3 and its downstream proteins. HO-3867 was found to have cytotoxic effects in ex vivo cultures of freshly collected human ovarian cancers, including those resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. Our results show that STAT3 is necessary for ovarian tumor progression/metastasis and highlight the potential for targeting STAT3 by HO-3867 as a therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2418204433,"Dopamine neurons signal reward prediction errors. This requires accurate reward predictions. It has been suggested that the ventral striatum provides these predictions. Here we tested this hypothesis by recording from putative dopamine neurons in the VTA of rats performing a task in which prediction errors were induced by shifting reward timing or number. In controls, the neurons exhibited error signals in response to both manipulations. However, dopamine neurons in rats with ipsilateral ventral striatal lesions exhibited errors only to changes in number and failed to respond to changes in timing of reward. These results, supported by computational modeling, indicate that predictions about the temporal specificity and the number of expected reward are dissociable and that dopaminergic prediction-error signals rely on the ventral striatum for the former but not the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2419567272,"The intestinal stem cell niche provides cues that actively maintain gut homeostasis. Dysregulation of these cues may compromise intestinal regeneration upon tissue insult and/or promote tumor growth. Here, we identify secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) as stem cell niche factors with context-dependent functions in the digestive tract. We show that group IIA sPLA2, a known genetic modifier of mouse intestinal tumorigenesis, is expressed by Paneth cells in the small intestine, while group X sPLA2 is expressed by Paneth/goblet-like cells in the colon. During homeostasis, group IIA/X sPLA2s inhibit Wnt signaling through intracellular activation of Yap1. However, upon inflammation they are secreted into the intestinal lumen, where they promote prostaglandin synthesis and Wnt signaling. Genetic ablation of both sPLA2s improves recovery from inflammation but increases colon cancer susceptibility due to release of their homeostatic Wnt-inhibitory role. This “trade-off” effect suggests sPLA2s have important functions as genetic modifiers of inflammation and colon cancer."

Glycosylation remodeling using the endoglycosidase-catalyzed deglycosylation and transglycosylation approach is emerging as a promising platform to produce homogeneous glycoforms of antibodies, but the broad application of this method will require the availability of highly efficient glycosynthase mutants. We describe in this paper a systematic site-directed mutagenesis of an endoglycosidase from Streptococcus pyogenes of serotype M49 (Endo-S2) and the evaluation of the resulting mutants for their hydrolysis and transglycosylation activities. We found that mutations at the Asp-184 residue gave mutants that demonstrated significantly different properties, some possessed potent transglycosylation activity with diminished hydrolysis activity but others did not, which would be otherwise difficult to predict without the comparative study. In contrast to the previously reported Endo-S mutants that are limited to action on complex type N-glycans, the Endo-S2 glycosynthases described here, including D184M and D184Q, were found to have remarkably relaxed substrate specificity and were capable of transferring three major types (complex, high-mannose, and hybrid type) of N-glycans for antibody glycosylation remodeling.

However, natural and recombinant antibodies are usually produced as heterogeneous glycoforms that are difficult to separate for further probing the structure-activity relationships of antibodies. Moreover, for a majority of anti-cancer mAbs on the market that rely on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity as a major mechanism of the therapeutic efficacy, the most active non-fucosylated glycoforms are usually present as minor fractions among the heterogeneous mixtures (8.Niwa R.

In this approach, the heterogeneous Fc glycans of a monoclonal antibody such as rituximab are removed by Endo-S-catalyzed deglycosylation to yield the antibody protein backbone carrying only the α1,6-fucosylated GlcNAc acceptor at the glycosylation site, then a desired N-glycan is transferred to the GlcNAc acceptor by an Endo-S glycosynthase mutant (EndoS-D233A or D233Q) in a site- and stereo-specific manner to reconstitute a homogeneous glycoform of the antibody.

Although the Endo-S glycosynthases were able to transfer biantennary complex type and modified Man3GlcNAc core, these mutants showed only marginal activity in transferring high-mannose type N-glycans. More recently, we have generated glycosynthase mutants from Endo-F3, another GH18 family endoglycosidase (32.Giddens J.P. Lomino J.V. Amin M.N.

It was found that the Endo-F3 glycosynthases, such as the D165A mutant, was able to transfer triantennary N-glycan to Fc domain of intact antibody, but they required α1,6-fucosylated GlcNAc moiety as the acceptor for transglycosylation and were unable to transfer to non-fucosylated GlcNAc acceptors. These studies have demonstrated that the glycosynthases so far available still have limitations due to substrate specificity and also vary in transglycosylation efficiency. As an effort to expand the scope of the glycosylation remodeling strategy, we turned our attention to Endo-S2, an endoglycosidase from S. pyogenes of serotype M49 (33.Sjögren J. Struwe W.B.

Endo-S2 shows only 37% sequence identity to Endo-S from the same bacteria and demonstrates a broader glycan substrate specificity in Fc deglycosylation than Endo-S (34.Sjögren J. Cosgrave E.F.

However, it was not clear if Endo-S2 had potential transglycosylation activity. If yes, it was yet to evaluate whether efficient glycosynthases could be generated from Endo-S2 and whether they would potentially have broader substrate specificity in transglycosylation than those previously reported. In this paper, we describe a systematic mutagenesis at Asp-184 that was identified as a critical residue for hydrolysis by sequence alignment, and the evaluation of the 19 mutants for transglycosylation activities and for their feasibility in antibody glycosylation remodeling. We found that Endo-S2 did possess potent transglycosylation activity, and the systematic site-directed mutagenesis led to the discovery of several glycosynthase mutants, including D184M and D184Q, that showed remarkable transglycosylation activity without apparent product hydrolysis activity. Moreover, we found that the Endo-S2 glycosynthases demonstrated remarkably relaxed substrate specificity, being capable of transferring three major types (complex, high-mannose, and hybrid type) of N-glycans for antibody glycosylation remodeling. In a comparative study, we also found that the Endo-S2 glycosynthase mutants were much more active in general than the Endo-S mutants for transglycosylation.

Sequence alignment of Endo-S2 and Endo-S revealed that the Asp-184 of Endo-S2 was the residue equivalent to Asp-233 of Endo-S essential for promoting oxazolinium ion formation in hydrolysis (Fig. 1). To generate efficient glycosynthase mutants from Endo-S2, we systematically replaced the Asp-184 with other 19 natural amino acid residues using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting 19 Asp-184 mutants were also expressed as soluble proteins in the pET22b-CPD vector and purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, in the same way as demonstrated for the wild type enzyme. The expression of the mutant enzymes gave comparable yields (15–20 mg/liters) as the expression of the wild type enzyme. The hydrolysis activities on Fc N-glycans in an intact antibody and the transglycosylation activities with glycan oxazoline were assessed following the scheme as shown in Fig. 2. The results indicate that most of the mutants at the Asp-184 residue led to significantly reduced or completely diminished hydrolysis activity on Fc N-glycan. Among them, D184F, D184H, D184K, D184R, and D184W mutants were completely devoid of hydrolytic activity, whereas several other mutants, including D184C, D184E, D184G, D184N, D184S, D184Y, were found to still retain significant hydrolysis activity (Table 1). On the other hand, the evaluation of transglycosylation indicated that almost all the mutants possessed transglycosylation activity when using the deglycosylated rituximab as the acceptor and a biantennary complex type glycan oxazoline as the donor substrate, but the activities varied significantly among different mutants (Fig. 2, Table 2). Among others, D184C, D184M, D184G, D184E, D184Y, D184S, and D184A were found to be the most active mutants. However, D184C, D184G, D184E, D184Y, D184S, and D184A also demonstrated significant residual hydrolytic activity. The most interesting mutant is D184M, which retained only marginal hydrolytic activity but showed extraordinarily high transglycosylation activity (only second to D184C), making it one of the best glycosynthase mutants to choose for glycosylation remodeling.TABLE 1Comparison of the specific hydrolysis activities of the Endo-S2 Asp-184 mutants using a synthetic complex glycoform of rituximab as the substrateMutantSpecific hydrolysis activity (×100)Percentage of specific hydrolysis activityμmol/min/mg%WT11.185100.000D184A0.7506.701D184C1.38612.392D184E0.8797.855D184F0.0000.000D184G1.24911.168D184H0.0000.000D184K0.0000.000D184R0.0000.000D184I0.0330.295D184L0.0450.405D184M0.1581.410D184N0.8427.526D184P0.3403.043D184Q0.0490.441D184S1.38712.398D184T0.2121.899D184V0.4093.659D184W0.0000.000D184Y5.52649.406 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Comparison of the specific transglycosylation activity of Endo-S2 Asp-184 mutants using sialoglycan oxazoline as donor substrate and deglycosylated rituximab as the acceptor substrateMutantsSpecific transglycosylation activity (×10)Percentage of specific transglycosylation activityμmol/min/mg%WT1.71244.31D184A1.02326.46D184C3.864100.00D184E2.00651.907D184F0.0441.14D184G2.27058.73D184H0.0260.68D184K0.0210.54D184R0.0220.57D184I0.0661.71D184L0.0992.55D184M2.86674.18D184N0.87922.75D184P0.1604.13D184Q0.3839.92D184S1.16430.13D184T0.82821.42D184V0.1473.79D184W0.0461.20D184Y1.19830.99 Open table in a new tab Rituximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody, was used as a model to examine the transglycosylation activity of the Endo-S2 Asp-184 mutants. The major Fc glycans of commercial rituximab are core-fucosylated biantennary complex type oligosaccharides carrying 0–2 galactose moieties named G0F, G1F, and G2F glycoforms, respectively. The general glycosylation remodeling approach was presented in Fig. 3 and the reaction products were assessed by LC-MS analysis (Fig. 4). Treatment of rituximab (1) with wild type Endo-S2 resulted in complete deglycosylation of rituximab, as demonstrated by the conversion of the glycoform mixtures (G0F, G1F, and G2F) found in commercial rituximab (Fig. 4A) to the Fucα1,6GlcNAc-glycoform (2) of rituximab (Fig. 4B). The Fucα1,6GlcNAc-rituximab (2) was purified away from the WT endoglycosidase and released glycans by Protein A affinity chromatography and used as the acceptor in the transglycosylation reactions. We found that Endo-S2 D184M was able to efficiently transfer the sialylated biantennary complex type (SCT) N-glycan from the corresponding glycan oxazoline (4) to the Fucα1,6GlcNAc-rituximab acceptor (2) to form the S2G2F glycoform of rituximab (3). The reaction could be readily pushed to completion with 20 molar eq (i.e. 10 molar eq per monomeric Fc domain) of the glycan oxazoline. The reaction yield was estimated by LC-MS analysis to be over 95% as almost no starting material was detected, which confirmed the completion of the transglycosylation. LC-MS analysis of the transglycosylation products (3) carrying the SCT N-glycan revealed that the heavy chain of 3 appeared as a single species at 51,412 (deconvolution data), which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass (M = 51,421 Da) for the heavy chain carrying a SCT N-glycan (with core-fucose), respectively (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4.ESI-MS analysis of the glycosylation remodeling of rituximab using Endo-S2 D184M.

https://openalex.org/W2415913163,"The Akt/adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has emerged as a critical signaling nexus for regulating cellular metabolism, energy homeostasis, and cell growth. Thus, dysregulation of this pathway contributes to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2diabetes, and cancer. We previously reported that a combination of grape polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin and catechin: RQC), at equimolar concentrations, reduces breast cancer (BC) growth and metastasis in nude mice, and inhibits Akt and mTOR activities and activates AMPK, an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, in metastatic BC cells. The objective of the present study was to determine the contribution of individual polyphenols to the effect of combined RQC on mTOR signaling. Metastatic BC cells were treated with RQC individually or in combination, at various concentrations, and the activities (phosphorylation) of AMPK, Akt, and the mTOR downstream effectors, p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and 4E binding protein (4EBP1), were determined by Western blot. Results show that quercetin was the most effective compound for Akt/mTOR inhibition. Treatment with quercetin at 15μM had a similar effect as the RQC combination in the inhibition of BC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. However, cell cycle analysis showed that the RQC treatment arrested BC cells in the G1 phase, while quercetin arrested the cell cycle in G2/M. In vivo experiments, using SCID mice with implanted tumors from metastatic BC cells, demonstrated that administration of quercetin at 15mg/kg body weight resulted in a ~70% reduction in tumor growth. In conclusion, quercetin appears to be a viable grape polyphenol for future development as an anti BC therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2410239982,"Human BRCA1 mutation carriers and BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary glands contain an abnormal population of mammary luminal progenitors that can form 3D colonies in a hormone-independent manner. The intrinsic cellular regulatory defect in these presumptive breast cancer precursors is not known. We have discovered that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) (p52/RelB) is persistently activated in a subset of BRCA1-deficient mammary luminal progenitors. Hormone-independent luminal progenitor colony formation required NF-κB, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), and the inhibitor of kappaB kinase, IKKα. Progesterone (P4)-stimulated proliferation resulted in a marked enhancement of DNA damage foci in Brca1−/− mouse mammary. In vivo, NF-κB inhibition prevented recovery of Brca1−/− hormone-independent colony-forming cells. The majority of human BRCA1mut/+ mammary glands showed marked lobular expression of nuclear NF-κB. We conclude that the aberrant proliferative capacity of Brca1−/− luminal progenitor cells is linked to the replication-associated DNA damage response, where proliferation of mammary progenitors is perpetuated by damage-induced, autologous NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2429058495,"Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive histologic subtype among malignant astrocytoma and is associated with poor outcomes because of heterogeneous tumour cell population including mature non-stem-like cell and immature stem-like cells within the tumour. Thus, it is critical to find new target-specific therapeutic modalities. Protein arginine methyltransferase enzyme 5 (PRMT5) regulates many cellular processes through its methylation activity and its overexpression in GBM is associated with more aggressive disease. Previously, we have shown that silencing of PRMT5 expression in differentiated GBM cell lines results in apoptosis and reduced tumour growth in mice. Here, we report the critical role of PRMT5 in GBM differentiated cells (GBMDC) grown in serum and GBM neurospheres (GBMNS) grown as neurospheres in vitro. Our results uncover a very significant role for PRMT5 in GBMNS self-renewal capacity and proliferation. PRMT5 knockdown in GBMDC led to apoptosis, knockdown in GBMNS led to G1 cell cycle arrest through upregulation of p27 and hypophoshorylation of retinoblastoma protein, leading to senescence. Comparison of impact of PRMT5 on cellular signalling by the Human Phospho-Kinase Array and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR revealed that unlike GBMDC, PRMT5 regulates PTEN expression and controls Akt and ERk activity in GBMNS. In vivo transient depletion of PRMT5 decreased intracranial tumour size and growth rate in mice implanted with both primary tumour-derived GBMNS and GBMDC. This is the first study to identify PTEN as a potential downstream target of PRMT5 and PRMT5 is vital to support both mature and immature GBM tumour cell populations."

After applying a correction-specific PCR assay to purify the corrected clones followed by sequencing to confirm mutation correction, we verified that the purified clones retained full pluripotency and exhibited normal karyotyping. Additionally, whole-exome sequencing showed that the mutation load to the exomes was minimal after CRISPR/Cas9 targeting. Furthermore, the corrected iPSCs were selected for erythroblast differentiation and restored the expression of HBB protein compared with the parental iPSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2415312862,"Despite substantial progress in recent years, graft survival beyond the first year still requires improvement. Since modern immunosuppression addresses mainly T-cell activation and proliferation, we studied macrophage infiltration into the allografts of 103 kidney transplant recipients during acute antibody and T-cell mediated rejection. Macrophage infiltration was correlated with both graft function and graft survival until month 36 after transplantation.Macrophage infiltration was significantly elevated in antibody-mediated and T-cell mediated rejection, but not in kidneys with established IFTA. Treatment of rejection with steroids was less successful in patients with more prominent macrophage infiltration into the allografts. Macrophage infiltration was accompanied by increased cell proliferation as well as antigen presentation. With regard to the compartmental distribution severity of T-cell-mediated rejection was correlated to the amount of CD68+ cells especially in the peritubular and perivascular compartment, whereas biopsies with ABMR showed mainly peritubular CD68 infiltration. Furthermore, severity of macrophage infiltration was a valid predictor of resulting creatinine values two weeks as well as two and three years after renal transplantation as illustrated by multivariate analysis. Additionally performed ROC curve analysis showed that magnitude of macrophage infiltration (below vs. above the median) was a valid predictor for the necessity to restart dialysis. Having additionally stratified biopsies in accordance to the magnitude of macrophage infiltration, differential CD68+ cell infiltration was reflected by striking differences in overall graft survival.The differences in acute allograft rejection have not only been reflected by different magnitudes of macrophage infiltration, but also by compartment-specific infiltration pattern and subsequent impact on resulting allograft function as well as need for dialysis initiation. There is a robust relationship between macrophage infiltration, accompanying antigen-presentation and resulting allograft function."
https://openalex.org/W2417165252,"Fumonisins, being common in occurrence in maize-based feeds, pose a great threat to animal and human health. The present study is aimed at determining the antifungal activity of Lactobacillus plantarum MYS6 against a fumonisin producing fungus, Fusarium proliferatum MYS9. The isolate was subjected to standard tests for determining its probiotic attributes and antifungal properties. L. plantarum MYS6 thrived well at pH 3.0 and 6.0, and exhibited strong resistance up to 3% bile. The isolate showed a high degree of cell surface hydrophobicity corresponding to its strong adhesion to chicken crop epithelial cells. Co-inoculation with the fungus on modified de Man Rogosa Sharpe medium revealed the inhibitory effect of L. plantarum MYS6 on fungal growth and biomass. Observation using scanning electron microscopy showed distortion of hyphal structures, swollen tips and disrupted conidia. Conidia germination inhibition assay restrained germination and showed deformed hyphae. The bioprotective feature of the isolate was evident by the inhibition of fungal development in maize-kernel treated with the cell free supernatant of L. plantarum MYS6. Both the isolate and its extracellular metabolites lowered fumonisin content in feed model up to 0.505 mg/Kg of feed and 0.3125 mg/Kg of feed respectively when compared to the level of 0.870 mg/Kg of feed in control. The major antifungal compounds produced by the isolate were 10-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester; palmitic acid, methyl ester; heptadecanoic acid, 16-methyl ester; stearic acid and lauric acid. L. plantarum MYS6 reduced 61.7% of fumonisin possibly by a binding mechanism. These findings suggest the application of L. plantarum MYS6 as an efficient probiotic additive and biocontrol agent in feed used in poultry industry. Additionally, the antifungal metabolites pose a conspicuous inhibition of Fusarium growth and fumonisin production."
https://openalex.org/W2410349404,"Background Mental health disease is under recognized in medical professionals. Objective To screen medical students (MS), residents and fellows for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) under the new era of work hour reform with age-matched controls from a large representative cross-sectional survey. Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey at a medical university in 2013–2014. We incorporated the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) to screen for MDD and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) to screen for GAD, along with additional questions on life stressors and academic performance. We compared these results to age-matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Results 126 residents/fellows and 336 medical students participated voluntarily. 15.1% and 15.9% of postgraduates as well as 16.4% and 20.3% of MS screened positive for MDD and GAD, respectively. When compared to national estimates, the prevalence of a positive screen for MDD was over five-fold higher in medical trainees compared to age-matched controls (16% vs. 2.8%, p<0.0001). Similarly, the prevalence of a positive screen for GAD was over eight-fold higher in medical trainees (19% vs. 2.3%, p<0.0001).The prevalence was consistently higher within age strata. 33.3% of postgraduates and 32% of MS believe there is a significant impact of depression or anxiety on their academic performance. For stress relief, one fifth of residents/fellows as well as MS reported alcohol use. Conclusions The stresses of medical education and practice may predispose trainees to psychopathological consequences that can affect their academic performance and patient care. The current study showed a significantly higher rate of MDD and GAD positive screens in medical trainees than the prevalence in an age-matched U.S. population, despite significant work hour reform for medical trainees. Increased awareness and support services are required at all levels of medical training. We propose that the ACGME and the Institute of Medicine may consider these findings when implementing future changes to work hour regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2418122237,"To investigate the perceived needs for health services by persons with stroke within the first year after rehabilitation, and associations between perceived impact of stroke, involvement in decisions regarding care/treatment, and having health services needs met.Data was collected, through a mail survey, from patients with stroke who were admitted to a university hospital in 2012 and had received rehabilitation after discharge from the stroke unit. The rehabilitation lasted an average of 2 to 4.6 months. The Stroke Survivor Needs Survey Questionnaire was used to assess the participants' perceptions of involvement in decisions on care or treatment and needs for health services in 11 problem areas: mobility, falls, incontinence, pain, fatigue, emotion, concentration, memory, speaking, reading, and sight. The perceived impact of stroke in eight areas was assessed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0. Eleven logistic regression models were created to explore associations between having health services needs met in each problem area respectively (dependent variable) and the independent variables. In all models the independent variables were: age, sex, SIS domain corresponding to the dependent variable, or stroke severity in cases when no corresponding SIS domain was identified, and involvement in decisions on care and treatment.The 63 participants who returned the questionnaires had a mean age of 72 years, 33 were male and 30 were female. Eighty percent had suffered a mild stroke. The number of participants who reported problems varied between 51 (80%, mobility) and 24 (38%, sight). Involvement in decisions on care and treatment was found to be associated with having health services needs met in six problem areas: falls, fatigue, emotion, memory, speaking, and reading.The results highlight the importance of involving patients in making decisions on stroke rehabilitation, as it appears to be associated with meeting their health services needs."
https://openalex.org/W2417405736,"Although social animals frequently make decisions about when or with whom to cooperate, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of partner choice. Most previous studies compared different dyads' performances, though did not allow an actual choice among partners. We tested eleven ravens, Corvus corax, in triads, giving them first the choice to cooperate with either a highly familiar or a rather unfamiliar partner and, second, with either a friend or a non-friend using a cooperative string-pulling task. In either test, the ravens had a second choice and could cooperate with the other partner, given that this one had not pulled the string in the meantime. We show that during the experiments, these partner ravens indeed learn to wait and inhibit pulling, respectively. Moreover, the results of these two experiments show that ravens' preferences for a specific cooperation partner are not based on familiarity. In contrast, the ravens did show a preference based on relationship quality, as they did choose to cooperate significantly more with friends than with non-friends and they were also more proficient when cooperating with a friend. In order to further identify the proximate mechanism of this preference, we designed an open-choice experiment for the whole group where all birds were free to cooperate on two separate apparatuses. This set-up allowed us to distinguish between preferences for close proximity and preferences to cooperate. The results revealed that friends preferred staying close to each other, but did not necessarily cooperate with one another, suggesting that tolerance of proximity and not relationship quality as a whole may be the driving force behind partner choice in raven cooperation. Consequently, we stress the importance of experiments that allow such titrations and, suggest that these results have important implications for the interpretations of cooperation studies that did not include open partner choice."
https://openalex.org/W2427870052,"Metastatic competence is contingent upon the aberrant activation of a latent embryonic program, known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which bestows stem cell properties as well as migratory and invasive capabilities upon differentiated tumor cells. We recently identified the transcription factor FOXC2 as a downstream effector of multiple EMT programs, independent of the EMT-inducing stimulus, and as a key player linking EMT, stem cell traits and metastatic competence in breast cancer. As such, FOXC2 could serve as a potential therapeutic target to attenuate metastasis. However, as FOXC2 is a transcription factor, it is difficult to target by conventional means such as small-molecule inhibitors. Herein, we identify the serine/threonine-specific kinase p38 as a druggable upstream regulator of FOXC2 stability and function that elicits phosphorylation of FOXC2 at serine 367 (S367). Using an orthotopic syngeneic mouse tumor model, we make the striking observation that inhibition of p38-FOXC2 signaling selectively attenuates metastasis without impacting primary tumor growth. In this model, circulating tumor cell numbers are significantly reduced in mice treated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580, relative to vehicle-treated counterparts. Accordingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of p38 decreases FOXC2 protein levels, reverts the EMT phenotype and compromises stem cell attributes in vitro. We also identify the EMT-regulator ZEB1-known to directly repress E-cadherin/CDH1-as a downstream target of FOXC2, critically dependent on its activation by p38. Consistent with the notion that activation of the p38-FOXC2 signaling axis represents a critical juncture in the acquisition of metastatic competence, the phosphomimetic FOXC2(S367E) mutant is refractory to p38 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the non-phosphorylatable FOXC2(S367A) mutant fails to elicit EMT and upregulate ZEB1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that FOXC2 regulates EMT, stem cell traits, ZEB1 expression and metastasis in a p38-dependent manner, and attest to the potential utility of p38 inhibitors as antimetastatic agents."

We described the patterns of HFMD occurrence and analyzed the effect of climatic factors on national HFMD incidence. Weekly clinically diagnosed HFMD case rates (per 1,000 outpatients) in sentinel sites and weekly climatic factors, such as average temperature, relative humidity, duration of sunshine, precipitation, and wind speed from 2010 to 2013, were used in this study. A generalized additive model with smoothing splines and climatic variables with time lags of up to 2 weeks were considered in the modeling process. To account for long-term trends and seasonality, we controlled for each year and their corresponding weeks. The autocorrelation issue was also adjusted by using autocorrelation variables. At an average temperature below 18°C, the HFMD rate increased by 10.3% for every 1°C rise in average temperature (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4, 12.3%). We also saw a 6.6% increase in HFMD rate (95% CI: 3.6, 9.7%) with every 1% increase in relative humidity under 65%, with a 1.5% decrease in HFMD rate observed (95% CI: 0.4, 2.7%) with each 1% humidity increase above 65%. Modeling results have shown that average temperature and relative humidity are related to HFMD rate. Additional research on the environmental risk factors of HFMD transmission is required to understand the underlying mechanism between climatic factors and HFMD incidence."

https://openalex.org/W2415748588,"Recording synchronous data from EEG and eye-tracking provides a unique methodological approach for measuring the sensory and cognitive processes of overt visual search. Using this approach we obtained fixation related potentials (FRPs) during a guided visual search task specifically focusing on the lambda and P3 components. An outstanding question is whether the lambda and P3 FRP components are influenced by concurrent task demands. We addressed this question by obtaining simultaneous eye-movement and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures during a guided visual search task while parametrically modulating working memory load using an auditory N-back task. Participants performed the guided search task alone, while ignoring binaurally presented digits, or while using the auditory information in a 0, 1, or 2-back task. The results showed increased reaction time and decreased accuracy in both the visual search and N-back tasks as a function of auditory load. Moreover, high auditory task demands increased the P3 but not the lambda latency while the amplitude of both lambda and P3 was reduced during high auditory task demands. The results show that both early and late stages of visual processing indexed by FRPs are significantly affected by concurrent task demands imposed by auditory working memory."

Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4–8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to ≥5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75–90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food."
https://openalex.org/W2411417838,"To investigate mechanisms for increased malignant properties in malignant melanomas by ganglioside GD3, enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources and subsequent mass spectrometry were performed using an anti-GD3 antibody and GD3-positive (GD3+) and GD3-negative (GD3-) melanoma cell lines. Neogenin, defined as a GD3-neighbored molecule, was largely localized in lipid/rafts in GD3+ cells. Silencing of neogenin resulted in the reduction of cell growth and invasion activity. Physical association between GD3 and neogenin was demonstrated by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with anti-neogenin antibody from GD3+ cell lysates. The intracytoplasmic domain of neogenin (Ne-ICD) was detected in GD3+ cells at higher levels than in GD3- cells when cells were treated by a proteasome inhibitor but not when simultaneously treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor. Exogenous GD3 also induced increased Ne-ICD in GD3- cells. Overexpression of Ne-ICD in GD3- cells resulted in the increased cell growth and invasion activity, suggesting that Ne-ICD plays a role as a transcriptional factor to drive malignant properties of melanomas after cleavage with γ-secretase. γ-Secretase was found in lipid/rafts in GD3+ cells. Accordingly, immunocyto-staining revealed that GD3, neogenin, and γ-secretase were co-localized at the leading edge of GD3+ cells. All these results suggested that GD3 recruits γ-secretase to lipid/rafts, allowing efficient cleavage of neogenin. ChIP-sequencing was performed to identify candidates of target genes of Ne-ICD. Some of them actually showed increased expression after expression of Ne-ICD, probably exerting malignant phenotypes of melanomas under GD3 expression."

One example of such protein assemblies, the BRCA1-A macromolecular complex, couples ubiquitin recognition and metabolism and promotes cellular responses to DNA damage. Specifically, the BRCA1-A complex not only recognizes Lys63-linked ubiquitin (K63-Ub) adducts at the damaged chromatin but is endowed with K63-Ub deubiquitylase (DUB) activity. To explore how the BRCA1-A DUB activity contributes to its function at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), we used RNAi and genome editing approaches to target BRCC36, the protein subunit that confers the BRCA1-A complex its DUB activity. Intriguingly, we found that the K63-Ub DUB activity, although dispensable for maintaining the integrity of the macromolecular protein assembly, is important in enforcing the accumulation of the BRCA1-A complex onto DSBs. Inactivating BRCC36 DUB attenuated BRCA1-A functions at DSBs and led to unrestrained DSB end resection and hyperactive DNA repair. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role of BRCC36 DUB in limiting DSB processing and repair and illustrate how cells may physically couple ubiquitin recognition and metabolizing activities for fine tuning of DNA repair processes.

https://openalex.org/W2415262931,"Protein-protein interactions are fundamental for all biological phenomena, and protein-protein interaction networks provide a global view of the interactions. The hub proteins, with many interaction partners, play vital roles in the networks. We investigated the subcellular localizations of proteins in the human network, and found that the ones localized in multiple subcellular compartments, especially the nucleus/cytoplasm proteins (NCP), the cytoplasm/cell membrane proteins (CMP), and the nucleus/cytoplasm/cell membrane proteins (NCMP), tend to be hubs. Examinations of keywords suggested that among NCP, those related to post-translational modifications and transcription functions are the major contributors to the large number of interactions. These types of proteins are characterized by a multi-domain architecture and intrinsic disorder. A survey of the typical hub proteins with prominent numbers of interaction partners in the type revealed that most are either transcription factors or co-regulators involved in signaling pathways. They translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, triggered by the phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination of intrinsically disordered regions. Among CMP and NCMP, the contributors to the numerous interactions are related to either kinase or ubiquitin ligase activity. Many of them reside on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, and act as the upstream regulators of signaling pathways. Overall, these hub proteins function to transfer external signals to the nucleus, through the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. Our analysis suggests that multiple-localization is a crucial concept to characterize groups of hub proteins and their biological functions in cellular information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2408816909,"Ribbon synapses mediate continuous release in neurons that have graded voltage responses. While mammalian retinas can signal visual flicker at 80–100 Hz, the time constant, τ, for the refilling of a depleted vesicle release pool at cone photoreceptor ribbons is 0.7–1.1 s. Due to this prolonged depression, the mechanism for encoding high temporal frequencies is unclear. To determine the mechanism of high-frequency signaling, we focused on an “Off” cone bipolar cell type in the ground squirrel, the cb2, whose transient postsynaptic responses recovered following presynaptic depletion with a τ of ∼0.1 s, or 7- to 10-fold faster than the τ for presynaptic pool refilling. The difference in recovery time course is caused by AMPA receptor saturation, where partial refilling of the presynaptic pool is sufficient for a full postsynaptic response. By limiting the dynamic range of the synapse, receptor saturation counteracts ribbon depression to produce rapid recovery and facilitate high-frequency signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2412000904,"The bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 does not synthesize siderophores for iron utilization in aerobic environments, and the mechanism of iron uptake within symbiotic soybean root nodules is unknown. An mbfA bfr double mutant defective in iron export and storage activities cannot grow aerobically in very high iron medium. Here, we found that this phenotype was suppressed by loss of function mutations in the feoAB operon encoding ferrous (Fe2+) iron uptake proteins. Expression of the feoAB operon genes was elevated under iron limitation, but mutants defective in either gene were unable to grow aerobically over a wide external ferric (Fe3+) iron (FeCl3) concentration range. Thus, FeoAB accommodates iron acquisition under iron limited and iron replete conditions. Incorporation of radiolabel from either 55Fe2+ or 59Fe3+ into cells was severely defective in the feoA and feoB strains, suggesting Fe3+ reduction to Fe2+ prior to traversal across the cytoplasmic membrane by FeoAB. The feoA or feoB deletion strains elicited small, ineffective nodules on soybean roots, containing few bacteria and lacking nitrogen fixation activity. A feoA(E40K) mutant contained partial iron uptake activity in culture that supported normal growth and established an effective symbiosis. The feoA(E40K) strain had partial iron uptake activity in situ within nodules and in isolated cells, indicating that FeoAB is the iron transporter in symbiosis.

We conclude that FeoAB supports iron acquisition under limited conditions of soil and in the iron-rich environment of a symbiotic nodule. Iron is an essential nutrient involved in many biological processes, including the TCA cycle, electron transport, detoxification, signal transduction, nucleic acid synthesis, gene regulation, and nitrogen fixation (1Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). The bioavailability of iron is low in aerobic environments because it is oxidized in the ferric (Fe3+) form and therefore highly insoluble. High affinity iron acquisition systems are expressed under iron limitation to scavenge the metal. To acquire ferric iron, many bacteria synthesize and secrete low molecular weight iron chelators called siderophores and then import the Fe3+-bound chelate back into the cell (2Chu B.C. Garcia-Herrero A. Johanson T.H. Krewulak K.D. Lau C.K. Peacock R.S. Slavinskaya Z. Vogel H.J. Siderophore uptake in bacteria and the battle for iron with the host: a bird's eye view.Biometals. 2010; 23: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, this uptake system includes an outer membrane receptor, a periplasmic protein, and an inner membrane ABC transporter (3Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Sansom M.S. Acquisition of siderophores in Gram-negative bacteria.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Some bacteria can also use other iron chelates such as siderophores produced by other microbes or heme (4Wandersman C. Stojiljkovic I. Bacterial heme sources: the role of heme, hemoprotein receptors and hemophores.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Genco C.A. Dixon D.W. Emerging strategies in microbial haem capture.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The genes encoding siderophore or heme uptake proteins are induced under iron limitation, and iron uptake under conditions where the metal is replete is not well described. Rhizobia bacteria live as free living soil organisms or as an endosymbiont within legume root nodule cells, where they fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia to fulfill the nitrogen requirement of the host. Iron is essential for rhizobia-legume symbioses for the nitrogenase enzymes and ancillary processes associated with it (6Brear E.M. Day D.A. Smith P.M. Iron: an essential micronutrient for the legume-rhizobium symbiosis.Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, bacterial iron transporters needed to establish symbiosis and function within nodule plant cells have not been elucidated. Some rhizobial species synthesize siderophores and the cognate transport proteins, but mutations in the corresponding genes do not affect the establishment or maintenance of symbiosis (7Stevens J.B.

Citrate as a siderophore in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3298-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but free living cells can utilize heme as an iron source (12Noya F. Arias A. Fabiano E. Heme compounds as iron sources for nonpathogenic Rhizobium bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3076-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also siderophores (xenosiderophores) produced by other microorganisms (13Plessner O. Klapatch T. Guerinot M.L. Siderophore utilization by Bradyrhizobium japonicum.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 1688-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Small S.K. Puri S. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. Positive control of ferric siderophore receptor gene expression by the Irr protein in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, many bacteria, including the Rhizobia, grow well aerobically in culture with Fe3+ salts, independent of siderophores, but the mechanism of uptake is unknown in most cases. A ferrichrome receptor mutant of B. japonicum strain 61A152 does not establish an effective symbiosis on soybean, but ferrichrome is a fungal siderophore not available to B. japonicum in nodules (15Benson H.P. Boncompagni E. Guerinot M.L. An iron uptake operon required for proper nodule development in the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2005; 18: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, those authors suggest that the fegA gene plays some other role. In addition a fegA mutant of B. japonicum USDA122 has no symbiotic phenotype (14Small S.K. Puri S. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. Positive control of ferric siderophore receptor gene expression by the Irr protein in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Within infected plant cells of nodules, the symbiotic bacteria, called bacteroids, are surrounded by a plant membrane to form the symbiosome (6Brear E.M. Day D.A. Smith P.M. Iron: an essential micronutrient for the legume-rhizobium symbiosis.Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Expression of the soybean divalent metal transporter GmDMT1 is enhanced in the symbiosome membrane (16Kaiser B.N. Moreau S. Castelli J. Thomson R. Lambert A. Bogliolo S. Puppo A. Day D.A. The soybean NRAMP homologue, GmDMT1, is a symbiotic divalent metal transporter capable of ferrous iron transport.Plant J. 2003; 35: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the soybean symbiosome membrane has ferric reductase activity (17LeVier K. Day D.A. Guerinot M.L. Iron uptake by symbiosomes from soybean root nodules.Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This suggests that iron traverses the symbiosome membrane in the ferrous (Fe2+) form in situ. Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is soluble and stable under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions. FeoB is a ferrous iron transporter that is widely distributed among bacteria and archaea (18Cartron M.L. Maddocks S. Gillingham P. Craven C.J. Andrews S.C. Feo-transport of ferrous iron into bacteria.Biometals. 2006; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The feoB gene is usually found in an operon with feoA, which encodes an auxiliary protein necessary for ferrous iron uptake, but its exact role is unknown (18Cartron M.L. Maddocks S. Gillingham P. Craven C.J. Andrews S.C. Feo-transport of ferrous iron into bacteria.Biometals. 2006; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As expected, bacterial feoB mutants have a growth phenotype in low O2 environments, but not under aerobic conditions (18Cartron M.L. Maddocks S. Gillingham P. Craven C.J. Andrews S.C.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that FeoAB is essential for aerobic growth and Fe3+ utilization in free living cells over a wide external iron concentration range and for symbiosis with soybean. Thus, B. japonicum employs a single iron transporter to adapt to diverse environmental conditions. MbfA is the major iron exporter in B. japonicum (24Sankari S. O'Brian M.R. A bacterial iron exporter for maintenance of iron homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16498-16507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Bfr is an iron storage protein needed to control iron toxicity in that organism (25Sankari S. O'Brian M.R. Synthetic lethality of the bfr and mbfA genes reveals a functional relationship between iron storage and iron export in managing stress responses in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0157250Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that an mbfA bfr double mutant has a severe growth phenotype in medium supplemented with a high iron concentration (25Sankari S. O'Brian M.R. Synthetic lethality of the bfr and mbfA genes reveals a functional relationship between iron storage and iron export in managing stress responses in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0157250Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells of the mbfA bfr strain grown to mid-log phase in liquid culture did not grow when spotted on solid medium containing 1.65 mm FeSO4, whereas the wild type, bfr, and mbfA strains were able to grow (supplemental Fig. S1A). In a search for secondary site mutations that suppressed this growth phenotype, mbfA bfr cells were plated onto solid medium containing 1.65 mm FeSO4 and selected for colonies that arose spontaneously. Ten colonies were scored, and four were pursued further by genotyping. The four colonies were rescored using the spotting assay as described above. The suppressor strains grew similarly to the wild type and single mutants (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, suppressors 6, 8, and 9 were unable to grow on plates containing 50 μm FeSO4 (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting that those mutants not only tolerated high iron but required it. Suppressors 6, 8, 9, and 11 were able to grow in medium containing 100 nm heme as the iron source, and therefore all strains were grown in this manner for maintenance and for primary cultures used in inoculations. The wild type strain USDA110, the mbfA bfr double mutant, and the four suppressor strains were genotyped by whole genome DNA sequencing, and mutated regions were verified by resequencing PCR-amplified fragments around the lesions. Suppressor strains 6, 8, and 9 have mutations within the coding region of the putative feoB gene (blr6523) encoding the ferrous (Fe2+) cytoplasmic (inner) membrane transporter FeoB (supplemental Fig. S2 A). The mutations include an in-frame deletion, a transposon insertion, and a nonsense mutation (supplemental Fig. S2 B). Suppressor 11 contains a missense mutation within the feoA gene resulting in a Glu-40 to Lys substitution. The feoA gene is immediately upstream of feoB that likely forms an operon (supplemental Fig. S2A). FeoA is an accessory protein also involved in Fe2+ uptake, but its exact function is not known (18Cartron M.L. Maddocks S. Gillingham P. Craven C.J. Andrews S.C. Feo-transport of ferrous iron into bacteria.Biometals. 2006; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 26Su Y.C. Chin K.H. Hung H.C. Shen G.H. Wang A.H. Chou S.H. Structure of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FeoA complexed with zinc: a unique prokaryotic SH3-domain protein that possibly acts as a bacterial ferrous iron-transport activating factor.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The feoB(Y454term) and feoA(E40K) alleles of suppressor 9 and 11, respectively, were reconstructed in an mbfA bfr background, and the suppressor phenotypes were confirmed (supplemental Fig. S3). Both of these gene variants were shown to be loss of function alleles based on the following: Partial diploids were constructed in an mbfA bfr background that harbored both the wild type and the mutant feo alleles (S9+ and S11+). Both strains grew in media with 50 μm FeSO4, but not with 1.65 mm FeSO4, (supplemental Fig. S3), similar to the mbfA bfr parent strain. Thus, the wild type feo genes were dominant over the suppressor alleles. In addition, feoA and feoB deletions mutants were constructed in the mbfA bfr background, and each mutant recapitulated the suppressor phenotype of growth in media containing 1.65 mm FeSO4 (supplemental Fig. S3). It is likely that a defect in iron uptake activity counteracted iron toxicity of the mbfA bfr mutant in high iron medium leading to the suppressor phenotype. The feoA and feoB deletions, as well as the feoB(Y454term) and feoA(E340K) alleles, were each constructed in wild type (mbfA+ bfr+) backgrounds and characterized by spotting assays (Fig. 1). feoA, feoB, and feoB(Y454term) grew in solid medium containing 1.65 mm FeSO4, but not 50 μm FeSO4, which suggests a defect in iron acquisition. The feoA(E40K) mutant did not have a discernible growth phenotype on plates in the wild type background but did in the mbfA bfr background. Iron is predominantly in the ferric (Fe3+) form in aerobic environments, and all experiments in this study were carried out aerobically. Therefore, it was not expected that the selection would yield mutations in a ferrous iron transport system. Although reduced iron (FeSO4) was used in the plates (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 and Fig. 1), we assumed that it would oxidize in air. Thus, we measured aerobic growth of the wild type and mutant strains in minimal medium using ferric iron (FeCl3) as the nutritional iron source (Fig. 2). The feoA and feoB mutants examined were constructed in wild type backgrounds. The wild type grew in minimal medium with no supplemented iron, but only to an A540 of ∼0.2. By contrast, the feoA, feoB, and feoB(Y454term) mutants showed no growth in that medium (Fig. 2A). The feoA(E40K) mutant grew similar to the wild type, suggesting a leaky phenotype that will be discussed further below. Similar results were observed when cells were grown in GSY medium, except that the wild type and feoA(E40K) cells grew to a higher A540, presumably because of contaminating iron (0.3 μm) in the medium (supplemental Fig. S4). The addition of 5, 50, or 500 μm FeCl3 to the growth medium did not rescue growth of the feoA, feoB, or feoB(Y454term) mutants, although the wild type grew well with iron supplementation (Fig. 2, B–D). Heme can be used as an iron source in B. japonicum (12Noya F. Arias A. Fabiano E. Heme compounds as iron sources for nonpathogenic Rhizobium bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3076-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is known to be taken up by the Hmu system (27Nienaber A. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Discovery of a haem uptake system in the soil bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and does not utilize FeoAB. Accordingly, the mutants grew well in medium supplemented with 500 nm heme (Fig. 2E). We conclude that the ferrous iron transport system FeoAB is required for ferric iron utilization. Moreover, FeoAB appears to be the major transporter over a wide concentration of ferric iron in the medium. This latter point is noteworthy because high affinity iron transport systems are usually expressed under iron limitation, but not under iron replete conditions (14Small S.K. Puri S. Sangwan I. O'Brian M.R. Positive control of ferric siderophore receptor gene expression by the Irr protein in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Yang J. Sangwan I. Lindemann A. Hauser F. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. O'Brian M.R. Bradyrhizobium japonicum senses iron through the status of haem to regulate iron homeostasis and metabolism.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By contrast, feoA and feoB are needed under severe iron limitation (Fig. 2A), as well as under iron-replete conditions (Fig. 2, B–D). The feoB gene is widespread among prokaryotes, and FeoB is known to be an inner membrane Fe2+ transporter (18Cartron M.L. Maddocks S. Gillingham P. Craven C.J. Andrews S.C. Feo-transport of ferrous iron into bacteria.Biometals. 2006; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, it is shown here to be required for growth with ferric iron. Thus, we measured iron uptake activity in the wild type and mutants using Fe2+ or Fe3+ as substrate (Fig. 3). 55Fe2+ uptake observed in the wild was almost completely abolished in the feoB and the feoA deletion strains (Fig. 3A). Thus, as expected, FeoAB is required for uptake of ferrous iron by B. japonicum. The initial uptake of 55Fe2+ uptake by wild type cells was measured as a function of the initial substrate concentration, and the data are presented as a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3B). The average apparent Km value of three trials was 16.8 ± 3.2 nm. Iron uptake by the wild type was readily detectable with 59Fe3+ as substrate but was severely defective in the feoB and the feoA deletion strains (Fig. 3C). These observations are consistent with the dependence on feoA and feoB for aerobic growth with ferric iron (Fig. 2). Fe3+ is likely reduced to Fe2+ in the medium or in the periplasm and subsequently transported across the inner membrane by FeoB. The initial uptake of 59Fe3+ uptake by wild type cells was measured as a function of the initial substrate concentration, and the data are presented as a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3D). The average apparent Km value of three trials was 278 ± 18 nm. This higher value compared with Fe2+ may reflect a reduction step, differences in mechanisms of traversing the outer membrane, or some other variable. Uptake of 55Fe2+ or 59Fe3+ by the feoA(E40K) strain was diminished but substantially greater than the deletion strains (Fig. 3). This diminished activity is sufficient to support aerobic growth in liquid medium, which likely explains the ability of that mutant to grow in liquid medium (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). The growth curve data (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4) suggest that FeoAB is the primary iron transporter in B. japonicum over a wide concentration range of iron. Thus, we monitored feoA and feoB mRNA in cells grown at various iron concentrations to determine whether these genes were regulated by iron (Fig. 4). The transcript levels of feoA and feoB were ∼5-fold higher in cells grown in medium with no added iron when compared with cells grown in 10 or 20 μm FeCl3 (Fig. 4) and dropped even lower in medium with 100 μm FeCl3. Thus, like other high affinity iron transport systems, the FeoAB system is maximally expressed under iron limitation. However, the lower levels of expression of this system at the higher iron concentrations must be sufficient to support growth because these genes are essential under those conditions. The feoA and feoB deletion mutants grew well in minimal (Fig. 2E) or GSY (supplemental Fig. S4E) medium supplemented with 500 nm heme as the iron source, but not in its absence. We wanted to assess whether the feoA and feoB mutants had other phenotypes associated with iron limitation with heme despite the good growth. Irr is the global iron-responsive transcriptional regulator in B. japonicum and related bacteria (28Yang J. Sangwan I. Lindemann A. Hauser F. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. O'Brian M.R. Bradyrhizobium japonicum senses iron through the status of haem to regulate iron homeostasis and metabolism.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Irr accumulates under iron limitation but degrades in response to the metal in a heme-dependent manner (29Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Heme is an effector molecule for iron-dependent degradation of the bacterial iron response regulator (Irr) protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We monitored Irr levels by Western blot analysis in cells of the wild type and mutant strains (Fig. 5A). Irr accumulation of wild type cells grown in modified GSY medium with heme as the only added iron source was diminished compared with cells grown in medium with no iron supplementation, which is expected because iron causes Irr degradation. Cells of the feoA and feoB deletion mutants, as well as feoB(Y454term), grown in heme-supplemented medium accumulated much more Irr than the wild type grown under the same condition, consistent with a lower cellular iron content. Thus, heme enters cells and can rescue growth in the mutants, but the iron level attained is not sufficient to degrade Irr. Clearly, the non-heme contaminating iron in the medium (0.3 μm as determined by atomic absorption) contributes to the cellular iron content in the wild type, but the feo mutants do not have access to it. In previous studies, GSY or similar medium without added iron has been used as the low iron conditions sufficient to induce Irr accumulation in cells (30Jaggavarapu S. O'Brian M.R. Differential control of Bradyrhizobium japonicum iron stimulon genes through variable affinity of the iron response regulator (Irr) for target gene promoters and selective loss of activator function.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The current work suggests that B. japonicum can tolerate substantially lower cellular iron levels. The Irr level in the feoA(E40K) was comparable with the wild type, consistent with other leaky phenotypes of this mutant. Irr activates the fhuE gene, and transcript was measured by quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 5B). fhuE levels were over 15-fold greater in the feo mutants that showed elevated Irr levels compared with the wild type. The feoA(E40K) mutant also showed elevated fhuE levels but to a lesser extent. The findings show that FeoAB is needed to maintain iron homeostasis under low iron conditions. To determine whether feoA and feoB are essential for symbiosis, soybean seedlings were inoculated with wild type and mutant strains and grown for 28 days in nitrogen-free soil. Strains feoB and feoA incited small, poorly developed nodules on soybean plants (Fig. 6A). The nodules contained few viable bacteria, which could not fix nitrogen as measured by acetylene reduction activity (Fig. 6B). The general appearance of 28-day-old plants inoculated with either feoB or feoA strain were identical to that of the uninoculated plant controls, consistent with the lack of nitrogen fixation activity (data not shown). These observations show that feoA and feoB are essential for establishing symbiosis with soybean. The route of iron entry into symbiotic bacteroids is unknown for any Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. The inability of the feoA or feoB strain to establish symbiosis does not directly address this question because those genes may be essential for infection and development of the nodule before symbiosis is established. Accordingly, the lack of bacteria within nodules elicited by the mutants prevents a direct measurement of iron uptake. The feoA(E40K) mutant has diminished but measurable iron uptake activity in free living cells (Fig. 3), grows well in culture (Fig. 2), and shows normal iron-responsive gene expression (Fig. 5). Importantly, it also elicited nitrogen fixing nodules on soybean (Fig. 6), thereby providing a tool to directly address the role of FeoAB on iron transport. Roots with attached nodules were incubated in medium containing 5 μm Fe2+ and harvested at various time points. The bacteroids were then isolated from the nodules, and radiolabel was measured (Fig. 7A). Radiolabel was taken up by the feoA(E40K) mutant within nodules, but at a lower rate, similar to what was observed in free living cells. Radiolabel found within the plant cytosol fraction was almost identical in nodules elicited by the wild type or feoA(E40K) strain (supplemental Fig. S6), suggesting that the lower rate of iron uptake by feo(E40K) bacteroids within nodules was not limited by entry into nodule plant cells. To address this further, we measured 55Fe2+ uptake by isolated bacteroids and found that the feoA(E40K) strain had lower uptake activity than the wild type (Fig. 7B). We conclude that the FeoAB transport system participates in iron uptake within symbiotic bacteroids. We also measured ferric (Fe3+) uptake by isolated bacteroids of the wild type but found almost no activity, even when using 1 μm 59Fe3+ as substrate (Fig. 7C). This differed from free living cells, which utilized Fe3+ (Fig. 3A), suggesting a ferric reductase activity in those cells that is absent in symbiotic bacteroids. B. japonicum resides in the iron-limited conditions of aerobic soils and also within the iron-rich milieu of soybean root nodules. In the present study, we show that the ferrous iron transporter FeoAB supports iron acquisition under these diverse conditions. FeoAB is required for aerobic growth using ferric iron as a nutritional iron source. In addition, B. japonicum does not employ different high affinity and low affinity transporters to support growth under iron-limited and iron-replete conditions, respectively, but instead, FeoAB is the primary iron transporter for over a wide range of external iron concentrations. Moreover, our findings support the conclusion that FeoAB functions as the iron transporter within plant cells of symbiotic root nodules. B. japonicum does not produce siderophores for ferric iron utilization, and the current study reveals FeoB as the inner membrane component for upt"
https://openalex.org/W2412310276,"Forces due to propulsion should approximate forces due to hydrodynamic drag for animals horizontally swimming at a constant speed with negligible buoyancy forces. Propulsive forces should also correlate with energy expenditures associated with locomotion—an important cost of foraging. As such, biologging tags containing accelerometers are being used to generate proxies for animal energy expenditures despite being unable to distinguish rotational movements from linear movements. However, recent miniaturizations of gyroscopes offer the possibility of resolving this shortcoming and obtaining better estimates of body accelerations of swimming animals. We derived accelerations using gyroscope data for swimming Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and determined how well the measured accelerations correlated with actual swimming speeds and with theoretical drag. We also compared dive averaged dynamic body acceleration estimates that incorporate gyroscope data, with the widely used Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) metric, which does not use gyroscope data. Four Steller sea lions equipped with biologging tags were trained to swim alongside a boat cruising at steady speeds in the range of 4 to 10 kph. At each speed, and for each dive, we computed a measure called Gyro-Informed Dynamic Acceleration (GIDA) using a method incorporating gyroscope data with accelerometer data. We derived a new metric—Averaged Propulsive Body Acceleration (APBA), which is the average gain in speed per flipper stroke divided by mean stroke cycle duration. Our results show that the gyro-based measure (APBA) is a better predictor of speed than ODBA. We also found that APBA can estimate average thrust production during a single stroke-glide cycle, and can be used to estimate energy expended during swimming. The gyroscope-derived methods we describe should be generally applicable in swimming animals where propulsive accelerations can be clearly identified in the signal—and they should also prove useful for dead-reckoning and improving estimates of energy expenditures from locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2408898700,"A signature feature of HIV infection is poor control of herpes virus infections, which reactivate from latency and cause opportunistic infections. While the general mechanism underlying this observation is deficient CD4+T-cell function, it is unknown whether increased severity of herpes virus infections is due primarily to poor immune control in latent or lytic sites of infection, or whether CD4+ immunodeficiency leads to more critical downstream deficits in humoral or cell-mediated immunologic responses. Here we compare genital shedding patterns of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) in 98 HIV infected and 98 HIV uninfected men matched on length of infection, HSV-1 serostatus and nationality. We demonstrate that high copy HSV-2 shedding is more frequent in HIV positive men, particularly in participants with CD4+ T-cell count <200/μL. Genital shedding is more frequent due to higher rate of shedding episodes, as well as a higher proportion of prolonged shedding episodes. Peak episode viral load was not found to differ between HIV infected and uninfected participants regardless of CD4+ T-cell count. We simulate a mathematical model which recapitulates these findings and identifies that rate of HSV-2 release from neural tissue increases, duration of mucosal cytolytic immune protection decreases, and cell-free viral lifespan increases in HIV infected participants. These results suggest that increased HSV-2 shedding in HIV infected persons may be caused by impaired immune function in both latent and lytic tissue compartments, with deficits in clearance of HSV-2 infected cells and extracellular virus."

But data is scarce in high burden countries, under field conditions, including data on the benefits of LTBI management. Objective To analyze the LTBI diagnosis and treatment cascade among contacts in primary health care (PHC) services in São José do Rio Preto—SP, Brazil. Methods Cross-sectional design, conducted with contacts of pulmonary TB patients followed in all PHC services. Data was collected from May to September 2014 in the Reporting System for TB cases (TBWEB) and Reporting System for Chemoprophylaxis. Medical records and treatment follow-up forms were reviewed and all the nurses responsible for TB in PHC services were interviewed. Results Among 336 contacts included, 267 (79.4%) were screened for TB or LTBI, according to the presence or not of respiratory symptoms. Among those contacts screened, 140 (52.4%) were symptomatic, 9 (3.4%) had TB disease, 106/221 (48%) had positive TST result, meeting the criteria for LTBI treatment, and 64/106 (60.4%) actually started it. Overall, among 267 screened, only 64 (24%) started LTBI treatment. The completion rates of treatment among the contacts who started it, those with positive TST result and those screened were 56.3% (36/64), 16.3% (36/221) and 13.5% (36/267), respectively. Nurses claimed that asymptomatic TB contacts pay no attention to preventive health care and do not seek medical care as they do not have symptoms of the disease. In reviewing the medical records, high proportions of contacts without evaluation, incomplete assessment, incorrect records of contraindication for LTBI treatment, lack of notes regarding the identification and evaluation of contacts were identified. Conclusions There is a need for better organization of the surveillance and investigation routine for contacts in PHC, considering the reorganization of the work process and the features of the local health system."

https://openalex.org/W2416632937,"Background Due to increased resistance and safety concerns with insecticide-based pediculicides, there is growing demand for head lice treatments with a physical mode of action. Certain mineral oils kill lice by blocking spiracles or by disrupting the epicuticular wax layer. The present study was performed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a mineral oil-based shampoo. Methods This randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, monocentric study (EudraCT registration no. 2014-002918-23) was performed from October 2014—June 2015 in Germany. A mineral oil shampoo (Mosquito® Med Läuse Shampoo 10 in Germany, Paranix or Silcap shampoo elsewhere), registered as medical device, was compared to a conventional, locally reimbursed, pyrethroid-based pediculicide (Goldgeist® Forte solution). In total, 107 patients (>1 year) with confirmed head lice infestation were included (test arm: n = 53; control arm: n = 54). All subjects received two applications of either test or control product at day 0 and day 7, according to the instructions for use. Efficacy and safety was evaluated directly, 1h and 24h after first application, before and after second treatment, and at day 10. The main objective was demonstrating a cure rate for the test product, being superior to 70% at day 10. Results Cure rates at day 10 (corrected for re-infestation) for the test product (96.1%) and control (94%) significantly exceeded the pre-defined target (70%) (p < 0.001, 2-sided, 1-sample, chi-square test) with confirmed non-inferiority for the test product. Over all visits, cure rates were consistently higher for the test product, whereas more initially-cured subjects remained lice-free until end of study (78%; control: 60%). Both products were safe and well tolerated, offering good esthetical effects. Conclusion This study showed that substance-based medical devices (including the tested mineral oil shampoo) can be safe and effective alternatives for insecticide-based pediculicides, with less risk for development of resistance because of the physical mode of action.

https://openalex.org/W2415150011,"During the biosynthesis of natural products, isotopic fractionation occurs due to the selectivity of enzymes for the heavier or lighter isotopomers. As only some of the positions in the molecule are implicated in a given reaction mechanism, position-specific fractionation occurs, leading to a non-statistical distribution of isotopes. This can be accessed by isotope ratio monitoring (13)C NMR spectrometry. The solanaceous alkaloids S-(-)-nicotine and hyoscyamine (atropine) are related in having a common intermediate, but downstream enzymatic steps diverge, providing a relevant test case to: (a) elucidate the isotopic affiliation between carbon atoms in the alkaloids and those in the precursors; (b) obtain information about the kinetic isotope effects of as yet undescribed enzymes, thus to make predictions as to their possible mechanism(s). We show that the position-specific (13)C/(12)C ratios in the different moieties of these compounds can satisfactorily be related to their known precursors and to the known kinetic isotope effects of enzymes involved in their biosynthesis, or to similar reaction mechanisms. Thus, the pathway to the common intermediate, N-methyl-Δ(1)-pyrrolinium, is seen to introduce similar isotope distribution patterns in the two alkaloids independent of plant species, whereas the remaining atoms of each target compound, which are of different origins, reflect their specific metabolic ancestry. We further demonstrate that the measured (13)C distribution pattern can be used to deduce aspects of the reaction mechanism of enzymes still to be identified."

Reyes C.N. Becker C.A. Katsumoto T.R. Ma J. Wolf A.J. Bose N. Chan A.S. Magee A.S. Danielson M.E. Weiss A. Vasilakos J.P. Underhill D.M. et al.Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a “phagocytic synapse.”.Nature. 2011; 472: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The difference is thought to be caused by the ability of particulate β-glucan to induce the formation of a phagocytic synapse that excludes CD45 and CD148 phosphatases (19.Goodridge H.S. Reyes C.N. Becker C.A. Katsumoto T.R. Ma J. Wolf A.J. Bose N. Chan A.S. Magee A.S. Danielson M.E. Weiss A. Vasilakos J.P. Underhill D.M. et al.Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a “phagocytic synapse.”.Nature. 2011; 472: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). As any important receptor, Dectin-1 is tightly regulated. This regulation occurs not only at the level of signaling pathways but also at the level of expression. Dectin-1 is highly up-regulated after IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF treatment, whereas IL-10, LPS, and dexamethasone down-regulate its expression (20.Willment J.A. Lin H.H. Reid D.M. Taylor P.R. Williams D.L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. Brown G.D. et al.Dectin-1 expression and function are enhanced on alternatively activated and GM-CSF-treated macrophages and are negatively regulated by IL-10, dexamethasone, and lipopolysaccharide.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4569-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To elicit the full antifungal immune response, Dectin-1 cooperates with several TLRs 4The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorgpglycoproteinSCIMPSLP76/SLP65-interacting membrane adaptor proteinAPCantigen-presenting cellCFSE5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl esterNP4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetylBMDCbone marrow-derived dendritic cellBMMFbone marrow-derived macrophageIMDMIscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. (most importantly TLR2) (17.Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. et al.Collaborative induction of inflammatory responses by dectin-1 and Toll-like receptor 2.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Its function is also complemented by other C-type lectin receptors, such as Dectin-2, which recognizes mannan structures in fungal cell walls (1.Hardison S.E. Brown G.D. et al.C-type lectin receptors orchestrate antifungal immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, Dectin-1 interacts with tetraspanin molecules, which form the basis of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and were suggested to be involved in Dectin-1 trafficking (21.Mantegazza A.R. Barrio M.M. Moutel S. Bover L. Weck M. Brossart P. Teillaud J.-L. Mordoh J. et al.CD63 tetraspanin slows down cell migration and translocates to the endosomal-lysosomal-MIICs route after extracellular stimuli in human immature dendritic cells.Blood. 2004; 104: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22.Meyer-Wentrup F.

Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains in some Dectin-1-expressing cells also interact with MHCII glycoproteins (MHCIIgp)and a small palmitoylated transmembrane adaptor protein, SCIMP (23.Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. et al.Tetraspanins as regulators of protein trafficking.Traffic. 2007; 8: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M.

Signal. 2014; 26: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of SCIMP is highly specific for the tissues of the immune system, where it is confined to the professional antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages). In B cells, SCIMP is phosphorylated after MHCIIgp cross-linking, and it is thought to be involved in the reverse signaling at the APC side of the immunological synapse. In the K46 B cell line, it was shown to be mainly responsible for supporting ERK signaling upon MHCIIgp stimulation (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The SCIMP molecule has four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. When phosphorylated, it binds Grb2, SLP-65, or SLP-76 and Csk via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Through a proline-rich sequence, SCIMP is constitutively associated with the Src family kinase Lyn. Despite the interaction with a negative regulator of the Src family kinases Csk, SCIMP plays an overall positive regulatory function mediated by the recruitment of the Grb2·SLP-65 complex, whereas Csk binding seems to be only responsible for negative feedback regulation of this process (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Stepanek O. Draber P. Horejsi V. et al.Palmitoylated transmembrane adaptor proteins in leukocyte signaling.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated SCIMP function in vivo using a SCIMP-deficient mouse model. Although we did not observe any effects of SCIMP deficiency on MHCIIgp signaling, we found that it is involved in the signaling by Dectin-1 in dendritic cells and macrophages, where it is important for sustaining prolonged MAP kinase activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. To determine the physiological function of SCIMP, we obtained the SCIMP-deficient mouse strain Scimptm1a(KOMP)Wtsi (hereafter termed Scimp−/−) from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). First we verified SCIMP deficiency at the protein level. As expected, there was no detectable SCIMP protein present in the lysates of Scimp−/− splenocytes and dendritic cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we assessed leukocyte development and leukocyte subset representation in lymphoid organs obtained from SCIMP-deficient mice. Bone marrows, spleens, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old wild-type and Scimp−/− animals. After preparation of single cell suspensions, a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis was carried out. This analysis determined the percentages of T cells, B cells, and their subpopulations as well as the representation of major myeloid cell subsets. However, Scimp−/− mice did not show any statistically significant differences from wild-type animals under steady-state conditions (Fig. 1, B–E). In B cells, SCIMP was shown to be involved in signal transduction downstream of MHCIIgp (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that GL7+ germinal center B cells express higher levels of SCIMP than naïve B cells (Fig. 2A). This suggests that SCIMP may participate in signaling in B cells during the process of obtaining antigen-specific T cell help in the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles. This eventually results in B cell differentiation into plasma cells and secretion of specific antibodies. To test the effect of SCIMP deficiency on this process, we immunized wild-type and Scimp−/− mice intradermally with ovalbumin. After the immunization, we collected the serum from immunized animals and measured antigen-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA. Although there was a significant increase in immunoglobulin production after immunization, there were no significant differences between wild-type and Scimp−/− animals in the detected levels of antigen-specific IgM or IgG (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also obtained when we used different antigen (a small recombinant fragment from ARHGEF4 protein, data not shown). Another option was that SCIMP may support the function of B cells as antigen-presenting cells. To test this, we performed a B cell antigen presentation assay. Scimp−/− and wild-type mice were crossed with the transgenic mouse strain B1–8i expressing B cell antigen receptor (BCR) specific for 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) hapten. Then we isolated B cells from these mice and fed them with NP-ovalbumin to allow its processing and presentation on MHCII molecules. Next we tested the ability of these B cells to stimulate OTII T cells expressing transgenic T cell antigen receptor (TCR) specific for ovalbumin peptide. The proliferation and activation of antigen-specific T cells were measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). Similar to the previous experiment, we did not observe any differences between WT and Scimp−/− B cells in their ability to activate antigen-specific T cells. Finally, we also tested signaling downstream of MHCIIgp in SCIMP-deficient B cells. Specifically, we analyzed ERK MAP kinase activation triggered by MHCIIgp cross-linking, which was shown previously to be reduced in the K46 B cell line after SCIMP down-regulation (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the K46 B cell line, murine purified B cells isolated from Scimp−/− spleen did not show any defects in ERK phosphorylation when compared with wild-type B cells (Fig. 2D). Moreover, calcium responses after MHCIIgp and IgM cross-linking were also not altered (Fig. 2E). This lack of differences at the single cell level in vitro may explain the lack of differences during the antigen presentation assay and antigen-specific antibody response in vivo. SCIMP is expressed not only in the B cell lineage but also in myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Strong expression of SCIMP was observed in dendritic cells differentiated from human monocytes using GM-CSF- and IL-4-supplemented medium (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), SCIMP expression is relatively low. However, it can be strongly up-regulated after GM-CSF treatment (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we wanted to find out whether SCIMP expression in BMDCs prepared by culturing bone marrow cells in GM-CSF-containing medium is caused by the presence of GM-CSF or whether it is their intrinsic quality. To test this, we used another method of BMDC generation from bone marrow cells that employs Flt3L instead of GM-CSF. As Fig. 3B shows, SCIMP is expressed even in BMDCs differentiated by Flt3L, although it is still further up-regulated after GM-CSF exposure (Fig. 3B). Finally, to assess SCIMP expression in dendritic cells in vivo, we sorted classical dendritic cells from murine spleens and analyzed SCIMP expression in these cells by Western blotting. These results clearly showed the presence of SCIMP in primary DCs (Fig. 3C). From these results we can conclude that SCIMP is expressed in dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo and that its expression is enhanced by the presence of GM-CSF. Because of the strong SCIMP expression in BMDCs, we decided to search for its function in this cell type. Surprisingly, we observed only a marginal increase in SCIMP phosphorylation after MHCIIgp cross-linking on the surface of these cells (Fig. 4A). Thus we hypothesized that, in BMDCs, SCIMP acts downstream of a different receptor. Dectin-1 was a very good candidate because, similar to SCIMP, it is present in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it is up-regulated in the presence of GM-CSF. We used zymosan as a well established Dectin-1 activator. Zymosan is a preparation of small particles rich in the Dectin-1 ligand β-glucan, prepared from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26.Di Carlo F.J. Fiore J.V. et al.On the composition of zymosan.Science. 1958; 127: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Strikingly, treatment of BMDCs with zymosan resulted in a strong increase of SCIMP phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Moreover, SCIMP localized into zymosan-containing phagosomes and remained there for at least 30 min (Fig. 4C and supplemental Movie 1). SCIMP phosphorylation was very stable, with only a minor reduction during the 30-min experiment (Fig. 4D). A similar observation was also made with BMMFs (Fig. 4E). Dectin-1 signal transduction is initiated by Src family kinases and Syk (15.Brubaker S.W. Bonham K.S. Zanoni I. Kagan J.C. et al.Innate immune pattern recognition: a cell biological perspective.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33: 257-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). To test which kinases are responsible for SCIMP phosphorylation after zymosan treatment, we stimulated BMDCs with zymosan in the presence of specific inhibitors of Src family kinases and Syk. The results suggested that both Src family and Syk kinases are required for SCIMP phosphorylation after zymosan treatment because SCIMP phosphorylation was most profoundly reduced when both Src family kinase (PP2) and Syk (Syk inhibitor IV) inhibitors were combined (Fig. 5A). The composition of zymosan is relatively complex. In addition to β-glucan, it also contains mannans (ligands of Dectin-2) and TLR2 ligands (26.Di Carlo F.J. Fiore J.V. et al.On the composition of zymosan.Science. 1958; 127: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27.Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. et al.The Toll-like receptor 2 is recruited to macrophage phagosomes and discriminates between pathogens.Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). To confirm Dectin-1 involvement in the induction of SCIMP phosphorylation, we exploited the much stronger responsiveness of Dectin-1 to particulate β-glucan than to soluble β-glucan as a unique feature of this receptor. As a result, many aspects of Dectin-1 signaling after stimulation with particulate β-glucan can be inhibited by soluble forms of β-glucan (19.Goodridge H.S. Reyes C.N. Becker C.A. Katsumoto T.R. Ma J. Wolf A.J. Bose N. Chan A.S. Magee A.S. Danielson M.E. Weiss A. Vasilakos J.P. Underhill D.M. et al.Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a “phagocytic synapse.”.Nature. 2011; 472: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Thus, in the next experiment, we stimulated BMDCs with zymosan particles in the presence or absence of soluble β-glucan. Indeed, treatment with soluble β-glucan substantially inhibited SCIMP phosphorylation, whereas soluble mannan had no effect (Fig. 5B), suggesting that SCIMP is indeed a part of the Dectin-1 signaling pathway. To further support this conclusion, we investigated SCIMP phosphorylation in MyD88-deficient BMDCs, which have impaired function of multiple TLRs, including TLR2, the main TLR activated by zymosan (17.Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. et al.Collaborative induction of inflammatory responses by dectin-1 and Toll-like receptor 2.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 28.Takeuchi O. Kaufmann A. Grote K. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Morr M. Mühlradt P.F.

Trans. 2000; 28: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SCIMP phosphorylation was not affected by the disruption of TLR signaling (Fig. 5C). Based on these experiments, we concluded that Dectin-1 is responsible for inducing SCIMP phosphorylation after zymosan treatment. To test the functional significance of SCIMP in Dectin-1 signaling, we first measured ERK activation in zymosan-stimulated BMDCs because the ERK pathway was affected in the previous study of the SCIMP-deficient K46 B cell line (24.Draber P. Vonkova I. Stepanek O. Hrdinka M. Kucova M. Skopcova T. Otahal P. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Yeung M. Weiss A. Brdicka T. et al.SCIMP, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in major histocompatibility complex class II signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4550-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We stimulated BMDCs with zymosan for 30 min and followed ERK phosphorylation in the lysates prepared from these cells at various time points. Surprisingly, we could not detect any reproducible differences in ERK phosphorylation between wild-type and Scimp−/− BMDCs (Fig. 6A). Similar results were also obtained for p38 and JNK MAP kinases (Fig. 6A and data not shown). We also crossed Scimp−/− mice with a MyD88-deficient strain to avoid interference from the TLR pathways. However, even in MyD88-deficient BMDCs, no differences in signaling caused by SCIMP deficiency could be detected (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4D, SCIMP phosphorylation after zymosan activation was stable for at least 30 min. When we analyzed this further, we found that increased"

In this paper we propose a software project staffing model considering dynamic elements of staff productivity with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing (HC) based optimizer. Since a newly generated reschedule dramatically different from the initial schedule could cause an obvious shifting cost increase, our rescheduling strategies consider both efficiency and stability. The results of real world case studies and extensive simulation experiments show that our proposed method is effective and could achieve comparable performance to other heuristic algorithms in most cases."
https://openalex.org/W2419032088,"To determine the effectiveness of immunization strategies used in therapeutic antibody or vaccine development, it is critical to assess the quality of immunization-induced polyclonal antibody responses. Here, we developed a workflow that uses sensitive methods to quantitatively and qualitatively assess immune responses against foreign antigens with regard to antibody binding affinity and epitope diversity. The application of such detailed assessments throughout an immunization campaign can significantly reduce the resources required to generate highly specific antibodies. Our workflow consists of the following two steps: 1) the use of surface plasmon resonance to quantify antigen-specific antibodies and evaluate their apparent binding affinities, and 2) the recovery of serum IgGs using an automated small scale purification system, followed by the determination of their epitope diversity using hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry. We showed that these methods were sensitive enough to detect antigen-specific IgGs in the nanogram/μl range and that they provided information for differentiating the antibody responses of the various immunized animals that could not be obtained by conventional methods. We also showed that this workflow can guide the selection of an animal that produces high affinity antibodies with a desired epitope coverage profile, resulting in the generation of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibody clones with desirable functional profiles. We postulate that this workflow will be an important tool in the development of effective vaccines to combat the highly sophisticated evasion mechanisms of pathogens."

Here, we found that the mbfA strain grown in elevated iron media (100 μM) became resistant to those treatments, suggesting a stress response adaptation. The bfr gene encodes the iron storage protein bacterioferritin, and its expression is derepressed by iron. An mbfA bfr double mutant showed a loss of stress adaptation, and had a severe growth phenotype in high iron media. Moreover, a bfrup allele in which bfr is constitutively derepressed conferred stress tolerance on an mbfA mutant without elevating the iron content in the growth media. The intracellular iron content of the mbfA bfr double mutant was substantially higher than that found in the wild type, even when grown in relatively low iron media (5 μM). Under that condition, iron-responsive gene expression was aberrant in the mbfA bfr strain. Moreover, the double mutant was sensitive to the iron-activated antibiotic streptonigrin. We conclude that MbfA and Bfr work in concert to manage iron and oxidative stresses. In addition, the need for iron detoxification is not limited to extreme environments, but is also required for normal cellular function."

All three genes are expressed during cultivation. At least two of the V. arvi JG-B58 S-layer proteins were visualized on the surface of living cells via atomic force microscopy (AFM). These S-layer proteins form a double layer with p4 symmetry. The S-layer proteins were isolated from the cells using two different methods. Purified S-layer proteins were recrystallized on SiO2 substrates in order to study the structure of the arrays and self-assembling properties. The primary structure of all examined S-layer proteins lack some features that are typical for Bacillus or Lysinibacillus S-layers. For example, they possess no SLH domains that are usually responsible for the anchoring of the proteins to the cell wall. Further, the pI values are relatively high ranging from 7.84 to 9.25 for the matured proteins. Such features are typical for S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus species although sequence comparisons indicate a close relationship to S-layer proteins of Lysinibacillus and Bacillus strains. In comparison to the numerous descriptions of S-layers, there are only a few studies reporting the concomitant existence of two different S-layer proteins on cell surfaces. Together with the genomic data, this is the first description of a novel type of S-layer proteins showing features of Lactobacillus as well as of Bacillus-type S-layer proteins and the first study of the cell envelope of Viridibacillus arvi."

This process can be done manually or automated by the use of image processing computer packages. Atlas-based segmentation automates this process by the use of a pre-labelled template and a registration algorithm. We developed an ovine brain atlas that can be used as a model for neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and focal epilepsy. 17 female Corriedale ovine brains were imaged in-vivo in a 1.5T (low-resolution) MRI scanner. 13 of the low-resolution images were combined using a template construction algorithm to form a low-resolution template. The template was labelled to form an atlas and tested by comparing manual with atlas-based segmentations against the remaining four low-resolution images. The comparisons were in the form of similarity metrics used in previous segmentation research. Dice Similarity Coefficients were utilised to determine the degree of overlap between eight independent, manual and atlas-based segmentations, with values ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap). For 7 of these 8 segmented areas, we achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5–0.8. The amygdala was difficult to segment due to its variable location and similar intensity to surrounding tissues resulting in Dice Coefficients of 0.0–0.2. We developed a low resolution ovine brain atlas with eight clinically relevant areas labelled. This brain atlas performed comparably to prior human atlases described in the literature and to intra-observer error providing an atlas that can be used to guide further research using ovine brains as a model and is hosted online for public access."

Methods Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011 were used for the present epidemiologic study. A total of 19,178 participants aged ≥ 30 years were evaluated for blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and performed ophthalmic slit lamp examinations. Pterygium was considered as a growth of fibrovascular tissue over the cornea. Results The average blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 18.6 ng/mL, and prevalence of pterygium was 6.5%. The odds of pterygium significantly increased across blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D quintiles after controlling sun exposure time as well as other confounders such as sex, age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension (P < 0.001). The odds ratios (OR) for pterygium was 1.51 (95% Confidence Interval[95%CI]; 1.19–1.92) in the highest blood vitamin D quintile. Stratified analysis by sex showed a positive association between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and pterygium in both men (quintile 5 versus 1, OR; 1.68, 95%CI; 1.19–2.37) and women (quintile 5 versus 1, OR; 1.37, 95% CI; 1.00–1.88).

https://openalex.org/W2415889765,"Background Levels of gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are high; health services for survivors are limited. Evidence from the few existing health services for survivors can inform improvements in care in this and similar settings. Methods Médecins Sans Frontières supported health services for survivors in Lae, PNG from 2008–2013. Routine monitoring data from August 2010-April 2013 were used to describe patient and service characteristics. Results 5,892 individuals received care over 6,860 presentations, the majority self-referred or referred by friends and family. Presentations were attributed to intimate partner violence(62%), non-partner sexual violence(15%), other forms of violence(3%), and past (but not current) violence(21%). 97% were female; an estimated 4.9% (95%CI:4.8–5.0%) of females resident in the catchment area presented to the programme during the 2.8years analysed. Of presentations for non-partner sexual violence, 79% knew their abuser and 50% were children <16 years. 92% of presentations reporting current violence received medical treatment for injuries. The majority of patients who received multiple counselling sessions reported improved functioning and decreased severity of psycho-social complaints. Conclusions Community awareness of the availability of free, best-practice, accessible, confidential medical and counselling services for sexual and gender-based violence in Lae, PNG resulted in many survivors presenting for care. High levels of ongoing intimate partner violence and child sexual abuse by known abusers indicates that alongside comprehensive medical care, access to effective services in non-health sectors such as policing, protection and legal services are needed if survivors are to escape the cycle of violence."

EGFR was significantly increased in the epithelium with basal cell hyperplasia from GC-naïve NPs (78%, 31/40) compared to controls (23%, 4/17). EGFR was also found in some degranulating goblet cells. ERBB4 expression was significantly higher in hyperplastic epithelium from GC-naïve NPs (65%, 26/40) than in controls (6%, 1/17). GC treatment restored the EGF expression and normalized the EGFR and ERBB4 expression in NPs. Differential expression patterns of EGF, EGFR, and ERBB4 are essential in epithelial restitution and remodeling in nasal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2416963610,"Background Allogeneic human islet transplantation is an effective therapy for the treatment of patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The low number of islet transplants performed worldwide and the different transplantation protocols used limit the identification of the most effective therapeutic options to improve the efficacy of this approach. Methods We present a retrospective analysis on the data collected from 44 patients with T1D who underwent islet transplantation at our institute between 2000 and 2007. Several variables were included: recipient demographics and immunological characteristics, donor and transplant characteristics, induction protocols, and additional medical treatment received. Immunosuppression was induced with anti-CD25 (Daclizumab), alone or in association with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatments (Etanercept or Infliximab), or with anti-CD52 (Alemtuzumab) in association with anti-TNF-α treatments (Etanercept or Infliximab). Subsets of patients were treated with Filgrastim for moderate/severe neutropenia and/or Exenatide for post prandial hyperglycemia. Results The analysis performed indicates a negative association between graft survival (c-peptide level ≥ 0.3 ng/ml) and islet infusion volume, with the caveat that, the progressive reduction of infusion volumes over the years has been paralleled by improved immunosuppressive protocols. A positive association is instead suggested between graft survival and administration of Exenatide and Filgrastim, alone or in combination. Conclusion This retrospective analysis may be of assistance to further improve long-term outcomes of protocols for transplant of islets and other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2419426939,"This paper presents a machine learning based approach for analyses of photos collected from laboratory experiments conducted to assess the potential impact of water-based drill cuttings on deep-water rhodolith-forming calcareous algae. This pilot study uses imaging technology to quantify and monitor the stress levels of the calcareous algae Mesophyllum engelhartii (Foslie) Adey caused by various degrees of light exposure, flow intensity and amount of sediment. A machine learning based algorithm was applied to assess the temporal variation of the calcareous algae size (∼ mass) and color automatically. Measured size and color were correlated to the photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield of charge separation in photosystem II, ) and degree of sediment coverage using multivariate regression. The multivariate regression showed correlations between time and calcareous algae sizes, as well as correlations between fluorescence and calcareous algae colors."
https://openalex.org/W2410173266,"Background The incidence of post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) in developed countries has decreased over the last 50 years. Here we identified the trends of the incidence of PIGN in Japan during the past four decades. Methods We explored the frequency, clinicopathological findings, and prognosis of PIGN based on 6,369 cases from the Renal Biopsy Database of our institute in the Kanto region of Japan, diagnosed histologically from 1976 to 2009. Results The numbers of PIGN cases were 131 (2.1%) in total, and 2.4%, 1.1%, 2.6% and 2.1% identified in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively. Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), including post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), accounted for almost all of the PIGN cases in the 1970s, but decreased to approx. 40%–50% since the 1990s. In the 1990s, Staphylococcus aureus infection-related nephritis (SARN) showed a rapid increase in rate, reaching 30%. The incidence of hepatitis C virus infection-associated GN (HCVGN) has increased since the 1990s. The average age at onset rose from 33 to 51 years over the study period. These transitions can be summarized as increases in SARN and HCVGN and decreases in PSGN and other types of AGN, since SARN and HCVGN have older onsets compared to PSGN and other AGN types. The clinicopathological features were marked for each PIGN. Regarding the prognosis, the renal death rates of both the SARN and HCVGN groups were significantly higher than those of other PIGN. Conclusion Based on our analysis of the Renal Biopsy Database, the incidence of PIGN in Japan reached its peak in the 1990s. The temporal changes in the incidence of PIGN reflected the trends in infectious diseases of each decade and the continual aging of the population, with a related higher susceptibility to infections."
https://openalex.org/W2415629623,"Most metazoan parasites that invade vertebrate hosts belong to three phyla: Platyhelminthes, Nematoda and Acanthocephala. Many of the parasitic members of these phyla are collectively known as helminths and are causative agents of many debilitating, deforming and lethal diseases of humans and animals. The North-East India Helminth Parasite Information Database (NEIHPID) project aimed to document and characterise the spectrum of helminth parasites in the north-eastern region of India, providing host, geographical distribution, diagnostic characters and image data. The morphology-based taxonomic data are supplemented with information on DNA sequences of nuclear, ribosomal and mitochondrial gene marker regions that aid in parasite identification. In addition, the database contains raw next generation sequencing (NGS) data for 3 foodborne trematode parasites, with more to follow. The database will also provide study material for students interested in parasite biology. Users can search the database at various taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, superfamily, family, genus, and species), or by host, habitat and geographical location. Specimen collection locations are noted as co-ordinates in a MySQL database and can be viewed on Google maps, using Google Maps JavaScript API v3. The NEIHPID database has been made freely available at http://nepiac.nehu.ac.in/index.php."
https://openalex.org/W2417693743,"A higher photosynthesis and lower energetic cost are recognized as important characteristics for invasive species, but whether these traits are also important for the ability of alien mangrove species to become invasive has seldom been reported. A microcosm study was conducted to compare the photosynthetic characteristics, energetic cost indices and other growth traits between two alien species (Sonneratia apetala and S. caseolaris) and four native mangrove species over four seasons in a subtropical mangrove nature reserve in Shenzhen, South China. The aim of the study was to evaluate the invasive potential of Sonneratia based on these physiological responses. The annual average net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and total carbon assimilation per unit leaf area (Atotal) of the two alien Sonneratia species were significantly higher than the values of the native mangroves. In contrast, the opposite results were obtained for the leaf construction cost (CC) per unit dry mass (CCM) and CC per unit area (CCA) values. The higher Atotal and lower CC values resulted in a 72% higher photosynthetic energy-use efficiency (PEUE) for Sonneratia compared to native mangroves, leading to a higher relative growth rate (RGR) of the biomass and height of Sonneratia with the respective values being 51% and 119% higher than those of the native species. Higher photosynthetic indices for Sonneratia compared to native species were found in all seasons except winter, whereas lower CC values were found in all four seasons. The present findings reveal that alien Sonneratia species may adapt well and become invasive in subtropical mangrove wetlands in Shenzhen due to their higher photosynthetic characteristics coupled with lower costs in energy use, leading to a higher PEUE. The comparison of these physiological responses between S. apetala and S. caseolaris reveal that the former species is more invasive than the latter one, thus requiring more attention in future."
https://openalex.org/W2410053722,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a known risk factor for lower urinary tract symptoms. This study investigates whether functional and expression changes of cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are involved in the bladder dysfunction in an obese rat model with insulin resistance. Bladder samples from obese Zucker rat (OZR) and their respective controls lean Zucker rat (LZR) were processed for immunohistochemistry and western blot for studying the cannabinoid receptors expression. Detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) strips from LZR and OZR were also mounted in myographs for isometric force recordings. Neuronal and smooth muscle CB1 and CB2 receptor expression and the nerve fiber density was diminished in the OZR bladder. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) and acetylcholine (ACh) induced frequency- and concentration-dependent contractions of LZR and OZR DSM. ACh contractile responses were similar in LZR and OZR. EFS-elicited contractions, however, were reduced in OZR bladder. Cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists failed to modify the DSM basal tension in LZR and OZR In LZR bladder, EFS responses were inhibited by ACEA and SER-601, CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists, respectively, these effects being reversed by ACEA plus the CB1 antagonist, AM-251 or SER-601 plus the CB2 antagonist, AM-630. In OZR bladder, the inhibitory action of ACEA on nerve-evoked contractions was diminished, whereas that SER-601 did not change EFS responses. These results suggest that a diminished function and expression of neuronal cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, as well as a lower nerve fiber density is involved in the impaired excitatory neurotransmission of the urinary bladder from the OZR."
