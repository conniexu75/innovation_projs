https://openalex.org/W1973847028,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by either translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. MicroRNAs play pivotal roles in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, including TLR-triggered inflammatory response. Here we reported that the expression of microRNA-223 (miR-223) was significantly decreased in murine macrophages during activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or poly (I∶C) stimulation. The inducible miR-223 down-regulation resulted in the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is directly targeted by miR-223, thus promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β, but not TNF-α. Interestingly, IL-6 was found to be a main factor in inducing the decrease in miR-223 expression after LPS stimulation, which formed a positive feedback loop to regulate IL-6 and IL-1β. Herein, our findings provide a new explanation characterizing the molecular mechanism responsible for the regulation of IL-6 production after TLR-triggered macrophage activation."
https://openalex.org/W2104950321,"Introduction In the era of malaria elimination and eradication, drug-based and vaccine-based approaches to reduce malaria transmission are receiving greater attention. Such interventions require assays that reliably measure the transmission of Plasmodium from humans to Anopheles mosquitoes. Methods We compared two commonly used mosquito feeding assay procedures: direct skin feeding assays and membrane feeding assays. Three conditions under which membrane feeding assays are performed were examined: assays with i) whole blood, ii) blood pellets resuspended with autologous plasma of the gametocyte carrier, and iii) blood pellets resuspended with heterologous control serum. Results 930 transmission experiments from Cameroon, The Gambia, Mali and Senegal were included in the analyses. Direct skin feeding assays resulted in higher mosquito infection rates compared to membrane feeding assays (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.94–2.95) with evident heterogeneity between studies. Mosquito infection rates in membrane feeding assays and direct skin feeding assays were strongly correlated (p<0.0001). Replacing the plasma of the gametocyte donor with malaria naïve control serum resulted in higher mosquito infection rates compared to own plasma (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.68–2.19) while the infectiousness of gametocytes may be reduced during the replacement procedure (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.52–0.70). Conclusions Despite a higher efficiency of direct skin feeding assays, membrane feeding assays appear suitable tools to compare the infectiousness between individuals and to evaluate transmission-reducing interventions. Several aspects of membrane feeding procedures currently lack standardization; this variability makes comparisons between laboratories challenging and should be addressed to facilitate future testing of transmission-reducing interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1967782781,"Ionizing radiation-induced oxidative stress is attributed to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to radiolysis of water molecules and is short lived. Persistent oxidative stress has also been observed after radiation exposure and is implicated in the late effects of radiation. The goal of this study was to determine if long-term oxidative stress in freshly isolated mouse intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) is dependent on radiation quality at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy. Mice (C57BL/6J; 6 to 8 weeks; female) were irradiated with 2 Gy of γ-rays, a low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, and intestinal tissues and IEC were collected 1 year after radiation exposure. Intracellular ROS, mitochondrial function, and antioxidant activity in IEC were studied by flow cytometry and biochemical assays. Oxidative DNA damage, cell death, and mitogenic activity in IEC were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Effects of γ radiation were compared to (56)Fe radiation (iso-toxic dose: 1.6 Gy; energy: 1000 MeV/nucleon; LET: 148 keV/µm), we used as representative of high-LET radiation, since it's one of the important sources of high Z and high energy (HZE) radiation in cosmic rays. Radiation quality affected the level of persistent oxidative stress with higher elevation of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide in high-LET (56)Fe radiation compared to unirradiated controls and γ radiation. NADPH oxidase activity, mitochondrial membrane damage, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were greater in (56)Fe-irradiated mice. Compared to γ radiation oxidative DNA damage was higher, cell death ratio was unchanged, and mitotic activity was increased after (56)Fe radiation. Taken together our results indicate that long-term functional dysregulation of mitochondria and increased NADPH oxidase activity are major contributing factors towards heavy ion radiation-induced persistent oxidative stress in IEC with potential for neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1963570368,"Environmental exposure to food sources may underpin area level differences in individual risk for overweight. Place of residence is generally used to assess neighbourhood exposure. Yet, because people are mobile, multiple exposures should be accounted for to assess the relation between food environments and overweight. Unfortunately, mobility data is often missing from health surveys. We hereby test the feasibility of linking travel survey data with food listings to derive food store exposure predictors of overweight among health survey participants.Food environment exposure measures accounting for non-residential activity places (activity spaces) were computed and modelled in Montreal and Quebec City, Canada, using travel surveys and food store listings. Models were then used to predict activity space food exposures for 5,578 participants of the Canadian Community Health Survey. These food exposure estimates, accounting for daily mobility, were used to model self-reported overweight in a multilevel framework. Median Odd Ratios were used to assess the proportion of between-neighborhood variance explained by such food exposure predictors.Estimates of food environment exposure accounting for both residential and non-residential destinations were significantly and more strongly associated with overweight than residential-only measures of exposure for men. For women, residential exposures were more strongly associated with overweight than non-residential exposures. In Montreal, adjusted models showed men in the highest quartile of exposure to food stores were at lesser risk of being overweight considering exposure to restaurants (OR = 0.36 [0.21-0.62]), fast food outlets (0.48 [0.30-0.79]), or corner stores (0.52 [0.35-0.78]). Conversely, men experiencing the highest proportion of restaurants being fast-food outlets were at higher risk of being overweight (2.07 [1.25-3.42]). Women experiencing higher residential exposures were at lower risk of overweight.Using residential neighbourhood food exposure measures may underestimate true exposure and observed associations. Using mobility data offers potential for deriving activity space exposure estimates in epidemiological models."
https://openalex.org/W2074324898,"Background Cholesterol management drugs known as statins are widely used and often well tolerated; however, a variety of muscle-related side effects can arise. These adverse events (AEs) can have serious impact, and form a significant barrier to therapy adherence. Surveillance of post-marketing AEs is of vital importance to understand real-world AEs and reporting differences between individual statin drugs. We conducted a review of post-approval muscle and tendon AE reports in association with statin use, to assess differences within the drug class. Methods We analyzed all case reports from the FDA AE Reporting System (AERS) database linking muscle-related AEs to statin use (07/01/2005–03/31/2011). Drugs examined were: atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin. Results Relative risk rates for rosuvastatin were consistently higher than other statins. Atorvastatin and simvastatin showed intermediate risks, while pravastatin and lovastatin appeared to have the lowest risk rates. Relative risk of muscle-related AEs, therefore, approximately tracked with per milligram LDL-lowering potency, with fluvastatin an apparent exception. Incorporating all muscle categories, rates for atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin were, respectively, 55%, 26%, 17%, and 7.5% as high, as rosuvastatin, approximately tracking per milligram potency (Rosuvastatin>Atorvastatin>Simvastatin>Pravastatin≈Lovastatin) and comporting with findings of other studies. Relative potency, therefore, appears to be a fundamental predictor of muscle-related AE risk, with fluvastatin, the least potent statin, an apparent exception (risk 74% vs rosuvastatin). Interpretation AE reporting rates differed strikingly for drugs within the statin class, with relative reporting aligning substantially with potency. The data presented in this report offer important reference points for the selection of statins for cholesterol management in general and, especially, for the rechallenge of patients who have experienced muscle-related AEs (for whom agents of lower expected potency should be preferred)."
https://openalex.org/W2001391676,"The hormone, relaxin, inhibits aberrant myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition by disrupting the TGF-β1/Smad2 axis, via its cognate receptor, Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 (RXFP1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) and a neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS)-NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent pathway. However, the signalling pathways involved in its additional ability to increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity remain unknown. This study investigated the extent to which the NO pathway was involved in human gene-2 (H2) relaxin's ability to positively regulate MMP-1 and its rodent orthologue, MMP-13, MMP-2 and MMP-9 (the main collagen-degrading MMPs) in TGF-β1-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts and primary renal myofibroblasts isolated from injured rats; by gelatin zymography (media) and Western blotting (cell layer). H2 relaxin (10-100 ng/ml) significantly increased MMP-1 (by ~50%), MMP-2 (by ~80%) and MMP-9 (by ~80%) in TGF-β1-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts; and MMP-13 (by ~90%), MMP-2 (by ~130%) and MMP-9 (by ~115%) in rat renal myofibroblasts (all p<0.01 vs untreated cells) over 72 hours. The relaxin-induced up-regulation of these MMPs, however, was significantly blocked by a non-selective NOS inhibitor (L-nitroarginine methyl ester (hydrochloride); L-NAME; 75-100 µM), and specific inhibitors to nNOS (N-propyl-L-arginine; NPLA; 0.2-2 µM), iNOS (1400W; 0.5-1 µM) and guanylyl cyclase (ODQ; 5 µM) (all p<0.05 vs H2 relaxin alone), but not eNOS (L-N-(1-iminoethyl)ornithine dihydrochloride; L-NIO; 0.5-5 µM). However, neither of these inhibitors affected basal MMP expression at the concentrations used. Furthermore, of the NOS isoforms expressed in renal myofibroblasts (nNOS and iNOS), H2 relaxin only stimulated nNOS expression, which in turn, was blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059; 1 µM). These findings demonstrated that H2 relaxin signals through a RXFP1-pERK-nNOS-NO-cGMP-dependent pathway to mediate its anti-fibrotic actions, and additionally signals through iNOS to up-regulate MMPs; the latter being suppressed by TGF-β1 in myofibroblasts, but released upon H2 relaxin-induced inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad2 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2031570851,"Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol found in various plants, especially in the skin of red grapes. The effect of resveratrol on human health is the topic of numerous studies. In fact this molecule has shown anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, blood-sugar-lowering ability and beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, for many polyphenol compounds of natural origin bioavailability is limited by low solubility in biological fluids, as well as by rapid metabolization in vivo. Therefore, appropriate carriers are required to obtain efficient therapeutics along with low administration doses. Liposomes are excellent candidates for drug delivery purposes, due to their biocompatibility, wide choice of physico-chemical properties and easy preparation. In this paper liposome formulations made by a saturated phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) and cholesterol (or its positively charged derivative DC-CHOL) were chosen to optimize the loading of a rigid hydrophobic molecule such as resveratrol. Plain and resveratrol loaded liposomes were characterized for size, surface charge and structural details by complementary techniques, i.e. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta potential and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Nuclear and Electron Spin magnetic resonances (NMR and ESR, respectively) were also used to gain information at the molecular scale. The obtained results allowed to give an account of loaded liposomes in which resveratrol interacted with the bilayer, being more deeply inserted in cationic liposomes than in zwitterionic liposomes. Relevant properties such as the mean size and the presence of oligolamellar structures were influenced by the loading of RESV guest molecules. The toxicity of all these systems was tested on stabilized cell lines (mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 and human astrocytes U373-MG), showing that cell viability was not affected by the administration of liposomial resveratrol."
https://openalex.org/W2002601103,"Large-scale collective behaviors such as synchronization and coordination spontaneously arise in many bacterial populations. With systems biology attempting to understand these phenomena, and synthetic biology opening up the possibility of engineering them for our own benefit, there is growing interest in how bacterial populations are best modeled. Here we introduce BSim, a highly flexible agent-based computational tool for analyzing the relationships between single-cell dynamics and population level features. BSim includes reference implementations of many bacterial traits to enable the quick development of new models partially built from existing ones. Unlike existing modeling tools, BSim fully considers spatial aspects of a model allowing for the description of intricate micro-scale structures, enabling the modeling of bacterial behavior in more realistic three-dimensional, complex environments. The new opportunities that BSim opens are illustrated through several diverse examples covering: spatial multicellular computing, modeling complex environments, population dynamics of the lac operon, and the synchronization of genetic oscillators. BSim is open source software that is freely available from http://bsim-bccs.sf.net and distributed under the Open Source Initiative (OSI) recognized MIT license. Developer documentation and a wide range of example simulations are also available from the website. BSim requires Java version 1.6 or higher."
https://openalex.org/W2050996088,"Even though the disruption of axonal transport is an important pathophysiological factor in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationship between disruption of axonal transport and pathogenesis of AD is poorly understood. Considering that α-tubulin acetylation is an important factor in axonal transport and that Aβ impairs mitochondrial axonal transport, we manipulated the level of α-tubulin acetylation in hippocampal neurons with Aβ cultured in a microfluidic system and examined its effect on mitochondrial axonal transport. We found that inhibiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which deacetylates α-tubulin, significantly restored the velocity and motility of the mitochondria in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transports, which would be otherwise compromised by Aβ. The inhibition of HDAC6 also recovered the length of the mitochondria that had been shortened by Aβ to a normal level. These results suggest that the inhibition of HDAC6 significantly rescues hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced impairment of mitochondrial axonal transport as well as mitochondrial length. The results presented in this paper identify HDAC6 as an important regulator of mitochondrial transport as well as elongation and, thus, a potential target whose pharmacological inhibition contributes to improving mitochondrial dynamics in Aβ treated neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1978649137,"Resveratrol, an activator of histone deacetylase Sirt-1, has been proposed to have beneficial health effects due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol and the intracellular signaling pathways involved are poorly understood. An in vitro model of human tenocytes was used to examine the mechanism of resveratrol action on IL-1β-mediated inflammatory signaling. Resveratrol suppressed IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and PI3K in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with resveratrol enhanced the production of matrix components collagen types I and III, tenomodulin, and tenogenic transcription factor scleraxis, whereas it inhibited gene products involved in inflammation and apoptosis. IL-1β-induced NF-κB and PI3K activation was inhibited by resveratrol or the inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin), c-Src (PP1), and Akt (SH-5) through inhibition of IκB kinase, IκBα phosphorylation, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suggesting that PI3K signaling pathway may be one of the signaling pathways inhibited by resveratrol to abrogate NF-κB activation. Inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin attenuated IL-1β-induced Akt and p65 acetylation, suggesting that p65 is a downstream component of PI3K/Akt in these responses. The modulatory effects of resveratrol on IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and PI3K were found to be mediated at least in part by the association between Sirt-1 and scleraxis and deacetylation of NF-κB and PI3K. Overall, these results demonstrate that activated Sirt-1 plays an essential role in the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol and this may be mediated at least in part through inhibition/deacetylation of PI3K and NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2059841695,"IL-12 family cytokines are important in host immunity. Whereas some members (IL-12, IL-23) play crucial roles in pathogenesis of organ-specific autoimmune diseases by inducing the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, others (IL-27 and IL-35) suppress inflammatory responses and limit tissue injury induced by these T cell subsets. In this study, we have genetically engineered a novel IL27p28/IL12p40 heterodimeric cytokine (p28/p40) that antagonizes signaling downstream of the gp130 receptor. We investigated whether p28/p40 can be used to ameliorate uveitis, a CNS inflammatory disease. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is the mouse model of human uveitis and is mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells. We show here that p28/p40 suppressed EAU by inhibiting the differentiation and inflammatory responses of Th1 and Th17 cells while promoting expansion of IL-10(+)- and Foxp3(+)-expressing regulatory T cells. Lymph node cells from mice treated with p28/p40 blocked adoptive transfer of EAU to naïve syngeneic mice by immunopathogenic T cells and suppressive effects of p28/p40 derived in part from antagonizing STAT1 and STAT3 pathways induced by IL-27 and IL-6. Interestingly, IL27p28 also suppressed EAU, but to a lesser extent than p28/p40. The inhibition of uveitogenic lymphocyte proliferation and suppression of EAU by p28/p40 and IL27p28 establish efficacy of single chain and heterodimeric IL-12 family cytokines in treatment of a CNS autoimmune disease. Creation of the biologically active p28/p40 heterodimeric cytokine represents an important proof-of-concept experiment, suggesting that cytokines comprising unique IL-12 α- and β-subunit pairing may exist in nature and may constitute a new class of therapeutic cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1976101319,"Cancer stem cells are distinguished from normal adult stem cells by their stemness without tissue homeostasis control. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), particularly globo-series GSLs, are important markers of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, but little is known about whether or not ceramide glycosylation, which controls glycosphingolipid synthesis, plays a role in modulating stem cells. Here, we report that ceramide glycosylation catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase, which is enhanced in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) but not in normal mammary epithelial stem cells, maintains tumorous pluripotency of BCSCs. Enhanced ceramide glycosylation and globotriosylceramide (Gb3) correlate well with the numbers of BCSCs in breast cancer cell lines. In BCSCs sorted with CD44(+)/ESA(+)/CD24(-) markers, Gb3 activates c-Src/β-catenin signaling and up-regulates the expression of FGF-2, CD44, and Oct-4 enriching tumorigenesis. Conversely, silencing glucosylceramide synthase expression disrupts Gb3 synthesis and selectively kills BCSCs through deactivation of c-Src/β-catenin signaling. These findings highlight the unexploited role of ceramide glycosylation in selectively maintaining the tumorous pluripotency of cancer stem cells. It speculates that disruption of ceramide glycosylation or globo-series GSL is a useful approach to specifically target BCSCs specifically."
https://openalex.org/W1970463288,"Class-3 semaphorins are secreted axon guidance factors. Some of these semaphorins have recently been characterized as suppressors of tumor progression. To determine if class-3 semaphorins can be used to inhibit the development of glioblastoma-multiforme tumors, we expressed recombinant sema-3A, 3B, 3D, 3E, 3F or 3G in U87MG glioblastoma cells. Sema3A and sema3B expressing cells contracted and changed shape persistently while cells expressing other semaphorins did not. Sema3A and sema3F differed from other semaphorins including sema3B as they also inhibited the proliferation of the cells and the formation of soft agar colonies. With the exception of sema3G and sema3B, expression of these semaphorins in U87MG cells inhibited significantly tumor development from subcutaneously implanted cells. Strong inhibition of tumor development was also observed following implantation of U87MG cells expressing each of the class-3 semaphorins in the cortex of mouse brains. Sema3D and sema3E displayed the strongest inhibitory effects and their expression in U373MG or in U87MG glioblastoma cells implanted in the brains of mice prolonged the survival of the mice by more then two folds. Furthermore, most of the mice that died prior to the end of the experiment did not develop detectable tumors and many of the mice survived to the end of the experiment. Most of the semaphorins that we have used here with the exception of sema3D were characterized previously as inhibitors of angiogenesis. Our results indicate that sema3D also functions as an inhibitor of angiogenesis and suggest that the anti-tumorigenic effects are due primarily to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. These results indicate that class-3 semaphorins such as sema3D and sema3E could perhaps be used to treat glioblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030277241,"Emerging evidence suggests that fast-spiking (FS) interneurons are disrupted in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. FS cells, which are the primary source of synaptic inhibition, are critical for temporally organizing brain activity, regulating brain maturation, and modulating critical developmental periods in multiple cortical systems. Reduced expression of parvalbumin, a marker of mature FS cells, has been reported in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and in mouse models of schizophrenia and autism. Although these results suggest that FS cells may be immature in neuropsychiatric disease, this possibility had not previously been formally assessed.This study used time-course global expression data from developing FS cells to create a maturation index that tracked with the developmental age of purified cortical FS cells. The FS cell maturation index was then applied to global gene expression data from human cortex to estimate the maturity of the FS cell developmental program in the context of various disease states. Specificity of the index for FS cells was supported by a highly significant correlation of maturation index measurements with parvalbumin expression levels that withstood correction for multiple covariates.Results suggest the FS cell developmental gene expression program is immature in autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. More broadly, the current study indicates that cell-type specific maturation indices can be used to measure the maturity of developmental programs even in data from mixed cell types such as those found in brain homogenates."

https://openalex.org/W1988695364,"Next-generation sequencing technologies are rapidly transforming molecular systematic studies of non-model animal taxa. The arachnid order Opiliones (commonly known as ""harvestmen"") includes more than 6,400 described species placed into four well-supported lineages (suborders). Fossil plus molecular clock evidence indicates that these lineages were diverging in the late Silurian to mid-Carboniferous, with some fossil harvestmen representing the earliest known land animals. Perhaps because of this ancient divergence, phylogenetic resolution of subordinal interrelationships within Opiliones has been difficult. We present the first phylogenomics analysis for harvestmen, derived from comparative RNA-Seq data for eight species representing all suborders. Over 30 gigabases of original Illumina short-read data were used in de novo assemblies, resulting in 50-80,000 transcripts per taxon. Transcripts were compared to published scorpion and tick genomics data, and a stringent filtering process was used to identify over 350 putatively single-copy, orthologous protein-coding genes shared among taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using various partitioning strategies, data coding schemes, and analytical methods overwhelmingly support the ""classical"" hypothesis of Opiliones relationships, including the higher-level clades Palpatores and Phalangida. Relaxed molecular clock analyses using multiple alternative fossil calibration strategies corroborate ancient divergences within Opiliones that are possibly deeper than the recorded fossil record indicates. The assembled data matrices, comprising genes that are conserved, highly expressed, and varying in length and phylogenetic informativeness, represent an important resource for future molecular systematic studies of Opiliones and other arachnid groups."
https://openalex.org/W2056247732,"Antimicrobial consumption is one of the major contributing factors facilitating the development and maintenance of bacteria exhibiting antimicrobial resistance. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, such as the qnr family, can be horizontally transferred and contribute to reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. We performed an observational study, investigating the copy number of PMQR after antimicrobial therapy. We enrolled 300 children resident in Ho Chi Minh City receiving antimicrobial therapy for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). Rectal swabs were taken on enrollment and seven days subsequently, counts for Enterobacteriaceae were performed and qnrA, qnrB and qnrS were quantified by using real-time PCR on metagenomic stool DNA. On enrollment, we found no association between age, gender or location of the participants and the prevalence of qnrA, qnrB or qnrS. Yet, all three loci demonstrated a proportional increase in the number of samples testing positive between day 0 and day 7. Furthermore, qnrB demonstrated a significant increase in copy number between paired samples (p<0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum), associated with non-fluoroquinolone combination antimicrobial therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing an association between the use of non-fluoroquinolone antimicrobials and the increasing relative prevalence and quantity of qnr genes. Our work outlines a potential mechanism for the selection and maintenance of PMQR genes and predicts a strong effect of co-selection of these resistance determinants through the use of unrelated and potentially unnecessary antimicrobial regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2115615435,"Species delimitation and species concepts have been a matter of debate among biodiversity researchers in the last decades, resulting in integrative taxonomy approaches and the use of modern species concepts, such as the phylogenetic, evolutionary or general lineage species concepts. The discussion of subspecies status and concepts has been addressed much less extensively, with some researchers completely refraining from recognizing subspecies. However, allopatric insular populations that are particularly differentiated have traditionally been assigned subspecies status. We studied the molecular phylogeny and morphology of endemic Comoran tree snakes of the genus Lycodryas. Taking an integrative taxonomic approach, we used the concept of independent lines of evidence to discriminate between evidence for specific and subspecific status. Molecular (mtDNA) and morphological data provided sufficient evidence to support four different taxa within Comoran Lycodryas. In a revision of this group, we propose two species, each with two subspecies. We present a discussion of the strong sexual dichromatism unique to Comoran Lycodryas within the genus and related genera that may be explained by sexual selection in combination with the absence of major predators. Then, we discuss the effects of insular evolution and the ""island rule"" on morphological traits in Comoran Lycodryas and in Liophidium mayottensis, another snake endemic to the Comoros. The absence of larger-bodied snakes may have promoted an increase in body size and the number of dorsal scale rows in these species. Finally, we discuss the subspecies concept, its applications and its significance for integrative taxonomy and for limiting taxonomic inflation. We emphasize that taxon descriptions should be based on an integrative approach using several lines of evidence, preferably in combination with statements on the underlying species concepts or operational criteria, to increase the objectivity and comparability of descriptions."
https://openalex.org/W2001847353,"Background Resistance of pandemic A(H1N1)2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) has remained limited. A new mutation I223R in the neuraminidase (NA) of H1N1pdm09 virus has been reported along with H275Y in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of I223R on oseltamivir and zanamivir susceptibility. Methods The NA enzymatic characteristics and susceptibility to NAIs of viruses harbouring the mutations I223R and H275Y alone or in combination were analyzed on viruses produced by reverse genetics and on clinical isolates collected from an immunocompromised patient with sustained influenza H1N1pdm09 virus shedding and treated by oseltamivir (days 0–15) and zanamivir (days 15–25 and 70–80). Results Compared with the wild type, the NA of recombinant viruses and clinical isolates with H275Y or I223R mutations had about two-fold reduced affinity for the substrate. The H275Y and I223R isolates showed decreased susceptibility to oseltamivir (246-fold) and oseltamivir and zanamivir (8.9- and 4.9-fold), respectively. Reverse genetics assays confirmed these results and further showed that the double mutation H275Y and I223R conferred enhanced levels of resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir (6195- and 15.2-fold). In the patient, six days after initiation of oseltamivir therapy, the mutation H275Y conferring oseltamivir resistance and the I223R mutation were detected in the NA. Mutations were detected concomitantly from day 6–69 but molecular cloning did not show any variant harbouring both mutations. Despite cessation of NAI treatment, the mutation I223R persisted along with additional mutations in the NA and the hemagglutinin. Conclusions Reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir was conferred by the I223R mutation which potentiated resistance to both NAIs when associated with the H275Y mutation in the NA. Concomitant emergence of the I223R and H275Y mutations under oseltamivir treatment underlines the importance of close monitoring of treated patients especially those immunocompromised."
https://openalex.org/W2003950009,"Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) divide and differentiate in a precisely regulated manner over time to achieve the remarkable expansion and assembly of the layered mammalian cerebral cortex. Both intrinsic signaling pathways and environmental factors control the behavior of NPCs during cortical development. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) are critical environmental regulators that help modulate and integrate environmental cues and downstream intracellular signals. Syndecan-1 (Sdc1), a major transmembrane HSPG, is highly enriched in the early neural germinal zone, but its function in modulating NPC behavior and cortical development has not been explored. In this study we investigate the expression pattern and function of Sdc1 in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We found that Sdc1 is highly expressed by cortical NPCs. Knockdown of Sdc1 in vivo by in utero electroporation reduces NPC proliferation and causes their premature differentiation, corroborated in isolated cells in vitro. We found that Sdc1 knockdown leads to reduced levels of β-catenin, indicating reduced canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, GSK3β inhibition helps rescue the Sdc1 knockdown phenotype, partially restoring NPC number and proliferation. Moreover, exogenous Wnt protein promotes cortical NPC proliferation, but this is prevented by Sdc1 knockdown. Thus, Sdc1 in the germinal niche is a key HSPG regulating the maintenance and proliferation of NPCs during cortical neurogenesis, in part by modulating the ability of NPCs to respond to Wnt ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2025430318,"Pathogens often rely on thermosensing to adjust virulence gene expression. In yersiniae, important virulence-associated traits are under the control of the master regulator RovA, which uses a built-in thermosensor to control its activity. Thermal upshifts encountered upon host entry induce conformational changes in the RovA dimer that attenuate DNA binding and render the protein more susceptible to proteolysis. Here, we report the crystal structure of RovA in the free and DNA-bound forms and provide evidence that thermo-induced loss of RovA activity is promoted mainly by a thermosensing loop in the dimerization domain and residues in the adjacent C-terminal helix. These determinants allow partial unfolding of the regulator upon an upshift to 37 °C. This structural distortion is transmitted to the flexible DNA-binding domain of RovA. RovA contacts mainly the DNA backbone in a low-affinity binding mode, which allows the immediate release of RovA from its operator sites. We also show that SlyA, a close homolog of RovA from Salmonella with a very similar structure, is not a thermosensor and remains active and stable at 37 °C. Strikingly, changes in only three amino acids, reflecting evolutionary replacements in SlyA, result in a complete loss of the thermosensing properties of RovA and prevent degradation. In conclusion, only minor alterations can transform a thermotolerant regulator into a thermosensor that allows adjustment of virulence and fitness determinants to their thermal environment.

In conclusion, only minor alterations can transform a thermotolerant regulator into a thermosensor that allows adjustment of virulence and fitness determinants to their thermal environment. Microbial pathogens need to adapt rapidly to milieus in warm-blooded hosts after entry from external habitats. This requires a coordinated control of large sets of genes covering a wide range of cellular processes. The thermal upshift accompanying host entry is often used by bacterial pathogens to tailor the complex regulatory network controlling virulence-associated functions (1Konkel M.E. Tilly K.

The MarR family constitutes an important class of transcriptional regulators by which prokaryotes sense their surrounding biosphere. They control numerous biological functions important for survival, stress resistance, metabolic adaptation, and virulence (4Perera I.C. Grove A. Molecular mechanisms of ligand-mediated attenuation of DNA binding by MarR family transcriptional regulators.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 2: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The SlyA/RovA family represents a subgroup of MarR-type regulators that participate in the control of virulence factors and are as such crucial for the successful establishment of an infection (5Ellison D.W. Miller V.L. Regulation of virulence by members of the MarR/SlyA family.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Salmonella SlyA protein was shown to control hemolysins and antimicrobial peptides and induces expression of SPI-2 (Salmonella pathogenicity island 2), necessary for survival in macrophages and virulence in mice (6Buchmeier N.

RovA, the SlyA homolog of pathogenic yersiniae, coordinates the expression of multiple genes contributing to host colonization and persistence. For instance, in enteropathogenic Yersinia species, RovA activates expression of the internalization factor invasin, allowing a more efficient colonization of gut-associated lymphatic follicles, whereas RovA of Yersinia pestis affects production of the type III secretion system and antiphagocytic Yop effector proteins, which are essential for the development of bubonic plague (10Heroven A.K.

A chromosomally encoded regulator is required for expression of the Yersinia enterocolitica inv gene and for virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other previously identified MarR homologs, RovA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which is 100% identical to RovA of Y. pestis, represents an intrinsic proteinaceous thermometer that is able to sense temperature shifts directly through reversible alterations in its conformation. Thermo-induced conformational changes within the RovA structure modulate its DNA-binding capacity and render the regulator more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by the ATP-dependent protease Lon (11Herbst K. Bujara M. Heroven A.K. Opitz W. Weichert M. Zimmermann A. Dersch P. Intrinsic thermal sensing controls proteolysis of Yersinia virulence regulator RovA.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000435Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Use of a built-in thermosensor in the MarR-type regulator RovA to control DNA-binding activity and protein stability represents a unique regulatory strategy to adjust virulence-associated processes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism through which RovA confers its specific biological activities, we solved the crystal structure of free and DNA-bound RovA and identified amino acids implicated in thermosensing and regulated proteolysis. A detailed description of the growth conditions, construction of bacterial strains and plasmids, and molecular biology procedures is provided under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Strains and plasmids are listed in supplemental Table S2.

RovA in the unbound and DNA-bound forms was crystallized at a concentration of 20 mg/ml with and without DNA (8 mg/ml). The crystals of RovA without DNA belong to the space group P212121, and a data set up to 2.4 Å was collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14h2. The crystals of RovA in complex with DNA belong to the space group P3 and diffract up to 1.9 Å. For details of the determination of the structure, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Supplemental Table S1 summarizes data collection and refinement statistics. The final models were validated using MolProbity (27Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

CD spectroscopy of the RovA proteins, DNA retardation assays, and protein stability assays were performed as described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures” or previously (11Herbst K.

Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1469-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The structures of RovA of Y. pseudotuberculosis alone and in complex with DNA were solved at resolutions of 1.85 and 2.1 Å, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in supplemental Table S1. The overall structure of RovA consists of two subunits comprising six α-helices and two β-sheets and resembles other members of the MarR regulator family (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The two RovA monomers are tightly intertwined with the three long helices α1, α5, and α6, which form a large dimer interface of 2252.6 Å2 and a ΔG of −34.4 kcal/mol. The interface is supported mainly by hydrophobic interactions involving surface-located aliphatic and aromatic amino acids in the respective dimerization domains. The DNA-binding domain is formed by the central part of RovA and contains a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. It comprises helices α3 (stabilizing helix) and α4 (recognition helix) and two antiparallel β-strands linked by a loop (wing) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Three different RovA dimer variants exist in a crystallographic asymmetric unit and have the same overall structure but vary slightly in their conformation (Fig. 1B). These differences are due mainly to movements of the DNA-binding domain or the mobility of one of the long helices in the dimerization region. Similar to other structures of MarR-type regulators, the wing of the DNA-binding region is disordered in the unbound form. This indicates that the unbound form of RovA shows a considerable degree of flexibility, especially in the DNA-binding region. Two high-affinity RovA-binding sites (I and II) were previously detected at diverse positions in the rovA and inv promoters (supplemental Fig. S2), to which RovA bound with a similar apparent dissociation constant (Kd = 32–46 nm) (10Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. RovA is autoregulated and antagonizes H-NS-mediated silencing of invasin and rovA expression in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Herbst K. Bujara M. Heroven A.K. Opitz W. Weichert M. Zimmermann A. Dersch P. Intrinsic thermal sensing controls proteolysis of Yersinia virulence regulator RovA.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000435Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To compare the DNA-binding mode for different target sites, RovA was crystallized in the presence of one binding site of each promoter, which contained a short consensus sequence ((A/T)ATTAT(A/T)T) shown to be important for RovA binding (10Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. RovA is autoregulated and antagonizes H-NS-mediated silencing of invasin and rovA expression in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). RovA bound to both promoter fragments in a similar fashion with a root mean square deviation between common Cα atoms of the structures of 0.41 Å. The asymmetric unit contains one RovA-DNA complex. In contrast to unbound RovA, only one RovA dimer variant is present, and the wing region is well defined. This suggests that RovA binding to DNA locks the regulatory protein into one conformation (Fig. 1, C and D). The superposition of RovA in the free and DNA-bound forms shows that RovA performs a twisting motion upon DNA binding (data not shown). This conformational change increases the gap between the two DNA-binding domains in the dimer to allow the insertion of helix α4 into consecutive major grooves of the DNA (Fig. 1, C and D). Both the conformational flexibility of RovA and motions of the DNA-binding domains seem crucial to propagate thermo-induced conformational changes into an attenuation of DNA binding. As expected, RovA bound to the previously identified DNA-binding site in the middle of the rovA promoter fragment (Fig. 2A). In the case of the inv promoter fragment, however, RovA interacted with the joint ends of the promoter fragments (Fig. 2B). The newly generated RovA-binding sequence in the pseudo-continuous DNA strand in the crystal is very similar to the originally detected binding sequence (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the new site represents a similar or even better target site for the RovA protein. Both RovA subunits make extensive and comparable contacts within the rovA and inv promoter regions (Fig. 2). Although helix α4 of the helix-turn-helix motif is deeply inserted into the major groove of the DNA, only very few specific interactions are visible between RovA and the DNA bases, namely Gln-60, Val-64, and Arg-86 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). Gln-60 of one RovA monomer is able to bind to an adenine located 6 bp from the pseudosymmetrical center in the rovA fragment (Fig. 2A). RovA binding to the original binding site in the inv fragment would have allowed a similar contact of Gln-60 by only one monomer. However, both Gln-60 residues of the RovA dimer are able to bind to adenines in the newly generated recognition site, which most probably increased the affinity for this binding sequence (supplemental Fig. S3). Notably, the importance of Gln-60 for the DNA interactions is also supported by the fact that a RovA(Q60R) variant had an impaired DNA-binding capacity and a reduced ability to stimulate inv expression (15Tran H.J. Heroven A.K. Winkler L. Spreter T. Beatrix B. Dersch P. Analysis of RovA, a transcriptional regulator of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis virulence that acts through antirepression and direct transcriptional activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42423-42432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The other important residue, Val-64, makes hydrophobic interactions with a thymidine at position 5 from the center of pseudosymmetry in both monomers, and Arg-86 of the wing domain interacts with a thymidine residue (position 9) at the end of the pseudopalindromic sequence (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). In addition to helix α4, also helices α2 and α3 and the wing make direct contacts with DNA (Fig. 1, C and D). However, most of these interactions are nonspecific hydrogen bonds between the wing and the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the DNA (Fig. 2). This is in line with previous results demonstrating that RovA is a global regulator that directly interacts with many promoter regions of Yersinia (10Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P.

The relatively small number of specific contacts between RovA and DNA allows the virulence regulator to recognize multiple non-palindromic promoter sequences in the Yersinia genome that do not share a highly conserved consensus sequence (10Heroven A.K.

Microbiol. 2007; 66: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Of the nonspecific interactions, binding of Gln-49 seems particularly important because this residue interacts with two adjacent sugar phosphate units on both sides of the bound DNA. This is supported by a previous study that showed that the Q49R mutation impairs DNA binding and renders the RovA molecule defective for transcriptional activation (15Tran H.J. Heroven A.K. Winkler L. Spreter T. Beatrix B. Dersch P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42423-42432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The closest homolog of RovA with a solved structure is SlyA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, showing an amino acid sequence identity of 76% (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1) (17Dolan K.T. Duguid E.M. He C. Crystal structures of SlyA protein, a master virulence regulator of Salmonella, in free and DNA-bound states.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22178-22185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular the DNA-binding regions are virtually identical, and both regulators show a similar promiscuity regarding their DNA-binding sites. However, in contrast to RovA, Gln-60 was not involved in DNA binding in the SlyA-DNA structure. On the other hand, Arg-65 of SlyA, which is bound to a guanine residue in the SlyA operator site (17Dolan K.T. Duguid E.M. He C. Crystal structures of SlyA protein, a master virulence regulator of Salmonella, in free and DNA-bound states.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22178-22185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), is not visible in the RovA structures in complex with the inv or rovA promoter fragment. This strongly suggests that RovA and SlyA recognize DNA sequences that are partially incomplete, i.e. do not contain all possible binding partners. The small number of specific contacts of RovA may be important to ensure a DNA-binding strength that allows rapid attenuation of DNA binding after a thermal upshift and counter-regulation and replacement of other competing global regulatory proteins. Previous studies showed that RovA acts mainly as an antisilencer that alleviates transcriptional repression by the small nucleoid protein H-NS, which has also little sequence specificity (10Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. RovA is autoregulated and antagonizes H-NS-mediated silencing of invasin and rovA expression in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.Mol.

This is different from other global regulators with conserved consensus sequences (e.g. the cAMP receptor protein Crp), which serve mainly to increase levels of promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase. In this case, the activator needs to be precisely positioned to ensure optimal interaction with the RNA polymerase. Although the structures of the Yersinia virulence factor RovA in its unbound form and in complex with DNA share many features with the Salmonella SlyA protein (Fig. 3) (17Dolan K.T. Duguid E.M. He C. Crystal structures of SlyA protein, a master virulence regulator of Salmonella, in free and DNA-bound states.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22178-22185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), major differences have been observed in their biochemical properties. The Yersinia RovA protein itself is a protein thermometer that uses intrinsic thermal sensing to control its DNA-binding functions and its degradation (11Herbst K. Bujara M. Heroven A.K. Opitz W. Weichert M. Zimmermann A. Dersch P. Intrinsic thermal sensing controls proteolysis of Yersinia virulence regulator RovA.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000435Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, thermosensing, concomitant with a loss in stability at body temperature, has not been described for Salmonella SlyA. All previous studies on SlyA-mediated control of virulence gene expression in Salmonella were performed at and report SlyA production at 37 °C (19Okada N. Oi Y. Takeda-Shitaka M. Kanou K. Umeyama H.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20924-20929Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fact, when the stabilities of RovA and SlyA were compared in Y. pseudotuberculosis and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, RovA was rapidly degraded, whereas the Salmonella SlyA protein remained stable at 37 °C in both pathogens (Fig. 4, A and B). However, at 25 °C, both the RovA and SlyA proteins remained stable. CD spectroscopy of the purified proteins further demonstrated that in contrast to RovA (Fig. 4C), SlyA does not undergo a temperature-dependent conformational change (Fig. 4D) and does not lose its DNA-binding capacity at body temperature (supplemental Fig. S5). This strongly indicates that SlyA is not an intrinsic thermosensor that is subjected to controlled proteolysis, although its overall structure is very similar to RovA (Fig. 3). Thermosensing has been described for only three other bacterial transcriptional regulators. However, these regulators are structurally unrelated to RovA and are most likely controlled by a different mechanism (23Hurme R. Berndt K.D. Normark S.J. Rhen M.

CtsR, the Gram-positive master regulator of protein quality control, feels the heat.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3621-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Superposition of the SlyA and RovA structures to identify variations between the two regulatory proteins revealed differences in a small loop between helices α5 and α6 (Fig. 3). This loop, including Gly-116 of RovA, has a different conformation in SlyA, in which position 116 is occupied by an alanine (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). We introduced a corresponding substitution into RovA and found that the mutant protein (RovA(G116A)) showed no major thermally induced loss of structural integrity (Fig. 5B) and did not display a thermo-induced reduction in DNA binding (Fig. 6B). DNA binding of the RovA(G116A) variant was comparable at 25 and 37 °C. This demonstrated that RovA(G116A) lost most of its intrinsic thermosensitivity observed for wild-type RovA. Consequently, RovA(G116A) did not reduce its DNA-binding property at 37 °C, which was concomitant with an enhanced stability of RovA (Fig. 5A). It is likely that the recognition sites for the Lon protease are occluded in the active DNA-bound RovA(G116A) variant even at 37 °C. In fact, previous studies with chimeric RovA proteins indicated that amino acids in the vicinity of the DNA-binding region are important for proteolytic susceptibility (11Herbst K. Bujara M. Heroven A.K. Opitz W. Weichert M. Zimmermann A. Dersch P. Intrinsic thermal sensing controls proteolysis of Yersinia virulence regulator RovA.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000435Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We conclude that the specific intrinsic thermosensing ability of RovA involves Gly-116 located in a flexible loop between helices α5 and α6 implicated in RovA dimerization. This represents a novel thermosensing mechanism. Of the three known thermosensing regulators, the heat-sensing domain is known only for CtsR, a master regulator of protein quality control of low-GC, Gram-positive bacteria (25Elsholz A.K. Michalik S. Zühlke D. Hecker M. Gerth U. CtsR, the Gram-positive master regulator of protein quality control, feels the heat.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3621-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in CtsR, intrinsic heat sensing occurs through a tetraglycine loop connecting the two β-sheets of its winged helix-turn-helix domain. Although both regions are structurally and functionally unrelated, they possess a low thermal stability due to a flexible loop structure.FIGURE 6Interaction of RovA, RovA(G116A), RovA(S127I/G128K), or RovA(G116A/S127I/G128K) with the rovA regulatory region at 25 or 37 °C. Double-stranded promoter fragments of the rovA regulatory region harboring RovA-binding site I (10Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P.

Compared with SlyA, slightly less of the RovA protein was detectable 90 min after blockage of protein synthesis. This indicates that additional amino acids contribute to the thermostabilization of SlyA. We replaced other amino acids of RovA with the equivalent amino acids of SlyA and found that a substitution of S127I/G128K in addition to G116A (RovA(G116A/S127I/G128K)) further increased the stability of RovA to the level of SlyA (Fig. 7A). DNA binding studies further showed that RovA(G116A/S127I/G128K) did not bind DNA in a temperature-dependent manner (Fig. 6D), similar to the SlyA protein (supplemental Fig. S5). We also included both mutations in RovA without the G116A substitution and found that the RovA(S127I/G128K) protein was more stable than the wild-type RovA protein, although it was still degraded at 37 °C (Fig. 5C). In contrast to RovA(G116A), only a slight reduction in the thermosensing capacity was apparent in the RovA(S127I/G128K) protein (Fig. 5D). In agreement with this observation, DNA binding of this variant was increased at 37 °C but was still lower relative to RovA(G116A) (Fig. 6, B and C). Interestingly, thermal denaturation measured by far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed two unfolding transitions for RovA and its variants, whereas SlyA exhibited only a single transition at a higher temperature (supplemental Fig. S6). The midpoints of both unfolding transitions were lowest for RovA, considerably higher for RovA(G116A), and highest for RovA(G116A/S127I/G128K) (supplemental Fig. S6). The in vitro thermal denaturation behavior is therefore in full agreement with the thermosensing capacities of the variants observed in vivo. To confirm these observations, we also included the reverse mutations in SlyA to determine whether introduction of the reciprocal substitutions leads to its destabilization at body temperature. In fact, we observed a considerable degradation of SlyA(A116G/I127S/K128G) in contrast to wild-type SlyA, which remained completely stable during the test period (Fig. 7B). All other changes designed to convert RovA into SlyA resulted in unstable or less stable proteins, e.g. RovA(T4P), or did not lead to a significant increase in protein stability at 37 °C, e.g. RovA(Q102E/V103M/D104E) and RovA(N41H/R42Q) (supplemental Fig. S7). We conclude that only a few specific amino acid substitutions are sufficient to transform a thermotolerant protein into an intrinsic thermosensor and vice versa. The thermal upshift encountered upon host entry is the most crucial signal for many pathogens to induce and adjust their virulence functions. Frequently, thermo-induced structural changes in the DNA (e.g. supercoiling and bending) and mRNAs (thermoswitches) are used to control virulence gene expression, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these control systems have been elucidated in several pathogens. Recently, also regulatory proteins that function as “molecular thermometers” have been identified (11Herbst K. Bujara M. Heroven A.K. Opitz W. Weichert M. Zimmermann A. Dersch P.

However, the mechanism of the primary thermosensing event and the structural determinants defining the thermosensitive properties of these regulators are largely unknown. In this study, we have shown that the overall structure of the thermosensitive master regulator RovA of Yersinia resembles the thermotolerant homologous protein SlyA of Salmonella in the free and DNA-bound forms. However, it contains a small number of distinct single amino acid substitutions leading to major changes in the biochemical properties of the regulator. Here, we have provided evidence that RovA thermosensing depends mainly on a flexible loop situated between two α-helical structures involved in dimer formation. Intrinsic thermal sensing is supported by additional residues, including G1y-128, which introduces more conformational flexibility in the adjacent helix α6. It is very likely that these determinants promote partial and reversible unfolding of the intervening helices upon a thermal upshift without disruption of the dimer. This conformational change is transmitted to the flexible DNA-binding domain of RovA, contacting mainly the DNA backbone. A low-affinity DNA-binding mode appears to enable the immediate release of RovA from its operator sites and allows rapid degradation of nonfunctional protein."
https://openalex.org/W2060614949,"Animals can store learned information in their brains through a series of distinct memory forms. Short-lasting memory forms can be followed by longer-lasting, consolidated memory forms. However, the factors determining variation in memory consolidation encountered in nature have thus far not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that two parasitic wasp species belonging to different families, Cotesia glomerata (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Trichogramma evanescens (Hymenoptera; Trichogrammatidae), similarly adjust the memory form they consolidate to a fitness-determining reward: egg-laying into a host-insect that serves as food for their offspring. Protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM) was consolidated after single-trial conditioning with a high-value host. However, single-trial conditioning with a low-value host induced consolidation of a shorter-lasting memory form. For Cotesia glomerata, we subsequently identified this shorter-lasting memory form as anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) because it was not sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors or anesthesia. Associative conditioning using a single reward of different value thus induced a physiologically different mechanism of memory formation in this species. We conclude that the memory form that is consolidated does not only change in response to relatively large differences in conditioning, such as the number and type of conditioning trials, but is also sensitive to more subtle differences, such as reward value. Reward-dependent consolidation of exclusive ARM or LTM provides excellent opportunities for within-species comparison of mechanisms underlying memory consolidation."

During the onset of diet-induced insulin resistance, elevated lipid levels in the circulation interfere with insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, leading to impaired glucose utilization. Recently, we identified vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 2 and 3 to be required for insulin- and contraction-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, respectively, in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated whether overexpression of VAMP2 and/or VAMP3 could protect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation under conditions of insulin resistance. HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes transiently overexpressing either VAMP2 or VAMP3 were cultured for 16 h with elevated concentrations of palmitate and insulin. Upon subsequent acute stimulation with insulin, we measured GLUT4 translocation, plasmalemmal presence of the fatty acid transporter CD36, and myocellular lipid accumulation. Overexpression of VAMP3, but not VAMP2, completely prevented lipid-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, the plasmalemmal presence of CD36 and intracellular lipid levels remained normal in cells overexpressing VAMP3. However, insulin signaling was not retained, indicating an effect of VAMP3 overexpression downstream of PKB/Akt. Furthermore, we revealed that endogenous VAMP3 is bound by the contraction-activated protein kinase D (PKD), and contraction and VAMP3 overexpression protect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation via a common mechanism. These observations indicate that PKD activates GLUT4 translocation via a VAMP3-dependent trafficking step, which pathway might be valuable to rescue constrained glucose utilization in the insulin-resistant heart.

Recent studies suggest that the activity of this channel is regulated by the Ca2+-binding protein 4 (CaBP4). In the present study, we explored this issue by examining functional effects of CaBP4 on heterologously expressed Cav1.4. We show that CaBP4 dramatically increases Cav1.4 channel availability. This effect crucially depends on the presence of the C-terminal ICDI (inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent inactivation) domain of Cav1.4 and is absent in a Cav1.4 mutant lacking the ICDI. Using FRET experiments, we demonstrate that CaBP4 interacts with the IQ motif of Cav1.4 and that it interferes with the binding of the ICDI domain. Based on these findings, we suggest that CaBP4 increases Cav1.4 channel availability by relieving the inhibitory effects of the ICDI domain on voltage-dependent Cav1.4 channel gating. We also functionally characterized two CaBP4 mutants that are associated with a congenital variant of human night blindness and other closely related nonstationary retinal diseases. Although both mutants interact with Cav1.4 channels, the functional effects of CaBP4 mutants are only partially preserved, leading to a reduction of Cav1.4 channel availability and loss of function. In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the functional interaction between CaBP4 and Cav1.4.

https://openalex.org/W2015665097,"Disrupted skin barrier due to altered keratinocyte differentiation is common in pathologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis and psoriasis. However, the molecular cascades governing keratinocyte terminal differentiation are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that a dominant mutation in ZNF750 leads to a clinical phenotype reminiscent of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Here we show that ZNF750 is a nuclear protein bearing a functional C-terminal nuclear localization signal. ZNF750 was specifically expressed in the epidermal suprabasal layers and its expression was augmented during differentiation, both in human skin and in-vitro, peaking in the granular layer. Silencing of ZNF750 in Ca2+-induced HaCaT keratinocytes led to morphologically apparent arrest in the progression of late differentiation, as well as diminished apoptosis and sustained proliferation. ZNF750 knockdown cells presented with markedly reduced expression of epidermal late differentiation markers, including gene subsets of epidermal differentiation complex and skin barrier formation such as FLG, LOR, SPINK5, ALOX12B and DSG1, known to be mutated in various human skin diseases. Furthermore, overexpression of ZNF750 in undifferentiated cells induced terminal differentiation genes. Thus, ZNF750 is a regulator of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and with its downstream targets can serve in future elucidation of therapeutics for common diseases of skin barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2090152921,"Despite the suggestion that reduced energy expenditure may be a key contributor to the obesity pandemic, few studies have tested whether acutely reduced energy expenditure is associated with a compensatory reduction in food intake. The homeostatic mechanisms that control food intake and energy expenditure remain controversial and are thought to act over days to weeks. We evaluated food intake in mice using two models of acutely decreased energy expenditure: 1) increasing ambient temperature to thermoneutrality in mice acclimated to standard laboratory temperature or 2) exercise cessation in mice accustomed to wheel running. Increasing ambient temperature (from 21°C to 28°C) rapidly decreased energy expenditure, demonstrating that thermoregulatory energy expenditure contributes to both light cycle (40±1%) and dark cycle energy expenditure (15±3%) at normal ambient temperature (21°C). Reducing thermoregulatory energy expenditure acutely decreased food intake primarily during the light cycle (65±7%), thus conflicting with the delayed compensation model, but did not alter spontaneous activity. Acute exercise cessation decreased energy expenditure only during the dark cycle (14±2% at 21°C; 21±4% at 28°C), while food intake was reduced during the dark cycle (0.9±0.1 g) in mice housed at 28°C, but during the light cycle (0.3±0.1 g) in mice housed at 21°C. Cumulatively, there was a strong correlation between the change in daily energy expenditure and the change in daily food intake (R2 = 0.51, p<0.01). We conclude that acutely decreased energy expenditure decreases food intake suggesting that energy intake is regulated by metabolic signals that respond rapidly and accurately to reduced energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2089255240,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent and have unlimited self-renewal capacity. Although pluripotency and differentiation have been examined extensively, the mechanisms responsible for self-renewal are poorly understood and are believed to involve an unusual cell cycle, epigenetic regulators and pluripotency-promoting transcription factors. Here we show that B-MYB, a cell cycle regulated phosphoprotein and transcription factor critical to the formation of inner cell mass, is central to the transcriptional and co-regulatory networks that sustain normal cell cycle progression and self-renewal properties of ESCs. Phenotypically, B-MYB is robustly expressed in ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and it is present predominantly in a hypo-phosphorylated state. Knockdown of B-MYB results in functional cell cycle abnormalities that involve S, G2 and M phases, and reduced expression of critical cell cycle regulators like ccnb1 and plk1. By conducting gene expression profiling on control and B-MYB deficient cells, ChIP-chip experiments, and integrative computational analyses, we unraveled a highly complex B-MYB-mediated transcriptional network that guides ESC self-renewal. The network encompasses critical regulators of all cell cycle phases and epigenetic regulators, pluripotency transcription factors, and differentiation determinants. B-MYB along with E2F1 and c-MYC preferentially co-regulate cell cycle target genes. B-MYB also co-targets genes regulated by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG that are significantly associated with stem cell differentiation, embryonic development, and epigenetic control. Moreover, loss of B-MYB leads to a breakdown of the transcriptional hierarchy present in ESCs. These results coupled with functional studies demonstrate that B-MYB not only controls and accelerates cell cycle progression in ESCs it contributes to fate decisions and maintenance of pluripotent stem cell identity."

https://openalex.org/W1968222216,"This article describes the development and testing of the first automatically microfabricated probes to be used in conjunction with the magic angle coil spinning (MACS) NMR technique. NMR spectroscopy is a versatile technique for a large range of applications, but its intrinsically low sensitivity poses significant difficulties in analyzing mass- and volume-limited samples. The combination of microfabrication technology and MACS addresses several well-known NMR issues in a concerted manner for the first time: (i) reproducible wafer-scale fabrication of the first-in-kind on-chip LC microresonator for inductive coupling of the NMR signal and reliable exploitation of MACS capabilities; (ii) improving the sensitivity and the spectral resolution by simultaneous spinning the detection microcoil together with the sample at the “magic angle” of 54.74° with respect to the direction of the magnetic field (magic angle spinning – MAS), accompanied by the wireless signal transmission between the microcoil and the primary circuit of the NMR spectrometer; (iii) given the high spinning rates (tens of kHz) involved in the MAS methodology, the microfabricated inserts exhibit a clear kinematic advantage over their previously demonstrated counterparts due to the inherent capability to produce small radius cylindrical geometries, thus tremendously reducing the mechanical stress and tearing forces on the sample. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the microfabrication technology, we have designed MACS probes for various Larmor frequencies (194, 500 and 700 MHz) testing several samples such as water, Drosophila pupae, adamantane solid and LiCl at different magic angle spinning speeds."

Twenty colostrum-fed (CF) pigs that were free of PCV2 and P1 at 1 month of age were randomly designated equally to two groups. Group 1 pigs were each injected with 400 µg of the cloned P1 plasmid DNA into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes and Group 2 were injected with same amount of the empty pSK vector DNA and served as controls. Viremias were positively detected in 8 of 10 P1 infected pigs from 14-21 days post-inoculation (dpi). The 8 infected animals showed pallor of skin and diarrhea. Gross lesions in the pigs euthanized on 35 dpi were similarly characterized by encephalemia, haemorrhage of the bladder mucosa, haemorrhage of the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, lung atrophy and haemorrhage. Histopathological lesions were arteriectasis and telangiectasia of the cavitas subarachnoidealis, interstitial pneumonia, mild atrophy of the cardiac muscle cells, histiocytic hyperplasia of the follicles in the tonsils, and haemorrhage of the inguinal lymph nodes. P1 DNA and antigens were confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry in the tissues and organs of the infected pigs, including the pancreas, bladders, testicles/ovaries, brains, lungs and liver. There were no obvious clinical signs and pathological lesions in the control pigs. This study demonstrated that P1 infection is one of the important pathologic agents on pig farms."

Screening and diagnosis of PTSD symptoms is crucial in trauma-related research and practice. The 13-item Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES) has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable tool to achieve this goal. This study was designed to examine the psychometric properties of the 13-item CRIES in a sample of Chinese debris flood victims. Methods A total of 268 participants (145 girls, 123 boys) aged 8–18 years were recruited from an integral part of a service oriented project, supported by the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences following the debris flood. The participants were given the 13-item CRIES 3 months after the debris flood. Results The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor structure (intrusion+arousal vs avoidance) emerged as the model best fit in total sample, boys and girls subsamples, respectively. The scale was also demonstrated to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83). Conclusion The study confirmed the good psychometric properties of the CRIES and its' applicability to Chinese children and adolescents. Moreover, these findings imply that the CRIES factor structure is stable across age, gender, and different types of trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2070456418,"Background This study sought to identify whether elevated risk of infectious intestinal disease (IID) exists in contaminated small water supply consumers compared with consumers drinking from small supplies complying with current standards and whether this effect is modified by age. Methodology and Principal Findings A prospective cohort study of 611 individuals receiving small supplies in England was conducted. Water supplies received sanitary inspection and examination for indicator bacteria and participants maintained a daily record of IID. Regression modeling with generalized estimating equations that included interaction terms between age and indicators of fecal pollution was performed. Crude IID prevalence was 9·3 days with symptoms/1000 person days (95%CI: 8·4, 10·1) and incidence was 3·2 episodes/1000 person days (95%CI, 2·7, 3·7) or 1·2 episodes per person year. Although there was no overall association between IID risk and indicator presence, there was strong interaction between age and indicator presence. In children under ten, relative risk (RR) of IID in those drinking from enterococci contaminated supplies was 4.8 (95%CI: 1.5, 15.3) for incidence and 8.9 (95%CI: 2.8, 27.5) for prevalence. In those aged 10 to 59, IID risk was lower but not statistically significant. Conclusions Contaminated small water supplies pose a substantial risk of IID to young children who live in homes reliant on these supplies. By contrast older children and adults do not appear to be at increased risk. Health care professionals with responsibility for children living in homes provided by very small water supplies should make parents aware of the risk."
https://openalex.org/W1975724206,"Catecholamine metabolism plays an important role in the determination of insect body color and cuticle sclerotization. To date, limited research has focused on these processes in silkworm. In the current study, we analyzed the interactions between catecholamines and melanin genes and their effects on the pigmentation patterns and physical properties of sclerotized regions in silkworm, using the melanic mutant melanism (mln) silkworm strain as a model. Injection of β-alanine into mln mutant silkworm induced a change in catecholamine metabolism and turned its body color yellow. Further investigation of the catecholamine content and expression levels of the corresponding melanin genes from different developmental stages of Dazao-mln (mutant) and Dazao (wild-type) silkworm revealed that at the larval and adult stages, the expression patterns of melanin genes precipitated dopamine accumulation corresponding to functional loss of Bm-iAANAT, a repressive effect of excess NBAD on ebony, and upregulation of tan in the Dazao-mln strain. During the early pupal stage, dopamine did not accumulate in Dazao-mln, since upregulation of ebony and black genes led to conversion of high amounts of dopamine into NBAD, resulting in deep yellow cuticles. Scanning electron microscope analysis of a cross-section of adult dorsal plates from both wild-type and mutant silkworm disclosed the formation of different layers in Dazao-mln owing to lack of NADA, compared to even and dense layers in Dazao. Analysis of the mechanical properties of the anterior wings revealed higher storage modulus and lower loss tangent in Dazao-mln, which was closely associated with the altered catecholamine metabolism in the mutant strain. Based on these findings, we conclude that catecholamine metabolism is crucial for the color pattern and physical properties of cuticles in silkworm. Our results should provide a significant contribution to Lepidoptera cuticle tanning research."

To counteract this stress, the heat-shock protein (HSP) network plays a vital role in restoring the homeostasis of the system. To study the stress-induced dynamics of heat-shock network, we analyzed three modules of the HSP90 network--namely trimerization reactions, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions, and the conversion of HSP90 from an open to a closed conformation--and constructed a corresponding nonlinear differential equation model based on mass action kinetics laws. The kinetic parameters of the model were obtained through global optimization, and sensitivity analyses revealed that the most sensitive parameters are the kinase and phosphatase that drive the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions. Bifurcation analysis carried out with the estimated kinetic parameters of the model with stress as bifurcation parameter revealed the occurrence of ""mushroom"", a type of complex dynamics in which S-shaped and Z-shaped hysteretic bistable forms are present together. We mapped the molecular events responsible for generating the mushroom dynamics under stress and interpreted the occurrence of the S-shaped hysteresis to a normal level of stress, and the Z-shaped hysteresis to the HSP90 variations under acute and chronic stress in the fear conditioned system, and further, we hypothesized that this can be extended to stress-related disorders such as depression and PTSD in humans. Finally, we studied the effect of parameter variations on the mushroom dynamics to get insight about the role of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation parameters in HSP90 network in bringing about complex dynamics such as isolas, where the stable steady states in a bistable system are isolated and separated from each other and not connected by an unstable steady state."

Individual expressions of personality traits were measured using the NEO-PI-R questionnaire. Conscientiousness correlated positively with error signaling in the left inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent anterior insula (IFG/aI). A second strong positive correlation was observed in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC). Neuroticism was negatively correlated with error signaling in the inferior frontal cortex possibly reflecting the negative inter-correlation between both scales observed on the behavioral level. Under present statistical thresholds no significant results were obtained for remaining scales. Aligning the personality trait of Conscientiousness with task accomplishment striving behavior the correlation in the left IFG/aI possibly reflects an inter-individually different involvement whenever task-set related memory representations are violated by the occurrence of errors. The strong correlations in the ACC may indicate that more conscientious subjects were stronger affected by these violations of a given task-set expressed by individually different, negatively valenced signals conveyed by the ACC upon occurrence of an error. Present results illustrate that for predicting individual responses to errors underlying personality traits should be taken into account and also lend external validity to the personality trait approach suggesting that personality constructs do reflect more than mere descriptive taxonomies."

Contemporary data are lacking on exposures to impaired driving behaviours and related injury among young adolescents, as well as inequities in these youth risk behaviours. Methods and Findings Cycle 6 (2009/10) of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey involved 26,078 students enrolled in 436 Canadian schools. We profiled cross-sectionally the reported use of alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs by on-road and off-road vehicle operators when young adolescents (mean age 13.3 (±1.6) years) were either driving or riding as a passenger. Comparisons were made across vulnerable subgroups. Multi-level logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the effects of the driving behaviours on risks for motor vehicle-related injury. Attributable risk fractions were also estimated. A total of 10% (±3%) of participants reported recent operation of an on-road or off-road motor vehicle after consuming alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs, while 21% (±3%) reported riding as a passenger with a driver under the same conditions. Larger proportions of youth reporting these risk behaviours were males, and from older age groups, rural communities, and socio-economically disadvantaged populations. The behaviours were consistently associated with increased risks for motor vehicle-related injury at the individual level (RR 2.35; 95% CI: 1.54 to 3.58 for frequent vs. no exposure as a driver; RR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.36 for frequent vs. no exposure as a passenger) and at the population level (Attributable Risk Fraction: 7.1% for drivers; 14.0% for passengers). The study was limited mainly by its reliance on self-reported data. Conclusion Impaired driving is an important health priority among young adolescents in Canada. Inequities in the involvement of younger adolescents in these risk behaviours suggest the need for targeted interventions for specific subgroups such as youth from rural communities, and among socially disadvantaged populations."
https://openalex.org/W2052981776,"A hallmark of prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopaties is the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), expressed by the prion gene (prnp), into an abnormally folded isoform (PrPSc) with amyloid-like features that causes scrapie in sheep among other diseases. prnp together with prnd (which encodes a prion-like protein designated as Doppel), and prnt (that encodes the prion protein testis specific - Prt) with sprn (shadow of prion protein gene, that encodes Shadoo or Sho) genes, constitute the “prion gene complex”. Whereas a role for prnd in the proper functioning of male reproductive system has been confirmed, the function of prnt, a recently discovered prion family gene, comprises a conundrum leading to the assumption that ruminant prnt is a pseudogene with no protein expression. The main objective of the present study was to identify Prt localization in the ram reproductive system and simultaneously to elucidate if ovine prnt gene is transcribed into protein-coding RNA. Moreover, as Prt is a prnp-related protein, the amyloid propensity was also tested for ovine and caprine Prt. Recombinant Prt was used to immunize BALB/c mice, and the anti-Prt polyclonal antibody (APPA) immune response was evaluated by ELISA and Western Blot. When tested by indirect immunofluorescence, APPA showed high avidity to the ram sperm head apical ridge subdomain, before and after induced capacitation, but did not show the same behavior against goat spermatozoa, suggesting high antibody specificity against ovine-Prt. Prt was also found in the testis when assayed by immunohistochemistry during ram spermatogenesis, where spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa, stained positive. These observations strongly suggest ovine prnt to be a translated protein-coding gene, pointing to a role for Prt protein in the ram reproductive physiology. Besides, caprine Prt appears to exhibit a higher amyloid propensity than ovine Prt, mostly associated with its phenylalanine residue."
https://openalex.org/W2067184085,"We present the first comprehensive analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in the Kaohsiung region of southern Taiwan. The major spoligotypes found in the 224 isolates studied were Beijing lineages (n = 97; 43.3%), EAI lineages (n = 72; 32.1%) and Haarlem lineages (n = 18; 8.0%). By 24 MIRU-VNTR typing, 174 patterns were identified, including 24 clusters of 74 isolates and 150 unique patterns. The combination of spoligotyping and 12-MIRU-VNTR revealed that 129 (57.6%) of the 224 isolates were clustered in 18 genotypes. Moreover, 63.6% (7/11) of infected persons younger than 30 years had a Beijing strain, which could suggest recent spread among younger persons by this family of TB strains in Kaohsiung. Among the 94 Beijing family (SIT1, SIT250 and SIT1674) isolates further analyzed for SNPs by mass spectrometry, the most frequent strain found was ST10 (n = 49; 52%), followed by ST22 (n = 17; 18%) and ST19 (n = 11; 12%). Among the EAI-Manila family isolates analyzed by region deletion-based subtyping, the most frequent strain found was RD type 1 (n = 63; 87.5%), followed by RD type 2 (n = 9; 12.5%). In our previous study, the proportion of modern Beijing strains (52.5%) in northern Taiwan was significantly higher than the proportion of EAI strains (11%). In contrast, in the present study, EAI strains comprised up to 32% of Beijing strains in southern Taiwan. In conclusion, both ‘modern’ (Beijing) and ‘ancient’ (EAI) M. tuberculosis strains are prevalent in the Kaohsiung region, perhaps suggesting that both strains are somehow more adapted to southern Taiwan. It will be interesting to investigate the dynamics of the lineage composition by different selection pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2097459992,"Vaccines against many pathogens for which conventional approaches have failed remain an unmet public health priority. Synthetic peptide-based vaccines offer an attractive alternative to whole protein and whole organism vaccines, particularly for complex pathogens that cause chronic infection. Previously, we have reported a promising lipid core peptide (LCP) vaccine delivery system that incorporates the antigen, carrier, and adjuvant in a single molecular entity. LCP vaccines have been used to deliver several peptide subunit-based vaccine candidates and induced high titre functional antibodies and protected against Group A streptococcus in mice. Herein, we have evaluated whether LCP constructs incorporating defined CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes could induce epitope-specific T cell responses and protect against pathogen challenge in a rodent malaria model. We show that LCP vaccines failed to induce an expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells following primary immunization or by boosting. We further demonstrated that the LCP vaccines induced a non-specific type 2 polarized cytokine response, rather than an epitope-specific canonical CD8+ T cell type 1 response. Cytotoxic responses of unknown specificity were also induced. These non-specific responses were able to protect against parasite challenge. These data demonstrate that vaccination with lipid core peptides fails to induce canonical epitope-specific T cell responses, at least in our rodent model, but can nonetheless confer non-specific protective immunity against Plasmodium parasite challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2144298404,"As some malaria control programs shift focus from disease control to transmission reduction, there is a need for transmission data to monitor progress. At lower levels of transmission, it becomes increasingly more difficult to measure precisely, for example through entomological studies. Many programs conduct regular cross sectional parasite prevalence surveys, and have access to malaria treatment data routinely collected by ministries of health, often in health management information systems. However, by themselves, these data are poor measures of transmission. In this paper, we propose an approach for combining annual parasite incidence and treatment data with cross-sectional parasite prevalence and treatment seeking survey data to estimate the incidence of new infections in the human population, also known as the force of infection. The approach is based on extension of a reversible catalytic model. The accuracy of the estimates from this model appears to be highly dependent on levels of detectability and treatment in the community, indicating the importance of information on private sector treatment seeking and access to effective and appropriate treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2122890687,"CXCR1, a classic GPCR that binds IL-8, plays a key role in neutrophil activation and migration by activating phospholipase C (PLC)β through Gα(15) and Gα(i) which generates diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates (IPs). In this study, two conserved amino acid residues of CXCR1 on the transmembrane domain (TM) 3 and TM6, Leu128(3.43) (L128) and Val247(6.40) (V247), respectively, were selectively substituted with other amino acids to investigate the role of these conserved residues in CXCR1 activation. Although two selective mutants on Leu128, Leu128Ala (L128A) and Leu128Arg (L128R), demonstrated high binding affinity to IL-8, they were not capable of coupling to G proteins and consequently lost the functional response of the receptors. By contrast, among the four mutants at residue Val247 (TM6.40), replacing Val247 with Ala (V247A) and Asn (V247N) led to constitutive activation of mutant receptors when cotransfected with Gα(15). The V247N mutant also constitutively activated the Gα(i) protein. These results indicate that L128 on TM3.43 is involved in G protein coupling and receptor activation but is unimportant for ligand binding. On the other hand, V247 on TM6.40 plays a critical role in maintaining the receptor in the inactive state, and the substitution of V247 impaired the receptor constraint and stabilized an active conformation. Functionally, there was an increase in chemotaxis in response to IL-8 in cells expressing V247A and V247N. Our findings indicate that Leu128(3.43) and Val247(6.40) are critical for G protein coupling and activation of signaling effectors, providing a valuable insight into the mechanism of CXCR1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2013231040,"Lung cancer mortality after exposure to radon decay products (RDP) among 16,236 male Eldorado uranium workers was analyzed. Male workers from the Beaverlodge and Port Radium uranium mines and the Port Hope radium and uranium refinery and processing facility who were first employed between 1932 and 1980 were followed up from 1950 to 1999. A total of 618 lung cancer deaths were observed. The analysis compared the results of the biologically-based two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model to the empirical excess risk model. The spontaneous clonal expansion rate of pre-malignant cells was reduced at older ages under the assumptions of the TSCE model. Exposure to RDP was associated with increase in the clonal expansion rate during exposure but not afterwards. The increase was stronger for lower exposure rates. A radiation-induced bystander effect could be a possible explanation for such an exposure response. Results on excess risks were compared to a linear dose-response parametric excess risk model with attained age, time since exposure and dose rate as effect modifiers. In all models the excess relative risk decreased with increasing attained age, increasing time since exposure and increasing exposure rate. Large model uncertainties were found in particular for small exposure rates."
https://openalex.org/W2071951605,"The pathways inducing the critical transition from compensated hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure remain poorly understood. The goal of our study is to determine the role of Rac-induced signaling in this transition process. Our previous results showed that Thyroxin (T4) treatment resulted in increased myocardial Rac expression in wild-type mice and a higher level of expression in Zea maize RacD (ZmRacD) transgenic mice. Our current results showed that T4 treatment induced physiologic cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice, as demonstrated by echocardiography and histopathology analyses. This was associated with significant increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Conversely, echocardiography and histopathology analyses showed that T4 treatment induced dilated cardiomyopathy along with compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in ZmRacD mice. These were linked with further increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Additionally, there were significant increases in caspase-8 expression and caspase-3 activity. However, there was a significant decrease in p38-MAPK activity. Interestingly, inhibition of myocardial Rac-GTP activity and superoxide generation with pravastatin and carvedilol, respectively, attenuated all functional, structural, and molecular changes associated with the T4-induced cardiomyopathy in ZmRacD mice except the compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. Taken together, T4-induced ZmRacD is a novel mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy that shares many characteristics with the human disease phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show graded Rac-mediated O(2)·(-) results in cardiac phenotype shift in-vivo. Moreover, Rac-mediated O(2)·(-) generation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis seem to play a pivotal role in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure. Targeting Rac signaling could represent valuable therapeutic strategy not only in saving the failing myocardium but also to prevent this transition process."

On the surface of the airway mucosa, there is a thin layer of epithelium; the epithelial cell bodies and the tight junctions form the epithelial barrier. The epithelial barrier physically separates the exterior environment and the deep tissue of the airway mucosa. It has been described that up to ∼1014 commensal bacteria live in the lumen of an adult human intestine (7Ley R.E. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Ecological and evolutionary forces shaping microbial diversity in the human intestine.Cell. 2006; 124: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). How exogenous antigens and microbial products pass across the epithelial barrier to be absorbed into the deep tissue in the body is to be further elucidated. Published data indicate that exposure to SEB does not affect the transepithelial resistance (TER) (8Lu J. Philpott D.J. Saunders P.R. Perdue M.H. Yang P.C. McKay D.M. Epithelial ion transport and barrier abnormalities evoked by superantigen-activated immune cells are inhibited by interleukin-10 but not interleukin-4.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Our previous studies indicate that the exogenous antigens can be transported across the epithelial barrier to get into the deep tissue via the intracellular pathway (9Yang P.C. Berin M.C. Perdue M.H.

The endosomes are defined as a membrane-bound compartment inside eukaryotic cells. It is an endocytic membrane transport pathway by which the endocytic cargo can be transported from the plasma membrane to the lysosome. The endocytic molecules from the plasma membrane can follow this pathway to lysosomes to be degraded. Three types of endosomes are described, the early, late, and recycling endosomes (12Mellman I. Endocytosis and molecular sorting.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The early endosomes mature into the late endosomes; during the course of time, the endosomes become increasingly acidic mainly through the activity of the V-ATPase (13Lafourcade C. Sobo K. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Garin J. van der Goot F.G. Regulation of the V-ATPase along the endocytic pathway occurs through reversible subunit association and membrane localization.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The late endosomes finally fuse with lysosomes. The endocytic substance can be degraded by the hydrolyase in lysosomes. The process of the fusion of endosome/lysosome is not fully understood yet. Recent studies indicate that the ubiquitin E3 ligase A20 (A20) plays a role in the fusion of endosome/lysosome (14Li L. Soetandyo N. Wang Q. Ye Y. The zinc finger protein A20 targets TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A20 is both a ubiquitin ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme; whether these activities are required for degrading SEB remains to be investigated. Thus, we designed and carried out this project. The results indicate that nasal epithelial cells endocytosed SEB, which increased the expression of ubiquitin E3 ligase A20 (A20, in short) in the cells; the A20 facilitated the degradation of SEB in the epithelial cells. SEB, NH4Cl, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). Antibodies of IgE, CD23, SEB, A20, EEA1, LAMP2, A20 shRNA, and fluorescence-labeled second antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Reagents for quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were purchased from Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). RPMI2650 cell line was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling kit was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Beijing, China). Human nasal epithelial cell line, RPMI2650 cells, was grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 100 μg ml−1 penicillin, and 200 mml-glutamine in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. When the cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution. For the SEB degradation assay, cells were cultured in Transwell filter inserts (polycarbonate membrane, 0.4-μm pore size, 1.12-cm2 surface area, Corning Costar Co.). To inhibit the lysosome function, 50 mm NH4Cl was included in the culture medium. TER of RPMI2650 monolayers was determined using the Millicell-ERS apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Following published procedures (15Wengst A. Reichl S. RPMI2650 epithelial model and three-dimensional reconstructed human nasal mucosa as in vitro models for nasal permeation studies.Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2010; 74: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we cultured RPMI2650 cells for 2 weeks in Transwell inserts to confluence (TER ≥100 ohm/cm2). SEB (10 μg/ml) was added to the apical chambers. Samples were taken from the basal chambers 24 h later. The levels of SEB in the samples were determined by ELISA. ELISA was performed to assess the levels of SEB and A20. Sample proteins (20 μg/ml), standard proteins, or bovine serum albumin (BSA, using as an irrelevant protein and a negative control) were added to 96-well plates (0.1 ml/well for every reagent); the plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. 5% skim milk was added to each well for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. The primary antibodies (10 ng/ml) were added to the wells and incubated at 4 °C overnight. HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (5 ng/ml) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine was added and incubated for 15 min; the reactions were stopped by adding 2 m H2SO4. Washing with TBS for three times was performed after each step. The optical density of each well was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Shanghai, China). The optical density value of the negative control wells was subtracted from the optical density value of each sample well and the standard wells. The results were calculated against the standard curve. Protein samples (60 μg/well) were fractioned in SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (10 ng/ml) at 4 °C overnight and followed by adding HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (5 ng/ml). The positive immunoreaction was visualized with the ECL Plus Western blotting reagent (Amersham Biosciences; Shanghai, China). The A20 gene expression in RPMI2650 cells was assessed by qRT-PCR. The total RNA was converted to cDNA with reverse transcriptase with the primer of A20 (forward, gagagcacaatggctgaaca; reverse, tccagtgtgtatcggtgcat; National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), NM_006290.2). The quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green master mix (Qiagen, Shanghai, China) in a Bio-Rad thermocycler (Bio-Rad Biotech, Shanghai, China). The results were expressed as the percentage of the housekeeping gene β-actin). A20 gene was knocked down in RPMI2650 cells with the shRNA of A20 (nonspecific shRNA was used as a control) following the manufacturer's instructions. The gene knockdown effect was presented in Fig. 3C. Following our established procedures with minor modifications (16Chen X. Cho D.B. Yang P.C. Double staining immunohistochemistry.N Am. J. Med. Sci. 2010; 2: 241-245PubMed Google Scholar), we stained A20, the absorbed SEB, endosomes, and lysosomes in RPMI2650 cells in an Eppendorf tube. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 h and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubating with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. The cells were smeared onto a slide and observed under a confocal microscope. The positive immune staining was quantitatively analyzed with the software Photoshop CS5. The results were expressed as pixels. 10 healthy subjects (5 male, 5 female; age, 23–30 years old), 10 patients with allergic rhinitis (5 male, 5 female, age, 25–32 years old), and 10 patients with non-allergic chronic rhinitis (5 male, 5 female; age, 24–29 years old) were recruited into this study at our outpatient clinic. The nasal epithelial samples were collected by scratching on the surface of the inferior turbinate with a plastic spoon (3 mm in diameter). The samples were processed for the extraction of RNA and protein immediately. The use of human tissue in this study was approved by the Human Study Ethic Committee at Shanxi Medical University. Informed, written consent was obtained from each subject. The cultured epithelial cells exposed to SEB in the culture were incubated with cycloheximide (70 μg/ml) for different periods of time. The cells were collected at the end of culture; the total cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. For the endocytosis of SEB of the epithelial cells, SEB was labeled with FITC employing the FITC-labeling kits following the manufacturer's instructions. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences between means were evaluated by Student t test and considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. All experiments were repeated at least three times. To elucidate whether nasal epithelial cells absorbed SEB, the nasal epithelial cell line, RPMI2650 cells, was exposed to SEB in culture for 0–30 min. The total proteins in the RPMI2650 cells were extracted and analyzed by ELISA. The results showed that the cells could absorb SEB in a SEB dose-(Fig. 1A) and exposure time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To confirm the results, we exposed the epithelial cells to the FITC-labeled SEB in the culture; the cells were collected at different time points and observed by confocal microscopy. The results showed the FITC staining inside the epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The data indicate that the nasal epithelial cells can endocytose SEB. Recent studies indicate that A20 plays a role in the endosome/lysosome fusion (14Li L. Soetandyo N. Wang Q. Ye Y. The zinc finger protein A20 targets TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); the latter is a critical procedure in degradation of the absorbed proteins in cells. To see whether human nasal epithelial cells express A20, we collected nasal epithelial samples and analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The results showed that the A20 expression was detected in healthy subjects and that this expression was significantly less in patients with chronic non-allergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis (Fig. 2, A and B). The results were corroborated by the data from a cell line study. The expression of A20 was also observed in the human nasal epithelial cell line, the RPMI2650 cells, at naive status; exposure to SEB in culture markedly increased the expression of A20 in the cells in a SEB dose- and exposure time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). Published data indicate that A20 plays a critical role in the prevention of immune inflammation in the body (17Vereecke L. Sze M. Mc Guire C. Rogiers B. Chu Y. Schmidt-Supprian M. Pasparakis M. Beyaert R. van Loo G. Enterocyte-specific A20 deficiency sensitizes to tumor necrosis factor-induced toxicity and experimental colitis.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and facilitates protein degradation in the cells (14Li L. Soetandyo N. Wang Q. Ye Y. The zinc finger protein A20 targets TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We postulated that the increase in A20 in nasal epithelial cells upon uptake of SEB may be associated with the degradation of the absorbed SEB in the cells. Because SEB could be absorbed into RPMI2650 cells (Fig. 1), the absorbed SEB could be either degraded within the cells or converted to the basal side of the cells. We next cultured the RPMI2650 cells in Transwell inserts to confluence. SEB was added to the apical chambers. Samples were taken from the basal chambers 24 h later. The contents of SEB in the basal chambers were assessed by ELISA using this test as a reference parameter to reflect the degradation of SEB by RPMI2650 cells. The results showed that the levels of SEB in samples from A20-sufficient RPMI2650 cells were below the detectable levels, implying that the SEB was degraded within the cells. To test the role of A20 in the degradation of SEB in nasal epithelial cells, the A20 gene was knocked down in a batch of RPMI2650 cells and then exposed to SEB in the Transwell system. Abundant SEB was detected in the basal chambers. To clarify whether the absorption of SEB altered the nasal epithelial paracellular permeability, we recorded the TER of RPMI2650 monolayer in Transwell inserts after the addition of SEB. The results showed that TER in the SEB-treated group was not significantly different from the control group (Fig. 3). The results indicate that the exposure to SEB does not alter the paracellular space of the nasal epithelial monolayer. We next further tested the role of the lysosome in the degradation of endocytic SEB in the epithelial cells. With the same experimental setting above, we added the lysosome inhibitor, NH4Cl, to the culture medium; the SEB flux through the epithelial monolayers was carried out. The results showed that even the A20-sufficient epithelial monolayers showed the high permeability to SEB (Fig. 3). The data indicate that A20 may not be directly involved in the degradation of the endocytic SEB; lysosome activities are required in the degradation of endocytic SEB. To further understand the role of A20 in the degradation of the endocytic SEB, we stained the SEB-treated RPMI2650 cells with antibodies against the markers of endosome, lysosome, and SEB; the cells were observed under a confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, SEB+ EEA1+ and SEB+ EEA1+ LAMP2+ immune products were observed in the A20-sufficient cells (Fig. 4A). In A20-deficient cells, more SEB+ EEA1+ immune products and fewer SEB+ EEA1+ LAMP2+ immune products were observed as compared with A20-sufficient cells (Fig. 4B). The results indicate that A20 plays a role in the fusion of endosome and lysosome. To confirm this inference, another batch of cells was stained with antibodies of A20, EEA1, and LAMP2. The results showed that A20+ EEA1+ and A20+ EEA1+ LAMP2+ immune products, but no A20+ LAMP2+ immune products, were observed (Fig. 4C). The results indicate that A20 is involved in the fusion of endosome and lysosome.TABLE 1Quantified data of immune staining in nasal epithelial cellsNumber of particlesSEB/EEA1aNumbers in parentheses indicate number of cells.SEB/EEA1/LAMP2aNumbers in parentheses indicate number of cells.%%Immune stainingA20+ cell86644.26 (5.8)51.63 (4.8)A20− cell89785.23 (8.2)*5.44 (6.1)*Number of particlesA20/EEA1A20/EEA1/LAMP2%%Immune stainingA20+ cell88241.55 (5.3)55.6 (7.4)a Numbers in parentheses indicate number of cells. Open table in a new tab The present data reveal a novel mechanism by which nasal epithelial cells process the absorbed microbial product, SEB. Upon the absorption of SEB, nasal epithelial cells express A20, which facilitates the fusion of endosome and lysosome and promotes the degradation of the absorbed SEB. Deficiency of A20 interferes with the fusion of endosome and lysosome, resulting in the endocytic SEB being un-degraded and being transported across the epithelial barrier. SEB is a superantigen; it is capable of activating T cells directly to trigger skewed immune response (18Niebuhr M. Mamerow D. Heratizadeh A. Satzger I. Werfel T. Staphylococcal α-toxin induces a higher T cell proliferation and interleukin-31 in atopic dermatitis.Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2011; 156: 412-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SEB can also act as an immune adjuvant to promote immune responses such as the induction of the hypersensitivity (5Forbes-Blom E. Camberis M. Prout M. Tang S.C. Le Gros G. Staphylococcal-derived superantigen enhances peanut-induced Th2 responses in the skin.Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2012; 42: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Yang P.C. Xing Z. Berin C.M.

SEB is produced by S. aureus. The nasal mucosa is one of the sites at which S. aureus commonly colonizes (19Thienhaus M.L. Wohlers J. Podschun R. Hedderich J. Ambrosch P. Laudien M. Antimicrobial peptides in nasal secretion and mucosa with respect to Staphylococcus aureus colonization in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.Rhinology. 2011; 49: 554-561PubMed Google Scholar), which can be a source of SEB. Applying SEB to the nasal mucosa directly facilitates the development of nasal hypersensitivity (20Moon I.J. Hong S.L. Kim D.Y. Lee C.H. Rhee C.S. Min Y.G. Blocking interleukin-17 attenuates enhanced inflammation by staphylococcal enterotoxin B in murine allergic rhinitis model.Acta Otolaryngol. 2012; 132: S6-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and airway mucosal sensitization (21Huvenne W.

Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B facilitates allergic sensitization in experimental asthma.Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2010; 40: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This information implies that the nasal epithelial cells can absorb SEB from the nasal cavity. The present study has proved the inference that nasal epithelial cells indeed absorb SEB. We expected that SEB would be converted to the basal side of the epithelial monolayers. However, this was not shown by the data. The amounts of SEB in the basal chamber of the Transwell were below detectable levels. The phenomenon indicates that the amounts of SEB converted to the basal chambers of Transwell inserts are very small if there is any. The amounts of A20 in the epithelial cells were also increased upon exposure to SEB, which was in parallel to the absorption of SEB in the cells. This is in line with previous studies; Hitotsumatsu et al. (22Hitotsumatsu O. Ahmad R.C. Tavares R. Wang M. Philpott D. Turer E.E. Lee B.L. Shiffin N. Advincula R. Malynn B.A. Werts C. Ma A. The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 restricts nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2-triggered signals.Immunity. 2008; 28: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of A20 was increased in macrophages upon the exposure to a microbial product, peptidoglycan. The biological significance of the increase in A20 is to limit the activities of the nuclear factor-κB in the cells to avoid potential injury caused by the microbial products (22Hitotsumatsu O. Ahmad R.C. Tavares R. Wang M. Philpott D. Turer E.E. Lee B.L. Shiffin N. Advincula R. Malynn B.A. Werts C. Ma A. The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 restricts nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2-triggered signals.Immunity. 2008; 28: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that the increase in A20 may facilitate the degradation of the absorbed SEB in the epithelial cells. The subsequent data support the inference; the A20-deficient nasal epithelial monolayers converted significantly more amounts of SEB to the basal chambers of Transwell inserts. This inference is also supported by a previous study that indicates A20 plays a role in tethering endosomes and lysosomes to facilitate the endosome/lysosome fusion (14Li L. Soetandyo N. Wang Q. Ye Y. The zinc finger protein A20 targets TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our data are in line with the study by showing that the SEB-carrying endosome/lysosome fusion was inhibited by knockdown of A20 in the nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we observed much lower levels of A20 in the nasal epithelium from patients with chronic allergic and non-allergic rhinitis; the data indirectly indicate that the insufficient amount of A20 may contribute to the pathogenesis of the chronic inflammation in the nasal mucosa. This inference is supported by a recent publication indicating that knocking out the gene of A20 from intestinal epithelial cells resulted in severe inflammation in the intestine (17Vereecke L. Sze M. Mc Guire C. Rogiers B. Chu Y. Schmidt-Supprian M. Pasparakis M. Beyaert R. van Loo G. Enterocyte-specific A20 deficiency sensitizes to tumor necrosis factor-induced toxicity and experimental colitis.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The nasal epithelium directly faces the exterior environment. The airborne antigens and microbial products can physically contract the nasal epithelial cells. As shown by the present study, the nasal epithelial cells can endocytose SEB, an example of microbial products. The results indicate that the nasal epithelial cells should have the ability to degrade the endocytic cargo. The results showed that the nasal epithelial cells did have such a capacity to degrade the endocytic SEB. The results also showed that after being endocytosed, the SEB was wrapped by the plasma membrane to form endosomes. Our previous studies also showed a similar phenomenon in which intestinal epithelial cells endocytosed protein antigens to form endosomes in the cells (10Berin M.C. Kiliaan A.J. Yang P.C. Groot J.A. Taminiau J.A. Perdue M.H. Rapid transepithelial antigen transport in rat jejunum: impact of sensitization and the hypersensitivity reaction.Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 856-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Yang P.C.

Invest. 2000; 106: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); such endosomes were also observed in rat nasal epithelial cells (24Yang P.C. Zeng H.Y. Zhang T.Y. Zheng Y.Q. Chen J.Z. The effects of sensitization and hypersensitivity reaction on transepithelial antigen transport of rat nasal mucosa.Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001; 125: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The present data show that the endocytic SEB can be degraded within the naive nasal epithelial cells, but cannot be degraded in the A20-deficient epithelial cells. The endocytic SEB is thus transported across the epithelial monolayer. Similar phenomena were observed previously; under allergic environment, the epithelial layer actively transports specific antigens to the subepithelial region (9Yang P.C. Berin M.C. Perdue M.H. Enhanced antigen transport across rat tracheal epithelium induced by sensitization and mast cell activation.J. immunol. 1999; 163: 2769-2776PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yang P.C. Zeng H.Y. Zhang T.Y.

The effects of sensitization and hypersensitivity reaction on transepithelial antigen transport of rat nasal mucosa.Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001; 125: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We also observed that the expression of A20 was significantly less in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis; thus, these epithelial layers may have hyperpermeability to airborne antigens and microbial products. Further investigations are needed to prove this. After endocytosis, the early antigen-carrying endosomes fuse each other to form late endosomes and finally fuse to lysosomes (12Mellman I. Endocytosis and molecular sorting.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 13Lafourcade C. Sobo K. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Garin J. van der Goot F.G. Regulation of the V-ATPase along the endocytic pathway occurs through reversible subunit association and membrane localization.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); the endocytic antigens are thus degraded by the acidic hydrolases of lysosomes (12Mellman I. Endocytosis and molecular sorting.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 13Lafourcade C. Sobo K. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Garin J. van der Goot F.G. Regulation of the V-ATPase along the endocytic pathway occurs through reversible subunit association and membrane localization.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed an interesting phenomenon that most SEB-carrying endosomes fused with lysosomes in the A20-sufficient epithelial cells, whereas far fewer SEB-carrying endosomes fused with lysosomes in those A20-deficient epithelial cells. The results imply that A20 is required in the fusion of endosome and lysosome. Similar phenomena were also observed in previous studies; Li et al. (14Li L. Soetandyo N. Wang Q. Ye Y. The zinc finger protein A20 targets TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that A20 was capable of targeting an associated signaling molecule such as TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation. We also observed that the endocytic SEB could also pass across the A20-sufficient epithelial monolayer in the presence of lysosome inhibitor. The results indicate that SEB is not degraded by A20 directly, but by the A20 deficiency-interfered endosome/lysosome fusion, which was supported by the immunocytochemistry data as shown by the present study. In summary, the present study reveals that nasal epithelial cells can endocytose SEB, which can be degraded in the cells with the aid of A20. Knockdown of A20 increases the SEB flux to the basal side of the nasal epithelial monolayers by interfering with the fusion of endosome/lysosome in the epithelial cells."

There were 38 cases of moderate keratitis with infiltrates between 3 to 6 mm in diameter and depth of infiltration not exceeding the inner 1/3 of the cornea. After excluding 5 patients with incomplete follow-up data, 13 patients who received early keratectomy within 1 week of admission were compared with a group of 20 patients treated medically. The significance of the association between early keratectomy and visual acuity, progression to perforation, secondary glaucoma and cataract formation, adjuvant therapy, hospitalization days and cost were assessed. There were no differences between the keratectomy and medication groups in regards to age, sex, presence of systemic diseases, and hypopyon formation on presentation. The early keratectomy group had a shorter hospital stay than the medical therapy group. Disease duration was significantly lower in the early keratectomy group (median: 29.0 vs. 54.5 days, P<0.001). Median hospitalization costs per patient were lower with early keratectomy (mean ward fee: 15175.4 vs. 44159.5 NTD, P<0.001; mean donor fee: 0 vs. 900.0 NTD, P<0.001), primarily because of reductions in hospital stay. More patients in the medication group developed perforations than in the keratectomy group (20% vs. 0%, respectively) and the perforation-free rate was higher in those with early keratectomy, but the results were not statistically significant.Early keratectomy in moderate Fusarium keratitis may reduce length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and perforation rates."

https://openalex.org/W1964526188,"How signals from fatty acid metabolism are translated into changes in food intake remains unclear. Previously we reported that mice with a genetic inactivation of Acads (acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, short-chain), the enzyme responsible for mitochondrial beta-oxidation of C4-C6 short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), shift consumption away from fat and toward carbohydrate when offered a choice between diets. In the current study, we sought to indentify candidate genes and pathways underlying the effects of SCFA oxidation deficiency on food intake in Acads-/- mice.We performed a transcriptional analysis of gene expression in brain tissue of Acads-/- and Acads+/+ mice fed either a high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) diet for 2 d. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed three top-scoring pathways significantly modified by genotype or diet: oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CREB signaling in neurons. A comparison of statistically significant responses in HF Acads-/- vs. HF Acads+/+ (3917) and Acads+/+ HF vs. LF Acads+/+ (3879) revealed 2551 genes or approximately 65% in common between the two experimental comparisons. All but one of these genes were expressed in opposite direction with similar magnitude, demonstrating that HF-fed Acads-deficient mice display transcriptional responses that strongly resemble those of Acads+/+ mice fed LF diet. Intriguingly, genes involved in both AMP-kinase regulation and the neural control of food intake followed this pattern. Quantitative RT-PCR in hypothalamus confirmed the dysregulation of genes in these pathways. Western blotting showed an increase in hypothalamic AMP-kinase in Acads-/- mice and HF diet increased, a key protein in an energy-sensing cascade that responds to depletion of ATP.Our results suggest that the decreased beta-oxidation of short-chain fatty acids in Acads-deficient mice fed HF diet produces a state of energy deficiency in the brain and that AMP-kinase may be the cellular energy-sensing mechanism linking fatty acid oxidation to feeding behavior in this model."
https://openalex.org/W1972556415,"In recent centuries and above all over the last few decades, human activities have generated perturbations (from mild to very severe or catastrophes) that, when added to those of natural origin, constitute a global threat to biodiversity. Predicting the effects of anthropogenic perturbations on species and communities is a great scientific challenge given the complexity of ecosystems and the need for detailed population data from both before and after the perturbations. Here we present three cases of well-documented anthropogenic severe perturbations (different forms of habitat loss and deterioration influencing fertility and survival) that have affected three species of birds (a raptor, a scavenger and a waterbird) for which we possess long-term population time series. We tested whether the perturbations caused serious population decline or whether the study species were resilient, that is, its population dynamics were relatively unaffected. Two of the species did decline, although to a relatively small extent with no shift to a state of lower population numbers. Subsequently, these populations recovered rapidly and numbers reached similar levels to before the perturbations. Strikingly, in the third species a strong breakpoint took place towards greater population sizes, probably due to the colonization of new areas by recruits that were queuing at the destroyed habitat. Even though it is difficult to draw patterns of resilience from only three cases, the study species were all long-lived, social species with excellent dispersal and colonization abilities, capable of skipping reproduction and undergoing a phase of significant long-term population increase. The search for such patterns is crucial for optimizing the limited resources allocated to conservation and for predicting the future impact of planned anthropogenic activities on ecosystems."

However, the optimal way of fusing the resulting kernel functions is usually unknown in practical applications. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) techniques allow to determine an optimal linear combination of such similarity matrices. Classical approaches to MKL promote sparse mixtures. Unfortunately, so-called 1-norm MKL variants are often observed to be outperformed by an unweighted sum kernel. The contribution of this paper is twofold: We apply a recently developed non-sparse MKL variant to state-of-the-art concept recognition tasks within computer vision. We provide insights on benefits and limits of non-sparse MKL and compare it against its direct competitors, the sum kernel SVM and the sparse MKL. We report empirical results for the PASCAL VOC 2009 Classification and ImageCLEF2010 Photo Annotation challenge data sets. About to be submitted to PLoS ONE."
https://openalex.org/W2071070576,"Myosin VI, the only known minus-ended actin filament-dependent motor, plays diverse cellular roles both as a processive motor and as a mechanical anchor. Although myosin VI has a short lever arm containing only one ""IQ-motif"" and a unique insertion for CaM binding, the motor walks with large and variable step sizes of ∼30-36 nm. Here, we show that the previously predicted coiled-coil domain immediately following the IQ-motifs (referred to as the lever arm extension (LAE)) adopts a stable monomeric, three-helix bundle fold in solution. Importantly, the LAE can undergo reversible, lipid membrane-dependent conformational changes. Upon exposure to lipid membranes, the LAE adopts a partially extended rod shape, and the removal of lipids from the LAE converts it back into the compact helix bundle structure. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that lipid membrane binding may initiate unfolding and thereby trigger the LAE expansion. This reversible, lipid membrane-dependent expansion of the LAE provides a mechanistic base for myosin VI to walk with large and variable step sizes."
