https://openalex.org/W2152351059,"Electrophoretic and autoradiographic analyses of the incorporation of 35S--methionine into newly synthesized proteins during myogenesis reveal that presumptive chicken myoblasts synthesize primarily one intermediate filament protein: vimentin. Desmin synthesis is initiated at the onset of fusion. Synthesis rates of both filament subunits increase during the first three days in culture, relative to the total protein synthesis rate. The observed increase in the rate of desmin synthesis (at least 10 fold) is significantly greater than that observed for vimentin, and is responsible for a net increase in the cellular desmin content relative to vimentin. Both filament subunits continue to be synthesized through at least 20 days in culture. Immunofluorescent staining using desmin- and vimentin-specific antisera supports the conclusion that desmin is synthesized only in fusing or multinucleate cells. These results indicate that the synthesis of the two filament subunits is not coordinately regulated during myogenesis. The distributions of desmin and vimentin in multinucleate chicken myotubes are indistinguishable, as determined by double immunofluorescence techniques. In early myotubes, both proteins are found in an intricate network of free cytoplasmic filaments. Later in myogenesis, several days after the appearance of alpha--actinin-containing Z line striations, both filament proteins become associated with the Z lines of newly assembled myofibrils, with a corresponding decrease in the number of cytoplasmic filaments. This transition corresponds to the time when the alpha--actinin-containing Z lines become aligned laterally. These data suggest that the two intermediate filament systems, desmin and vimentin, have an important role in the lateral organization and registration of myofibrils and that the synthesis of desmin and assembly of desmin-containing intermediate filaments during myogenesis is directly related to these functions. These results also indicate that the Z disc is assembled in at least two distinct steps during myogenesis."

Slices from male rats show increased excitability to estradiol and not to testosterone. Slices from female rats are not affected by estradiol, but slices from female rats in diestrus show increased excitability in response to testosterone whereas slices from females in proestrus show decreased excitability."

https://openalex.org/W2037355625,"Striking changes in the pattern of protein synthesis occur shortly after the fertilization of Spisula solidissima oocytes. These changes include a strong reduction in the synthesis of prominent oocyte-specific proteins and a large increase in the synthesis of at least three proteins whose labeling dominates the pattern of protein synthesis in early embryos. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that these changes are modulated at the translational level: 1.—Oocytes and embryos contain identical sets of mRNA, as measured by cell-free translation of phenol-extracted RNA from the two developmental stages. 2.—Different sets of these messages are associated with ribosomes at the two stages. 3.—Cell-free translation of mixtures of the unextracted 12,000 × g supernatants of oocyte or embryo homogenates with reticulocyte lysate gives patterns of protein synthesis that accurately resemble the patterns of synthesis from intact cells of the cognate stage, despite the fact that these homogenates contain identical sets of mRNA. These results provide strong evidence that the alterations in the pattern of protein synthesis at fertilization are due to stage-specific utilization of different subsets of messenger RNA from a common maternal mRNA population at the two stages of development. The fact that phenol extraction of these mRNAs renders them all equally available for translation in the reticulocyte lysate implies that discrimination is achieved by selective repression of availability by some phenol-soluble component of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969148166,"Estrogen was administered to male rats that had received unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum. Following this treatment, their duration of rotation increased in response to amphetamine. Estrogen treatment resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of striatal dopamine receptors. Therefore, both behavioral and biochemical evidence suggests that striatal dopamine function is influenced by peripherally administered estrogens. These results are relevant to the clinical cases of chorea associated with elevated concentrations of estrogen, which occur in pregnancy and during oral contraceptive use."
https://openalex.org/W2029115611,"Infant rat pups, fed through intragastric cannulas from postnatal day 4 through day 18, showed a 19 percent reduction in total brain weight when ethanol was included in their diet on days 4 through 7. This reduction in brain weight occurred even though body growth in the experimental rats was equal to that of their littermate controls. The ethanol-exposed animals were markedly hypoactive during the period of drug administration, then displayed gross body tremors for 3 to 5 days. Throughout the study, the animals treated with ethanol had poor motor coordination and were hyperresponsive. These brain and behavioral effects appear similar to those seen in fetal alcohol syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2004924083,"In rats, multiple daily amphetamine injections (2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, injected subcutaneously every 4 hours for 5 days) resulted in a progressive augmentation in response, characterized by a more rapid onset and an increased magnitude of stereotypy. By contrast, offset times of both the stereotypy and the poststereotypy hyperactivity periods were markedly shortened. When the animals were retested with the same dose of amphetamine 8 days after the long-term treatment was discontinued, the time of offset of the stereotypy and hyperactivity phases had recovered to values found with short-term amphetamine treatment, whereas the more rapid onset of stereotypy persisted. Brain monoamine and amphetamine concentrations and tyrosine hydroxylase activity were determined in comparably treated rats at times corresponding to the behavioral observations. The behavioral data indicate that enhanced responsiveness to amphetamine following its repeated administration may contribute to the development of amphetamine psychosis."

https://openalex.org/W2005787819,The male gamete of the parasitic protozoan Diplauxis hatti has a flagellum consisting of three doublet microtubules. This flagellum exhibits a helicoidal waveform in which bends propagate toward the tip with a frequency of about 1.5 hertz. It is the simplest motile eukaryotic flagellum yet described.
https://openalex.org/W2159622712,"Abstract We have studied plasminogen activator (PA) synthesis in fibroblast cultures exposed to ultraviolet light (UV) and to several agents that produce DNA damage. PA synthesis was induced by UV in chicken, hamster, rat, mouse and human fibroblasts. The rate of enzyme synthesis, like the inhibition of 3 H-thymidine incorporation, was a first-order function of UV fluence, and the UV sensitivity of these responses was very similar. The kinetics of PA induction after UV were much slower and the duration of synthesis much longer than following brief exposure to other inducing agents such as hormones, retinoids, tumor promoters or transforming viral genes; the ultimate level of PA production was in the same range as that induced by tumor promoters or viral transformation. PA synthesis was also induced by other agents that produce DNA damage. Those tested were neocarzinostatin, N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, arabinosyl cytosine, mitomycin C and methyl methanesulfonate, some of which induce DNA repair of the long and others of the short type. These effects were not due merely to inhibition of DNA synthesis since they did not occur in cultures exposed to 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine or methotrexate. Chick myotubes are post-mitotic cells in which DNA replication is permanently repressed, and they did not synthesize PA following exposure to DNA-damaging agents or UV. We discuss the potential relationship of PA production to post-irradiation inflammation and to the induction of DNA repair functions of the SOS type."

https://openalex.org/W2095495747,"Urine produced by wild female house mice, living in high- and low-density populations and confined to areas within a highway cloverleaf, was tested for its ability to delay puberty in juvenile female mice. Only urine collected from females in the dense population at its maximum density delayed puberty in test females. Urine collected when the population was less dense, or from a population that remained sparse, failed to delay puberty. These results suggest that a urinary factor present at high densities may delay puberty and thus help to slow further population growth."

Both growth hormone and triiodothyronine also restore lens cell proliferation in vivo but not in vitro. Somatomedin-like activity in frog serum is diminished by hypophysectomy and is restored by growth hormone and triiodothyronine.

Other perinatal factors, such as birth weight and gestational age, are related more to the amount of fetal drug exposure than to the type."
https://openalex.org/W1518595107,"With a view to the potential biological significance of iron binding by the phosphoprotein phosvitin, the interaction of these two electrostatically complementary constituents of egg yolk particles was studied by ultrafiltration, circular dichroism, and sedimentation. Ferric complexes of phosvitin are strong and stable; ferrous complexes are weak and dissociate readily. When saturated, pairs of the approximately 135 phosphate groups of a phosvitin molecule appear to bind 1 iron atom each. These findings confirm and extend previous reports regarding the ferric complex and characterize the ferrous complex for the first time. The iron binding sites are not equivalent. Contrary to previous speculations, iron binding is not accompanied by a conformational change from an unordered structure to one of the beta-type. Apparently, neutralization of negative charges, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition of this transition. Nevertheless, iron affects phosvitin structure. Above pH 2, where the protein is unordered but adjusts its average conformation to changes in its net charge as the pH of its solution is varied, iron mimics the effect of protons quantitatively. Near pH 2, where the beta-type conformation is readily acquired by the protein in the absence of iron, the consequences of iron binding upon conformation are determined by the manner in which the iron-phosvitin interaction is brought about. Either the extent of the transition to the normal beta-structure becomes limited or the nature of the resulting conformation becomes modified. It is noteworthy that ellipticity changes in the presence of iron do not necessarily occur in parallel at about 200 and 215 nm as they do when the transconformation is produced by pH changes alone. The binding of iron appears to be mostly intramolecular. Intermolecular cross-links become dominant only if most binding sites are filled and then only as a secondary event subsequent to binding and the initial conformational adjustment."

Their brains contained an excess of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, and their livers a nine- to tenfold excess of sphingomyelin and cholesterol. A total deficiency of lysosomal (pH 5.0) sphingomyelinase was found in the leukocytes, liver, and brain of the cats, although the activity of the microsomal (pH 7.4, magnesium-dependent) sphingomyelinase was normal in brain. These cats appear to have a genetic disease identical to Niemann-Pick disease type A."
https://openalex.org/W2013714589,"Intermediate filaments from squid brain tissue were reassembled in vitro and purified by two cycles of assembly and disassembly. Purified squid brain filaments contained one major polypeptide (60,000 daltons), which constituted about 70 percent of the total protein, and three minor polypeptides (74,000, 100,000, and 220,000 daltons). Squid brain intermediate filaments were reconstituted from rod-shaped protofilamentous subunits. In addition to the intermediate filaments, dense bodies which may function in intermediate filament nucleation or organization were retained through two purification cycles."

Analysis of the data revealed no evidence for heritability of olfactory sensitivity. However, factors significantly associated with odor perception included cigar, pipe, and cigarette smoking; body fatness; alcohol consumption; and diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W2124750402,"Abstract A partial library of cloned human DNA was screened for sequences represented on and specific to the X chromosome. The library was constructed from Bam HI-digested human DNA from cells with X chromosome polyploidy, and was cloned in pBR322. The screening was performed by individually hybridizing 32 P-labeled cloned plasmids to Southern blots containing Bam HI-digested DNA from mouse-human hybrid cells having the human X chromosome and from derivative hybrids lacking the human X. Of 45 clones assayed, 33 contained sequences homologous to ones represented many times on the X. In situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes demonstrated that at least four of these clones were homologous to autosomes as well. Only one of the 18 clones of this kind tested cross-hybridized with another. Two recombinant plasmids were shown to be derived from the X chromosome and to be X chromosome-specific by three criteria: they hybridized to a single band in the Southern blots of Bam HI-digested DNA from hybrid cells containing the X chromosome; they hybridized to a band of the same molecular weight as did the inserted DNA fragment; and they showed a dosage effect when hybridized to Southern blots of Bam HI-digested DNA from XY and XXX cells. One of these hybridized as a single-copy or low-order reiterated sequence in a Cot analysis using male DNA as driver. Our methods can be applied to the identification of any chromosome-specific clone. The two X-specific clones identified here should be useful in investigating the mechanism of X inactivation and in isolating a Barr body."
https://openalex.org/W1979079768,"Monozygotic twins developed from cultured murine blastocysts at the ratio of approximately 1:100. The locus at which the denuded blastocysts attached to the culture dish was usually a random section of their mural trophoblasts, in which case single egg cylinders developed unilaterally. However, in those few blastocysts attaching with their antipolar mural trophoblasts, the inner cell mass became subdivided into two parts because of restrictions imposed on its growth by the apically situated polar trophoblasts and the plastic substrate. Each subdivision apparently incorporated totipotent cells, resulting in the bilateral formation of two egg cylinders sharing the same ectoplacental cone."

https://openalex.org/W1967497452,"The main features of alcoholic rhabdomyolysis-skeletal muscle necrosis, marked elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase, and myoglobinuria-were produced in rats by a combination of relatively prolonged (2 to 4 weeks) exposure to ethanol and a brief period of food deprivation. This observation suggests that fasting may similarly trigger muscle injury during binge drinking in man. The effect of fasting is in part related to an increase in blood alcohol due to reduced alcohol clearance and in part caused by a fasting-induced potentiation of the toxic effects of high concentrations of alcohol of skeletal muscle."

When prematurely separated female rats grow to adulthood and mate with stock males, their normally reared F1 progeny also have increased susceptibility to restraint-induced erosions. Cross-fostering studies show that prenatal rather than postnatal factors transmit this susceptibility to the F1 progeny."

https://openalex.org/W1278985172,The stoichiometry of the interaction between prealbumin and retinol-binding protein was investigated. Gel chromatography analyses of prealbumin on columns equilibrated with retinol-binding protein (RBP)-containing buffers and fluorescence polarization analyses of RBP in the presence of various concentrations of prealbumin demonstrated that 3 molecules of RBP could simultaneously bind to prealbumin. Each RBP molecule seemed to interact with prealbumin with an apparent association constant of about 7.8 X 10(6) M-1. Fab fragments of anti-iudiotypic antibodies raised against anti-RBP antibodies reaced specifically with the RBP-binding sites on prealbumin. Two anti-idiotypic Fab fragments could simultaneously interact with prealbumin. These data strongly suggest that prealbumin exhibits at least two RBP-binding sites.
https://openalex.org/W1539526971,"The thermodynamics of both normal and abnormal (disease-associated) protein solubility has been examined. It is shown that the atypical behavior of monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulins can be explained by the formation of one or a few additional electrostatic contacts or, less frequently, a larger number of van der Waals interactions in the protein-rich solid phase relative to normal immunoglobulin. It is hypothesized that cryoimmunoglobulins represent the outer edge of the solubility distribution of total serum immunoglobulin."

https://openalex.org/W1575922693,"Abstract The binding of 2-nonanone to bovine serum albumin exhibited positive cooperativity at low molal ratios of binding, indicating stabilization of the hydrophobic binding sites at low concentrations of 2-nonanone. The degree of cooperativity was affected by the type of anion present as evidenced from the changes in the Hill coefficient. The effectiveness of anions in increasing the Hill coefficient followed the Hofmeister series for anions, i.e. F- < SO42- < Cl- < Br- < SCN- < Cl3CCOO-. Also, the positive cooperativity decreased as the pH was increased from 3.0 to 7.0. The possible mechanism for the changes in the positive cooperativity of 2-nonanone binding to albumin in the presence of anions is discussed in terms of the stabilizing effect of ketones at low concentrations (Asakura, T., Adachi, K., and Schwartz, E. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6423-6425) and the destabilizing effect of lyotropic anions on protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W4240295856,"In rats, multiple daily amphetamine injections (2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, injected subcutaneously every 4 hours for 5 days) resulted in a progressive augmentation in response, characterized by a more rapid onset and an increased magnitude of stereotypy.

When the animals were retested with the same dose of amphetamine 8 days after the long-term treatment was discontinued, the time of offset of the stereotypy and hyperactivity phases had recovered to values found with short-term amphetamine treatment, whereas the more rapid onset of stereotypy persisted. Brain monoamine and amphetamine concentrations and tyrosine hydroxylase activity were determined in comparably treated rats at times corresponding to the behavioral observations. The behavioral data indicate that enhanced responsiveness to amphetamine following its repeated administration may contribute to the development of amphetamine psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977757117,"Interactions of the plasma membrane with the cytoskeleton are required for diverse cellular functions such as adhesion, division, secretion, endocytosis and chemotaxis. We therefore investigated whether the reversible assembly of microtubules and/or microfilaments in leukocytes affected the synthesis of a key membrane component, phosphatidylcholine. The effects of a variety of antitubuin and antimicrofilament agents on phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the methylation of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and its formation through CDP-choline were studied. The antitubulins inhibited the incorporation of 3H-methyl groups into phosphatidylethanolamine in guinea pig macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes by as much as 64%, while cytochalasin B, an antimicrofilament agent, had no effect. In contrast, the incorporation of methyl-3H-choline into phosphatidylcholine was stimulated in these cells by as much as 2 fold by the anti-tubulins. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in a nonphagocytic cell type, splenic lymphocytes, was not altered in the presence of the antitubulin agents. Changes in the state of polymerization of cellular tubulin pools associated with certain specialized functions of cells may, through effects on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, alter local membrane composition, microviscosity, or the interaction of membrane proteins with their environment."

https://openalex.org/W2151133743,"Surface aromatic residues of bovine alpha-lactalbumin were detected by laser photo-CIDNP NMR spectroscopy in the submillimolar (100 micro M) range. The association behavior of this protein was observed in this range (Kd approximately equal to 100 micro M) by the variation in absolute NMR peak intensities for surface polarized residues as the monomer-monomer association step lowered surface residue accessibilities. This example was also the first case reported for laser photo-CIDNP studies of proteins where all three polarizable aromatic residues (tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine) were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2105246211,"The reaction catalyzed by bovine L-glutamate dehydrogenase is subjected to allosteric activation by ADP. We have measured the thermodynamic parameters (delta G0, delta H0, delta S0, and delta Cp) of the formation of the various possible binary and ternary complexes formed between the enzyme, NADPH, and either ADP or its analogs, adenosine, AMP, and ATP. delta H0 and delta Cp have been measured by flow calorimetry; delta G0 values obtained by calorimetry itself, differences spectroscopy, or gel filtration have been selected on the basis of accuracy under the conditions required for the formation of each complex. The data are interpreted in terms of parameters, the differences between the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of a ternary complex and the sum of those of the two related binary complexes. Both adnosine and ATP appear to loosen the binding of NADPH by simply preventing a subsite interaction of NADPH. AMP appears to have only minor and probably secondary effects. The negative effect of the binding of ADP on that of NADPH, however, involves the formation of a new interaction, which is exothermic, entropy compensated, has a moderately large negative delta Cp, and does not occur in either binary complex."

https://openalex.org/W1525351298,"A human fibrosarcoma cell line, 8387, produces and secretes multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA)-like polypeptide growth factors, which are associated with a high molecular weight binding protein. The purification of 8387-MSA involved concentration of serum-free media conditioned by 8387 cells, dialysis, and chromatography of the acid-soluble growth-promoting activity on Bio-Gel P-100 in 1 M acetic acid and subsequently on carboxymethylcellulose. The purification was followed by a radioreceptor assay specific for MSA and an assay for growth-stimulating activity. Both activities chromatographed through the purification steps of 8387-MSA. 8387-MSA competes with 125I-labeled rat MSA for binding on rat cells with a specific activity 5 times lower than that of rat MSA and stimulates [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA of normal rat fibroblasts at comparable concentrations. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the MSA-competing activity co-migrated with a single band of protein that behaved heterogeneously on discpolyacrylamide gels in the presence of 6 M urea, yielding two bands associated with biological activity. 8387-MSA is a single chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 14,500."
