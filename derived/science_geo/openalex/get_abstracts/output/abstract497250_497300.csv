https://openalex.org/W2060161265,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a class of riboregulators that either directly act in long form or are processed to shorter miRNAs and siRNAs. Emerging evidence shows that lncRNAs participate in stress responsive regulation. In this study, to identify the putative maize lncRNAs responsive to drought stress, 8449 drought responsive transcripts were first uploaded to the Coding Potential Calculator website for classification as protein coding or non-coding RNAs, and 1724 RNAs were identified as potential non-coding RNAs. A Perl script was written to screen these 1724 ncRNAs and 664 transcripts were ultimately identified as drought-responsive lncRNAs. Of these 664 transcripts, 126 drought-responsive lncRNAs were highly similar to known maize lncRNAs; the remaining 538 transcripts were considered as novel lncRNAs. Among the 664 lncRNAs identified as drought responsive, 567 were upregulated and 97 were downregulated in drought-stressed leaves of maize. 8 lncRNAs were identified as miRNA precursor lncRNAs, 62 were classified as both shRNA and siRNA precursors, and 279 were classified as siRNA precursors. The remaining 315 lncRNAs were classified as other lncRNAs that are likely to function as longer molecules. Among these 315 lncRNAs, 10 are identified as antisense lncRNAs and 7 could pair with 17 CDS sequences with near-perfect matches. Finally, RT-qPCR results confirmed that all selected lncRNAs could respond to drought stress. These findings extend the current view on lncRNAs as ubiquitous regulators under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2062068818,"Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) plays a vital role in achieving global child survival targets. Effective treatment programmes are available but little is known about longer term outcomes following programme discharge.From July 2006 to March 2007, 1024 children (median age 21.5 months, IQR 15-32) contributed 1187 admission episodes to an inpatient-based SAM treatment centre in Blantyre, Malawi. Long term outcomes, were determined in a longitudinal cohort study, a year or more after initial programme discharge. We found information on 88%(899/1024).In total, 42%(427/1024) children died during or after treatment. 25%(105/427) of deaths occurred after normal programme discharge, >90 days after admission. Mortality was greatest among HIV seropositive children: 62%(274/445). Other risk factors included age <12 months; severity of malnutrition at admission; and disability. In survivors, weight-for-height and weight-for-age improved but height-for-age remained low, mean -2.97 z-scores (SD 1.3).Although SAM mortality in this setting was unacceptably high, our findings offer important lessons for future programming, policy and research. First is the need for improved programme evaluation: most routine reporting systems would have missed late deaths and underestimated total mortality due to SAM. Second, a more holistic view of SAM is needed: while treatment will always focus on nutritional interventions, it is vital to also identify and manage underlying clinical conditions such as HIV and disability. Finally early identification and treatment of SAM should be emphasised: our results suggest that this could improve longer term as well as short term outcomes. As international policy and programming becomes increasingly focused on stunting and post-malnutrition chronic disease outcomes, SAM should not be forgotten. Proactive prevention and treatment services are essential, not only to reduce mortality in the short term but also because they have potential to impact on longer term morbidity, growth and development of survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2093481377,"Loss of muscle proteins and the consequent weakness has important clinical consequences in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, chronic heart failure, and in aging. In fact, excessive proteolysis causes cachexia, accelerates disease progression, and worsens life expectancy. Muscle atrophy involves a common pattern of transcriptional changes in a small subset of genes named atrophy-related genes or atrogenes. Whether microRNAs play a role in the atrophy program and muscle loss is debated. To understand the involvement of miRNAs in atrophy we performed miRNA expression profiling of mouse muscles under wasting conditions such as fasting, denervation, diabetes, and cancer cachexia. We found that the miRNA signature is peculiar of each catabolic condition. We then focused on denervation and we revealed that changes in transcripts and microRNAs expression did not occur simultaneously but were shifted. Indeed, whereas transcriptional control of the atrophy-related genes peaks at 3 days, changes of miRNA expression maximized at 7 days after denervation. Among the different miRNAs, microRNA-206 and -21 were the most induced in denervated muscles. We characterized their pattern of expression and defined their role in muscle homeostasis. Indeed, in vivo gain and loss of function experiments revealed that miRNA-206 and miRNA-21 were sufficient and required for atrophy program. In silico and in vivo approaches identified transcription factor YY1 and the translational initiator factor eIF4E3 as downstream targets of these miRNAs. Thus miRNAs are important for fine-tuning the atrophy program and their modulation can be a novel potential therapeutic approach to counteract muscle loss and weakness in catabolic conditions."

To explore this phenomenon mechanistically, we examined the impact of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the transcriptomes of both pre-osteoblastic (POBs) and differentiated osteoblastic (OBs) MC3T3-E1 cells, and assessed localization of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) at sites of action on a genome-scale using ChIP sequence analysis. We observed that the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcriptomes of POBs and OBs were quantitatively and qualitatively different, supporting not only the altered biology observed but the potential for a change in VDR interaction at the genome as well. This idea was confirmed through discovery that VDR cistromes in POBs and OBs were also strikingly different. Depletion of VDR-binding sites in OBs, due in part to reduced VDR expression, was the likely cause of the loss of VDR-target gene interaction. Continued novel regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3, however, suggested that factors in addition to the VDR might also be involved. Accordingly, we show that transcriptomic modifications are also accompanied by changes in genome binding of the master osteoblast regulator RUNX2 and the chromatin remodeler CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β. Importantly, genome occupancy was also highlighted by the presence of epigenetic enhancer signatures that were selectively changed in response to both differentiation and 1,25(OH)2D3. The impact of VDR, RUNX2, and C/EBPβ on osteoblast differentiation is exemplified by their actions at the Runx2 and Sp7 gene loci. We conclude that each of these mechanisms may contribute to the diverse actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 on differentiating osteoblasts.

Metab. 2011; 25: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the skeleton, 1,25(OH)2D3 functions both to preserve bone integrity and strength and to create a viable mineral reservoir accessible during times of negative calcium and/or phosphate balance (2Bikle D.D. Vitamin D and bone.Curr. Osteoporos Rep. 2012; 10: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Eisman J.A. Bouillon R. Vitamin D: direct effects of vitamin D metabolites on bone: lessons from genetically modified mice.Bonekey Rep. 2014; 3: 499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These activities are both direct and indirect; accordingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 acts indirectly via the intestine and kidney to maintain the blood levels of calcium and phosphorus necessary for mineralization and directly to modulate bone cell differentiation and function (4Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. Vitamin D, disease and therapeutic opportunities.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 941-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The direct actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 on bone cells are complex and include both cell autonomous and paracrine mechanisms, the latter arising from the ability of the hormone to stimulate or repress the expression of growth factors and cytokines from chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes that affect cells located nearby (2Bikle D.D. Vitamin D and bone.Curr. Osteoporos Rep. 2012; 10: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). One such paracrine factor is receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand that is produced in a variety of bone cell types and plays a paramount role in regulating the formation, activation, function, and survival of hematopoietic cell-derived osteoclasts (5Lacey D.L.

Evidence for these homeostatic actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 derives from studies conducted both in normal rodents in vivo and in VDR- or cytochrome p450 27B1 (CYP27B1)-null mice (9Bouillon R.

Early in vitro studies revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 both stimulated and inhibited osteoblast-lineage cell growth and function depending upon the source of the cells and their initial state of differentiation (2Bikle D.D. Vitamin D and bone.Curr. Osteoporos Rep. 2012; 10: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additional studies have confirmed this pleiotropic effect of the hormone in primary osteoblast preparations, cells of distinct skeletal origin, and in osteoblastic cell lines representative of different stages of maturation. Interestingly, mixed regulatory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been recapitulated both in vivo and ex vivo using osteoblasts derived from the VDR- and/or CYP27B1-null mouse models referred to above (13Amling M.

These studies are more difficult to interpret, however, as the biological effects of the hormone are much more complex in vivo (16Lieben L. Masuyama R. Torrekens S. Van Looveren R. Schrooten J.

In all of these cases, the mechanisms that underlie these dynamic and stage-specific effects of the vitamin D hormone on cells are not well understood. However, these findings have significant implications for the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the skeleton during unique physiological states or in various disease conditions. Regardless of whether 1,25(OH)2D3 functions in an anabolic or catabolic fashion on the skeleton or via direct actions to regulate additional biological activities associated with vitamin D, its actions involve VDR-dependent changes in gene expression. Like many members of this class of DNA binding factors, the VDR functions in a largely 1,25(OH)2D3-controlled manner by interacting directly with vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located within regulatory regions that are linked functionally to specific target genes (17Pike J.W.

Regulation of gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in bone cells: exploiting new approaches and defining new mechanisms.Bonekey Rep. 2014; 3: 482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that in addition to their positions adjacent to gene promoters, enhancers are also frequently located distal to promoter regions (19Meyer M.B. Goetsch P.D. Pike J.W.

Whether located near or far in linear terms from transcriptional start sites (TSS), however, most of these elements appear to function through direct molecular interaction with the promoter regions of their target genes via looping mechanisms (21de Wit E. de Laat W. A decade of 3C technologies: insights into nuclear organization.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Regardless of this detail, VDR binding enables the recruitment of co-regulatory enzyme complexes that are frequently chromatin-active (22Dowd D.R. Sutton A.L. Zhang C. MacDonald P.N. Feldman D.

Meyer M.B. Fundamentals of vitamin D hormone-regulated gene expression.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.11.004Google Scholar). The VDR also participates in the down-regulation of gene expression as well either directly through DNA binding or via protein-protein interaction mechanisms with DNA-bound transcriptional activators that suppress gene expression (24Murayama A. Kim M.S. Yanagisawa J. Takeyama K. Kato S.

Neither of these mechanisms are well understood. The mouse MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast has been utilized for several decades as an inducible in vitro model for studying osteoblast differentiation to the mature cell phenotype (25Sudo H. Kodama H.A.

Recently, we showed that differentiation leads to a significant alteration in the transcriptome of these cells and that this change correlates directly with both a partial redistribution of RUNX2 and C/EBPβ at binding sites across the genome and modifications to the epigenome (28Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Pike J.W. The RUNX2 cistrome in osteoblasts: characterization, down-regulation following differentiation and relationship to gene expression.J. Biol.

In this study, we explore how differentiation affects the transcriptional response of these cells to 1,25(OH)2D3.

The differentiated samples contained substantial mineralized matrix and were subjected to three 15-s pulses with a Polytron Homogenizer (Power Gen 125, Fisher). The resulting sample was sonicated with a microtip sonic dismembrator (Fisher) for three 10-s pulses. 20 μg of sample was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and loaded for samples on Tris-glycine 4–20% gels (Invitrogen).

Cells were cultured for 48 or 72 h, at which point the media were changed, and the cells were treated for an additional 24 h with 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 or ethanol vehicle and processed as indicated above for RNA and RT-qPCR TaqMan analyses. For 24-well reporter assays, cells were harvested, and the lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described below. Luciferase activity was normalized in all cases using β-galactosidase activity. The pCH110-β galactosidase reporter plasmid was previously described (30Kim S. Yamazaki M. Zella L.A. Shevde N.K.

As documented in Fig. 1A, ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate induce bone formation in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts (POB) during a 15-day culture period, a well described outcome that is a manifestation of the mature osteoblast phenotype in vitro. The inclusion of 1,25(OH)2D3 during this time period blocks bone formation, and numerous studies have suggested that this involves an inhibition of differentiation. Surprisingly, however, the impact of osteoblast differentiation on the response of bone cells to 1,25(OH)2D3 has not been systematically explored, despite the suggestion that the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 on osteoblast-lineage cells are stage-specific both in vitro and in vivo (2Bikle D.D. Vitamin D and bone.Curr. Osteoporos Rep. 2012; 10: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To address this issue directly, we treated undifferentiated POB and 15-day differentiated OB MC3T3-E1 cells with either vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 h and then examined the effects of both differentiation and 1,25(OH)2D3 on the two cell types via gene expression profiling. As reported recently, POB differentiation to OBs altered the expression of 721 genes (>2-fold, 95% confidence limit), including the genes for Runx2, Col1a1, Spp1, osteoprotegerin (Tnfrsf11b), parathyroid hormone receptor (Pth1r), podoplanin (E11, Pdpn), and MyoD family inhibitor (Mdfi) (28Meyer M.B.

Interestingly, treatment of POBs and OBs with 1,25(OH)2D3 in this context also resulted in differential gene regulation profiles as well. As summarized in Fig. 1B, the expression of 960 genes was altered (>2-fold, 95% confidence limit) (747 increased and 213 decreased) by 1,25(OH)2D3 in POBs, whereas only 376 were modulated by the hormone (232 increased and 144 decreased) in differentiated OBs. The Venn diagrams (Fig. 1C) demonstrate that although 187 of these genes were up-regulated in common (>2-fold, 95% confidence limit), 560 and 45 genes were uniquely up-regulated in POBs and OBs, respectively. A similar qualitative feature was noted with down-regulated genes. These findings suggest that although a subset of genes are similarly regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in both POBs and OBs, cells also respond uniquely to the hormon"
https://openalex.org/W2006690687,"WRKY transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of plant defense responses. We previously reported that OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. In this study, we identified OsWRKY53 as a substrate of OsMPK3/OsMPK6, components of a fungal PAMP-responsive MAPK cascade in rice, and analyzed the effect of OsWRKY53 phosphorylation on the regulation of basal defense responses to a virulence race of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae strain Ina86-137. An in vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the OsMPK3/OsMPK6 activated by OsMKK4 phosphorylated OsWRKY53 recombinant protein at its multiple clustered serine-proline residues (SP cluster). When OsWRKY53 was coexpressed with a constitutively active mutant of OsMKK4 in a transient reporter gene assay, the enhanced transactivation activity of OsWRKY53 was found to be dependent on phosphorylation of the SP cluster. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 (OsWRKY53SD) showed further-enhanced disease resistance to the blast fungus compared to native OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants, and a substantial number of defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes, were more upregulated in the OsWRKY53SD-overexpressing plants compared to the OsWRKY53-overexpressing plants. These results strongly suggest that the OsMKK4-OsMPK3/OsMPK6 cascade regulates transactivation activity of OsWRKY53, and overexpression of the phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 results in a major change to the rice transcriptome at steady state that leads to activation of a defense response against the blast fungus in rice plants."
https://openalex.org/W2004824524,"Folate intake during pregnancy may affect the regulation of DNA methylation during fetal development. The genomic regions in the offspring that may be sensitive to folate exposure during in utero development have not been characterized. Using genome-scale profiling, we investigated DNA methylation in 2 immune cell types (CD4+ and antigen-presenting cells) isolated from neonatal cord blood, selected on the basis of in utero folate exposure. High-folate (HF; n=11) and low-folate (LF; n=12) groups were selected from opposite extremes of maternal serum folate levels measured in the last trimester of pregnancy. A comparison of these groups revealed differential methylation at 7 regions across the genome. By far, the biggest effect observed was hypomethylation of a 923 bp region 3 kb upstream of the ZFP57 transcript, a regulator of DNA methylation during development, observed in both cell types. Levels of H3/H4 acetylation at ZFP57 promoter and ZFP57 mRNA expression were higher in CD4+ cells in the HF group relative to the LF group. Hypomethylation at this region was replicated in an independent sample set. These data suggest that exposure to folate has effects on the regulation of DNA methylation during fetal development, and this may be important for health and disease.—Amarasekera, M., Martino, D., Ashley, S., Harb, H., Kesper, D., Strickland, D., Saffery, R., Prescott, S.

https://openalex.org/W1999313030,"Colorectal and pancreatic cancers remain important contributors to cancer mortality burden and, therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) extracts and its components have been reported as natural potent antiproliferative agents against cancer cells. However, to potentially apply rosemary as a complementary approach for cancer therapy, additional information regarding the most effective composition, its antitumor effect in vivo and its main molecular mediators is still needed. In this work, five carnosic acid-rich supercritical rosemary extracts with different chemical compositions have been assayed for their antitumor activity both in vivo (in nude mice) and in vitro against colon and pancreatic cancer cells. We found that the antitumor effect of carnosic acid together with carnosol was higher than the sum of their effects separately, which supports the use of the rosemary extract as a whole. In addition, gene and microRNA expression analyses have been performed to ascertain its antitumor mechanism, revealing that up-regulation of the metabolic-related gene GCNT3 and down-regulation of its potential epigenetic modulator miR-15b correlate with the antitumor effect of rosemary. Moreover, plasmatic miR-15b down-regulation was detected after in vivo treatment with rosemary. Our results support the use of carnosic acid-rich rosemary extract as a complementary approach in colon and pancreatic cancer and indicate that GCNT3 expression may be involved in its antitumor mechanism and that miR-15b might be used as a non-invasive biomarker to monitor rosemary anticancer effect."
https://openalex.org/W2100819009,"The voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 1.3 channel is widely regarded as a therapeutic target for immunomodulation in autoimmune diseases. ShK-186, a selective inhibitor of Kv1.3 channels, ameliorates autoimmune diseases in rodent models, and human phase 1 trials of this agent in healthy volunteers have been completed. In this study, we identified and characterized a large family of Stichodactyla helianthus toxin (ShK)-related peptides in parasitic worms. Based on phylogenetic analysis, 2 worm peptides were selected for study: AcK1, a 51-residue peptide expressed in the anterior secretory glands of the dog-infecting hookworm Ancylostoma caninum and the human-infecting hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and BmK1, the C-terminal domain of a metalloprotease from the filarial worm Brugia malayi. These peptides in solution adopt helical structures closely resembling that of ShK. At doses in the nanomolar-micromolar range, they block native Kv1.3 in human T cells and cloned Kv1.3 stably expressed in L929 mouse fibroblasts. They preferentially suppress the proliferation of rat CCR7- effector memory T cells without affecting naive and central memory subsets and inhibit the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response caused by skin-homing effector memory T cells in rats. Further, they suppress IFNγ production by human T lymphocytes.

In rodents, an increase in the latency for the development of seizures and status epilepticus (SE) has been reported in different animal models but the consequences of delivering stimulation to chronic epileptic animals have not been extensively addressed. We study the effects of anterior thalamic nucleus (AN) stimulation at different current intensities in rats rendered epileptic following pilocarpine (Pilo) administration. Four months after Pilo-induced SE, chronic epileptic rats were bilaterally implanted with AN electrodes or had sham-surgery. Stimulation was delivered for 6 h/day, 5 days/week at 130 Hz, 90 µsec. and either 100 µA or 500 µA. The frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures in animals receiving stimulation was compared to that recorded in the preoperative period and in rats given sham treatment. To investigate the effects of DBS on hippocampal excitability, brain slices from animals receiving AN DBS or sham surgery were studied with electrophysiology. We found that rats treated with AN DBS at 100 µA had a 52% non-significant reduction in the frequency of seizures as compared to sham-treated controls and 61% less seizures than at baseline. Animals given DBS at 500 µA had 5.1 times more seizures than controls and a 2.8 fold increase in seizure rate as compared to preoperative values. In non-stimulated controls, the average frequency of seizures before and after surgery remained unaltered. In vitro recordings have shown that slices from animals previously given DBS at 100 µA had a longer latency for the development of epileptiform activity, shorter and smaller DC shifts, and a smaller spike amplitude compared to non-stimulated controls. In contrast, a higher spike amplitude was recorded in slices from animals given AN DBS at 500 µA."
https://openalex.org/W1967990398,"Exposure to ionizing radiation can produce multiple, clustered oxidative lesions in DNA. The near simultaneous excision of nearby lesions in opposing DNA strands by the base excision repair (BER) enzymes can produce double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). This attempted BER accounts for many of the potentially lethal or mutagenic DSBs that occur in vivo. To assess the impact of nucleosomes on the frequency and pattern of BER-dependent DSB formation, we incubated nucleosomes containing oxidative damages in opposing DNA strands with selected DNA glycosylases and human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. Overall, nucleosomes substantially suppressed DSB formation. However, the degree of suppression varied as a function of (i) the lesion type and DNA glycosylase tested, (ii) local sequence context and the stagger between opposing strand lesions, (iii) the helical orientation of oxidative lesions relative to the underlying histone octamer, and (iv) the distance between the lesion cluster and the nucleosome edge. In some instances the binding of a BER factor to one nucleosomal lesion appeared to facilitate binding to the opposing strand lesion. DSB formation did not invariably lead to nucleosome dissolution, and in some cases, free DNA ends resulting from DSB formation remained associated with the histone octamer. These observations explain how specific structural and dynamic properties of nucleosomes contribute to the suppression of BER-generated DSBs. These studies also suggest that most BER-generated DSBs will occur in linker DNA and in genomic regions associated with elevated rates of nucleosome turnover or remodeling."

The simultaneous deletion of both JBP1 and JBP2 yields a cell line that is unable to synthesize base J unless cells are fed hmU (14Cliffe L.J. Kieft R. Southern T. Birkeland S.R. Marshall M.

Finally, using recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that JBP1 stimulates the hydroxylation of thymidine in the context of dsDNA in a Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate-, and O2-dependent manner (15Cliffe L.J.

These data confirm the identity of JBP1/2 as the thymidine hydroxylases catalyzing the first step of base J synthesis and that this step is independent from the subsequent step of glucose conjugation. As reviewed in Borst and Sabatini (8Borst P. Sabatini R. Base J: discovery, biosynthesis, and possible functions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), attempts to identify the GT involved in the synthesis of base J have been unsuccessful. However, a recent bioinformatic study identified a possible candidate GT in trypanosomatids (21Iyer L.M. Zhang D. Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. Computational identification of novel biochemical systems involved in oxidation, glycosylation and other complex modifications of bases in DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7635-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Examining biochemical pathways for DNA modifications, Iyer et al. (21) identified a GT-A-like glucosyltransferase with an operonic association to a JBP-related gene within several phage genomes. The authors postulate that because operons contain functionally related genes, these TET/JBP-associated glycosyltransferases glycosylate substrates generated by the JBP-like enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the TET/JBP-associated glycosyltransferases, including the kinetoplastid homologs, possess many of the structural elements and catalytic residues characteristic of the Rossmannoid nucleotide-diphospho-sugar binding fold typical of the GT-A/fringe superfamily (21Iyer L.M. Zhang D. Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. Computational identification of novel biochemical systems involved in oxidation, glycosylation and other complex modifications of bases in DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7635-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We now show the first functional analysis of the T. brucei TET/JBP-associated glycosyltransferase homolog and refer to it as base J-specific GT (JGT). Our in vitro assays show that recombinant JGT utilizes UDP-Glc to transfer glucose to dsDNA substrates containing hmU. Mutation of conserved residues in the catalytic domain of the GT-A fold in JGT impairs DNA glucosylation. In vivo, deletion of both JGT alleles in T. brucei results in the complete loss of base J. Reintroduction of an ectopically expressed, HA-tagged JGT in the JGT KO restores base J synthesis. RNAi knockdown of JGT led to a sequential reduction in base J and increased levels of hmU and 5-formyluracil (fU) in the T. brucei genome in a time-dependent manner. The analyses of JGT function in vivo not only confirm its identity and the two-step base J synthesis model but also indicate that it is the only GT catalyzing the second step of base J synthesis. These studies also suggest the ability of the JBP enzymes to convert hmU to fU. Here we discuss the regulation and consequence of the oxidation and glucosylation of hmU in the trypanosome genome by JBP and JGT. The bloodstream form T. brucei cell line strain 427 and the 90–13 RNAi cell line were cultured in HMI9 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10% serum plus as described previously (9DiPaolo C. Kieft R. Cross M. Sabatini R. Regulation of trypanosome DNA glycosylation by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 90-13 cells were cultured in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml neomycin and 5 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain the intergrated genes for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, respectively. Transfections of bloodstream form T. brucei were essentially carried out as described previously (14Cliffe L.J. Kieft R. Southern T. Birkeland S.R. Marshall M. Sweeney K. Sabatini R. JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Constructs used to generate JGT knockout lines contain either a hygromycin phosphotransferase (Hyg) gene (pTub-Hygro) or a blasticidin S deaminase (BSR) gene (pTub-Blast). The T. brucei JGT-flanking regions used to target each allele were PCR-amplified from T. brucei 427 genomic DNA. The 611-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ flank was PCR-amplified using the sense primer 5′-GCGGCCGCCGGCACTGACGATCTTACAT-3′ (the NotI site is underlined) and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCCACATAATATAGCGCCACACATTC-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pTub-Hygro and pTub-Blast vectors digested with NotI and BamHI. The 595-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′ flank was PCR-amplified using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTTGCAGATGGCGTGTTTCT-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined) and the antisense primer: 5′-CTCGAGACGTGTGCCTAATACACTTACC-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined) and cloned into the pTub-Hygro construct. For the pTub-Blast construct, the 3′ flank was generated using the sense primer 5′-GGGCCCTGCAGATGGCGTGTTTCT-3′ (the ApaI site is underlined) and the antisense primer 5′- GGGCCCAAGCTTACGTGTGCCTAATACACTTACC-3′ (the ApaI site is underlined). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the ApaI-digested pTub-Blast vector. The pJGT-Tub-Hygro knockout construct was digested with NotI and XhoI, and the pJGT-Tub-Blast knockout construct was digested with NotI and HindIII prior to transfection. Transfectants were selected for resistance at 5 μg/ml hygromycin and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Two rounds of transfection were used to replace both JGT alleles. The correct integration of the KO constructs and deletion of the JGT ORF was confirmed by PCR. To allow ectopic expression of HA-JGT fusion, we utilized a modified ptub-phleo construct (22Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Taylor M.C. Kieft R. Borst P. VSG gene expression site control in insect form Trypanosoma brucei.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5470-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that contains the enhanced green fluorescent protein ORF cloned between the tubulin flanking sequences. A 2012-bp PCR product corresponding to the T. brucei JGT ORF was PCR-amplified using the sense primer CCTGCAGGATGGCTTACCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGGAGGTCCAAGTGAGGGGAAG (the SbfI site is underlined and sequence coding for the HA tag is shown in boldface) and the antisense primer GGCGCGCCTTAGTCTGCCTGCGACCCTCC (the AscI site is underlined) and cloned into the ptub-GFP vector digested with SbfI and AscI. Insertion of the HA-JGT PCR product in the place of EGFP now allows expression of HA-JGT N terminus fusion protein after integration into the tubulin array. The final construct (HA-JGT-tub-phleo) was digested with XbaI and XhoI before electroporation, and transformants were selected for resistance to 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. To allow Tet-inducible ablation of the T. brucei JGT mRNA, the pZJM-JGT RNA interference construct was generated by inserting a 524-bp portion of the JGT ORF into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the RNAi vector pZJM (23Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei gene expression by RNA interference using an integratable vector with opposing T7 promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A 524-bp fragment of the coding sequence of the JGT gene (tb427.10.6900) was amplified from T. brucei 427 genomic DNA using the sense primer CTCGAGGTGAATGTGTATGCCAACGC (the XhoI site is underlined) and the antisense primer AAGCTTTTGTTCTGCTGGCAGATGTC (the HindIII site is underlined) and cloned into the XhoI- and HindIII-digested pZJM vector. The resulting construct, pZJM-JGT, was digested with NotI prior to transfection. Transfectants were selected for resistance at 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. To quantify the genomic J levels, DNA was isolated and utilized in the anti-J DNA immunoblot assay as described previously (24van Leeuwen F. Wijsman E.R. Kieft R. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Borst P. Localization of the modified base J in telomeric VSG gene expression sites of Trypanosoma brucei.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3232-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, serially diluted genomic DNA was blotted to nitrocellulose, followed by incubation with anti-J antisera. Bound antibodies were detected by a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP and visualized by ECL. The membrane was stripped and hybridized with a probe for the β-tubulin gene to correct for DNA loading. Total RNA was obtained using Qiagen RNeasy kits according to the instructions of the manufacturers. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Heat-inactivated cDNA reaction mixtures were finally treated with RNase H at 37 °C for 45 min. Quantification of selected genes was performed on an iCycler with an iQ5 multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture contained 5 pmol of forward and reverse primer, 2× iQ SYBR Green Super Mix (Bio-Rad), and 2 μl of template cDNA. Standard curves were prepared for each gene using 5-fold dilutions of a known quantity (250 ng/μl) of genomic DNA from wild-type T. brucei DNA. The quantities were calculated using iQ5 optical detection system software. Each sample was normalized to enolase mRNA. The primer sequences utilized in this analysis were as follows: JGT, 5′-CCTGACTGAGAACCCTTACTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCACGTGTGACCATATACA-3′ (antisense); JBP1, 5′-GTGTCCTAGCTGTGCTCAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGTGCGTATCGAAGAGTAAG-3′ (antisense); JBP2, 5′-CCTTCCACCTTTGTGTATTCCT-3′ sense) and 5′-CAACCGTCTCCTTCCTTGATAC-3′ (antisense); enolase, 5′-GGCCTGCAACTCTCTTCTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCACTGACCAGCCATTCT-3′ (antisense). The open reading frame of T. brucei JGT (Tb927.10.6900 TriTrypDB) was codon-optimized for E. coli expression and cloned into pET16b expression vector by GeneArt. The codon-optimized JGT nucleotide sequence is available upon request. The final construct was Tb-JGT-pET16b. Expression and purification of the N-terminal His10-tagged Tb-JGT was performed with BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)- RIL-competent cells (Agilent). Briefly, freshly transformed bacterial cell cultures were induced at A600 nm 0.4–0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 16 °C. Cell pellets were washed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm PMSFand then flash-frozen and stored at −70 °C until purification. Cells were lysed and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, PMSF, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor; Roche). Cell lysates were clarified at 31,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Recombinant JGT was affinity-purified with Talon resin (CloneTech) at 4 °C for 1 h, washed with 600 mm NaCl lysis buffer in a batch, and eluted by gravity column with 150 mm imidazole lysis buffer. Purified protein was concentrated by Centricon (Millipore) and visualized by colloidal blue-stained SDS-PAGE and anti-His Western blot analysis. JGT concentration was estimated on the basis of mass spec analysis indicating the ratio of JGT and DnaK in the purified sample and comparison to BSA standards on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Mutagenesis of the T. brucei JGT was achieved using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). As a template for the PCR Tb-JGT-pET16b construct, the following primer pairs were used: r(80)a, 5′-GAGCAAAGGTgcaTTTTATCATGAACGTGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAACAAAAA TCGGAACAG-3′ (reverse); d241a, 5′-TGGGTTATGGcTGATGATATCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATACCACTGTGCTGCATG-3′ (reverse); and d243a, 5′ATGGATGATGGcTATCGCCAAATTTTTC-5′ (forward) and 5′-AACCCAATACCACTGTGC-3′ (reverse). Nucleotides shown in lowercase indicate altered amino acids to yield a point mutation. The mutated construct was verified by DNA sequencing and utilized as described above for expression and purification. A standard glucosylation assay consisted of 88 μm UDP-[3H]glucose (specific activity 45Ci/mmol), ∼0.05 μm recombinant JGT, and 100 μm DNA containing four hmU residues in buffer (50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm manganese acetate, and 1 mm DTT (pH 7.9)). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 400 μm cold UDP-glucose and flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen for processing. The reaction mixtures were thawed and applied immediately to a 2.5-cm DE81 membrane (GE Healthcare, catalog no. 3658-325) under air pressure using a vacuum manifold. The filters where then washed in 3 × 2 ml of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, 3 × 2 ml of water, and 3 × 2 ml of 100% ethanol. Membranes were air-dried and placed in scintillation vials containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The solution was mixed, and tritium incorporation was measured for 1 min. All glucosylation reaction values were corrected for nonspecific binding of UDP-[3H]glucose to the filters. Background values were determined using reactions performed in the absence of enzyme but in the presence of UDP-[3H]glucose. Oligos modified with hmU (H) (ACCCHAACCCHAACCCHAACCCHA) and an unmodified (thymidine) control (ACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTA) were hybridized to complementary oligo (TAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGT), synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies to generate hmU modified and unmodified dsDNA substrates, respectively. DNA duplexes were made by boiling complementary oligos for 10 min and allowing them to cool overnight. Proteins from 3 × 107 cell equivalents were separated by SDS-PAGE 8% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. SC-805) (1:1000 dilution), anti-histone H3 (Abcam, catalog no. ab8580) (1:2500 dilution) or anti-JBP2 antibody, as described previously (19Kieft R. Brand V. Ekanayake D.K. Sweeney K. DiPaolo C.

Parasitol. 2007; 156: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected by a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP and visualized by ECL. To minimize artificial DNA oxidation, a modified procedure was used to isolate total genomic DNA for LC/MS analysis. Briefly, T. brucei cells were pelleted, washed in 1× PBS, and then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and 400 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. 5 m NaCl was then added and centrifuged to remove protein and cell debris, and DNA was precipitated with cold 100% ethanol. Purified genomic DNA from the indicated trypanosome cell lines was digested to nucleosides and subjected to LC/MS analysis. 4S. Liu, D. Ji, L. Cliffe, R. Sabatini, and Y.

https://openalex.org/W1964229726,"In influenza A virus-infected cells, replication and transcription of the viral genome occurs in the nucleus. To be packaged into viral particles at the plasma membrane, encapsidated viral genomes must be exported from the nucleus. Intriguingly, the nuclear export protein (NEP) is involved in both processes. Although NEP stimulates viral RNA synthesis by binding to the viral polymerase, its function during nuclear export implicates interaction with viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP)-associated M1. The observation that both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal moiety of NEP raised the question whether these two features of NEP are linked functionally. Here we provide evidence that the interaction between M1 and the vRNP depends on the NEP C terminus and its polymerase activity-enhancing property for the nuclear export of vRNPs. This suggests that these features of NEP are linked functionally. Furthermore, our data suggest that the N-terminal domain of NEP interferes with the stability of the vRNP-M1-NEP nuclear export complex, probably mediated by its highly flexible intramolecular interaction with the NEP C terminus. On the basis of our data, we propose a new model for the assembly of the nuclear export complex of Influenza A vRNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1971805725,"Most cases with Niemann-Pick disease type C carry mutations in NPC1. Some of the mutations, including the most frequent I1061T, give rise to unstable proteins selected for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. The purpose of the current study was to shed mechanistic insights into the degradation process. A proteasome inhibitor MG132 prolonged the life span of the wild-type NPC1 expressed in COS cells. The expressed protein associated with multiple chaperones including heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), Hsp70, heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), and calnexin. Accordingly, expression of an E3 ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) enhanced MG132-induced accumulation of ubiquitylated NPC1. Co-expression and RNAi knockdown experiments in HEK cells indicated that Hsp70/Hsp90 stabilized NPC1, whereas Hsc70 destabilized it. In human fibroblasts carrying the I1061T mutation, adenovirus-mediated expression of Hsp70 or treatment with an HSP-inducer geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) increased the level of the mutant protein. In GGA-treated cells, the rescued protein was localized in the late endosome and ameliorated cholesterol accumulation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed three lysine residues at amino acids 318, 792, and 1180 as potential ubiquitin-conjugation sites. Substitutions of the three residues with alanine yielded a mutant protein with a steady-state level more than three times higher than that of the wild-type. Introduction of the same substitutions to the I1061T mutant resulted in an increase in its protein level and functional restoration. These findings indicated the role of HSPs in quality control of NPC1 and revealed the role of three lysine residues as ubiquitin-conjugation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1963912082,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in many biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. Particular miRNAs function either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and appear to have diagnostic and prognostic significance. Although numerous miRNAs are dys-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) only a small fraction has been characterized functionally. Using high-throughput functional screening and miRNA profiling of clinical samples the present study aims at identifying miRNAs important for the control of cellular growth and/or apoptosis in CRC. The high-throughput functional screening was carried out in six CRC cell lines transfected with a pre-miR library including 319 synthetic human pre-miRs. Phenotypic alterations were evaluated by immunostaining of cleaved cPARP (apoptosis) or MKI67 (proliferation). Additionally, TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosa and 46 microsatellite stable stage II CRC patients. Among the miRNAs that induced growth arrest and apoptosis in the CRC cell lines, and at same time were dys-regulated in the clinical samples, miR-375 was selected for further analysis. Independent in vitro analysis of transient and stable transfected CRC cell lines confirmed that miR-375 reduces cell viability through the induction of apoptotic death. We identified YAP1 as a direct miR-375 target in CRC and show that HELLS and NOLC1 are down-stream targets. Knock-down of YAP1 mimicked the phenotype induced by miR-375 over-expression indicating that miR-375 most likely exerts its pro-apoptotic role through YAP1 and its anti-apoptotic down-stream targets BIRC5 and BCL2L1. Finally, in vivo analysis of mouse xenograft tumors showed that miR-375 expression significantly reduced tumor growth. We conclude that the high-throughput screening successfully identified miRNAs that induce apoptosis and/or inhibit proliferation in CRC cells. Finally, combining the functional screening with profiling of CRC tissue samples we identified clinically relevant miRNAs and miRNA targets in CRC."

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D status in a population sample of Asian children and to investigate the relationship of vitamin D status with allergic diseases and atopy.Children aged 5-18 years (N = 1315) in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese CHildren (PATCH) study were evaluated using questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and total and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE).The mean concentration of serum 25(OH)D was 20.4 ng/mL (SD: 7.1 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25(OH)D<20 ng/mL) was present in 670 subjects (51.0%), while vitamin D insufficiency (defined as serum 25(OH)D<30 ng/mL) was observed in 1187 subjects (90.3%). Older age (P<0.001), female gender (P<0.001), higher body mass index (P = 0.001), winter and spring seasons (compared to summer; P both<0.001), and passive smoking (P = 0.011) were independently associated with low serum 25(OH)D levels. After adjusting for potential confounders, serum 25(OH)D status had no association with asthma, rhinitis, eczema, atopy, or total serum IgE (all P>0.05).Low serum 25(OH)D levels are remarkably common in this population sample of Asian children, suggesting that millions of children living in Taiwan may have suboptimal levels of vitamin D, which should be a matter of public health concern. Our results provides epidemiological evidence against the association of vitamin D status with various allergic diseases and atopy in Asian children."
https://openalex.org/W1990442312,"Enzymatic proteolysis by calpains, Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases, has been implicated in pathological processes such as cellular degeneration or death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain activation in the hearts subjected to myocardial infarction. We produced myocardial infarction in Cast−/− mice deficient for calpastatin, the specific endogenous inhibitory protein for calpains, and Cast+/+ mice. The activity of cardiac calpains in Cast+/+ mice was not elevated within 1 day but showed a gradual elevation after 7 days following myocardial infarction, which was further pronounced in Cast−/− mice. Although the prevalence of cardiomyocyte death was indistinguishable between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice, Cast−/− mice exhibited profound contractile dysfunction and chamber dilatation and showed a significant reduction in survival rate after myocardial infarction as compared with Cast+/+ mice. Notably, immunofluorescence revealed that at 28 days after myocardial infarction, calpains were activated in cardiomyocytes exclusively at the border zone and that Cast−/− mice showed higher intensity and a broader extent of calpain activation at the border zone than Cast+/+ mice. In the border zone of Cast−/− mice, pronounced activation of calpains was associated with a decrease in N-cadherin expression and up-regulation of molecular markers for cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, calpain activation by treatment with ionomycin induced cleavage of N-cadherin and decreased expression levels of β-catenin and connexin 43, which was attenuated by calpain inhibitor. These results thus demonstrate that activation of calpains disassembles cell-cell adhesion at intercalated discs by degrading N-cadherin and thereby promotes left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.

The main isoforms in mammalian cells are ubiquitous μ-calpain (calpain 1) and m-calpain (calpain 2), which demand micromolar and millimolar levels of Ca2+, respectively, for exhibiting proteolytic activity in vitro (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). The μ- and m-calpains are heterodimers consisting of an isoform-specific catalytic subunit encoded by Capn1 and Capn2, respectively, and a common regulatory subunit encoded by Capns1 (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). In vivo, the proteolytic activity of both μ- and m-calpains is tightly controlled by calpastatin, a major and specific endogenous inhibitory protein of calpains (2Hanna R.A. Campbell R.L. Davies P.L. Calcium-bound structure of calpain and its mechanism of inhibition by calpastatin.Nature. 2008; 456: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the calpain-calpastatin system controls fundamental cellular functions such as cytoskeletal remodeling, cell cycle regulation, gene expression, and cell death (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Thus, the imbalance between calpains and calpastatin can give rise to a wide spectrum of diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, muscular dystrophy, cataract formation, diabetes mellitus, ischemia, and cancers (3Zatz M. Starling A. Calpains and disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, Ca2+ plays a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling, and dysregulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, often in the form of Ca2+ overload, leads to myocardial cell injury. Although multiple destructive processes are triggered by Ca2+ overload, the cellular demise ensues largely from Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition and from Ca2+-induced proteolysis (4Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Mechanisms underlying acute protection from cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 581-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In ex vivo or in vivo hearts, Ca2+ overload after ischemia-reperfusion have caused contractile dysfunction (post-ischemic stunning), which is associated with proteolysis of structural and regulatory proteins such as α-actinin, desmin, α-spectrin, troponin I, Na+/K+-ATPase, and protein kinase Cα (5Matsumura Y.

Furthermore, calpains have been implicated in the execution of myocardial cell death during ischemia-reperfusion. Calpain activation mediates Ca2+ overload-induced proteolysis in these processes, as is evident from observations that pharmacological inhibition of calpains has significantly attenuated myocardial stunning and reduced infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion (5Matsumura Y.

However, the consequences of calpain activation after myocardial infarction (MI) 3The abbreviations used are: MImyocardial infarctionAng IIangiotensin IICxconnexinLVleft ventricular. remain to be fully elucidated in an in vivo context. During acute ischemia, the intracellular Ca2+ is elevated mainly through Ca2+ entry by reverse mode Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (15Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Levy L. London R.E.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that enzymatic activities as well as mRNA and protein levels of calpains are elevated in a chronic phase (17Sandmann S. Yu M. Unger T.

Pharmacol. 2006; 47: 413-421PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that calpain activation may be implicated in the progression of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after MI. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated that calpain inhibitors reduced infarct size and prevented LV dysfunction after MI in animal models (22Saitoh T. Nakajima T. Takahashi T. Kawahara K.

Physiol. 2009; 297: H1744-H1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but there are significant limitations to these pharmacological approaches. Most of the calpain inhibitors ineluctably exert nonspecific effects on other proteases (such as caspases and cathepsins) or proteasome activity in some degree and fail to reach the effective concentrations in vivo because of low permeability across the cell membrane and measurable toxicity to living cells (24Carragher N.O. Calpain inhibition: a therapeutic strategy targeting multiple disease states.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 615-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). myocardial infarction angiotensin II connexin left ventricular. In the present study we examined the temporal transition and regional and subcellular distribution of calpain activity in the heart after MI. Furthermore, we produced MI in calpastatin knock-out (Cast−/−) mice and wild-type (Cast+/+) mice to elucidate the consequences of enhanced calpain activation. We found that calpains were activated in the border zone, adjacent to the infarct zone, during the chronic phase and that profound activation of calpains exacerbated LV remodeling after MI in Cast−/− mice. Mechanistically, unregulated activation of calpain induced cleavage of N-cadherin and disrupted the cadherin-based cell adhesions, which potentially led to progression of LV remodeling after MI. Generation of Cast−/− mice has been described previously (25Takano J. Tomioka M. Tsubuki S. Higuchi M. Iwata N. Itohara S. Maki M. Saido T.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16175-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rates were measured in conscious mice noninvasively by a programmable sphygmomanometer (BP-98A, Softron) using the tail-cuff method. To produce MI, we anesthetized 8–12-week-old mice by intraperitoneal injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg), midazolam (4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (5 mg/kg) (26Kawai S. Takagi Y. Kaneko S. Kurosawa T. Effect of three types of mixed anesthetic agents alternate to ketamine in mice.Exp. Anim. 2011; 60: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and anesthesia was monitored by pinching the toe. We ligated the left descending coronary artery with 10-0 nylon suture at the level of below left atrium, and post-operative analgesia (meloxicam, 5 mg/kg/24 h) was administered subcutaneously for 48 h. For evaluation of cardiac dimensions and contractility, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on conscious mice with Vevo 770 Imaging System using a 25-MHz linear probe (Visual Sonics). At the indicated time points, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). The hearts were removed and prepared for further histological and molecular analysis. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chiba University. For histological analysis, hearts were excised, fixed in 10% neutralized formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections at 5 μm were deparaffinized and stained with Masson's trichrome for evaluation of fibrosis. We evaluated a ratio of infarct area to left ventricular free wall area for quantification of the infarct area (%). Infarct length (mm) was measured as the midline of the length of infarct that included >50% of the whole thickness of the myocardial wall (27Takagawa J. Zhang Y. Wong M.L. Sievers R.E. Kapasi N.K. Wang Y. Yeghiazarians Y. Lee R.J. Grossman W. Springer M.L. Myocardial infarct size measurement in the mouse chronic infarction model: comparison of area- and length-based approaches.J. Appl. Physiol. 2007; 102: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, hearts were excised and immediately embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT cryo-embedding compound (Miles Laboratories). Cryostat sections at 5 μm were fixed in acetone, and primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen) or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was applied to visualize expression of specific proteins. Images were acquired with either a microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon) using the Radiance 2000 confocal scanning system (Bio-Rad) or an LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). A TUNEL assay with nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 was performed using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Bio), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a CCD camera (Axiocam; Carl Zeiss). The images were analyzed for calculation of areas with intense fluorescence using the BZ-Analyzer software in Hybrid Cell Count mode (Keyence). Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (28Zou Y. Akazawa H. Qin Y. Sano M. Takano H. Minamino T. Makita N. Iwanaga K.

Mechanical stress activates angiotensin II type 1 receptor without the involvement of angiotensin II.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Study Committee of Osaka University. Briefly, cervical dislocation euthanasia was performed by trained personal before harvesting of the cardiac tissue according to the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines for the euthanasia of animals. Cardiomyocytes were plated at a field density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum. Forty-eight hours after plating cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pretreated with 10 μm MDL28170 (Sigma) in serum-free DMEM for 1 h, and stimulated with 10 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for 10 min. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with primary antibodies and visualized with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with a confocal microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss). The enzymatic activity of calpains was measured using the Calpain-Glo Protease Assay (Promega) according to the manufacture's protocol. Protein samples were fractionated with SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). The blotted membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactive signals were detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) and developed onto a film (Hyperfilm ECL; GE Healthcare Biosciences) or visualized using a lumino-image analyzer (ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini; GE Healthcare). The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-N-cadherin antibody (clone 3B9, Invitrogen) raised against the intracellular domain of chicken N-cadherin, rabbit polyclonal anti-N-cadherin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) raised against the extracellular domain of human N-cadherin, rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 antibody (clone CX-1B1, Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx43 antibody (Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (clone EA-53, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen 1 antibody (Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone DM1A, Sigma), rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (clone 14C10, Cell Signaling Technology). A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the calpain cleavage site of the N-terminal 135-kDa fragment of αII-spectrin was described previously (25Takano J. Tomioka M. Tsubuki S. Higuchi M. Iwata N. Itohara S. Maki M. Saido T.C. Calpain mediates excitotoxic DNA fragmentation via mitochondrial pathways in adult brains: evidence from calpastatin mutant mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16175-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and single-stranded cDNA was transcribed by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We conducted quantitative real-time PCR analysis using Light Cycler TaqMan Master Kit (Roche Applied Science) with the target-specific primers and the matching probes designed by the Universal ProbeLibrary System (Roche Applied Science). Amplification conditions were initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 25 s at 60 °C. Individual PCR products were analyzed by melting point analysis. The expression level of a gene was normalized relative to that of Gapdh by using a comparative Ct method. The primer sequences and Universal Probe numbers were designed with the ProbeFinder software as following: Nppa, 5′-cacagatctgatggatttcaaga-3′ and 5′-cctcatcttctaccggcatc-3′, no. 25; Nppb, 5′-gtcagtcgtttgggctgtaac-3′ and 5′- agacccaggcagagtcagaa-3′, no. 71; Acta1, 5′-aatgagcgtttccgttgc-3′ and 5′-atccccgcagactccatac-3′, no. 94; Gapdh, 5′-tgtccgtcgtggatctgac-3′ and 5′-cctgcttcaccaccttcttg-3′, no. 80. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences in measured values were analyzed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student's t test for two-group comparison and a 1-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni's method for multi-group comparison. We estimated survival curves after MI by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared the two groups by the log-rank test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. First, we examined the time course of change in calpain activity after MI in wild-type mice by using an antibody specific to the calpain-cleaved N-terminal 135-kDa fragment of αII-spectrin (25Takano J. Tomioka M. Tsubuki S. Higuchi M. Iwata N. Itohara S. Maki M. Saido T.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16175-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that intracellular Ca2+ is elevated immediately after myocardial ischemia (15Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Levy L. London R.E. Elevation in cytosolic free calcium concentration early in myocardial ischemia in perfused rat heart.Circ. Res. 1987; 60: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), the level of spectrin proteolysis was unchanged within 24 h after MI (Fig. 1A). However, at 7 days after MI, spectrin proteolysis was significantly increased and sustained thereafter (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that calpains are activated not in the acute phase but in the subacute and chronic phase after MI. Next, we compared the activities of cardiac calpains after MI between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice. It has been reported that basal activity of calpain is important for protein homeostasis in unstressed hearts (29Galvez A.S. Diwan A. Odley A.M. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Melendez J.G. Robbins J. Lynch R.A. Marreez Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Cardiomyocyte degeneration with calpain deficiency reveals a critical role in protein homeostasis.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but the calpain activity in sham-operated hearts, as assessed by the level of spectrin proteolysis, was indistinguishable between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice (Fig. 1B). Essentially, Cast−/− mice showed normal development, fertility, and life span (25Takano J. Tomioka M. Tsubuki S. Higuchi M. Iwata N. Itohara S. Maki M. Saido T.C. Calpain mediates excitotoxic DNA fragmentation via mitochondrial pathways in adult brains: evidence from calpastatin mutant mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16175-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, Cast−/− mice exhibited normal heart rates, blood pressures, and cardiac function under the physiological conditions as assessed by echocardiographic evaluation (Table 1). These results suggest that calpastatin deficiency has little effect on basal activity of calpain under the physiological conditions. However, as compared with Cast+/+ mice, Cast−/− mice showed a significant increase in spectrin proteolysis at 28 days after MI (Fig. 1B), suggesting that calpastatin deficiency exaggerates activation of calpains when calpain activation is induced under stressed conditions.TABLE 1Basal heart rates, blood pressures, and echocardiographic parameters of Cast−/− and Cast+/+ miceParametersCast+/+Cast−/−PNumber44Age (weeks)8.60 ± 0.088.60 ± 0.200.54Heart rate (bpm)640 ± 13.6646 ± 32.60.79SBP (mm Hg)98.9 ± 5.0897.9 ± 5.730.79DBP (mm Hg)58.2 ± 4.2652.6 ± 3.120.76LVEDD (mm)3.48 ± 0.033.46 ± 0.270.90LVESD (mm)1.71 ± 0.021.69 ± 0.040.51IVSth (mm)0.86 ± 0.110.89 ± 0.040.62PWth (mm)0.81 ± 0.070.90 ± 0.050.13FS (%)50.7 ± 1.2850.9 ± 2.470.91 Open table in a new tab At 14 days after MI, histological analysis with Masson's trichrome staining and echocardiographic examination revealed no significant difference in LV geometry and function between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A and B). However, at 28 days after MI, Cast−/− mice showed more severe LV dilatation and dysfunction than Cast+/+ mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Because there was no significant difference in infarct size, determined either by area measurement or by length measurement, between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice (Fig. 2, E and F), LV remodeling was promoted independently of the infarct size in Cast−/− mice. As a consequence, the survival rate was significantly lower in Cast−/− mice than in Cast+/+ mice (p < 0.05), although the early death within 14 days after MI was comparable (p = 0.058) (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that enhanced activation of calpains in the chronic phase enhances LV remodeling in Cast−/− mice, leading to death possibly due to heart failure. Calpains have been implicated in the execution of cell death (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the prevalence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice by TUNEL staining. There was no significant difference in the number of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in the infarct area of Cast−/− and Cast+/+ hearts at 24 h after MI (Fig. 3, A and B). Throughout the period from 3 to 28 days, apoptotic cardiomyocytes were scarcely observed in the infarct or non-infarct area of both genotypes, and the number was not significantly different between Cast−/− and Cast+/+ mice (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, the infarct area of Cast−/− mice was not significantly different from that of Cast+/+ mice at 28 days after MI (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that calpastatin deficiency has little impact on myocardial cell death both in the acute phase and in the chronic phase after MI. To gain insights into the mechanism of how calpain activation leads to exacerbation of LV remodeling, we utilized immunofluorescence staining and assessed the cellular and subcellular localization of calpain activation in the infarct and border zones. In sham-operated hearts of Cast+/+ mice, calpain-cleaved αII-spectrin was primarily localized in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4A). Especially in cardiomyocytes, the fluorescence signals showed a characteristic cross-striated pattern that is typically seen with sarcom"

Genetic analyses have shown that these cleavage events are dependent on the caspase-8 like Dredd, suggesting that Imd and Relish are direct substrates of Dredd. Among the seven Drosophila caspases, we find that Dredd uniquely promotes Imd and Relish processing, and purified recombinant Dredd cleaves Imd and Relish in vitro. In addition, interdomain cleavage of Dredd is not required for Imd or Relish processing and is not observed during immune stimulation. Baculovirus p35, a suicide substrate of executioner caspases, is not cleaved by purified Dredd in vitro. Consistent with this biochemistry but contrary to earlier reports, p35 does not interfere with Imd signaling in S2* cells or in vivo."

We assessed the direct effectiveness of PCV10 vaccination in preventing nasopharyngeal/NP pneumococcal carriage in infants. Methods A cross-sectional population-based household survey was conducted in Goiania Brazil, from December/2010-February/2011 targeting children aged 7–11 m and 15–18 m. Participants were selected using a systematic sampling. NP swabs, demographic data, and vaccination status were collected from 1,287 children during home visits. Main outcome and exposure of interest were PCV10 vaccine-type carriage and dosing schedules (3p+0, 2p+0, and one catch-up dose), respectively. Pneumococcal carriage was defined by a positive culture and serotyping was performed by Quellung reaction. Rate ratio/RR was calculated as the ratio between the prevalence of vaccine-types carriage in children exposed to different schedules and unvaccinated for PCV10. Adjusted RR was estimated using Poisson regression. PCV10 effectiveness/VE on vaccine-type carriage was calculated as 1-RR*100. Results The prevalence of pneumococcal carriage was 41.0% (95%CI: 38.4–43.7). Serotypes covered by PCV10 and PCV13 were 35.2% and 53.0%, respectively. Vaccine serotypes 6B (11.6%), 23F (7.8%), 14 (6.8%), and 19F (6.6%) were the most frequently observed. After adjusted for confounders, children who had received 2p+0 or 3p+0 dosing schedule presented a significant reduction in pneumococcal vaccine-type carriage, with PCV10 VE equal to 35.9% (95%CI: 4.2–57.1; p = 0.030) and 44.0% (95%CI: 14.–63.5; p = 0.008), respectively, when compared with unvaccinated children. For children who received one catch-up dose, no significant VE was detected (p = 0.905). Conclusion PCV10 was associated with high protection against vaccine-type carriage with 2p+0 and 3p+0 doses for children vaccinated before the second semester of life. The continuous evaluation of carriage serotypes distribution is likely to be useful for evaluating the long-term effectiveness and impact of pneumococcal vaccination on serotypes reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2116206051,"The need to integrate social and economic factors into conservation planning has become a focus of academic discussions and has important practical implications for the implementation of conservation areas, both private and public. We conducted a survey in the Daly Catchment, Northern Territory, to inform the design and implementation of a stewardship payment program. We used a choice model to estimate the likely level of participation in two legal arrangements--conservation covenants and management agreements--based on payment level and proportion of properties required to be managed. We then spatially predicted landholders' probability of participating at the resolution of individual properties and incorporated these predictions into conservation planning software to examine the potential for the stewardship program to meet conservation objectives. We found that the properties that were least costly, per unit area, to manage were also the least likely to participate. This highlights a tension between planning for a cost-effective program and planning for a program that targets properties with the highest probability of participation."
https://openalex.org/W2020547502,"Thermal imaging has been used in the past for remote detection of regions of canopy showing symptoms of stress, including water deficit stress. Stress indices derived from thermal images have been used as an indicator of canopy water status, but these depend on the choice of reference surfaces and environmental conditions and can be confounded by variations in complex canopy structure. Therefore, in this work, instead of using stress indices, information from thermal and visible light imagery was combined along with machine learning techniques to identify regions of canopy showing a response to soil water deficit. Thermal and visible light images of a spinach canopy with different levels of soil moisture were captured. Statistical measurements from these images were extracted and used to classify between canopies growing in well-watered soil or under soil moisture deficit using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes Classifier (GPC) and a combination of both the classifiers. The classification results show a high correlation with soil moisture. We demonstrate that regions of a spinach crop responding to soil water deficit can be identified by using machine learning techniques with a high accuracy of 97%. This method could, in principle, be applied to any crop at a range of scales."

We previously demonstrated that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-expressing eosinophils contribute to this process in murine zymosan-induced peritonitis. In this study, eosinophils promoted resolution by regulating expression of macrophage CXCL13. Microarray analysis revealed that eosinophils significantly increased (~ 3-fold) the expression of macrophage CXCL13 by a 12/15-LOX-dependent mechanism. CXCL13 depletion caused a resolution defect, with the reduced appearance of phagocytes carrying engulfed zymosan in the draining lymph nodes. Inflamed lymph node hypertrophy, a critical feature of the resolution process, was reduced by ~60% in eosinophil-deficient mice, and adoptive transfer of eosinophils or administration of CXCL13 corrected this defect. Administration of the 12/15-LOX-derived mediator lipoxin A4 (LXA4) increased the expression of CXCL13 and restored the defect of lymph node hypertrophy in eosinophil-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that eosinophils control the resolution of inflammation and draining lymph node hypertrophy through proresolving lipid mediators and the CXCL13 pathway in mice.—Tani, Y., Isobe, Y., Imoto, Y., Segi-Nishida, E., Sugimoto, Y., Arai, H., Arita, M.

In the present study, we determined the complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA genome sequence of this plant pathogen. Compared with other PPNs genera, this genome (19,589 bp) is only slightly smaller than that of Pratylenchus vulnus (21,656 bp). The nucleotide composition of the whole mtDNA sequence of M. graminicola is significantly biased toward A and T, with T being the most favored nucleotide and C being the least favored. The A+T content of the entire genome is 83.51%. The mt genome of M. graminicola contains 36 genes (lacking atp8) that are transcribed in the same direction. The gene arrangement of the mt genome of M. graminicola is unique. A total of 21 out of 22 tRNAs possess a DHU loop only, while tRNASer(AGN) lacks a DHU loop. The two large noncoding regions (2,031 bp and 5,063 bp) are disrupted by tRNASer(UCN). Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes support the monophylies of the three orders Rhabditida, Mermithida and Trichinellida, the suborder Rhabditina and the three infraorders Spiruromorpha, Oxyuridomorpha and Ascaridomorpha, but do not support the monophylies of the two suborders Spirurina and Tylenchina, and the three infraorders Rhabditomorpha, Panagrolaimomorpha and Tylenchomorpha. The four Tylenchomorpha species including M. graminicola, P. vulnus, H. glycines and R. similis from the superfamily Tylenchoidea are placed within a well-supported monophyletic clade, but far from the other two Tylenchomorpha species B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus of Aphelenchoidea. In the clade of Tylenchoidea, M. graminicola is sister to P. vulnus, and H. glycines is sister to R. similis, which suggests root-knot nematodes has a closer relationship to Pratylenchidae nematodes than to cyst nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2052872574,"Philaenus spumarius is a widespread insect species in the Holarctic region. Here, by focusing on the mtDNA gene COI but also using the COII and Cyt b genes and the nuclear gene EF-1α, we tried to explain how and when its current biogeographic pattern evolved by providing time estimates of the main demographic and evolutionary events and investigating its colonization patterns in and out of Eurasia. Evidence of recent divergence and expansion events at less than 0.5 Ma ago indicate that climate fluctuations in the Mid-Late Pleistocene were important in shaping the current phylogeographic pattern of the species. Data support a first split and differentiation of P. spumarius into two main mitochondrial lineages: the “western”, in the Mediterranean region and the “eastern”, in Anatolia/Caucasus. It also supports a following differentiation of the “western” lineage into two sub-lineages: the “western-Mediterranean”, in Iberia and the “eastern-Mediterranean” in the Balkans. The recent pattern seems to result from postglacial range expansion from Iberia and Caucasus/Anatolia, thus not following one of the four common paradigms. Unexpected patterns of recent gene-flow events between Mediterranean peninsulas, a close relationship between Iberia and North Africa, as well as high levels of genetic diversity being maintained in northern Europe were found. The mitochondrial pattern does not exactly match to the nuclear pattern suggesting that the current biogeographic pattern of P. spumarius may be the result of both secondary admixture and incomplete lineage sorting. The hypothesis of recent colonization of North America from both western and northern Europe is corroborated by our data and probably resulted from accidental human translocations. A probable British origin for the populations of the Azores and New Zealand was revealed, however, for the Azores the distribution of populations in high altitude native forests is somewhat puzzling and may imply a natural colonization of the archipelago."

In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter). In this study, we have provided the details of the geographical distribution of EBLV-1a in the south-west of France and the north-south division of EBLV-1b with its subdivisions into three phylogenetic groups: group B1 in the north-west, group B2 in the centre and group B3 in the north-east of France."
https://openalex.org/W2164049366,"Hemiscorpius lepturus scorpionism poses one of the most dangerous health problems in many parts of the world. The common therapy consists of using antivenom antibody fragments derived from a polyclonal immune response raised in horses. However, this immunotherapy creates serious side effects, including anaphylactic shock sometimes even leading to death. Thus, many efforts have been made to introduce new replacement therapeutics that cause less adverse reactions. One of the most attractive approaches to replacing the available therapy is offered by single-domain antibody fragments, or nanobodies (Nbs). We immunized dromedaries with H. lepturus toxin and identified a functional recombinant Nb (referred to as F7Nb) against heminecrolysin (HNc), the major known hemolytic and dermonecrotic fraction of H. lepturus venom. This Nb was retrieved from the immune library by phage display selection. The in vitro neutralization tests indicated that 17.5 nmol of the F7Nb can inhibit 45% of the hemolytic activity of 1 EC100 (7.5 μg/ml) of HNc. The in vivo neutralization tests demonstrated that F7Nb had good antihemolytic and antidermonecrotic effects against HNc in all tested mice. Surprisingly, F7Nb (8.75 nmol) neutralized 1 LD100 of HNc (10 μg) via an intracerebroventricular route or 1 LD100 (80 μg) via a subcutaneous route. All of the control mice died. Hence, this Nb is a potential leading novel candidate for treating H. lepturus scorpionism in the near future.—Yardehnavi, N., Behdani, M., Pooshang Bagheri, K., Mahmoodzadeh, A., Khanahmad, H., Shahbazzadeh, D., Habibi-Anbouhi, M., Hassanzadeh Ghassabeh, G., Muyldermans, S.

We estimated the effect of health-facility admission on maternal survival, and how this effect varies with skilled attendant coverage across India.Using unmatched population-based case-control analysis of national datasets, we compared the effect of health-facility admission at any time (antenatal, intrapartum, postpartum) on maternal deaths (cases) to women reporting pregnancies (controls). Probability of maternal death decreased with increasing skilled attendant coverage, among both women who were and were not admitted to a health-facility, however, the risk of death among women who were admitted was higher (at 50% coverage, OR = 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.85-2.92) than among those women who were not; while at higher levels of coverage, the effect of health-facility admission was attenuated. In a secondary analysis, the probability of maternal death decreased with increasing coverage among both women admitted for delivery or delivered at home but there was no effect of admission for delivery on mortality risk (50% coverage, OR = 1.0, 0.80-1.25), suggesting that poor quality of obstetric care may have attenuated the benefits of facility-based care. Subpopulation analysis of obstetric hemorrhage cases and report of 'excessive bleeding' in controls showed that the probability of maternal death decreased with increasing skilled attendant coverage; but the effect of health-facility admission was attenuated (at 50% coverage, OR = 1.47, 0.95-1.79), suggesting that some of the effect in the main model can be explained by women arriving at facility with complications underway. Finally, highest risk associated with health-facility admission was clustered in women with education ≤ 8 years.The effect of health-facility admission did vary by skilled attendant coverage, and this effect appears to be driven partially by reverse causality; however, inequitable access to and possibly poor quality of healthcare for primary and emergency services appears to play a role in maternal survival as well."
https://openalex.org/W1963559087,"Background The Innocor device contains a highly sensitive photoacoustic gas analyser that has been used to perform multiple breath washout (MBW) measurements using very low concentrations of the tracer gas SF6. Use in smaller subjects has been restricted by the requirement for a gas analyser response time of <100 ms, in order to ensure accurate estimation of lung volumes at rapid ventilation rates. Methods A series of previously reported and novel enhancements were made to the gas analyser to produce a clinically practical system with a reduced response time. An enhanced lung model system, capable of delivering highly accurate ventilation rates and volumes, was used to assess in vitro accuracy of functional residual capacity (FRC) volume calculation and the effects of flow and gas signal alignment on this. Results 10–90% rise time was reduced from 154 to 88 ms. In an adult/child lung model, accuracy of volume calculation was −0.9 to 2.9% for all measurements, including those with ventilation rate of 30/min and FRC of 0.5 L; for the un-enhanced system, accuracy deteriorated at higher ventilation rates and smaller FRC. In a separate smaller lung model (ventilation rate 60/min, FRC 250 ml, tidal volume 100 ml), mean accuracy of FRC measurement for the enhanced system was minus 0.95% (range −3.8 to 2.0%). Error sensitivity to flow and gas signal alignment was increased by ventilation rate, smaller FRC and slower analyser response time. Conclusion The Innocor analyser can be enhanced to reliably generate highly accurate FRC measurements down at volumes as low as those simulating infant lung settings. Signal alignment is a critical factor. With these enhancements, the Innocor analyser exceeds key technical component recommendations for MBW apparatus."

In the North Pacific their population structure is unclear and current status unknown, with the exception of a well-studied eastern North Pacific (ENP) population. Despite existing abundance estimates for the ENP population, it is difficult to estimate pre-exploitation abundance levels and gauge their recovery because historical catches of the ENP population are difficult to separate from catches of other populations in the North Pacific. We collated previously unreported Soviet catches and combined these with known catches to form the most current estimates of North Pacific blue whale catches. We split these conflated catches using recorded acoustic calls from throughout the North Pacific, the knowledge that the ENP population produces a different call than blue whales in the western North Pacific (WNP). The catches were split by estimating spatiotemporal occurrence of blue whales with generalized additive models fitted to acoustic call patterns, which predict the probability a catch belonged to the ENP population based on the proportion of calls of each population recorded by latitude, longitude, and month. When applied to the conflated historical catches, which totaled 9,773, we estimate that ENP blue whale catches totaled 3,411 (95% range 2,593 to 4,114) from 1905–1971, and amounted to 35% (95% range 27% to 42%) of all catches in the North Pacific. Thus most catches in the North Pacific were for WNP blue whales, totaling 6,362 (95% range 5,659 to 7,180). The uncertainty in the acoustic data influence the results substantially more than uncertainty in catch locations and dates, but the results are fairly insensitive to the ecological assumptions made in the analysis. The results of this study provide information for future studies investigating the recovery of these populations and the impact of continuing and future sources of anthropogenic mortality."

Methods Consecutive SLE patients who had been followed at the Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University were recruited. Cross-sectional correlations of the EQ-5D with equivalent domains in disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL), LupusQol, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) measures, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SDI), and patient characteristics were tested. Discriminant validity to assess the ability to distinguish between patients of different disease severity was assessed. There also were evaluations of ceiling and floor effects. Results 240 patients were recruited in total. The EQ-5D correlated moderately to strongly with all domains of the LupusQoL (r: 0.44–0.7) apart from intimate relationships (r = 0.25) and body image (r = 0.18). There was moderate negative correlation between EQ-5D and clinical assessment of disease, SLEDAI (r = −0.589) and SDI (r = −0.509). When compared with equivalent domains on LupusQoL, there was good construct validity in EQ-5D (r: 0.631–0.812). EQ-5D could also discriminate patients with varied disease severity (according SLEDAI and SDI). There was no floor effect in EQ-5D but the ceiling effect remains strong (34%). Conclusion Our results provide sufficient evidence that the EQ-5D displays construct and criterion validity for use in SLE patients.

Existing MVLR applications commonly use Query-by-Example (QBE) based image retrieval principle to fulfill the location recognition task. However, the QBE framework is not reliable enough due to the variations in the capture conditions and viewpoint changes between the query image and the database images. To solve the above problem, we make following contributions to the design of a panorama based on-device MVLR system. Firstly, we design a heading (from digital compass) aware BOF (Bag-of-features) model to generate the descriptors of panoramic images. Our approach fully considers the characteristics of the panoramic images and can facilitate the panorama based on-device MVLR to a large degree. Secondly, to search high dimensional visual descriptors directly on mobile devices, we propose an effective bilinear compressed sensing based encoding method. While being fast and accurate enough for on-device implementation, our algorithm can also reduce the memory usage of projection matrix significantly. Thirdly, we also release a panoramas database as well as a set of test panoramic quires which can be used as a new benchmark to facilitate further research in the area. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods for on-device MVLR applications."

Nonsense (c.662C→A, p.S221X designated F1, c.1609dupA, p.V537fsX7 designated F3) and missense (c.1073G→A, p.C358Y designated F2) NT5E gene mutations in three distinct families have been shown recently to cause premature arterial calcification disease in human patients. However, the underlying mechanisms by which loss-of-function NT5E mutations cause human disease are unknown. We hypothesized that human NT5E gene mutations cause mistrafficking of the defective proteins within cells, ultimately blocking NT5E catalytic function. To test this hypothesis, plasmids encoding cDNAs of wild type and mutant human NT5E tagged with the fluorescent probe DsRed were generated and used for transfection and heterologous expression in immortalized monkey COS-7 kidney cells that lack native NT5E protein. Enzyme histochemistry and Malachite green assays were performed to assess the biochemical activities of wild type and mutant fusion NT5E proteins. Subcellular trafficking of fusion NT5E proteins was monitored by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis of fractionated cell constituents. All 3 F1, F2, and F3 mutations result in a protein with significantly reduced trafficking to the plasma membrane and reduced ER retention as compared to wild type protein. Confocal immunofluorescence demonstrates vesicles containing DsRed-tagged NT5E proteins (F1, F2 and F3) in the cell synthetic apparatus. All 3 mutations resulted in absent NT5E enzymatic activity at the cell surface. In conclusion, three familial NT5E mutations (F1, F2, F3) result in novel trafficking defects associated with human disease. These novel genetic causes of human disease suggest that the syndrome of premature arterial calcification due to NT5E mutations may also involve a novel “trafficking-opathy”."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor effect of clotrimazole, and to investigate the possible mechanism of clotrimazole-mediated antitumor activity in OSCC. Methodology In vitro experiments, the cell viability and clonogenic ability of three human OSCC cell lines CAL27, SCC25 and UM1 were detected after clotrimazole treatment by CCK8 assay and colony formation assay. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry, and the involvement of several mediators of apoptosis was examined by western blot analysis. Then, the in vivo antitumor effect of clotrimazole was investigated in CAL27 xenograft model. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were performed to determine the presence of apoptotic cells and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in tumors from mice treated with or without clotrimazole. Results Clotrimazole inhibited proliferation in all three OSCC cell lines in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and significantly reduced the colony formation of OSCC cells in vitro. Clotrimazole caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. In addition, clotrimazole induced apoptosis in OSCC cells, and significantly down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Notably, clotrimazole treatment inhibited OSCC tumor growth and cell proliferation in CAL27 xenograft model. Clotrimazole also markedly reduced Bcl-2 expression and increased the protein level of Bax in tumor tissues of xenograft model. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated a potent anticancer effect of clotrimazole by inducing cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis in OSCC."

We investigated the effect of HCU on hepatic cysteine oxidation in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) protein levels were 90% repressed without any change in mRNA levels. Cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) was induced at both the mRNA (8-fold) and protein (15-fold) levels. Cysteine supplementation normalized CDO protein levels without reversing the induction of CSAD. Regulatory changes in CDO and CSAD expression were proportional to homocysteine elevation, indicating a possible threshold effect. Hepatic and blood taurine levels in HCU animals were decreased by 21 and 35%, respectively, and normalized by cysteine supplementation. Expression of the cytoplasmic (GOT1) and mitochondrial (GOT2) isoforms of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase were repressed in HCU animals by 86 and 30%, respectively. HCU induced regulatory changes in CSAD, CDO, and GOT1 expression were normalized by taurine supplementation, indicating that cysteine is not the only sulfur compound that regulates hepatic cysteine oxidation. Collectively, our results indicate that HCU induces significant alterations of sulfur metabolism with the potential to contribute to pathogenesis and that cysteine and taurine have the potential to serve as adjunctive treatments in this disease.—Jiang, H., Stabler, S.

To evolve the VH domain, we performed in vivo protein solubility selection that linked antibiotic resistance to the protein folding quality control mechanism of the twin-arginine translocation pathway of E. coli. After screening a human germ-line VH library, 95% of the VH proteins obtained were identified as VH3 family members; one VH protein, MG2x1, stood out among separate clones expressing individual VH variants. With further screening of combinatorial framework mutation library of MG2x1, we found a consistent bias toward substitution with tryptophan at the position of 50 and 58 in VH. Comparison of the crystal structures of the VH variants revealed that those substitutions with bulky side chain amino acids filled the cavity in the VH interface between heavy and light chains of the Fab arrangement along with the increased number of hydrogen bonds, decreased solvation energy, and increased negative charge. Accordingly, the engineered VH acquires an increased level of thermodynamic stability, reversible folding, and soluble expression. The library built with the VH variant as a scaffold was qualified as most of VH clones selected randomly were expressed as soluble form in E. coli regardless length of the combinatorial CDR. Furthermore, a non-aggregation feature of the selected VH conferred a free of humoral response in mice, even when administered together with adjuvant. As a result, this selection provides an alternative directed evolution pathway for unstable proteins, which are distinct from conventional methods based on the phage display."
https://openalex.org/W2048701968,"Mutations in the copper (Cu) transporter gene ATP7B, the primary cause of Wilson disease (WD), result in high liver Cu and death of hepatocytes. Cu chelators and zinc salts are the two most important drugs used in the treatment of WD patients; however, the molecular mechanisms of the drugs with regard to ATP7B expression have not been determined. A targeted knockout of ATP7B (KO) was established in the most widely used human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 for molecular studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. KO cells showed similar growth, Cu uptake, release, and gene expression as compared to parental cells. However, in the presence of Cu, morphological changes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and loss of viability were observed. Induction of metallothionein (MT1X) after Cu exposure was significantly reduced in KO cells. Following zinc treatment, MT1X expression was strongly induced and a high percentage of KO cells could be rescued from Cu induced toxicity. D-penicillamine treatment had a minor effect on the viability of KO cells whereas the parental cell line showed a pronounced improvement. Combined treatment displayed a highly synergistic effect in KO cells. The data suggest that zinc has a previously unrecognized effect on the viability of hepatocytes that lack ATP7B due to a high induction of MT1X expression that compensates low gene expression after Cu exposure. A combination therapy that simultaneously targets at MT1X induction and Cu chelation improves the overall survival of hepatocytes for most efficient therapy of patients having WD."

Eligible patients were dosed with 1 g/kg of Gammaplex on two consecutive days, followed by assessment of safety and efficacy on Days 3, 5, 9, 14, 21, 32 and 90. Response was defined as the increase in platelet count to a threshold of ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L on or before Day 9 after the first dose of Gammaplex.All 35 patients received at least one infusion of Gammaplex. Twenty-nine (83%) patients responded to Gammaplex, similar to the historical control, with a 95% lower one-sided confidence interval of 68.9%. Median duration of response was 10.0 days, with an overall reduction in bleeding episodes. Gammaplex provided supranormal concentrations of total IgG; mean peak concentration (Cmax) of 45.3 g/L (4.53 g/dL), with a mean half-life of 28.5 days. Fifteen patients reported 63 Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs); the most common were headache (10 patients), vomiting (6 patients) and pyrexia (5 patients). Five of these ADRs were considered serious, one patient had three concurrent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); these were vomiting, dehydration and headache. Two other patients each had one SAE (headache). There were no unexpected Adverse Events (AEs) or thromboembolic episodes and no significant changes in vital signs, biochemical, haematological and virology results.Gammaplex achieved a very high concentration of serum IgG but was well-tolerated and effective in the treatment of ITP with a similar degree of efficacy to the pre-determined historical control group and the pre-set statistical criteria.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00504075 Clinical Trials Registry India 000016."
https://openalex.org/W2099836536,"Hierarchical scales are useful in understanding the structure of underlying latent traits in many questionnaires. The Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ) explored the attitudes to ageing of older people themselves, and originally described three distinct subscales: (1) Psychosocial Loss (2) Physical Change and (3) Psychological Growth. This study aimed to use Mokken analysis, a method of Item Response Theory, to test for hierarchies within the AAQ and to explore how these relate to underlying latent traits.Participants in a longitudinal cohort study, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, completed a cross-sectional postal survey. Data from 802 participants were analysed using Mokken Scaling analysis. These results were compared with factor analysis using exploratory structural equation modelling.Participants were 51.6% male, mean age 74.0 years (SD 0.28). Three scales were identified from 18 of the 24 items: two weak Mokken scales and one moderate Mokken scale. (1) 'Vitality' contained a combination of items from all three previously determined factors of the AAQ, with a hierarchy from physical to psychosocial; (2) 'Legacy' contained items exclusively from the Psychological Growth scale, with a hierarchy from individual contributions to passing things on; (3) 'Exclusion' contained items from the Psychosocial Loss scale, with a hierarchy from general to specific instances. All of the scales were reliable and statistically significant with 'Legacy' showing invariant item ordering. The scales correlate as expected with personality, anxiety and depression. Exploratory SEM mostly confirmed the original factor structure.The concurrent use of factor analysis and Mokken scaling provides additional information about the AAQ. The previously-described factor structure is mostly confirmed. Mokken scaling identifies a new factor relating to vitality, and a hierarchy of responses within three separate scales, referring to vitality, legacy and exclusion. This shows what older people themselves consider important regarding their own ageing."

We report that the Arg Src homology (SH) 2 domain binds two specific phosphotyrosines on cortactin, a known Abl/Arg substrate, with over 10-fold higher affinity than the Abl SH2 domain. We show that this significant affinity difference is due to the substitution of arginine 161 and serine 187 in Abl to leucine 207 and threonine 233 in Arg, respectively. We constructed Abl SH2 domains with R161L and S187T mutations alone and in combination and find that these substitutions are sufficient to convert the low affinity Abl SH2 domain to a higher affinity “Arg-like” SH2 domain in binding to a phospho-cortactin peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2003022704,"Understanding the nature of inter-specific and conspecific interactions in the ocean is challenging because direct observation is usually impossible. The development of dual transmitter/receivers, Vemco Mobile Transceivers (VMT), and satellite-linked (e.g. GPS) tags provides a unique opportunity to better understand between and within species interactions in space and time. Quantifying the uncertainty associated with detecting a tagged animal, particularly under varying field conditions, is vital for making accurate biological inferences when using VMTs. We evaluated the detection efficiency of VMTs deployed on grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, off Sable Island (NS, Canada) in relation to environmental characteristics and seal behaviour using generalized linear models (GLM) to explore both post-processed detection data and summarized raw VMT data. When considering only post-processed detection data, only about half of expected detections were recorded at best even when two VMT-tagged seals were estimated to be within 50-200 m of one another. At a separation of 400 m, only about 15% of expected detections were recorded. In contrast, when incomplete transmissions from the summarized raw data were also considered, the ratio of complete transmission to complete and incomplete transmissions was about 70% for distances ranging from 50-1000 m, with a minimum of around 40% at 600 m and a maximum of about 85% at 50 m. Distance between seals, wind stress, and depth were the most important predictors of detection efficiency. Access to the raw VMT data allowed us to focus on the physical and environmental factors that limit a transceiver's ability to resolve a transmitter's identity."

Endocytosis appears to play a major role in the stability of PM proteins. Proteins that reside for the most part at the PM are generally more slowly degraded than proteins that undergo endocytosis (3Hare J.F. Taylor K.

U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5902-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, recycling mechanisms may also limit the time a protein is exposed to the sorting machinery that traffics endocytosed proteins to lysosomes for degradation (4Clague M.J. Liu H. Urbé S.

This relationship between endocytosis and degradation is often regulated by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination. This regulation involves endocytosis through clathrin-mediated (CME) or clathrin-independent (CIE) pathways, selective recognition of cargo for ubiquitination, sorting of ubiquitinated cargo within endosomes, packaging of ubiquitinated cargo into vesicles that bud into the lumen of the endosome (forming multivesicular bodies), and fusion of these endosomes with lysosomes, resulting in cargo degradation (2MacGurn J.A.

CME has been extensively studied and involves the selection and rapid internalization of PM proteins that contain distinct cytoplasmic sorting sequences recognized by adaptor proteins that are part of the clathrin coat (8Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). CME is the primary mechanism for endocytosis of transferrin receptor, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and signaling receptors after ligand stimulation (9Godlee C. Kaksonen M. Review series: from uncertain beginnings: initiation mechanisms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CIE, by contrast, is a slower non-selective internalization pathway that appears to lack a distinctive cytoplasmic coat and may function as a bulk form of endocytosis (10Howes M.T. Kirkham M. Riches J. Cortese K. Walser P.J. Simpson F. Hill M.M. Jones A. Lundmark R. Lindsay M.R. Hernandez-Deviez D.J. Hadzic G. McCluskey A. Bashir R. Liu L. Pilch P. McMahon H. Robinson P.J. Hancock J.F.

Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 675-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). There has been increased interest in CIE because it is the mode of entry for a number of bacterial toxins and cell surface proteins involved in immune function, ion and nutrient transport, and cell adhesion (11Maldonado-Báez L. Williamson C. Donaldson J.G. Clathrin-independent endocytosis: a cargo-centric view.Exp. Cell Res. 2013; 319: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to lysosomal degradation, a number of PM proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage of the luminal domain into the extracellular space, also known as ectodomain shedding. Although generally overlooked as a mechanism for protein turnover, ectodomain shedding is an essential post-translational mechanism that plays a critical role in development, cellular homeostasis, and immune function and during pathological conditions in vivo (12Horiuchi K. A brief history of tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme: an overview of ectodomain shedding.Keio J. Med. 2013; 62: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Scheller J. Chalaris A.

Whether turnover of specific PM proteins represents a balance between lysosomal targeting and ectodomain shedding and how this may be regulated in different cell types are unclear. We are interested in factors that determine PM protein turnover, especially proteins that enter cells by CIE, and in developing a systematic method to study this in cells. To establish a method to analyze PM protein turnover, we used a chemical labeling approach in which the self-labeling SNAP-tag was appended to the N terminus of the α chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, also known as Tac, as well as to a number of Tac variants that differ only in their mode of internalization (CIE versus CME), anchorage in the PM (transmembrane versus lipid-anchored), ability to be ubiquitinated, and presence or absence of juxtamembrane O-linked sugars. Pulse-chase studies with PM labeled SNAP-Tac chimeras demonstrated the usefulness of a model protein that undergoes a variety of trafficking and cell surface modifications. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. BG-S-S-488, BG-488, BG-800, and BG-PEG12-biotin were synthesized as described previously (15Eyster C.A. Cole N.B. Petersen S. Viswanathan K. Früh K. Donaldson J.G.

Rabbit anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and rabbit anti-Lamp1 were purchased from BD Biosciences and Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Batimastat (BB-94) and the O-linked glycosylation inhibitor benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside were from Sigma. For all SNAP-Tac chimeras, the signal peptide of hen egg lysozyme (MRSLLILVLCFLPLAALG) was introduced just before the second amino acid of the SNAP-tag (DKDCEMKR …). Following the SNAP-tag, a (GGGGS)2 linker was introduced followed by restriction sites (XbaI and ApaI) to insert the indicated extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail domains of Tac. The native signal peptide of Tac was omitted, and the beginning of the extracellular domain (1ELCDDD …) followed the linker. For SNAP-Tac-LI, the sequence ERAPLIRT from the rat lysosomal membrane protein LimpII (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_054001) was appended to the cytoplasmic tail of Tac. This contains the dileucine signal for clathrin adaptor-protein interactions and internalization via CME (17Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A.

For SNAP-Tac-KR, the single lysine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of Tac was mutated to an arginine (K246R). For SNAP-Tac-GPI, the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of Tac was replaced by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor sequence from the low affinity immunoglobulin γ Fc region receptor III-B (CD16b; NCBI Reference Sequence NM_001271037) (19Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Characterization of a nonclathrin endocytic pathway: membrane cargo and lipid requirements.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3542-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For the SNAP-Tac(T→A) glycosylation mutant, threonine residues corresponding to amino acids 197, 203, 208, and 216 in the mature Tac protein (20Miedel M.C. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Limited proteolysis of recombinant human soluble interleukin-2 receptor. Identification of an interleukin-2 binding core.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21097-21105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were replaced by alanine residues. For truncated SNAP-Tac chimeras containing control and mutated O-linked glycosylation sites, a 27-amino acid stalk region from the membrane proximal side of the extracellular domain of Tac (193LVTTTDFQIQTEMAATMETSIFTTEYQ219 …) was introduced together with the Tac transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 220–251) into the SNAP vector described above. The putative cleavage site that generates the soluble form of Tac resides immediately prior to the stalk domain between residues Cys192 and Leu193 (see “Discussion”). The threonine residues (in bold) were changed to alanine residues in the glycosylation mutants. All constructs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 using standard PCR and cloning techniques and sequence-verified. HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips (for immunofluorescence) or 10-cm plates (for degradation and pulldown assays) and transfected using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Experiments were performed 15–18 h after transfection. Cells expressing the chimeric proteins were labeled with BG-S-S-488 (1–2 μm) at 4 °C for 30 min in DMEM with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were then rinsed two times in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing calcium and magnesium, transferred to fresh medium, and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, cells were incubated with 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 2 min at 37 °C to remove excess surface label. After two washes in PBS, cells were fixed for 10 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS; rinsed with PBS, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); and incubated with rabbit anti-EEA1 monoclonal antibody in PBS, 10% FBS containing 0.2% saponin for 1 h followed by Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL). To monitor trafficking of cargo to lysosomal compartments, cells were incubated with BG-S-S-488 for 15 min at 37 °C, rinsed in HBSS, then transferred to fresh medium containing 20 mm NH4Cl and 20 μm BG-NH2 to block subsequent SNAP-tag labeling, and incubated for 6–22 h at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed in PBS, treated or not with TCEP, fixed, stained with rabbit anti-Lamp1 monoclonal antibody in PBS, 10% FBS containing 0.2% saponin for 1 h, and processed as described above. All images were obtained using either a 510 or 780 LSM confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63× Plan Apo objective and processed using Adobe Photoshop. The MetaMorph colocalization application (Molecular Devices) was used to quantify colocalization between SNAP-tag cargo and EEA1 or Lamp-1 acquired as maximum intensity projections. After separating the confocal images in the two different colors, individual cells were outlined using the MetaMorph trace region tool. After thresholding, quantification of the amount of overlapping fluorescence pixels per cell was obtained after applying the colocalization function. Data analysis was done using Excel and Prism software. HeLa or COS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SNAP constructs in 10-cm dishes. After 18 h, cells were removed from the dishes with 10 mm EDTA and replated into 12-well plates to assure similar levels of expression in each well. The next day, cells were labeled with BG-800 at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed, and then incubated in medium at 37 °C for the indicated time points in the presence of 20 μm BG-NH2 to block further SNAP labeling. At each time point, medium was collected, and cells were solubilized in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer I (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science Complete tablets) and 20 μm BG-NH2. For SNAP-Tac-GPI, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer I containing 1.0% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside instead of Triton X-10. Cell media and lysates (in duplicates or triplicates) were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and directly scanned and quantified by the Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). To determine protein concentration, gels were stained with Coomassie stain as described (21Luo S. Wehr N.B. Levine R.L. Quantitation of protein on gels and blots by infrared fluorescence of Coomassie Blue and Fast Green.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 350: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and rescanned. Protein detection was in the 700 nm channel. In brief, after electrophoresis, gels were stained for 20 min with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma B-7920) in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. They were then rinsed with 40% methanol and 7% acetic acid followed by destaining for 30 min to overnight in the same solution. Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) or other protein quantification assays can be used; however, we found that the values given by Coomassie staining generated more accurate results as it directly accounts for protein loading. To measure protein loading, the intensity for single or multiple protein bands was determined within each lane. The fluorescence signal for the protein of interest, as detected by BG-800, was then normalized to the Coomassie signal. To calculate the fraction shed into the medium, the values of the media fractions accounted for volume were divided by the total signal represented by shed plus cell-associated values. Prism and Excel software were used to analyze data, generate degradation plots, and calculate half-lives. This protocol is essentially from Eyster et al. (15Eyster C.A. Cole N.B. Petersen S.

HeLa cells (10-cm dishes) were transfected with the indicated SNAP-Tac construct (4 μg/dish) with HA-ubiquitin (1 μg/dish) and with or without MARCH8-FLAG (1 μg/dish). After 18 h, cells were labeled with BG-PEG4-biotin (1–2 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, lifted, and pelleted at 300 × g. Cell pellets were incubated with 100 μm BG-NH2 in 0.05 ml of PBS for 15 min at 4 °C and then solubilized by adding 0.2 ml of lysis buffer II (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide plus Complete protease inhibitor tablets. The cell extract was denatured by adding 20% SDS to obtain a 1% final concentration and boiled for 10 min. The SDS was quenched by adding 0.02 ml of 20% Triton X-100 and 1.8 ml of lysis buffer I, and the cell extract was placed on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and 0.05 ml of the supernatant was saved for SDS-PAGE. 0.05 ml of 1:1 slurry of NeutrAvidin-agarose resin (Thermo Scientific) was added to the supernatant and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer I and once with water. 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer was added, and the beads were boiled for 10 min before protein separation by SDS-PAGE (6% Tris, glycine for analysis of ubiquitination; 4–20% for analysis of MARCH8-FLAG expression; Novex, Invitrogen), transfer to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting. HA-ubiquitin was probed with monoclonal HA.11 (Covance), MARCH8-FLAG was probed with mouse anti-FLAG (M2 from Sigma), and SNAP-Tac proteins were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-SNAP (New England Biolabs). Species-specific infrared secondary antibodies were used for subsequent detection. Biotinylated SNAP-Tac was detected with DyLight 800-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies (each for 1 h at room temperature), then washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and visualized by scanning with an Odyssey infrared scanner. HeLa cells were transfected with SNAP constructs and replated into 12-well plates as described above. The next day, cells were labeled with BG-800 at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 500 nm batimastat (BB-94). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of BB-94. Media were collected, and cells were solubilized in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer I with protease inhibitors and 20 μm BG-NH2. Cell media and lysates (in triplicates or duplicates) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and directly scanned and quantified by the Odyssey infrared scanner. To determine protein concentration, gels were stained with Coomassie stain as described above and rescanned. Quantification was described above. For studies with inhibitors of O-linked glycosylation, HeLa cells were transiently transfected for 16 h with SNAP-Tac in 12-well dishes. Where indicted, GalNAc-O-Bn (Sigma) was added during the overnight transfection (2 mm final concentration). Cells were labeled with BG-800 for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with HBSS, and then incubated with Opti-MEM (0.5 ml) containing 40 μm BG-NH2. Cells were maintained for 10 min at room temperature and then shifted to 37 °C. The medium was collected, and cell lysates were made at 0 and 8 h of chase. Where indicated, the “sheddase” inhibitor BB-94 was added during the chase (1 μm final concentration). To qualitatively assess the amount of SNAP-Tac shed into the medium during the overnight incubation with GalNAc-O-Bn, the medium from control versus GalNAc-O-Bn-treated cells was incubated with BG-800 for 4 h at 4 °C. SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. 10-cm dishes of subconfluent HeLa or COS cells were treated with 1 mm EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-biotin (Thermo Scientific) in HBSS containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed once with HBSS and then incubated with HBSS containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then chased for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM. Media were collected, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then solubilized in lysis buffer I plus protease inhibitors. SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min before SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of protein were loaded from cell lysates as determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Biotinylated proteins were labeled with DyLight 800-conjugated NeutrAvidin and then detected on an Odyssey scanner. The α chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, also known as CD25 or Tac, is a type I membrane protein with a short, 13-amino acid cytoplasmic tail that lacks known targeting sequences.

The SNAP-tag has an active site cysteine residue that covalently binds O6-benzylguanine (BG) and its synthetic derivatives (29Keppler A. Gendreizig S. Gronemeyer T. Pick H. Vogel H. Johnsson K.

The covalent bond between BG and the SNAP-tag, however, makes fluorescence studies of endocytosis difficult because the probe cannot be removed from labeled proteins on the cell surface, concealing the intracellular endocytosed pool. Hence, we introduced a modification into this system that allows for the removal of the surface label (16Cole N.B. Donaldson J.G. Releasable SNAP-tag probes for studying endocytosis and recycling.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cleavable disulfide bond is introduced between the BG moiety and Alexa Fluor 488, creating BG-S-S-488, which allows us to remove surface fluorescence after a brief (1–2-min) treatment with the cell-impermeable reducing agent TCEP. To examine how different cytoplasmic sorting motifs affect the trafficking and turnover of cell surface proteins, different cytoplasmic tails were appended onto a reporter protein, SNAP-Tac. These modifications include an ERAPLIRT extension to generate a clathrin internalization signal (SNAP-Tac-LI); replacement of the transmembrane domain of Tac with a GPI anchor (SNAP-Tac-GPI); and mutation of the single lysine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of Tac (SNAP-Tac-K246R), a mutant expected to lack cytoplasmic sequences for ubiquitination (Fig. 1A) (see “Discussion”). We first examined the trafficking itinerary of SNAP-Tac proteins in cells using the cleavable BG-S-S-488 ligand. HeLa cells expressing SNAP-Tac, SNAP-Tac-LI, SNAP-Tac-KR, or SNAP-Tac-GPI were labeled at 4 °C with BG-S-S-488 for 30 min, then placed in fresh medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow endocytosis to occur. After 10 min, SNAP-Tac was still primarily at the cell surface, but some internal punctate structures could also be observed (Fig. 1B, top row). The internal pool of SNAP-Tac was revealed after the addition of TCEP, and it"

Although agent and environmental factors contribute to the incidence of this disease, the genetic factors influencing the clinical outcomes of R. equi pneumonia are ill-defined. Here, we performed independent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)- and copy number variant (CNV)-based genome-wide association studies to identify genomic loci associated with R. equi pneumonia in foals. Foals at a large Quarter Horse breeding farm were categorized into 3 groups: 1) foals with R. equi pneumonia (clinical group [N = 43]); 2) foals with ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary lesions that never developed clinical signs of pneumonia (subclinical group [N = 156]); and, 3) foals without clinical signs or ultrasonographic evidence of pneumonia (unaffected group [N = 49]). From each group, 24 foals were randomly selected and used for independent SNP- and CNV-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The SNP-based GWAS identified a region on chromosome 26 that had moderate evidence of association with R. equi pneumonia when comparing clinical and subclinical foals. A joint analysis including all study foals revealed a 3- to 4-fold increase in odds of disease for a homozygous SNP within the associated region when comparing the clinical group with either of the other 2 groups of foals or their combination. The region contains the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2 (TRPM2) gene, which is involved in neutrophil function. No associations were identified in the CNV-based GWAS. Collectively, these data identify a region on chromosome 26 associated with R. equi pneumonia in foals, providing evidence that genetic factors may indeed contribute to this important disease of foals."
https://openalex.org/W2045572548,"G2A (from G2 accumulation) receptor is a member of the proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family and induces signal transduction events that regulate the cell cycle, proliferation, oncogenesis, and immunity. The mechanism by which G2A-mediated signal transduction is regulated by the extracellular pH remains unresolved. Here, we first visualize the pH-dependent G2A distribution change in living cells by a sortase A-mediated pulse labeling technology: the short-peptide tag-fused human G2A on human embryo kidney HEK293T cell surfaces was labeled with a small fluorescent dye in the presence of lysophosphatidylcholine, and the labeled G2A was chased at acidic and neutral pHs in real time by microscope time course observations. G2A internalization from cell surfaces into intracellular compartments was observed to be inhibited under acidic pH conditions, and this inhibition was relieved at neutral pH. Additionally, the internalized G2A was redistributed onto cell surfaces by jumping from a neutral to an acidic pH. From quantitative image analysis data, we conclude the amount of G2A on the cell surface was controlled by suppressing the G2A internalization rate by one-tenth in response to the extracellular acidic pH, and this acidic pH-induced G2A accumulation on cell surfaces may be explained by proton-induced dissociation of G2A from endocytic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2063944133,"Background Pulse pressure (PP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and nighttime BP parameters are heritable traits. However, the genetic association of pulse pressure and its clinical impact remain undetermined. Method and Results We conducted a genome-wide association study of PP using ambulatory BP monitoring in young-onset hypertensive patients and found a significant association between nighttime PP and SNP rs897876 (p = 0.009) at chromosome 2p14, which contains the predicted gene FLJ16124. Young-onset hypertension patients carrying TT genotypes at rs897876 had higher nighttime PP than those with CT and CC genotypes (TT, 41.6±7.3 mm Hg; CT, 39.1±6.0 mm Hg; CC, 38.9±6.3 mm Hg; p<0.05,). The T risk allele resulted in a cumulative increase in nighttime PP (β = 1.036 mm Hg, se. = 0.298, p<0.001 per T allele). An independent community-based cohort containing 3325 Taiwanese individuals (mean age, 50.2 years) was studied to investigate the genetic impact of rs897876 polymorphisms in determining future cardiovascular events. After an average 7.79±0.28 years of follow-up, the TT genotype of rs897876 was independently associated with an increased risk (in a recessive model) of coronary artery disease (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.20–4.03; p = 0.01) and total cardiovascular events (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.29–3.06; p = 0.002), suggesting that the TT genotype of rs897876C, which is associated with nighttime pulse pressure in young-onset hypertension patients, could be a genetic prognostic factor of cardiovascular events in the general cohort. Conclusion The TT genotype of rs897876C at 2p14 identified in young-onset hypertensive had higher nighttime PP and could be a genetic prognostic factor of cardiovascular events in the general cohort in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2109582293,"Tropomodulin1 (Tmod1) is an actin-capping protein that plays an important role in actin filament pointed-end dynamics and length in striated muscle. No mechanisms have been identified to explain how Tmod1's functional properties are regulated. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the functional significance of the phosphorylation of Tmod1 at previously identified Thr54. Rat cardiomyocytes were assessed for phosphorylation of Tmod1 using Pro-Q Diamond staining and (32)P labeling. Green fluorescent protein-tagged phosphorylation-mimic (T54E) and phosphorylation-deficient (T54A) versions of Tmod1 were expressed in cultured cardiomyocytes, and the ability of these mutants to assemble and restrict actin lengths was observed. We report for the first time that Tmod1 is phosphorylated endogenously in cardiomyocytes, and phosphorylation at Thr54 causes a significant reduction in the ability of Tmod1 to assemble to the pointed end compared with that of the wild type (WT; 48 vs. 78%, respectively). In addition, overexpression of Tmod1-T54E restricts actin filament lengths by only ∼3%, whereas Tmod1-WT restricts the lengths significantly by ∼8%. Finally, Tmod1-T54E altered the actin filament-capping activity in polymerization assays. Taken together, our data suggest that pointed-end assembly and Tmod1's thin filament length regulatory function are regulated by its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W2119891727,"We sought to use splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to produce a model of accelerated ageing by enhancing expression of progerin, translated from a mis-spliced lamin A gene (LMNA) transcript in human myogenic cells. The progerin transcript (LMNA Δ150) lacks the last 150 bases of exon 11, and is translated into a truncated protein associated with the severe premature ageing disease, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS arises from de novo mutations that activate a cryptic splice site in exon 11 of LMNA and result in progerin accumulation in tissues of mesodermal origin. Progerin has also been proposed to play a role in the 'natural' ageing process in tissues. We sought to test this hypothesis by producing a model of accelerated muscle ageing in human myogenic cells. A panel of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal across exon 11 of the LMNA pre-mRNA, and these compounds were transfected into primary human myogenic cells. RT-PCR showed that the majority of oligonucleotides were able to modify LMNA transcript processing. Oligonucleotides that annealed within the 150 base region of exon 11 that is missing in the progerin transcript, as well as those that targeted the normal exon 11 donor site induced the LMNA Δ150 transcript, but most oligonucleotides also generated variable levels of LMNA transcript missing the entire exon 11. Upon evaluation of different oligomer chemistries, the morpholino phosphorodiamidate oligonucleotides were found to be more efficient than the equivalent sequences prepared as oligonucleotides with 2'-O-methyl modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone. The morpholino oligonucleotides induced nuclear localised progerin, demonstrated by immunostaining, and morphological nuclear changes typical of HGPS cells. We show that it is possible to induce progerin expression in myogenic cells using splice-switching oligonucleotides to redirect splicing of LMNA. This may offer a model to investigate the role of progerin in premature muscle ageing."
https://openalex.org/W1979032365,"Bromeliad phytotelmata are frequently used by several Neotropical amphibian taxa, possibly due to their high humidity, microclimatic stability, and role as a refuge from predators. Indeed, the ability of phytotelmata to buffer against adverse environmental conditions may be instrumental in allowing some amphibian species to survive during periods of environmental change or to colonize sub-optimal habitats. Association between bromeliad traits and salamanders has not been studied at a fine scale, despite the intimate association of many salamander species with bromeliads. Here, we identify microhabitat characteristics of epiphytic bromeliads used by two species of the Bolitoglossa morio group (B. morio and B. pacaya) in forest disturbed by volcanic activity in Guatemala. Specifically, we measured multiple variables for bromeliads (height and position in tree, phytotelma water temperature and pH, canopy cover, phytotelma size, leaf size, and tree diameter at breast height), as well as salamander size. We employed a DNA barcoding approach to identify salamanders. We found that B. morio and B. pacaya occurred in microsympatry in bromeliads and that phytotelmata size and temperature of bromeliad microhabitat were the most important factors associated with the presence of salamanders. Moreover, phytotelmata with higher pH contained larger salamanders, suggesting that larger salamanders or aggregated individuals might modify pH. These results show that bromeliad selection is nonrandom with respect to microhabitat characteristics, and provide insight into the relationship between salamanders and this unique arboreal environment."
https://openalex.org/W1996310585,"Since the description of the Neotropical genus Vargasiella in 1952, its taxonomic position has remained unclear, mainly due to a lack of sufficient data. In this study, the taxonomic position of Vargasiella was revised based on the outcomes of macro- and micromorphological studies, analyses of selected molecular markers and ecological methods of niche distribution modeling. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred using three DNA markers: matK, trnL-F and ITS sequences. The morphological studies included the analysis of macromorphological features of herbarium specimens as well as micromorphological examination of preserved flowers. The ecological niche modeling was applied to identify the distribution of the suitable niches of the studied taxa. The relationships between Vargasiella and most similar taxa remain unresolved based on the molecular analysis. The outcomes from the morphological studies indicated significant differences between Vargasiella, Warrea and Warreopsis. Moreover, a niche shift in response to changing climate after the last glacial maximum is observed in Vargasiella, while no substantial changes in the occupied habitats were identified in the other related taxa. The clocktree of the Zygopetaleae estimated from the matK gene indicated that the most recent common ancestors of Vargasiella, Warrea and Warreopsis originated in the Miocene, while the divergence time for Vargasiella and Warrea was assessed at approximately 5.4 Ma ago. Vargasiella seems to be an outshoot of the main branch of evolution of the Zygopetaleae. It is noteworthy that the Vargasiella-Warrea dichotomy could have taken place later than the divergence of Warreopsis from the mutual lineage. The molecular analysis and morphological data suggest that Vargasiella and Warrea could have evolved from a common ancestor. Accumulation of morphological differences and acceleration of the evolution of Vargasiella were more intensive than in other Warreinae and this could probably be synchronized with adaptation to different climatic conditions."
