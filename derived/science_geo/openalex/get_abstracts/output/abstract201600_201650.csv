https://openalex.org/W2030865527,"ONE of the Chlorella mutants described by Claes (strain 5/520)1 synthesizes in the dark certain poly-cis-isomers, which are described in the literature as protetrahydrolycopene2 and prolycopene3. In the algal cells the stereoconfiguration is sensitive to light. If oxygen is present, the procarotenes are isomerized in blue but not in red light, yielding the trans-forms in the cells. In this case light absorbed by the carotenes is presumed to be responsible for their isomerization."

The longer-acting barbiturates, barbitone and phenobarbitone, can accumulate in the body when administered in relatively low therapeutic dosage, and concentrations of these drugs in the blood of about 5 mgm./100 ml. do not necessarily imply poisoning. The shorter-acting barbiturates, when taken in therapeutic quantities, however, do not accumulate, and in such cases this concentration would imply that an excessive quantity had been taken."

https://openalex.org/W2011750925,"REDUCTION in radiation damage under conditions of low oxygen tension during the exposure has been demonstrated in a number of plant and animal tissues1. This report deals with similar effects in the insect Rhodnius prolixus. Latent radiation damage in ‘resting’ cells of the epidermis of Rhodnius is expressed as a burn at delayed moulting following a blood meal2. In these studies, the delay in moulting and the size of the burns have been utilized as convenient indices of the oxygen effect during X-irradiation."

Experiments in progress in this Laboratory have shown that this compound is rapidly detoxicated by biological agencies when added to soil at the rate of 0.02–0.05 per cent; various bacteria capable of utilizing it for growth were isolated from enrichment cultures by plating on selective agar medium. (A few earlier investigators1,2 have tested allyl alcohol with negative results as a carbon source for fungi and bacteria.)"

https://openalex.org/W2064803467,"A NEED has long existed for a simple, direct method for determining whether cross-reacting antigens are identical, or merely similar. Isolation and immuno-chemical characterization of individual antigens are often impossible. Measurement of precipitation or agglutinin titres, or of optimum proportions, are generally too crude to make distinction between identity and similarity possible, and may lead to confusing results1. Wodehouse2 has reported the method of cross-neutralization to be unsuited for antigenic analysis of allergens."

https://openalex.org/W1990772593,"HUMAN blood plasma or serum produces a delayed, slow contraction of the isolated ileum of the guinea pig. This effect is best observed with dialysed plasma, since dialysis eliminates the quick-contracting agents1. Recently, Gabr2 described the isolation from the G. 2 fraction of human plasma3 of a fatty acid which has an effect similar to that of plasma on the isolated ileum of the guinea pig."

https://openalex.org/W2081523062,"CONSIDERABLE data are now available on the radiosensitivity of cultivated plants1,2, but very little is known about the tolerance of wild species. We have investigated the doses of γ-radiation needed to prevent weed seeds from growing. The seeds were stored at 32 per cent relative humidity and irradiated in air with a range of doses from 0 to 100,000 rads of γ-radiation from cobalt-60. They were then planted in steam-sterilized soil and the number of plants arriving at maturity were counted. LD50 values for some common species of arable weeds are listed in Table 1."

Recently, however, seed samples of wild, cultivated and subspontaneous coffees in this region have been gathered by various agriculturists1,2. Several small seedling populations from Ethiopia were sent here in 1952 and 1953, and the genetic constitution of some of them is now being worked out."
