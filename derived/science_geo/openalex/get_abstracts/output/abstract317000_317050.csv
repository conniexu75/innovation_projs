https://openalex.org/W2034006956,"Argon-supported inductively coupled plasmas operated at atmospheric pressures are excellent vaporization-atomization-excitation-ionization sources for analytical atomic emission spectroscopy. When a polychromator is used for observing the emitted spectra, the metals and metalloids can be determined simultaneously at the ultratrace, trace, minor, and major concentration levels under one set of experimental parameters. Alternatively, programmable scanning spectrometers may be utilized for sequential determinations. The atomization-excitation process is remarkably free of interelement interactions, the powers of detection are in the part per billion range for most elements, and sample manipulation requirements prior to analyses are often minimal. The technique meets the requirements of an analytical system for the simultaneous or sequential determination of the elements at all concentration levels to an unusual high degree."

Similar measurements can be used to determine cosmogenic beryllium-10 (half-life, 1.5 x 10(6) years) profiles in various geophysical reservoirs such as sea sediments and polar ice. This procedure can be used either to date such samples or to give information about geophysical and astrophysical phenomena that have influenced the beryllium-10 production rate in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2022880284,"Analyses of xenon from well gas rich in carbon dioxide reveal a large excess of radiogenic xenon-129 from the decay of extinct iodine-129. Smaller excesses observed in the heavy xenon isotopes are from fission. These results place narrow limits on any age difference between the earth and the oldest meteorites. The occurrence of excess radiogenic xenon-129 in well gas also suggests that any quantitative degassing of existing solid materials to form the atmosphere must have been limited to a very early period of the earth's history, approximately the first 10(8) years. Alternatively, this observation is consistent with a model of the earth's continuous, but still incomplete, degassing since its time of formation."

https://openalex.org/W1994642143,"Transverse ridges consisting of protrusions into crustal fractures of ultramafic bodies derived from the upper mantle exist at the intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with equatorial fracture zones. Shallow-water limestones containing detrital grains of quartz, microcline, and orthoclase 1 millimeter in diameter were found on the summit of one such transverse ultramafic body at the Vema Fracture Zone; these findings are explained on the assumption that the limestones were deposited within a narrow, shallow proto-Atlantic and were left behind during the further opening of the Atlantic. Transverse ultramafic bodies from the offset zones of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge behave as nonspreading blocks plastered between spreading crustal plates."
https://openalex.org/W2158398233,"Spectroscopic analysis is a useful technique for identifying and quantitatively determining the presence of specific gaseous constituents. Development of high-power tunable lasers has made the spectroscopic technique for detection of trace constituents in the atmosphere very attractive for practical applications. In this article three of the currently used modes for laser detection of pollution are reviewed: (i) long-path measurements, (ii) laser Raman (differential absorption) measurements, and (iii) optoacoustic detection. Progress in the field has been extremely rapid in the last few years and very useful and reliable data on air pollution can now be obtained routinely with the techniques described."
https://openalex.org/W2017215095,"Radar observations of Mars with a surface resolution of 1.3° in latitude and 0.8° in longitude have been carried out during the opposition of 1971. With a precision in surface height measurement approaching 75 meters in regions of high reflectivity, it has been possible to measure the detailed characteristics of a number of craters. Many of these can be identified with craters shown in Mariner photographs of Mars. In addition, a scarp has been seen at 41° west, 14° south with an average slope of about 6° extending over about 40 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W1986582502,"This article traces the development of stabilized lasers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology passive-stabilization experiments of the early 1960's up through the current epoch of highly stabilized helium-neon and carbon dioxide and continuous wave dye lasers. The utility, present performance, and limitations of stabilized lasers as standards of length or frequency for precision measurements are discussed. Examples considered of laser applications to physical measurements of outstanding scientific interest include determination of the speed of light, redefinition of the meter, resolution of the photon recoil-induced spectral doubling, use of optical ""Ramsey"" interference fringes from ultrahigh-resolution spectroscopy, and two improved tests of special relativity."
https://openalex.org/W1981199359,"Radar observations of a narrow belt of the surface of Mars, centered at 16 degrees south latitude, show a very rugged terrain, with elevation differences greater than 13 kilometers from peak to valley. For nearby points, the relative altitude is measured to 40 meters at best; the precision is worse for points at different latitudes, or widely separated in longitude, because of orbital uncertainties. Some of the larger craters have been resolved, and their depth and, in some cases, the height of the raised rim have been measured. Where high resolution photographs, are available, the correlation is excellent."

https://openalex.org/W2005417314,"Infrared radiometric inference measurements of the mass of water vapor injected into the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by a number of plains thunderstorms show an average threefold increase over the fair weather background mass of water vapor. These airborne measurements, made from the National Aeronautics and Space Admninistration Convair 990 jet laboratory, extended over a sample size much larger than that possible by balloon and other techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2059310807,Observations made before aind after a catastrophic storml support the conclutsion that caves receivinig storm recharge may be significantly developed in the vadose zone by the processes of niass transfer. These processes are greatly accelerated during times of major floods. Evidence indicates that in ancient times floods of similar magnitude have occurred.
