https://openalex.org/W1751215550,"Recent advances in molecular therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) require precise genetic diagnosis because most therapeutic strategies are mutation-specific. To understand more about the genotype-phenotype correlations of the DMD gene we performed a comprehensive analysis of the DMD mutational spectrum in a large series of families. Here we provide the clinical, pathological and genetic features of 576 dystrophinopathy patients. DMD gene analysis was performed using the MLPA technique and whole gene sequencing in blood DNA and muscle cDNA. The impact of the DNA variants on mRNA splicing and protein functionality was evaluated by in silico analysis using computational algorithms. DMD mutations were detected in 576 unrelated dystrophinopathy families by combining the analysis of exonic copies and the analysis of small mutations. We found that 471 of these mutations were large intragenic rearrangements. Of these, 406 (70.5%) were exonic deletions, 64 (11.1%) were exonic duplications, and one was a deletion/duplication complex rearrangement (0.2%). Small mutations were identified in 105 cases (18.2%), most being nonsense/frameshift types (75.2%). Mutations in splice sites, however, were relatively frequent (20%). In total, 276 mutations were identified, 85 of which have not been previously described. The diagnostic algorithm used proved to be accurate for the molecular diagnosis of dystrophinopathies. The reading frame rule was fulfilled in 90.4% of DMD patients and in 82.4% of Becker muscular dystrophy patients (BMD), with significant differences between the mutation types. We found that 58% of DMD patients would be included in single exon-exon skipping trials, 63% from strategies directed against multiexon-skipping exons 45 to 55, and 14% from PTC therapy. A detailed analysis of missense mutations provided valuable information about their impact on the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W2110326961,"Carbapenemases have increasingly been reported in enterobacteriaceae worldwide. Most carbapenemases are plasmid encoded hence resistance can easily spread. Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae are reported to cause mortality in up to 50% of patients who acquire bloodstream infections. We set out to determine the burden of carbapenem resistance as well as establish genes encoding for carbapenemases in enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates obtained from Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda.This was a cross-sectional study with a total of 196 clinical isolates previously collected from pus swabs, urine, blood, sputum, tracheal aspirates, cervical swabs, endomentrial aspirates, rectal swabs, Vaginal swabs, ear swabs, products of conception, wound biopsy and amniotic fluid. All isolates were subjected to phenotypic carbapenemase screening using Boronic acid-based inhibition, Modified Hodge and EDTA double combined disk test. In addition, all the isolates were subjected to PCR assay to confirm presence of carbapenemase encoding genes.The study found carbapenemase prevalence of 22.4% (44/196) in the isolates using phenotypic tests, with the genotypic prevalence slightly higher at 28.6% (56/196). Over all, the most prevalent gene was blaVIM (21,10.7%), followed by blaOXA-48 (19, 9.7%), blaIMP (12, 6.1%), blaKPC (10, 5.1%) and blaNDM-1 (5, 2.6%). Among 56 isolates positive for 67 carbapenemase encoding genes, Klebsiella pneumonia was the species with the highest number (52.2%). Most 32/67(47.7%) of these resistance genes were in bacteria isolated from pus swabs.There is a high prevalence of carbapenemases and carbapenem-resistance encoding genes among third generation cephalosporins resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Uganda, indicating a danger of limited treatment options in this setting in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2341432280,"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and to characterize extended-spectrum β-lactamases- and/or carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat in Zagazig, Egypt.One hundred and six Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected from retail chicken meat samples purchased in Zagazig, Egypt in 2013. Species identification was done by MALDI-TOF MS. Screening for ESBL-E was performed by inoculation of isolates recovered from meat samples onto the EbSA (Cepheid Benelux, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands) selective screening agar. ESBL production was confirmed by combination disc diffusion test with clavulanic acid (Rosco, Taastrup, Denmark). Carbapenemases production was confirmed with double disk synergy tests. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR with specific primers for TEM, SHV, and CTX-M and carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP and VIM). PCR products of CTX-M genes were purified and sequenced. Phylogenetic grouping of E. coli was performed by a PCR-based method.Of these 106 isolates 69 (65.09%) were ESBL producers. Twelve (11.32%) of these isolates were also phenotypically class B carbapenemases producer. TEM genes were detected in 61 (57.55%) isolates. 49 (46.23%) isolates harbored CTX-M genes, and 25 (23.58%) carried genes of the SHV family. All CPE belonged to the NDM group. The predominant CTX-M sequence type was CTX-M-15 (89.80%). The majority (80%) of the ESBL-EC belonged to low virulence phylogroups A and B1.This is the first study from Egypt reporting high rates of ESBLs and carbapenemases (65.09% and 11.32%, respectively) in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat. These results raise serious concerns about public health and food safety as retail meat could serve as a reservoir for these resistant bacteria which could be transferred to humans through the food chain."
https://openalex.org/W1879552348,"Biomass allocation is an essential concept for understanding above- vs. below-ground functions and for predicting the dynamics of community structure and ecosystem service under ongoing climate change. There is rare available knowledge of grazing effects on biomass allocation in multiple zonal alpine grassland types along climatic gradients across the Northern Tibetan Plateau. We collected the peak above- and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB) values at 106 pairs of well-matched grazed vs. fenced sites during summers of 2010-2013, of which 33 pairs were subject to meadow, 52 to steppe and 21 to desert-steppe. The aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was represented by the peak AGB while the belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) was estimated from ANPP, the ratio of living vs. dead BGB, and the root turnover rate. Two-ways analyses of variance (ANOVA) and paired samples comparisons with t-test were applied to examine the effects of pasture managements (PMS, i.e., grazed vs. fenced) and zonal grassland types on both ANPP and BNPP. Allometric and isometric allocation hypotheses were also tested between logarithmically transformed ANPP and BNPP using standardized major axis (SMA) analyses across grazed, fenced and overall sites. In our study, a high community-dependency was observed to support the allometric biomass allocation hypothesis, in association with decreased ANPP and a decreasing-to-increasing BNPP proportions with increasing aridity across the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Grazing vs. fencing seemed to have a trivial effect on ANPP compared to the overwhelming influence of different zonal grassland types. Vegetation links above- and below-ground ecological functions through integrated meta-population adaptive strategies to the increasing severity of habitat conditions. Therefore, more detailed studies on functional diversity are essentially to achieve conservation and sustainability goals under ongoing climatic warming and intensifying human influences."
https://openalex.org/W2207990462,"In Gram-positive pathogens, surface proteins may be covalently anchored to the bacterial peptidoglycan by sortase, a cysteine transpeptidase enzyme. In contrast to other Gram-positive bacteria, only one single sortase enzyme, SrtB, is conserved between strains of Clostridium difficile. Sortase-mediated peptidase activity has been reported in vitro, and seven potential substrates have been identified. Here, we demonstrate the functionality of sortase in C. difficile. We identify two sortase-anchored proteins, the putative adhesins CD2831 and CD3246, and determine the cell wall anchor structure of CD2831. The C-terminal PPKTG sorting motif of CD2831 is cleaved between the threonine and glycine residues, and the carboxyl group of threonine is amide-linked to the side chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the peptidoglycan peptide stem. We show that CD2831 protein levels are elevated in the presence of high intracellular cyclic diGMP (c-diGMP) concentrations, in agreement with the control of CD2831 expression by a c-diGMP-dependent type II riboswitch. Low c-diGMP levels induce the release of CD2831 and presumably CD3246 from the surface of cells. This regulation is mediated by proteolytic cleavage of CD2831 and CD3246 by the zinc metalloprotease ZmpI, whose expression is controlled by a type I c-diGMP riboswitch. These data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for expression of two sortase substrates by the secondary messenger c-diGMP, on which surface anchoring is dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1837384645,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly. Neuritic plaques whose primary component is amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles which are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, are known to be the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. In addition, impaired synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks is thought to be important mechanism underlying for the cognitive deficits observed in AD. Although various causative factors, including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysregulation and oxidative damage caused by Aβ, are involved in early onset of AD, fundamental therapeutics that can modify the progression of this disease are not currently available. In the present study, we investigated whether phloroglucinol (1, 3, 5-trihydroxybenzene), a component of phlorotannins, which are plentiful in Ecklonia cava, a marine brown alga species, displays therapeutic activities in AD. We found that phloroglucinol attenuates the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by oligomeric Aβ1-42 (Aβ1-42) treatment in HT-22, hippocampal cell line. In addition, phloroglucinol was shown to ameliorate the reduction in dendritic spine density induced by Aβ1-42 treatment in rat primary hippocampal neuron cultures. We also found that the administration of phloroglucinol to the hippocampal region attenuated the impairments in cognitive dysfunction observed in 22-week-old 5XFAD (Tg6799) mice, which are used as an AD animal model. These results indicate that phloroglucinol displays therapeutic potential for AD by reducing the cellular ROS levels."
https://openalex.org/W1827907477,"Various bacteria localize metabolic pathways to proteinaceous organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (MCPs), enabling the metabolism of carbon sources to enhance survival and pathogenicity in the gut. There is considerable interest in exploiting bacterial MCPs for metabolic engineering applications, but little is known about the interactions between MCP signal sequences and the protein shells of different MCP systems. We found that the N-terminal sequences from the ethanolamine utilization (Eut) and glycyl radical-generating protein MCPs are able to target reporter proteins to the 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) MCP, and that this localization is mediated by a conserved hydrophobic residue motif. Recapitulation of this motif by the addition of a single amino acid conferred targeting function on an N-terminal sequence from the ethanol utilization MCP system that previously did not act as a Pdu signal sequence. Moreover, the Pdu-localized signal sequences competed with native Pdu targeting sequences for encapsulation in the Pdu MCP. Salmonella enterica natively possesses both the Pdu and Eut operons, and our results suggest that Eut proteins might be localized to the Pdu MCP in vivo. We further demonstrate that S. enterica LT2 retained the ability to grow on 1,2-propanediol as the sole carbon source when a Pdu enzyme was replaced with its Eut homolog. Although the relevance of this finding to the native system remains to be explored, we show that the Pdu-localized signal sequences described herein allow control over the ratio of heterologous proteins encapsulated within Pdu MCPs."
https://openalex.org/W1782094909,"Diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia include measures of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Consensus on the definition of sarcopenia has not been reached yet. To improve insight into the most clinically valid definition of sarcopenia, this study aimed to compare the association between parameters of malnutrition, as a risk factor in sarcopenia, and diagnostic measures of sarcopenia in geriatric outpatients.This study is based on data from a cross-sectional study conducted in a geriatric outpatient clinic including 185 geriatric outpatients (mean age 82 years). Parameters of malnutrition included risk of malnutrition (assessed by the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire), loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss and underweight (body mass index <22 kg/m2). Diagnostic measures of sarcopenia included relative muscle mass (lean mass and appendicular lean mass [ALM] as percentages), absolute muscle mass (total lean mass and ALM/height2), handgrip strength and walking speed. All diagnostic measures of sarcopenia were standardized. Associations between parameters of malnutrition (independent variables) and diagnostic measures of sarcopenia (dependent variables) were analysed using multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, body mass, fat mass and height in separate models.None of the parameters of malnutrition was consistently associated with diagnostic measures of sarcopenia. The strongest associations were found for both relative and absolute muscle mass; less stronger associations were found for muscle strength and physical performance. Underweight (p = <0.001) and unintentional weight loss (p = 0.031) were most strongly associated with higher lean mass percentage after adjusting for age. Loss of appetite (p = 0.003) and underweight (p = 0.021) were most strongly associated with lower total lean mass after adjusting for age and fat mass.Parameters of malnutrition relate differently to diagnostic measures of sarcopenia in geriatric outpatients. The association between parameters of malnutrition and diagnostic measures of sarcopenia was strongest for both relative and absolute muscle mass, while less strong associations were found with muscle strength and physical performance."
https://openalex.org/W2255673426,"In many photosynthetic organisms, tight-binding Rubisco inhibitors are released by the motor protein Rubisco activase (Rca). In higher plants, Rca plays a pivotal role in regulating CO2 fixation. Here, the ATPase activity of 0.005 mm tobacco Rca was monitored under steady-state conditions, and global curve fitting was utilized to extract kinetic constants. The kcat was best fit by 22.3 ± 4.9 min−1, the Km for ATP by 0.104 ± 0.024 mm, and the Ki for ADP by 0.037 ± 0.007 mm. Without ADP, the Hill coefficient for ATP hydrolysis was extracted to be 1.0 ± 0.1, indicating noncooperative behavior of homo-oligomeric Rca assemblies. However, the addition of ADP was shown to introduce positive cooperativity between two or more subunits (Hill coefficient 1.9 ± 0.2), allowing for regulation via the prevailing ATP/ADP ratio. ADP-mediated activation was not observed, although larger amounts led to competitive product inhibition of hydrolytic activity. The catalytic efficiency increased 8.4-fold upon cooperative binding of a second magnesium ion (Hill coefficient 2.5 ± 0.5), suggesting at least three conformational states (ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and empty) within assemblies containing an average of about six subunits. The addition of excess Rubisco (24:1, L8S8/Rca6) and crowding agents did not modify catalytic rates. However, high magnesium provided for thermal Rca stabilization. We propose that magnesium mediates the formation of closed hexameric toroids capable of high turnover rates and amenable to allosteric regulation. We suggest that in vivo, the Rca hydrolytic activity is tuned by fluctuating [Mg2+] in response to changes in available light.

https://openalex.org/W2155004764,"Background Several studies indicate that HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children have a high infectious morbidity. We previously reported an increased incidence of group B streptococcus (GBS) infections in HEU infants born in Belgium. Methods This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of all cause severe infections in HEU infants born in Belgium between 1985 and 2006, including the pre-antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis era (1985 to 1994). The medical charts of 537 HEU infants followed in a single center were reviewed. Results The incidence rate of severe infections during the first year of life was 16.8/100 HEU infant-years. The rates of invasive S. pneumoniae (0.62/100 infant-years) and GBS infections (1.05/100 infant-years) were, respectively, 4 and 13-fold higher in HEU infants than in the general infant population. Preterm birth was a risk factor for severe infections in the neonatal period (aOR = 21.34, 95%CI:7.12–63.93) and post-neonatal period (aHR = 3.00, 95%CI:1.53–5.88). As compared to the pre-ARV prophylaxis era, infants born in the ARV prophylaxis era (i.e., after April 1994) had a greater risk of severe infections (aHR = 2.93; 95%CI:1.07–8.05). This risk excess was present in those who received ARV prophylaxis (aHR 2.01, 95%CI 0.72–5.65) and also in those born in the ARV prophylaxis era who did not benefit from ARV prophylaxis as a result of poor access to antenatal care or lack of compliance (aHR 3.06, 95%CI 0.88–10.66). Conclusions In HEU infants born in an industrialized country, preterm birth and being born during the ARV prophylaxis era were risk factors of severe infections throughout the first year of life. These observations have important implications for the clinical management of HIV-infected mothers and their infants."
https://openalex.org/W1771018704,"Rotational grazing management strategies have been promoted as a way to improve the sustainability of native grass-based pasture systems. From disturbance ecology theory, rotational grazing relative to continuous grazing can increase pasture productivity by allowing vegetation to recover after short intense grazing periods. This project sought to assess whether soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks would also increase with adoption of rotational grazing management. Twelve pairs of rotationally and continuously grazed paddocks were sampled across a rainfall gradient in South Australia. Pasture productivity approximated as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was on average no different between management categories, but when the data from all sites were aggregated as log response ratios (rotational/continuous) a significant positive trend of increasing NDVI under rotational grazing relative to continuous grazing was found (R2 = 0.52). Mean SOC stocks (0-30 cm) were 48.3 Mg C ha-1 with a range of 20-80 Mg C ha-1 across the study area with no differences between grazing management categories. SOC stocks were well correlated with rainfall and temperature (multiple linear regression R2 = 0.61). After removing the influence of climate on SOC stocks, the management variables, rest periods, stocking rate and grazing days, were found to be significantly correlated with SOC, explaining 22% of the variance in SOC, but there were still no clear differences in SOC stocks at paired sites. We suggest three reasons for the lack of SOC response. First, changes in plant productivity and turnover in low-medium rainfall regions due to changes in grazing management are small and slow, so we would only expect at best small incremental changes in SOC stocks. This is compounded by the inherent variability within and between paddocks making detection of a small real change difficult on short timescales. Lastly, the management data suggests that there is a gradation in implementation of rotational grazing and the use of two fixed categories (i.e. rotational v. continuous) may not be the most appropriate method of comparing diverse management styles."
https://openalex.org/W1797860642,"Dapsone (DDS) hydroxylamine metabolites cause oxidative stress- linked adverse effects in patients, such as methemoglobin formation and DNA damage. This study evaluated the ameliorating effect of the antioxidant resveratrol (RSV) on DDS hydroxylamine (DDS-NHOH) mediated toxicity in vitro using human erythrocytes and lymphocytes. The antioxidant mechanism was also studied using in-silico methods. In addition, RSV provided intracellular protection by inhibiting DNA damage in human lymphocytes induced by DDS-NHOH. However, whilst pretreatment with RSV (10-1000 μM significantly attenuated DDS-NHOH-induced methemoglobinemia, but it was not only significantly less effective than methylene blue (MET), but also post-treatment with RSV did not reverse methemoglobin formation, contrarily to that observed with MET. DDS-NHOH inhibited catalase (CAT) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, but did not alter superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in erythrocytes. Pretreatment with RSV did not alter these antioxidant enzymes activities in erythrocytes treated with DDS-NHOH. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory methods showed that DDS-NHOH has a pro-oxidant effect, whereas RSV and MET have antioxidant effect on ROS. The effect on methemoglobinemia reversion for MET was significantly higher than that of RSV. These data suggest that the pretreatment with resveratrol may decrease heme-iron oxidation and DNA damage through reduction of ROS generated in cells during DDS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1164997755,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) type 3, also known as lymphoid tissue inducer cells, plays a major role in both the development and remodeling of organized lymphoid tissues and the maintenance of adaptive immune responses. HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection causes breakdown of intestinal barriers resulting in microbial translocation, leading to systemic immune activation and disease progression. However, the effects of HIV/SIV infection on ILC3 are unknown. Here, we analyzed ILC3 from mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues in chronically SIV-infected macaques and uninfected controls. ILC3 cells were defined and identified in macaque lymphoid tissues as non-T, non-B (lineage-negative), c-Kit(+)IL-7Rα(+) (CD117(+)CD127(+)) cells. These ILC3 cells highly expressed CD90 (∼ 63%) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor and produced IL-17 (∼ 63%), IL-22 (∼ 36%), and TNF-α (∼ 72%) but did not coexpress CD4 or NK cell markers. The intestinal ILC3 cell loss correlated with the reduction of total CD4(+) T cells and T helper (Th)17 and Th22 cells in the gut during SIV infection (P < 0.001). Notably, ILC3 could be induced to undergo apoptosis by microbial products through the TLR2 (lipoteichoic acid) and/or TLR4 (LPS) pathway. These findings indicated that persistent microbial translocation may result in loss of ILC3 in lymphoid tissues in SIV-infected macaques, further contributing to the HIV-induced impairment of gut-associated lymphoid tissue structure and function, especially in mucosal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1627848973,"The psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) is an addictive drug of abuse. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to modulate METH-related reward and METH-seeking behaviour. Recent findings implicated the subthalamic nucleus (STh) as a key brain region in oxytocin modulation of METH-induced reward. However, it is unclear if oxytocin acts in this region to attenuate relapse to METH-seeking behaviour, and if this action is through the oxytocin receptor. We aimed to determine whether oxytocin pretreatment administered into the STh would reduce reinstatement to METH use in rats experienced at METH self-administration, and if this could be reversed by the co-administration of the oxytocin receptor antagonist desGly-NH2,d(CH2)5[D-Tyr2,Thr4]OVT. Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent surgery to implant an intravenous jugular vein catheter and bilateral microinjection cannulae into the STh under isoflourane anaesthesia. Rats were then trained to self-administer intravenous METH (0.1 mg/kg/infusion) by lever press during 2-hour sessions under a fixed ratio 1 schedule for 20 days. Following extinction of lever press activity, the effect of microinjecting saline, oxytocin (0.2 pmol, 0.6 pmol, 1.8 pmol, 3.6 pmol) or co-administration of oxytocin (3.6 pmol) and desGly-NH2,d(CH2)5[D-Tyr2,Thr4]OVT (3 nmol) into the STh (200 nl/side) was examined on METH-primed reinstatement (1 mg/kg; i.p.). We found that local administration of the highest oxytocin dose (3.6 pmol) into the STh decreased METH-induced reinstatement and desGly-NH2,d(CH2)5[D-Tyr2,Thr4]OVT had a non-specific effect on lever press activity. These findings highlight that oxytocin modulation of the STh is an important modulator of relapse to METH abuse."

In this study, we combine spectroscopic methods and microscopy to investigate α-helical IAPP-membrane interactions.

Electron microscopy shows the formation of various highly curved structures such as tubules or smaller vesicles in a membrane-remodeling process, and spectrofluorometric detection of vesicle leakage shows disruption of membrane integrity. This effect is stronger for human IAPP than for the less toxic rat IAPP.

In one model, hIAPP damages membranes at the amyloid fibril formation stage, such that hIAPP fibrils forming near the membrane extract lipid from the membrane as they grow; this lipid uptake process results in nonspecific rupturing and fragmentation of the membrane by the nascent fibrils (17Sparr E.

Therefore, fibril growth cannot be the sole mechanism involved. Other mechanisms have been suggested that are analogous to those utilized by antimicrobial peptides (22Shai Y.

One possibility that remains unexplored is that IAPP induces membrane curvature as an α-helical wedge. Prior to forming β-sheet fibrils, IAPP is known to bind to negatively charged lipids and detergents using an amphipathic α-helical structure (39Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R.

Here, we hypothesize that the insertion of such a helical structure into negatively charged membranes might induce and/or sense membrane curvature. Other proteins that form membrane-bound amphipathic α-helices are known to induce membrane curvature by pushing phospholipid headgroups apart, thereby effectively acting as wedges.

Importantly, such membrane remodeling and induction of membrane curvature can cause disruption of membrane integrity (52Varkey J. Isas J.M. Mizuno N. Jensen M.B. Bhatia V.K. Jao C.C. Petrlova J. Voss J.C. Stamou D.G. Steven A.C. Langen R. Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins.J. Biol.

Furthermore, at presynaptic termini in transgenic mice, overexpressed human α-synuclein was associated with remodeling of organelle membranes into highly curved structures (56Boassa D. Berlanga M.L.

We therefore tested whether some of the previously observed membrane-disrupting effects of IAPP might have been caused by induction of membrane curvature. Moreover, prior studies on membrane curvature-inducing proteins have shown that such proteins can also exhibit curvature-sensitive membrane binding under some conditions (44Peter B.J. Kent H.M.

Inasmuch as sensing of membrane curvature could have implications for physiological and pathogenic recruitment of IAPP to membranes, we also investigated the curvature sensitivity of the IAPP-membrane interaction. Using circular dichroism (CD), spectrophotometry, and fluorescence microscopy of GUVs, we find that α-helical IAPP converts large, negatively charged vesicles into much smaller structures. Dye leakage experiments indicate that this membrane remodeling coincides with significant disruption of membrane integrity, and electron microscopy reveals the IAPP-dependent formation of lipid tubules and smaller vesicles. By uncovering IAPP as a curvature inducer, we can correlate the previously discovered early phase of membrane leakage with the modulation of membrane architecture into highly curved structures. When using only weakly negatively charged membranes, we find that IAPP transitions from an inducer of membrane curvature to a sensor of membrane curvature. The induction or sensing of membrane curvature may impact IAPP's physiological and pathological functions and govern its membrane localization in vivo. In support of this notion, we show that IAPP preferentially localizes to mitochondria, where it interacts with cristae. Cristae are curved membrane structures rich in cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine, lipids with pronounced negative spontaneous curvature.

Methods The antiproliferative activity was evaluated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The inhibition of tumorigenesis was performed in JB6 promotion-sensitive (P+) cells. Results Results showed that Pelingo apple juice is characterized by a very high polyphenol content and strongly inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation. Its antiproliferative activity was found to be higher than the other five apple juices tested. Pelingo juice induced cell accumulation in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and autophagy through overexpression of p21, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and an increase in lipidated microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 beta (LC3B). Remarkably, Pelingo juice inhibited the 12-o-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced tumorigenesis of JB6 P+ cells, suppressing colony formation in semi-solid medium and TPA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Conclusions Our data indicate that the Pelingo apple is rich in food components that can markedly inhibit in vitro tumorigenesis and growth of human breast cancer cells and could provide natural bioactive non-nutrient compounds, with potential chemopreventive activity."
https://openalex.org/W1124415944,"An adequate health workforce force is central to universal health coverage and positive public health outcomes. However many African countries have critical shortages of healthcare workers, which are worse in primary healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of healthcare workers, policy makers and the community on the shortage of healthcare workers in Botswana.Fifteen focus group discussions were conducted with three groups of policy makers, six groups of healthcare workers and six groups of community members in rural, urban and remote rural health districts of Botswana. All the participants were 18 years and older. Recruitment was purposive and the framework method was used to inductively analyse the data.There was a perceived shortage of healthcare workers in primary healthcare, which was believed to result from an increased need for health services, inequitable distribution of healthcare workers, migration and too few such workers being trained. Migration was mainly the result of unfavourable personal and family factors, weak and ineffective healthcare and human resources management, low salaries and inadequate incentives for rural and remote area service.Botswana has a perceived shortage of healthcare workers, which is worse in primary healthcare and rural areas, as a result of multiple complex factors. To address the scarcity the country should train adequate numbers of healthcare workers and distribute them equitably to sufficiently resourced healthcare facilities. They should be competently managed and adequately remunerated and the living conditions and rural infrastructure should also be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2166552442,"Despite resection and adjuvant therapy, the 5-year survival for patients with Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is less than 10%. This poor outcome is largely attributed to rapid tumor growth and early dispersal of cells, factors that contribute to a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. An understanding of the cellular and molecular machinery that drive growth and dispersal is essential if we are to impact long-term survival. Our previous studies utilizing a series of immortalized GBM cell lines established a functional causation between activation of fibronectin matrix assembly (FNMA), increased tumor cohesion, and decreased dispersal. Activation of FNMA was accomplished by treatment with Dexamethasone (Dex), a drug routinely used to treat brain tumor related edema. Here, we utilize a broad range of qualitative and quantitative assays and the use of a human GBM tissue microarray and freshly-isolated primary human GBM cells grown both as conventional 2D cultures and as 3D spheroids to explore the role of Dex and FNMA in modulating various parameters that can significantly influence tumor cell dispersal. We show that the expression and processing of fibronectin in a human GBM tissue-microarray is variable, with 90% of tumors displaying some abnormality or lack in capacity to secrete fibronectin or assemble it into a matrix. We also show that low-passage primary GBM cells vary in their capacity for FNMA and that Dex treatment reactivates this process. Activation of FNMA effectively “glues” cells together and prevents cells from detaching from the primary mass. Dex treatment also significantly increases the strength of cell-ECM adhesion and decreases motility. The combination of increased cohesion and decreased motility discourages in vitro and ex vivo dispersal. By increasing cell-cell cohesion, Dex also decreases growth rate of 3D spheroids. These effects could all be reversed by an inhibitor of FNMA and by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-486. Our results describe a new role for Dex as a suppressor of GBM dispersal and growth."
https://openalex.org/W1878346456,"Multiple stressors are an increasing concern in the management and conservation of ecosystems, and have been identified as a key gap in research. Coral reefs are one example of an ecosystem where management of local stressors may be a way of mitigating or delaying the effects of climate change. Predicting how multiple stressors interact, particularly in a spatially explicit fashion, is a difficult challenge. Here we use a combination of an expert-elicited Bayesian network (BN) and spatial environmental data to examine how hypothetical scenarios of climate change and local management would result in different outcomes for coral reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Parameterizing our BN using the mean responses from our experts resulted in predictions of limited efficacy of local management in combating the effects of climate change. However, there was considerable variability in expert responses and uncertainty was high. Many reefs within the central GBR appear to be at risk of further decline based on the pessimistic opinions of our expert pool. Further parameterization of the model as more data and knowledge become available could improve predictive power. Our approach serves as a starting point for subsequent work that can fine-tune parameters and explore uncertainties in predictions of responses to management."
https://openalex.org/W1156760083,"Developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is associated with lung dysfunction and diseases. However, it is unknown if this association has a fetal origin. The present study addressed this important question by examining the effects of BPA on fetal lung development. BPA was administered to pregnant mice via diet from embryonic day (E) 7.5 to E18.5. Fetal lungs were analyzed at E18.5 for changes in structure and expression of key molecular markers of lung maturation. Our main findings were as follows: BPA severely retards fetal lung maturation, as evidenced by diminished alveolar airspace (15% of control) and thickened septa, hallmarks of lung immaturity; this immaturity is characterized by aberrant alveolar epithelial type I cell differentiation because expression of the type I cell marker, aquaporin 5, but not type II cell markers, is dramatically reduced (16% of control); and the effects of BPA are likely mediated through the glucocorticoid signaling pathway because the expression of epithelial sodium channel γ and glutathione peroxidase, 2 well-known glucocorticoid target genes, is down-regulated in BPA-exposed fetal lungs, and, importantly, maternal dexamethasone administration rescues the lung immaturity phenotype. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BPA disrupts fetal lung maturation, thus suggesting a fetal origin for BPA-induced lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1866573468,"In this exploratory neuroimaging-proteomic study, we aimed to identify CSF proteins associated with AD and test their prognostic ability for disease classification and MCI to AD conversion prediction. Our study sample consisted of 295 subjects with CSF multi-analyte panel data and MRI at baseline downloaded from ADNI. Firstly, we tested the statistical effects of CSF proteins (n = 83) to measures of brain atrophy, CSF biomarkers, ApoE genotype and cognitive decline. We found that several proteins (primarily CgA and FABP) were related to either brain atrophy or CSF biomarkers. In relation to ApoE genotype, a unique biochemical profile characterised by low CSF levels of Apo E was evident in ε4 carriers compared to ε3 carriers. In an exploratory analysis, 3/83 proteins (SGOT, MCP-1, IL6r) were also found to be mildly associated with cognitive decline in MCI subjects over a 4-year period. Future studies are warranted to establish the validity of these proteins as prognostic factors for cognitive decline. For disease classification, a subset of proteins (n = 24) combined with MRI measurements and CSF biomarkers achieved an accuracy of 95.1% (Sensitivity 87.7%; Specificity 94.3%; AUC 0.95) and accurately detected 94.1% of MCI subjects progressing to AD at 12 months. The subset of proteins included FABP, CgA, MMP-2, and PPP as strong predictors in the model. Our findings suggest that the marker of panel of proteins identified here may be important candidates for improving the earlier detection of AD. Further targeted proteomic and longitudinal studies would be required to validate these findings with more generalisability."

Participants underwent detailed ophthalmologic examinations including uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp and fundus examinations as well as questionnaires about previous outdoor activity and sunlight protection methods. ARC was recorded by LOCSⅢ classification system. The prevalence of cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract were assessed separately for the risk factors and its association with outdoor activity.Of all 2006 eligible participants, 883 (44.0%) adults were diagnosed with ARC. The prevalence rates of cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract per person were 41.4%, 30.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Women had a higher tendency of nuclear and cortical cataract than men (OR = 1.559, 95% CI 1.204-2.019 and OR = 1.862, 95% CI 1.456-2.380, respectively). Adults with high myopia had a higher prevalence of nuclear cataract than adults without that (OR = 2.528, 95% CI 1.055-6.062). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that age was risk factor of nuclear (OR = 1.190, 95% CI 1.167-1.213) and cortical (OR = 1.203, 95% CI 1.181-1.226) cataract; eyes with fundus diseases was risk factor of posterior subcapsular cataract (OR = 6.529, 95% CI 2.512-16.970). Outdoor activity was an independent risk factor of cortical cataract (OR = 1.043, 95% CI 1.004-1.083). The risk of cortical cataract increased 4.3% (95% CI 0.4%-8.3%) when outdoor activity time increased every one hour. Furthermore, the risk of cortical cataract increased 1.1% (95% CI 0.1%-2.0%) when cumulative UV-B exposure time increased every one year.Outdoor activity was an independent risk factor for cortical cataract, but was not risk factor for nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract.

https://openalex.org/W1816498372,"Non-invasive measurement of stress hormone metabolites in feces has become routine practice for the evaluation of distress and pain in animal experiments. Since metabolism and excretion of glucocorticoids may be variable, awareness and adequate consideration of influencing factors are essential for accurate monitoring of adrenocortical activity. Reference values are usually provided by baselines compiled prior to the experiment and by age matched controls. The comparison of stress hormone levels between animals of different ages or between studies looking at hormone levels at the beginning and at the end of a long term study might be biased by age-related effects. In this study we analyzed fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) during the lifetime of untreated female mice of the strains C57BL/6NCrl and Crl:CD1. For this purpose feces for each individual mouse were collected every two months over a period of 24 hours, at intervals of four hours, until the age of 26 months. Results of the study revealed that age of the animals had a significant impact on the level and circadian rhythm of stress hormone metabolites. Furthermore, long-term observation of mice revealed a strain specific excretion profile of FCM influenced by strong seasonal variability."

In South Korea, the National Health Insurance administers the National Cancer Screening Program to its beneficiaries. We examined the impact of the National Cancer Screening Program on socioeconomic disparities in cancer stage at diagnosis.Cancer patients registered in the Korean Central Cancer Registry from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 with a diagnosis of gastric cancer (n = 22,470), colon cancer (n = 16,323), breast cancer (n = 10,076), or uterine cervical cancer (n = 2,447) were included. Income level was divided into three groups according to their monthly contribution of National Health Insurance. We employed absolute (age-standardized prevalence rate, slope index of inequality) and relative (relative index of inequality) measures to separately examine social disparities among participants and non-participants of the National Cancer Screening Program in terms of the early-stage rate.Age-standardized prevalence rates of early-stage by income group were always higher in participants than in non-participants. Furthermore, the age-standardized prevalence rate of early-stage in the low income group of the participants was also higher than that of the high income group of the non-participants. The sizes of disparities (both slope index of inequality and relative index of inequality) are smaller in participants compared to non-participants.National Cancer Screening Program participation reduced income disparity in cancer stage at diagnosis. Population-based cancer screening programs can be used as an effective measure to reduce income disparity in cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W1805014646,"In the Mediterranean, the island dwarf megafaunas became extinct around the end of the Pleistocene, during a period of rapid and global climate change. In Cyprus, this coincided with the first human presence on the island, as attested by the rock shelter of Akrotiri-Aetokremnos where an Epipaleolithic anthropogenic layer (stratum 2) was found overlying a massive accumulation of pygmy hippopotamus (Phanourios minor (Desmarest, 1822)) [Boekschoten and Sondaar, 1972] bones (stratum 4). The relationship between the two layers is highly controversial and the role played by humans in hippo extinction remains fiercely debated. Here, we provide new, direct radiocarbon and physico-chemical analyses on calcined bones which elucidates the complex depositional history of the assemblage. Bone turquoise was identified using micro-PIXE analysis and depth-profiling together with Vis spectroscopy, demonstrating that these bones were not freshly burned. Bayesian modeling of the radiocarbon dates indicates that stratum 4 accumulated during the first half of the 13th mill cal BP and that calcination occurred several hundred years later. We conclude that accumulation occurred naturally during the beginning of the Younger Dryas and that Epipalaeolithic visitors subsequently used the bones as fuel, starting from the mid-13th mill cal BP. At that time, dwarf hippos were probably already extinct or at least highly endangered. Our results shed new light on the possible causes of hippo extinction, on the subsequent introduction of the wild boar and on the earliest occupation of the island by humans."

Phytaspase is involved in PCD triggered by abiotic insults, such as oxidative and salt stresses, as well as by biotic stresses. In the latter case, infection with tobacco mosaic virus of certain tobacco cultivars was used to induce a specific form of plant PCD known as the hypersensitive response, which leads to the death of infected cells and limits virus spread.

Despite the similarities with caspases in cleavage specificity and a role in PCD, regulation of the phytaspase activity is different. Being synthesized as preproenzyme, phytaspase is autocatalytically and constitutively processed to generate a mature proteolytically active enzyme, which is secreted out of healthy plant cells. Upon induction of PCD, phytaspase is re-imported from the intercellular space into the dying cells to get access to intracellular proteins (20Chichkova N.V. Shaw J. Galiullina R.A. Drury G.E.

Kinetic analysis of the cleavage of optimized peptide substrates revealed their efficient hydrolysis by phytaspase. The acquired knowledge of the amino acid sequence of the preferred phytaspase cleavage site allowed us to identify phytaspase substrates among human gastrointestinal peptide hormones. Fresh rice O. sativa cv. “Leader” leaves (100 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted twice with 250- and 100-ml portions of B1 buffer (20 mm MES, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% glycerol), pH 5.7, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm PMSF. The debris was eliminated by 20-min centrifugations at 14,000 × g at +4 °C, and the supernatant exhibiting pH 6.7 was acidified at +4 °C to pH 5.3 by adding 3 n acetic acid dropwise. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a DE53 column (Whatman, 100 ml) equilibrated with B1 buffer, pH 5.7. Flow-through from this column was collected and fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The protein fraction that precipitated within the 30–60% interval of (NH4)2SO4 saturation was dissolved in B1 buffer, pH 5.7, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample was then subjected to cation exchange chromatography on a HiTrap CM FF1 column (CM Sepharose Fast Flow, 1 ml) equilibrated with buffer B1, pH 5.7, using AKTA Purifier10 (GE Healthcare). Elution was performed with a 0–1.0 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Peak fractions containing phytaspase activity (0.25–0.45 m NaCl) were combined and brought to 0.4 m NaCl. The obtained sample was loaded onto a HiTrap Blue HP column (5 ml) equilibrated with B1 buffer, pH 5.7. Elution was performed with a 0–2.5 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer, and peak fractions containing phytaspase activity (1.3–2.2 m NaCl) were combined and concentrated using a YM-30 Centricon (Amicon). Phytaspase sample was then incubated with 0.4 mm biotin-TATD-CHO phytaspase inhibitor (Bachem) in B1 buffer, pH 5.5, at 27 °C for 30 min, an excess of the unreacted inhibitor was removed using a Sephadex G10 (GE Healthcare) mini spin column, and the reaction mixture was applied onto a SoftLink Soft Release Avidin resin (Promega) at 0 °C. Biotinylated proteins eluted with 5 mm biotin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Purified enzyme was dialyzed against B1 buffer, pH 6.5, and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme concentration was determined using BSA as a standard. Phytaspase activity was determined by assessing fragmentation of the GFP-VirD2Ct protein and by hydrolysis of synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates. In the former case, His6-tagged GFP-VirD2Ct protein containing, in successive order, a His tag, a GFP moiety, and an 86-amino acid-long C-terminal region of the A. tumefaciens VirD2 protein, was isolated from Escherichia coli cells overproducing the recombinant protein by means of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography as described (19Chichkova N.V. Kim S.H. Titova E.S. Kalkum M. Morozov V.S. Rubtsov Y.P. Kalinina N.O. Taliansky M.E. Vartapetian A.B. A plant caspase-like protease activated during the hypersensitive response.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the enzyme were incubated with the GFP-VirD2Ct protein (3 μg) in B1 buffer, pH 5.7, at 27 °C for 1.5 h, reaction mixtures were fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and substrate fragmentation was visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Individual fluorogenic peptide substrates (from American Peptide Co., Anaspec, Bachem, Calbiochem, California Peptide Research, Enzo Life Sciences, MP Biomedicals, and those synthesized in this work; see below) were tested at the concentration of 20 μm. Kinetic measurements of fluorescence intensities were performed in B1 buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl at 27 °C or 30 °C in triplicate using FLUOstar OPTIMA reader (BMG Labtech) equipped with 405-nm excitation and 520-nm emission filters (for peptides with an 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) fluorescent tag or with 355-nm excitation and 460-nm emission filters for 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) derivatives). In the case of ACC derivatives, Tween 20 was omitted from B1 buffer to closely mimic reaction conditions used for library screenings (see below). To determine the pH and salt dependence for phytaspase hydrolysis, the enzyme samples were diluted 10-fold with buffers of pH 3.0–8.0 with or without 0.5 m NaCl and incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrate at 30 °C for up to 5 h or with GFP-VirD2Ct substrate protein (in buffers lacking NaCl only) for 2.5 h. Sodium citrate, sodium acetate, MES, and HEPES were used at 20 mm to obtain buffers covering pH intervals 3.0–3.5, 4.0–5.0, 5.5–6.5, and 7.0–8.0, respectively. All buffers contained 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% glycerol. The fluorogenic substrate library (P2, P3, and P4 positions) was synthesized similarly to the previously published protocols (26Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S.

A constitutively active and uninhibitable caspase-3 zymogen efficiently induces apoptosis.Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the first step Fmoc-ACC-OH fluorophore was attached to 6 g of Rink Amide resin according to the procedure described elsewhere (28Poreba M. Kasperkiewicz P. Snipas S.J. Fasci D. Salvesen G.S. Drag M. Unnatural amino acids increase sensitivity and provide for the design of highly selective caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21: 1482-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After the Fmoc group deprotection (20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)), Fmoc-Asp(tBu)-OH (2.5 eq) was attached to the NH2-ACC-resin using 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU, 2.5 eq) as a coupling agent and 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (collidine, 2.5 eq) as a base. The reaction was carried out overnight. Next, the coupling of Fmoc-Asp(tBu)-OH was repeated with 1.5 eq of each reagent(overnight). The Fmoc-Asp(tBu)-OH substitution level was determined using HPLC analysis. A small portion of resin was subjected to TFA/triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/H2O cleavage, and the crude product was analyzed on HPLC; the only peak detected was from Fmoc-Asp(tBu)-ACC. After the Fmoc group deprotection the resin was washed with DMF (3×), dichloromethane (DCM, 3×), and MeOH (3×) and dried over P2O5 overnight. Next, the resin was divided into 60 portions (20 portions for each position). For the synthesis of the P2 library, 20 portions of resin were placed into a MultiChem 48-well synthesis apparatus (FlexChem from SciGene, Sunnyvale, CA) and swollen in DCM for 15 min and then washed with DMF (3×). For coupling fixed P2 position, each of 20 Fmoc-protected amino acids (19 natural and 1 unnatural, susceptible to oxidation cysteine was replaced with norleucine) (3 eq) was preactivated with N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (3 eq) and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (3 eq) in DMF for 3 min and poured into the resin. The P2 coupling reaction was carried out for 3 h. After this time, the ninhydrin test confirmed the completion of coupling. The Fmoc group was deprotected as described previously. For coupling P3 and P4 positions of the P2 library, an isokinetic mixture of 19 Fmoc-protected amino acids was prepared (18 natural and 1 unnatural cysteine was omitted, and norleucine was used instead of methionine). Then, 5 eq of the isokinetic mixture was preincubated with 5 eq of N-hydroxybenzotriazole and 5 eq of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF for 3 min and poured onto the resin. The coupling reaction was carried out for 3 h (monitoring by ninhydrin test). Finally, after P4 Fmoc group deprotection the N-terminal amine group was acetylated using a mixture of acetic acid (5 eq), HBTU, 5 eq, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (5 eq) in DMF. The acetylation reaction was performed for 30 min to obtain Ac-mix-mix-P2-Asp(tBu)-ACC-resin. Next, the resin was washed with DMF (3×), DCM (3×), MeOH (3×), and dried over P2O5 overnight. The P3 and P4 sublibraries were synthesized in a similar manner. Finally, each of the 20-member sublibraries was cleaved from the resin with a mixture of TFA/TIPS/H2O (v/v/v 95:2.5:2.5, 2 ml per well) for 2 h. The solution from each well was collected separately, and diethyl ether was used to precipitate compounds. After centrifugation and decantation, the white crude product was dissolved in a mixture of water and acetonitrile (1:2, v/v) and lyophilized. The final product was dissolved in peptide grade DMSO to the final concentration of 20 mm and stored at −80 °C until use. Enzyme activity toward libraries was measured as a relative fluorescence units per second using a plate reader (Molecular Devices) according to the previously described method (28Poreba M. Kasperkiewicz P. Snipas S.J. Fasci D. Salvesen G.S. Drag M.

The final substrate library concentration in each well was 100 μm, and final enzyme concentration was 12.6 nm. The substrate library (stock solution 10 mm in DMSO) was added to a 96-well Corning Plate (opaque). The enzyme was preincubated in buffer for 30 min at 30 °C followed by addition to the plate wells. Relative fluorescence values were measured at 355/460 nm (cutoff 455 nm), and the obtained results were transformed to percentages by comparison of the highest value from each library separately (set as 100%) to relative fluorescence units per second for each library component. The result was presented as a bar graph made using Microsoft Excel. Substrates were synthesized according to the previously described method (28Poreba M. Kasperkiewicz P. Snipas S.J. Fasci D.

Unnatural amino acids increase sensitivity and provide for the design of highly selective caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21: 1482-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 1 eq of Fmoc-Rink Amide resin (0.7 mmol/g, 200–300 mesh) was swollen for 30 min in DCM in a glass peptide synthesis vessel. Resin was washed 3 times with DMF (3 × 5 ml) followed by Fmoc-protecting group removal with 20% piperidine/DMF solution (3 times for 5, 5, and 25 min). The resin was washed 3 times with DMF and to confirm amine group deprotection, a ninhydrin test was conducted. In the next step 2.5 eq of Fmoc-ACC-OH was activated for 2 min with 2.5 eq of N-hydroxybenzotriazole and 2.5 eq of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF in an Eppendorf tube followed by pouring onto the resin. The mixture was agitated for 24 h at room temperature, and then the supernatant was removed, the resin was washed 3 times with DMF, and Fmoc-ACC-OH coupling was repeated using 1.5 eq of reagents. After 24 h, the resin was washed 3 times with DMF (3 × 5 ml), and a ninhydrin test was carried out to confirm coupling of Fmoc-ACC-OH. Subsequently, the Fmoc-protecting group was removed using the previously described method, and 2.5 eq of Fmoc-Asp-OH was preactivated with 2.5 eq of HATU and 2.5 eq of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (collidine) in DMF for 2 min in an Eppendorf tube followed by pouring onto the resin. After gentle agitation for 24 h at room temperature,the resin was washed with DMF (3 × 5 ml), and coupling was repeated with 1.5 eq of reagents. Next, the solution was removed, and the resin was washed with DMF (3 × 5 ml). The Fmoc protecting group was removed as previously described, and 2.5 eq of Fmoc-P2-OH was preactivated in the solution of 2.5 eq of N-hydroxybenzotriazole and 2.5 eq of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF and poured onto the resin. After 3 h of agitation, the resin was washed with DMF (3 × 5 ml), and after Fmoc deprotection, Fmoc-P3-OH and Fmoc-P4-OH amino acids were attached to the resin in the same way. The P4 amino acid was then acetylated with 5 eq of AcOH, 5 eq of HBTU, and 5 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in DMF for 45 min at room temperature. The resin was washed with DMF (3 × 5 ml), DCM (2 × 5 ml), and with MeOH (2 × 5 ml) and dried over P2O5 overnight. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using a standard procedure. A solution of TFA:TIPS:H2O (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v) was added to the resin, and the mixture was shaken once every 10 min for 2 h. The filtrate was then collected in conical Falcon tubes (15 ml), resin was washed with solution of TFA:TIPS:H2O (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v), and filtrates were combined. Substrates were precipitated with cold Et2O in −20 °C, centrifuged, washed once with cold Et2O, and dried at room temperature. The crude products were then dissolved in DMSO, purified on HPLC (Waters, column: Spherisorb®, 5-μm particle size, length 25-cm, inner diameter 4.6 mm) in an H2O:acetonitrile gradient and lyophilized. Purified substrates were dissolved in DMSO and stored at −80 °C until use. For phytaspase-mediated cleavage of fluorogenic peptide substrates carried out at 1 μm (ΑCC derivatives) and 5 μm (AFC derivatives) concentrations, the level of hydrolysis was determined fluorimetrically using either varying enzyme concentrations (10–100 pm) and a fixed time or using a constant enzyme concentration of 250 pm for measuring the time course of hydrolysis leading to complete substrate digestion. For fragmentation of GFP-VirD2Ct (0.2–0.4 μm), aliquots of reaction mixtures withdrawn at 5-min intervals were subjected to gel electrophoresis. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned, the images were converted into black-and-white format, and the degree of protein fragmentation was determined using Image Quant software. From the obtained data, kcat/Km values were determined assuming first order reaction kinetics ([S] ≪ Km). Kmvalues were determined by measuring the initial rates of substrate cleavage within the linear part of the plot at various substrate concentrations (15–200 μm for AFC derivatives, 1–15 μm for ACC derivatives, and 0.5–5.0 μm for GFP-VirD2Ct). Lineweaver-Burk plots drawn using the data obtained were used to derive values for Km. Gastrin-1 (GenScript) and sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK-8, American Peptide Co.) peptides at the concentration of 40 μm were treated with phytaspase (1.9 nm) in 16 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl at 37 °C for 18 h. At several time points, 1-μl aliquots of reaction mixtures were withdrawn and diluted 10-fold with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5-μl aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich, 20 mg/ml, in 20% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and dried on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target plate. Peptide masses were measured using an UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) equipped with an neodymium-doped (Nd) laser in positive and negative (for sulfated CCK-8 peptides) ion modes with a reflector. Spectra were obtained in the 600–4500 m/z range. The accuracy of monoisotopic mass measurements was within 0.1 Da. Fragmentation ion spectra were obtained in a tandem mode with the accuracy within 1 Da. To define the cleavage specificity of rice phytaspase, native enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a series of chromatography fractionations of leaf extracts, including an affinity chromatography step (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resultant phytaspase displayed a single protein band of ∼80 kDa upon gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). The proteolytic activity of the isolated enzyme was manifested by specific fragmentation of the protein substrate GFP-VirD2Ct at the TATD motif (Fig. 1B) as well as by its ability to hydrolyze fluorogenic peptide substrates Ac-VEID-AFC, Ac-VNLD-AFC, and Ac-STATD-AFC bu"

However, the formulation defects of conventional pesticides cause food toxicity and ecological environmental problems. In this study, a novel, efficient and environmentally friendly formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin, a solid nanodispersion, was successfully developed based on melt-emulsification and high-speed shearing methods. The solid nanodispersion presented excellent advantages over conventional pesticide formulations in such formulation functions as dispersibility, stability and bioavailability. The formulation is free of organic solvents, and the use of surfactant is reduced. Therefore, the application of the solid nanodispersion in crop production will improve efficacy and reduce the occurrence of both pesticide residues in food and environmental pollution from pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2128192130,"Sparing zones from mowing has been proposed, and applied, to improve local conditions for survival and reproduction of insects in hay meadows. However, little is known about the efficiency of refuge zones and the consequences for local populations. We studied population densities of butterflies before and after mowing in the refuge zone of 15 meadows in 2009 and 2011. We also studied the behaviour of the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) comparing nectar use, interactions and flights in the refuge zone before and after mowing. Densities of grassland butterflies in this zone doubled on average after mowing. The density of females of M. jurtina increased on average fourfold, while males showed a more modest increase. In line with the idea of increased scramble competition in the refuge zone after mowing, M. jurtina increased the time spent on nectar feeding, the preferred nectar source was visited more frequently, and females made more use of non-preferred nectar sources. Maniola jurtina did not interact more with conspecifics after mowing, but interactions lasted longer. Flight tracks did not change in linearity, but were faster and shorter after mowing. After mowing, only a part of the local grassland butterflies moved to the uncut refuge zone. The resulting concentration effect alters the time allocated to different activities, nectar use and movements. These aspects have been largely ignored for agri-environmental schemes and grassland management in nature reserves and raise questions about optimal quantities and quality of uncut refuge sites for efficient conservation of grassland arthropods in agricultural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2109303221,"The management of thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures is still controversial. The thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) algorithm is now widely used to guide clinical decision making, however, in clinical practice, we come to realize that TLICS also has its limitations for treating patients with total scores less than 4, for which conservative treatment may not be optimal in all cases.The aim of this study is to identify several risk factors for the failure of conservative treatment of TL burst fractures according to TLICS algorithm.From June 2008 to December 2013, a cohort of 129 patients with T10-l2 TL burst fractures with a TLISC score ≤3 treated non-operatively were identified and included into this retrospective study. Age, sex, pain intensity, interpedicular distance (IPD), canal compromise, loss of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle (KA) were selected as potential risk factors and compared between the non-operative success group and the non-operative failure group.One hundred and four patients successfully completed non-operative treatment, the other 25 patients were converted to surgical treatment because of persistent local back pain or progressive neurological deficits during follow-up. Our results showed that age, visual analogue scale (VAS) score and IPD, KA were significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, regression analysis indicated that VAS score and IPD could be considered as significant predictors for the failure of conservative treatment.The recommendation of non-operative treatment for TLICS score ≤3 has limitations in some patients, and VAS score and IPD could be considered as risk factors for the failure of conservative treatment. Thus, conservative treatment should be decided with caution in patients with greater VAS scores or IPD. If non-operative management is decided, a close follow-up is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2110593056,"Kidney Failure is epidemic in many remote communities in Canada. In-centre hemodialysis is provided within these settings in satellite hemodialysis units. The key cost drivers of this program have not been fully described. Such information is important in informing the design of programs aimed at optimizing efficiency in providing dialysis and preventative chronic kidney disease care in remote communities.We constructed a cost model based on data derived from 16 of Manitoba, Canada's remote satellite units. We included all costs for operation of the unit, transportation, treatment, and capital costs. All costs were presented in 2013 Canadian dollars.The annual per-patient cost of providing hemodialysis in the satellite units ranged from $80,372 to $215,918 per patient, per year. The median per patient, per year cost was $99,888 (IQR $89,057-$122,640). Primary cost drivers were capital costs related to construction, human resource expenses, and expenses for return to tertiary care centres for health care. Costs related to transport considerably increased estimates in units that required plane or helicopter transfers.Satellite hemodialysis units in remote areas are more expensive on a per-patient basis than hospital hemodialysis and satellite hemodialysis available in urban areas. In some rural, remote locations, better value for money may reside in local surveillance and prevention programs in addition support for home dialysis therapies over construction of new satellite hemodialysis units."
https://openalex.org/W2160543350,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a highly chemoresistant solid tumor. We have studied this apoptotic resistance using in vitro and ex vivo three-dimensional models, which acquire a high level of chemoresistance that can be reduced by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Here, we investigate the activity of GDC-0980, a novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, which has been proposed to be effective in mesothelioma. In this work, we aimed to identify mechanisms and markers of efficacy for GDC-0980 by utilizing 3D models of mesothelioma, both in vitro multicellular spheroids and ex vivo tumor fragment spheroids grown from patient tumor samples. We found that a subset of mesothelioma spheroids is sensitive to GDC-0980 alone and to its combination with chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, this sensitivity did not correlate with the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Instead, sensitivity to GDC-0980 correlated with the presence of constitutive ATG13 puncta, a feature of autophagy, a cellular program that supports cells under stress. In tumor fragment spheroids grown from 21 tumors, we also found a subset (n = 11) that was sensitive to GDC-0980, a sensitivity that also correlated with the presence of ATG13 puncta. Interference with autophagy by siRNA of ATG7, an essential autophagic protein, increased the response to chemotherapy, but only in the sensitive multicellular spheroids. In the spheroids resistant to GDC-0980, autophagy appeared to play no role. In summary, we show that GDC-0980 is effective in mesothelioma 3D models that display ATG13 puncta, and that blockade of autophagy increases their response to chemotherapy. For the first time, we show a role for autophagy in the response to chemotherapy of 3D models of mesothelioma and propose ATG13 as a potential biomarker of the therapeutic responsiveness of mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W2254603275,"Many studies have revealed the influences of music, and particularly its tempo, on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and respiration patterns. Since there is the interaction between the ANS and the respiratory system, namely sympatho-respiratory coupling, it is possible that the effect of musical tempo on the ANS is modulated by the respiratory system. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the relationship between musical tempo and respiratory rate on the ANS. Fifty-two healthy people aged 18-35 years participated in this study. Their respiratory rates were controlled by using a silent electronic metronome and they listened to simple drum sounds with a constant tempo. We varied the respiratory rate-acoustic tempo combination. The respiratory rate was controlled at 15 or 20 cycles per minute (CPM) and the acoustic tempo was 60 or 80 beats per minute (BPM) or the environment was silent. Electrocardiograms and an elastic chest band were used to measure the heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively. The mean heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) were regarded as indices of ANS activity. We observed a significant increase in the mean heart rate and the low (0.04-0.15 Hz) to high (0.15-0.40 Hz) frequency ratio of HRV, only when the respiratory rate was controlled at 20 CPM and the acoustic tempo was 80 BPM. We suggest that the effect of acoustic tempo on the sympathetic tone is modulated by the respiratory system."
https://openalex.org/W1959175517,"Recent advances indicate that assigning or reversing edge direction can significantly improve the structural controllability of complex networks. For directed networks, approaching the optimal structural controllability can be achieved by detecting and reversing certain “inappropriate” edge directions. However, the existence of multiple sets of “inappropriate” edge directions suggests that different edges have different effects on optimal controllability—that is, different combinations of edges can be reversed to achieve the same structural controllability. Therefore, we classify edges into three categories based on their direction: critical, redundant and intermittent. We then investigate the effects of changing these edge directions on network controllability, and demonstrate that the existence of more critical edge directions implies not only a lower cost of modifying inappropriate edges but also better controllability. Motivated by this finding, we present a simple edge orientation method aimed at producing more critical edge directions—utilizing only local information—which achieves near optimal controllability. Furthermore, we explore the effects of edge direction on the controllability of several real networks."
https://openalex.org/W2154694525,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects almost 19% of the elderly population in Brazil and similar percentages around the world. Amputation of lower limbs in diabetic patients who present foot complications is a common occurrence with a significant reduction of life quality, and heavy costs on the health system. Unfortunately, there is no easy protocol to define the conditions that should be considered to proceed to amputation. The main objective of the present study is to create a simple prognostic score to evaluate the diabetic foot, which is called Tardivo Algorithm. Calculation of the score is based on three main factors: Wagner classification, signs of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is evaluated by using Peripheral Arterial Disease Classification, and the location of ulcers. The final score is obtained by multiplying the value of the individual factors. Patients with good peripheral vascularization received a value of 1, while clinical signs of ischemia received a value of 2 (PAD 2). Ulcer location was defined as forefoot, midfoot and hind foot. The conservative treatment used in patients with scores below 12 was based on a recently developed Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) protocol. 85.5% of these patients presented a good outcome and avoided amputation. The results showed that scores 12 or higher represented a significantly higher probability of amputation (Odds ratio and logistic regression-IC 95%, 12.2–1886.5). The Tardivo algorithm is a simple prognostic score for the diabetic foot, easily accessible by physicians. It helps to determine the amputation risk and the best treatment, whether it is conservative or surgical management."
https://openalex.org/W1914980107,"During the last decade, Bayesian probability theory has emerged as a framework in cognitive science and neuroscience for describing perception, reasoning and learning of mammals. However, our understanding of how probabilistic computations could be organized in the brain, and how the observed connectivity structure of cortical microcircuits supports these calculations, is rudimentary at best. In this study, we investigate statistical inference and self-organized learning in a spatially extended spiking network model, that accommodates both local competitive and large-scale associative aspects of neural information processing, under a unified Bayesian account. Specifically, we show how the spiking dynamics of a recurrent network with lateral excitation and local inhibition in response to distributed spiking input, can be understood as sampling from a variational posterior distribution of a well-defined implicit probabilistic model. This interpretation further permits a rigorous analytical treatment of experience-dependent plasticity on the network level. Using machine learning theory, we derive update rules for neuron and synapse parameters which equate with Hebbian synaptic and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity rules in a neural implementation. In computer simulations, we demonstrate that the interplay of these plasticity rules leads to the emergence of probabilistic local experts that form distributed assemblies of similarly tuned cells communicating through lateral excitatory connections. The resulting sparse distributed spike code of a well-adapted network carries compressed information on salient input features combined with prior experience on correlations among them. Our theory predicts that the emergence of such efficient representations benefits from network architectures in which the range of local inhibition matches the spatial extent of pyramidal cells that share common afferent input."
https://openalex.org/W2132813884,"Paradoxical kinesis has been observed in bradykinetic people with Parkinson's disease. Paradoxical kinesis occurs in situations where an individual is strongly motivated or influenced by relevant external cues. Our aim was to induce paradoxical kinesis in the laboratory. We tested whether the motivation of avoiding a mild electric shock was sufficient to induce paradoxical kinesis in externally-triggered and self-initiated conditions in people with Parkinson's disease tested on medication and in age-matched controls.Participants completed a shock avoidance behavioural paradigm in which half of the trials could result in a mild electric shock if the participant did not move fast enough. Half of the trials of each type were self-initiated and half were externally-triggered. The criterion for avoiding shock was a maximum movement time, adjusted according to each participant's performance on previous trials using a staircase tracking procedure.On trials with threat of shock, both patients with Parkinson's disease and controls had faster movement times compared to no potential shock trials, in both self-initiated and externally-triggered conditions. The magnitude of improvement of movement time from no potential shock to potential shock trials was positively correlated with anxiety ratings.When motivated to avoid mild electric shock, patients with Parkinson's disease, similar to healthy controls, showed significant speeding of movement execution. This was observed in both self-initiated and externally-triggered versions of the task. Nevertheless, in the ET condition the improvement of reaction times induced by motivation to avoid shocks was greater for the PD patients than controls, highlighting the value of external cues for movement initiation in PD patients. The magnitude of improvement from the no potential shock to the potential shock trials was associated with the threat-induced anxiety. This demonstration of paradoxical kinesis in the laboratory under both self-initiated and externally-triggered conditions has implications for motivational and attentional enhancement of movement speed in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2181294110,"Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or congenital analgesia is a rare monogenic hereditary condition. This disorder is characterized by the inability to perceive any form of pain. Nonsense mutations in Nav.1.7, the main pain signaling voltage-gated sodium channel, lead to its truncations and, consequently, to the inactivation of the channel functionality. However, a non-truncating homozygously inherited missense mutation in a Bedouin family with CIP (Nav1.7-R907Q) has also been reported. Based on our currently acquired in-depth knowledge of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavage preferences, we developed the specialized software that predicts the presence of the MMP cleavage sites in the peptide sequences. According to our in silico predictions, the peptide sequence of the exposed extracellular unstructured region linking the S5-S6 transmembrane segments in the DII domain of the human Nav1.7 sodium channel is highly sensitive to MMP-9 proteolysis. Intriguingly, the CIP R907Q mutation overlaps with the predicted MMP-9 cleavage site sequence. Using MMP-9 proteolysis of the wild-type, CIP, and control peptides followed by mass spectrometry of the digests, we demonstrated that the mutant sequence is severalfold more sensitive to MMP-9 proteolysis relative to the wild type. Because of the substantial level of sequence homology among sodium channels, our data also implicate MMP proteolysis in regulating the cell surface levels of the Nav1.7, Nav1.6, and Nav1.8 channels, but not Nav1.9. It is likely that the aberrantly accelerated MMP-9 proteolysis during neurogenesis is a biochemical rational for the functional inactivation in Nav1.7 and that the enhanced cleavage of the Nav1.7-R907Q mutant is a cause of CIP in the Bedouin family."
https://openalex.org/W1154177010,"The white-rot fungus Schizophyllum commune (Agaricomycetes) was used to study the cell biology of microtubular trafficking during mating interactions, when the two partners exchange nuclei, which are transported along microtubule tracks. For this transport activity, the motor protein dynein is required. In S. commune, the dynein heavy chain is encoded in two parts by two separate genes, dhc1 and dhc2. The N-terminal protein Dhc1 supplies the dimerization domain, while Dhc2 encodes the motor machinery and the microtubule binding domain. This split motor protein is unique to Basidiomycota, where three different sequence patterns suggest independent split events during evolution. To investigate the function of the dynein heavy chain, the gene dhc1 and the motor domain in dhc2 were deleted. Both resulting mutants were viable, but revealed phenotypes in hyphal growth morphology and mating behavior as well as in sexual development. Viability of strain Δdhc2 is due to the higher expression of kinesin-2 and kinesin-14, which was proven via RNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1830973753,"5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside monophosphate (AICAR) is a natural metabolite with potent anti-proliferative and low energy mimetic properties. At high concentration, AICAR is toxic for yeast and mammalian cells, but the molecular basis of this toxicity is poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of yeast purine salvage pathway mutants that are synthetically lethal with AICAR accumulation. Genetic suppression revealed that this synthetic lethality is in part due to low expression of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase under high AICAR conditions. In addition, metabolite profiling points to the AICAR/NTP balance as crucial for optimal utilization of glucose as a carbon source. Indeed, we found that AICAR toxicity in yeast and human cells is alleviated when glucose is replaced by an alternative carbon source. Together, our metabolic analyses unveil the AICAR/NTP balance as a major factor of AICAR antiproliferative effects."
https://openalex.org/W1890895197,"The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China, characterized by high diversity in geomorphology and irrigated agriculture in middle reaches. To improve the knowledge about the relationship between biotic and hydrological processes, this study used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (1982-2006) to analyze spatiotemporal variations in vegetation growth by using the Mann-Kendall test together with Sen's slope estimator. The results indicate that 10.1% and 1.6% of basin area exhibit statistically significant (p < 0.05) upward and downward trends, and maximum magnitude is 0.066/10a and 0.026/10a, respectively. More specifically, an increasing trend was observed in the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor and a decreasing trend detected in the transitional region between them. Increases in precipitation and temperature may be one possible reason for the changes of vegetation growth in the Qilian Mountains. And decreasing trend in transitional region may be driven by the changes in precipitation. Increases of irrigation contribute to the upward trend of NDVI for cropland in the Hexi Corridor, reflecting that agricultural development becomes more intensive. Our study demonstrates the complexity of the response of vegetation growth in the HRB to climate change and anthropogenic activities and correspondingly adopting mechanistic ecological models capable of describing both factors is favorable for reasonable predictions of future vegetation growth. It is also indicated that improving irrigation water use efficiency is one practical strategy to balance water demand between human and natural ecosystems in the HRB."
https://openalex.org/W1960498321,"Usp46 mutant mice (congenic strain on a B6 genetic background; MT mice) have a low weaning rate and display poor maternal behavior compared to C57BL/6J mice (B6 mice). Based on these observations, we examined how maternal behavior is shaped by cross-fostering and in-fostering MT and B6 mice. The experiments consisted of six groups: B6 mice fostered by their biological mother (B6-CO); MT mice fostered by their biological mother (MT-CO); B6 mice fostered by a different B6 mother (B6-IF); MT mice fostered by a different MT mother (MT-IF); B6 mice fostered by an MT mother (B6-CF); and MT mice fostered by a B6 mother (MT-CF). Maternal behavior was assessed using the pup-retrieval test in adult female offspring, and four parameters, time nursing pups in the nest, time sniffing or licking pups, rearing behavior, and latency to retrieve pups, were measured. Cross-fostering significantly reduced time spent nursing and sniffing/licking pup, and increased the number of instances of rearing in the B6-CF group, and improved three parameters of maternal behaviors (nursing, rearing and latency) in the MT-CF group. These results indicate that the level of maternal care is transmitted to their pups and proper maternal behaviors can be shaped if adequate postpartum maternal care is given, even in genetically vulnerable mice. However, the offspring's genotype may also influence the development of maternal behaviors in adulthood. Thus, MT mice may prove useful as a model for trans-generational transmission of maternal care, and these findings may provide insight into the mechanisms of maltreating behaviors in human child abuse."
https://openalex.org/W2224953524,"Prestin is the motor protein of cochlear outer hair cells. Its unique capability to perform direct, rapid, and reciprocal electromechanical conversion depends on membrane potential and interaction with intracellular anions. How prestin senses the voltage change and interacts with anions are still unknown. Our three-dimensional model of prestin using molecular dynamics simulations predicts that prestin contains eight transmembrane-spanning segments and two helical re-entry loops and that tyrosyl residues are the structural specialization of the molecule for the unique function of prestin. Using site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological techniques, we confirmed that residues Tyr(367), Tyr(486), Tyr(501), and Tyr(508) contribute to anion binding, interacting with intracellular anions through novel anion-π interactions. Such weak interactions, sensitive to voltage and mechanical stimulation, confer prestin with a unique capability to perform electromechanical and mechanoelectric conversions with exquisite sensitivity. This novel mechanism is completely different from all known mechanisms seen in ion channels, transporters, and motor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1773960751,"Objectives Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), a vitamin K-dependent protein, has been implicated in systemic inflammation, obesity, and insulin resistance (IR). Data from recent studies suggest that polymorphisms in the Gas6 gene are associated with cardiovascular disorders and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the association of Gas6 gene variants with obesity, IR, and T2D development has not been explored. Materials and Methods Four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Gas6 gene were genotyped in 984 participants from the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe) family cohort. An insulin suppression test was performed to determine IR based on steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG). Associations between IR indices and obesity, and SNP genotypes, based on previously-reported data for this cohort (Phase I), were analyzed. In the present follow-up study (Phase II), the effects of gene variants of Gas6 on the progression to T2D were explored in individuals who were free of T2D in Phase I. The mean follow-up period for Phase II was 5.7 years. Results The mean age of the study population in Phase I was 49.5 years and 16.7% of individuals developed T2D during follow-up. After adjusting for covariates, three SNPs (rs8191973, rs8197974, and rs7323932) were found to be associated with SSPG levels (p = 0.007, p = 0.03, and p = 0.011, respectively). This association remained significant after multiple testing and showed a significant interaction with physical activity for SNP rs8191973. However, no other significant correlations were observed between Gas6 polymorphisms and other indices of IR or obesity. A specific haplotype, AACG (from rs8191974, rs7323932, rs7331124, and rs8191973), was positively associated with SSPG levels (p = 0.0098). None of the polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of T2D development. Conclusions Our results suggest that Gas6 gene variants are associated with IR, although their effects on subsequent progression to T2D were minimal in this prospective Asian cohort."
https://openalex.org/W1793167192,"Background Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are stroke warning signs and emergency situations, and, if immediately investigated, doctors can intervene to prevent strokes. Nevertheless, many patients delay going to the doctor, and doctors might delay urgently needed investigations and preventative treatments. We set out to determine how much general practitioners (GPs) and hospital physicians (HPs) knew about stroke risk after TIA, and to measure their referral rates. Methods We used a structured questionnaire to ask GPs and HPs in the catchment area of the University Hospital of Bern to estimate a patient’s risk of stroke after TIA. We also assessed their referral behavior. We then statistically analysed their reasons for deciding not to immediately refer patients. Results Of the 1545 physicians, 40% (614) returned the survey. Of these, 75% (457) overestimated stroke risk within 24 hours, and 40% (245) overestimated risk within 3 months after TIA. Only 9% (53) underestimated stroke risk within 24 hours and 26% (158) underestimated risk within 3 months; 78% (473) of physicians overestimated the amount that carotid endarterectomy reduces stroke risk; 93% (543) would rigorously investigate the cause of a TIA, but only 38% (229) would refer TIA patients for urgent investigations “very often”. Physicians most commonly gave these reasons for not making emergency referrals: patient’s advanced age; patient’s preference; patient was multimorbid; and, patient needed long-term care. Conclusions Although physicians overestimate stroke risk after TIA, their rate of emergency referral is modest, mainly because they tend not to refer multimorbid and elderly patients at the appropriate rate. Since old and frail patients benefit from urgent investigations and treatment after TIA as much as younger patients, future educational campaigns should focus on the importance of emergency evaluations for all TIA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2229867255,"Introduction Using a novel method called near-infrared transillumination backscattering sounding (NIR-T/BSS) that allows for the non-invasive measurement of pial artery pulsation (cc-TQ) and subarachnoid width (sas-TQ) in humans, we assessed the influence of sympathetic activation on the cardiac and respiratory contribution to blood pressure (BP) cc-TQ oscillations in healthy subjects. Methods The pial artery and subarachnoid width response to handgrip (HGT) and cold test (CT) were studied in 20 healthy subjects. The cc-TQ and sas-TQ were measured using NIR-T/BSS; cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured using Doppler ultrasound of the left internal carotid artery; heart rate (HR) and beat-to-beat mean BP were recorded using a continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography; respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation (MV), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and end-tidal O2 (EtO2) were measured using a metabolic and spirometry module of the medical monitoring system. Wavelet transform analysis was used to assess the relationship between BP and cc-TQ oscillations. Results HGT evoked an increase in BP (+15.9%; P<0.001), HR (14.7; P<0.001), SaO2 (+0.5; P<0.001) EtO2 (+2.1; P<0.05) RR (+9.2%; P = 0.05) and MV (+15.5%; P<0.001), while sas-TQ was diminished (-8.12%; P<0.001), and a clear trend toward cc-TQ decline was observed (-11.0%; NS). CBFV (+2.9%; NS) and EtCO2 (-0.7; NS) did not change during HGT. CT evoked an increase in BP (+7.4%; P<0.001), sas-TQ (+3.5%; P<0.05) and SaO2(+0.3%; P<0.05). HR (+2.3%; NS), CBFV (+2.0%; NS), EtO2 (-0.7%; NS) and EtCO2 (+0.9%; NS) remained unchanged. A trend toward decreased cc-TQ was observed (-5.1%; NS). The sas-TQ response was biphasic with elevation during the first 40 seconds (+8.8% vs. baseline; P<0.001) and subsequent decline (+4.1% vs. baseline; P<0.05). No change with respect to wavelet coherence and wavelet phase coherence was found between the BP and cc-TQ oscillations. Conclusions Short sympathetic activation does not affect the cardiac and respiratory contribution to the relationship between BP—cc-TQ oscillations. HGT and CT display divergent effects on the width of the subarachnoid space, an indirect marker of changes in intracranial pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1772409835,"Gene-activating lipophilic compounds are carried into the nucleus when loaded on fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABP). Some of these proteins are recognized by the α-Karyopherin (Kapα) through its nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of three positive residues that are not in a continuous sequence. The Importin system can distinguish between FABP loaded with activating and non-activating compounds. In the present study, we introduced molecular dynamics as a tool for clarifying the mechanism by which FABP4, loaded with activating ligand (linoleate) is recognized by Kapα. In the first phase, we simulated the complex between KapαΔIBB (termed “Armadillo”) that was crystallized with two NLS hepta-peptides. The trajectory revealed that the crystal-structure orientation of the peptides is rapidly lost and new interactions dominate. Though, the NLS sequence of FABP4 is cryptic, since the functional residues are not in direct sequence, implicating more than one possible conformation. Therefore, four possible docked conformations were generated, in which the NLS of FABP4 is interacting with either the major or the minor sites of Kapα, and the N → C vectors are parallel or anti-parallel. Out of these four basic starting positions, only the FABP4-minor site complex exhibited a large number of contact points. In this complex, the FABP interacts with the minor and the major sites, suppressing the self-inhibitory interaction of the Kapα, rendering it free to react with Kapβ. Finally, we propose that the transportable conformation generated an extended hydrophobic domain which expanded out of the boundary of the FABP4, allowing the loaded linoleate to partially migrate out of the FABP into a joint complex in which the Kapα contributes part of a combined binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1767680765,"The complexity of biological systems motivates us to use the underlying networks to provide deep understanding of disease etiology and the human diseases are viewed as perturbations of dynamic properties of networks. Control theory that deals with dynamic systems has been successfully used to capture systems-level knowledge in large amount of quantitative biological interactions. But from the perspective of system control, the ways by which multiple genetic factors jointly perturb a disease phenotype still remain.In this work, we combine tools from control theory and network science to address the diversified control paths in complex networks. Then the ways by which the disease genes perturb biological systems are identified and quantified by the control paths in a human regulatory network. Furthermore, as an application, prioritization of candidate genes is presented by use of control path analysis and gene ontology annotation for definition of similarities. We use leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the ability of finding the gene-disease relationship. Results have shown compatible performance with previous sophisticated works, especially in directed systems.Our results inspire a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive pathological processes. Diversified control paths offer a basis for integrated intervention techniques which will ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1819137214,"Background A significant percentage of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) achieve clinically meaningful improvement when receiving placebo or tadalafil 5mg once daily. However, individual patient characteristics associated with treatment response are unknown. Methods This integrated clinical data mining analysis was designed to identify factors associated with a clinically meaningful response to placebo or tadalafil 5mg once daily in an individual patient with LUTS-BPH. Analyses were performed on pooled data from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical studies, including about 1,500 patients, from which 107 baseline characteristics were selected and 8 response criteria. The split set evaluation method (1,000 repeats) was used to estimate prediction accuracy, with the database randomly split into training and test subsets. Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models were then generated on the training subset and used to predict response in the test subset. Prediction models were generated for placebo and tadalafil 5mg once daily Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal prediction models lying on the ROC surface. Findings International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) baseline group (mild/moderate vs. severe) for active treatment and placebo achieved the highest combined sensitivity and specificity of 70% and ~50% for all analyses, respectively. This was below the sensitivity and specificity threshold of 80% that would enable reliable allocation of an individual patient to either the responder or non-responder group Conclusions This extensive clinical data mining study in LUTS-BPH did not identify baseline clinical or demographic characteristics that were sufficiently predictive of an individual patient response to placebo or once daily tadalafil 5mg. However, the study reaffirms the efficacy of tadalalfil 5mg once daily in the treatment of LUTS-BPH in the majority of patients and the importance of evaluating individual patient need in selecting the most appropriate treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1177679736,"Human dynactin-associated protein (dynAP) is a transmembrane protein that promotes AktSer473 phosphorylation. Here, we report the oncogenic properties of dynAP. In contrast to control NIH3T3 cells expressing LacZ (NIH3T3LacZ), NIH3T3dynAP cells vigorously formed foci in two-dimensional culture, colonies on soft agar, and spheroids in anchorage-deficient three-dimensional culture. NIH3T3dynAP cells injected into nude mice produced tumors with abundant blood vessels and weak cell-cell contacts. Expression of dynAP elevated the level of rictor (an essential subunit of mTORC2) and promoted phosphorylation of FOXO3aSer253. FOXO3a is a transcriptional factor that stimulates expression of pro-apoptotic genes and phosphorylation of FOXO3a abrogates its function, resulting in promoted cell survival. Knockdown of rictor in NIH3T3dynAP cells reduced AktSer473 phosphorylation and formation of foci, colony in soft agar and spheroid, indicating that dynAP-induced activation of the mTORC2/AktSer473 pathway for cell survival contributes to cell transformation. E-cadherin and its mRNA were markedly reduced upon expression of dynAP, giving rise to cells with higher motility, which may be responsible for the weak cell-cell adhesion in tumors. Thus, dynAP could be a new oncoprotein and a target for cancer therapy."
