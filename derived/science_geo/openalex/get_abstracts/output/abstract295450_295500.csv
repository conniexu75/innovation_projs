https://openalex.org/W1965719259,"Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a process in which two or more metalorganic chemicals (for instance, trimethylgallium) or one or more metalorganic sources and one or more hydride sources (for instance, arsine, AsH(3)) are used to form the corresponding intermetallic crystalline solid solution. MOCVD materials technology is a vapor-phase growth process that is becoming widely used to study the basic physics of novel materials and to grow complex semiconductor device structures for new optoelectronic and photonic systems. The MOCVD process is described and some of the device applications and results that have been realized with it are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the III-V compound semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1979061170,"Many ordered intermetallic alloys have attractive high-temperature properties; however, low ductility and brittle fracture limit their use for structural applications. The embrittlement in these alloys is mainly caused by an insufficient number of slip systems (bulk brittleness) and poor grain-boundary cohesion. Recent studies have shown that the ductility and fabricability of ordered intermetallics can be substantially improved by alloying processes and control of microstructural features through rapid solidification and thermomechanical treatments. These results demonstrate that the brittleness problem associated with ordered intermetallics can be overcome by using physical metallurgical principles. Application of these principles will be illustrated by results on Ni(3)Al and Ni(3)V-Co(3)V-Fe(3)V. The potential for developing these alloys as a new class of high-temperature structural materials is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983791273,"Some of the current directions of scientific research on electrically conducting organic solids are reviewed. Both molecular charge transfer salts and polymers are included, with emphasis on the present level of understanding of the novel solid-state properties of these materials in terms of their chemistry and structure. For the charge transfer salts the various types of metal-to-insulator phase transitions which dominate the properties of most of these materials are discussed. Also described are the superconducting and magnetic states which have been found recently. In the case of the polymers the chemistry and physics of the conduction mechanism is examined and contrasted with that of their classical inorganic counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2081466737,"An important trend in materials science is the use of increasingly sophisticated methods to control composition and microstructure during processing. Near-surface modification by ion implantation and laser treatment is one of these new methods for tailoring material properties. Novel materials have been formed which are far from thermodynamic equilibrium and which exhibit unexpected and useful properties. The most extensively studied property changes include modified electrical properties of semiconductors and improved wear, hardness, and corrosion resistance of metals. The high degree of control available with energetic beams allows relations between microstructure and properties to be systematically investigated at the atomic level. This article illustrates how ion and laser beam modification is being applied to advance both the technology and the exploratory science of materials."
https://openalex.org/W1965920556,"Conformational transitions in polymers involve large angle rotations about bonds. The process must proceed in a way that does not require gross movements of the macromolecules. The dynamics have been investigated by computer simulation and kinetic theory. The rate-determining step in the transition is found to occur in a mode which is kept local by distortion of nearby parts of the molecule. One especially important type of cooperativity, crank-like counterrotation of second-neighbor bonds, is identified. Experiments which provide evidence about the dynamics of conformational transitions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2032621639,"Today's fiber-optic communications systems are fused-silica-based fibers for which signals require reamplification every 30 kilometers. Repeaterless long-haul (transcontinental and transoceanic) links can only be envisaged if a new fiber material with intrinsic power losses significantly lower than those of silica can be identified and developed. This article reviews the development of silica-based systems, details the physical mechanisms which produce signal attenuation in fiber materials in general, and identifies that class of materials from which ultralow loss glasses are most likely to be developed in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2163577776,"The goal for optical information processing is to use the unique characteristics of light which are not readily achieved with electronic devices, namely, ultrahigh speed (picoseconds), a high degree of parallelism (image processing), and conductor-free interconnection. The requirements of the nonlinear materials to perform such functions, using all-optical interactions, are discussed and the limitations of the nonlinear mechanisms are outlined."

https://openalex.org/W2003098175,"The great advances made in polymeric structural materials over the past decade have led to their replacement of conventional materials in a wide range of uses including high-performance aerospace applications. This shift in choice of materials is based on economic advantages, simplified fabrication, freedom from corrosion, and lower weight. The trend toward use of polymeric materials will grow as the materials science of this new technology is developed. Better insight into such fundamental problems as the mechanisms by which forces are transferred to the polymer molecule, the surface interactions between polymer phases or polymer and fiber, and the molecular processes by which energy is absorbed during fracture will greatly stimulate the development of this field."
