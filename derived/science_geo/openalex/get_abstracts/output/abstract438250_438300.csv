https://openalex.org/W2077418979,"Getting Autophagy to Akt The protein kinase Akt is often activated in human cancers and is thought to promote tumor formation. One way in which it may do so is to inhibit autophagy (a process by which the cell digests its own proteins or organelles, especially damaged ones). Wang et al. (p. 956 , published online 25 October; see the Perspective by Koren and Kimchi ) provide a direct molecular mechanism by which Akt regulates autophagy. Beclin, a component of the autophagy machinery, appears to be a direct target of phosphorylation by Akt. Such phosphorylation enhanced interaction of Beclin with intermediate filaments of the cyto skeleton and inhibited autophagy. Expression of a modified Beclin 1 molecule that could not be phosphorylated by Akt inhibited Akt-induced transformation of cells in culture and tumor formation in a mouse model."

Predicting the effects of future ocean warming on biogeochemical cycles depends critically on understanding how existing global temperature variation affects phytoplankton. Here we show that variation in phytoplankton temperature optima over 150 degrees of latitude is well explained by a gradient in mean ocean temperature. An eco-evolutionary model predicts a similar relationship, suggesting that this pattern is the result of evolutionary adaptation. Using mechanistic species distribution models, we find that rising temperatures this century will cause poleward shifts in species' thermal niches and a sharp decline in tropical phytoplankton diversity in the absence of an evolutionary response."
https://openalex.org/W1966771851,"Eukaryotic cells can use the autophagy pathway to defend against microbes that gain access to the cytosol or reside in pathogen-modified vacuoles. It remains unclear if pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms to manipulate autophagy. Here, we found that the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila could interfere with autophagy by using the bacterial effector protein RavZ to directly uncouple Atg8 proteins attached to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosome membranes. RavZ hydrolyzed the amide bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue and an adjacent aromatic residue in Atg8 proteins, producing an Atg8 protein that could not be reconjugated by Atg7 and Atg3. Thus, intracellular pathogens can inhibit autophagy by irreversibly inactivating Atg8 proteins during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2059681687,"Antennal olfaction is extremely important for insect survival, mediating key behaviors such as host preference, mate choice, and oviposition site selection. Multiple antennal proteins are involved in olfactory signal transduction pathways. Of these, odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) confer specificity on olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, we identified the olfactory gene repertoire of the economically important agricultural pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera, by assembling the adult male and female antennal transcriptomes. Within the male and female antennal transcriptomes we identified a total of 47 OR candidate genes containing 6 pheromone receptor candidates. Additionally, 12 IR genes as well as 26 odorant-binding proteins and 12 chemosensory proteins were annotated. Our results allow a systematic functional analysis across much of conventional ORs repertoire and newly reported IRs mediating the key olfaction-mediated behaviors of H. armigera."
https://openalex.org/W2024571132,"ZIP14 (slc39A14) is a zinc transporter induced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. ZIP14 induction accompanies the reduction in serum zinc (hypozincemia) of acute inflammation. ZIP14 can transport Zn(2+) and non-transferrin-bound Fe(2+) in vitro. Using a Zip14(-/-) mouse model we demonstrated that ZIP14 was essential for control of phosphatase PTP1B activity and phosphorylation of c-Met during liver regeneration. In the current studies, a global screening of ZIP transporter gene expression in response to LPS-induced endotoxemia was conducted. Following LPS, Zip14 was the most highly up-regulated Zip transcript in liver, but also in white adipose tissue and muscle. Using ZIP14(-/-) mice we show that ZIP14 contributes to zinc absorption from the gastrointestinal tract directly or indirectly as zinc absorption was decreased in the KOs. In contrast, Zip14(-/-) mice absorbed more iron. The Zip14 KO mice did not exhibit hypozincemia following LPS, but do have hypoferremia. Livers of Zip14-/- mice had increased transcript abundance for hepcidin, divalent metal transporter-1, ferritin and transferrin receptor-1 and greater accumulation of iron. The Zip14(-/-) phenotype included greater body fat, hypoglycemia and higher insulin levels, as well as increased liver glucose and greater phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and increased GLUT2, SREBP-1c and FASN expression. The Zip14 KO mice exhibited decreased circulating IL-6 with increased hepatic SOCS-3 following LPS, suggesting SOCS-3 inhibited insulin signaling which produced the hypoglycemia in this genotype. The results are consistent with ZIP14 ablation yielding abnormal labile zinc pools which lead to increased SOCS-3 production through G-coupled receptor activation and increased cAMP production as well as signaled by increased pSTAT3 via the IL-6 receptor, which inhibits IRS 1/2 phosphorylation. Our data show the role of ZIP14 in the hepatocyte is multi-functional since zinc and iron trafficking are altered in the Zip14(-/-) mice and their phenotype shows defects in glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2137123557,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has long been known to be capable of forming aggregates and colonies. It was recently demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi aggregate formation dramatically changes the in vitro response to hostile environments by this pathogen. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these aggregates are indeed biofilms, structures whose resistance to unfavorable conditions are well documented. We studied Borrelia burgdorferi for several known hallmark features of biofilm, including structural rearrangements in the aggregates, variations in development on various substrate matrices and secretion of a protective extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix using several modes of microscopic, cell and molecular biology techniques. The atomic force microscopic results provided evidence that multilevel rearrangements take place at different stages of aggregate development, producing a complex, continuously rearranging structure. Our results also demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of developing aggregates on different abiotic and biotic substrates, and is also capable of forming floating aggregates. Analyzing the extracellular substance of the aggregates for potential exopolysaccharides revealed the existence of both sulfated and non-sulfated/carboxylated substrates, predominately composed of an alginate with calcium and extracellular DNA present. In summary, we have found substantial evidence that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of forming biofilm in vitro. Biofilm formation by Borrelia species might play an important role in their survival in diverse environmental conditions by providing refuge to individual cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968810018,"Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is highly effective for treating colon cancer patients postdiagnosis; however, the mechanisms of action of aspirin in colon cancer are not well defined. Aspirin and its major metabolite sodium salicylate induced apoptosis and decreased colon cancer cell growth and the sodium salt of aspirin also inhibited tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse xenograft model. Colon cancer cell growth inhibition was accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins and decreased expression of Sp-regulated gene products including bcl-2, survivin, VEGF, VEGFR1, cyclin D1, c-MET and p65 (NFκB). Moreover, we also showed by RNA interference that β-catenin, an important target of aspirin in some studies, is an Sp-regulated gene. Aspirin induced nuclear caspase-dependent cleavage of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins and this response was related to sequestration of zinc ions since addition of zinc sulfate blocked aspirin-mediated apoptosis and repression of Sp proteins. The results demonstrate an important underlying mechanism of action of aspirin as an anticancer agent and, based on the rapid metabolism of aspirin to salicylate in humans and the high salicylate/aspirin ratios in serum, it is likely that the anticancer activity of aspirin is also due to the salicylate metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W2066653656,"Background Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive occlusion of the internal carotid artery causing cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage. Genetic factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of MMD are being increasingly recognized. Previous studies have shown that the RNF213 gene was related to MMD susceptibility in the Japanese population. However, there is no large scale study of the association between this gene and MMD in the Chinese Han population. Thus we designed this case-control study to validate the R4810K mutation and to define the further spectrum of RNF213 mutations in Han Chinese. Methodology/Principal Findings Genotyping of the R4810K mutation in the RNF213 gene was performed in 170 MMD cases and 507 controls from a Chinese Han population. The R4810K mutation was identified in 22 of 170 MMD cases (13%), including 21 heterozygotes and a single familial homozygote. Two of the 507 controls (0.4%) were heterozygous R4810K carriers. The R4810K mutation greatly increased the risk for MMD (OR = 36.7, 95% CI: 8.6∼156.6, P = 6.1 E-15). The allele frequency of R4810K was significantly different between patients with ischemia and hemorrhage (OR = 5.4, 95% CI: 1.8∼16.1, P = 0.001). Genomic sequencing covering RNF213 exon 40 to exon 68 also identified eight other non-R4810K variants; P4007R, Q4367L, A4399T, T4586P, L4631V, E4950D, A5021V and M5136I. Among them A4399T polymorphism was found in 28/170 cases (16.5%) and 45/507 controls (8.9%) and was associated with MMD (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2∼3.3, P = 0.004), especially with hemorrhage (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2∼6.5, P = 0.014). Conclusions RNF213 mutations are associated with MMD susceptibility in Han Chinese. The ischemic type MMD is particularly related to the R4810K mutation. However, A4399T is also a susceptible variant for MMD, primarily associated with hemorrhage. Identification of novel variants in the RNF213 gene further highlights the genetic heterogeneity of MMD."
https://openalex.org/W1977599754,"The αβ-tubulin subunits of microtubules can undergo a variety of evolutionarily-conserved post-translational modifications (PTMs) that provide functional specialization to subsets of cellular microtubules. Acetylation of α-tubulin residue Lysine-40 (K40) has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport, and ciliary assembly, yet a mechanistic understanding of how acetylation influences these events is lacking. Using the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody 6-11B-1 and electron cryo-microscopy, we demonstrate that the K40 acetylation site is located inside the microtubule lumen and thus cannot directly influence events on the microtubule surface, including kinesin-1 binding. Surprisingly, the monoclonal 6-11B-1 antibody recognizes both acetylated and deacetylated microtubules. These results suggest that acetylation induces structural changes in the K40-containing loop that could have important functional consequences on microtubule stability, bending, and subunit interactions. This work has important implications for acetylation and deacetylation reaction mechanisms as well as for interpreting experiments based on 6-11B-1 labeling."
https://openalex.org/W2079408751,"Plasmid Partitioning Bacterial plasmids need to be able to partition faithfully into daughter cells. Combining structural data and advanced microscopy, Gayathri et al. (p. 1334 , published online 25 October; see the cover) describe how actin-like ParM filaments form a bipolar spindle for the faithful segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the two cell poles of Escherichia coli , despite being polar, with two distinct ends. ParM filaments are elongated by a small adaptor protein ParR that physically links the filament end(s) to a centromere-like region on the plasmid. Antiparallel filament bundling and sliding appear to produce a bipolar spindle made of filaments that elongate unidirectionally so that all the plasmids are segregated together in one large bundle."
https://openalex.org/W2101625168,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) mediates protein translocation across the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae - the causative agent of cholera. All V. cholerae strains examined to date harbor gene clusters encoding a T6SS. Structural similarity and sequence homology between components of the T6SS and the T4 bacteriophage cell-puncturing device suggest that the T6SS functions as a contractile molecular syringe to inject effector molecules into prokaryotic and eukaryotic target cells. Regulation of the T6SS is critical. A subset of V. cholerae strains, including the clinical O37 serogroup strain V52, express T6SS constitutively. In contrast, pandemic strains impose tight control that can be genetically disrupted: mutations in the quorum sensing gene luxO and the newly described regulator gene tsrA lead to constitutive T6SS expression in the El Tor strain C6706. In this report, we examined environmental V. cholerae isolates from the Rio Grande with regard to T6SS regulation. Rough V. cholerae lacking O-antigen carried a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the global T6SS regulator VasH and did not display virulent behavior towards Escherichia coli and other environmental bacteria. In contrast, smooth V. cholerae strains engaged constitutively in type VI-mediated secretion and displayed virulence towards prokaryotes (E. coli and other environmental bacteria) and a eukaryote (the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum). Furthermore, smooth V. cholerae strains were able to outcompete each other in a T6SS-dependent manner. The work presented here suggests that constitutive T6SS expression provides V. cholerae with an advantage in intraspecific and interspecific competition."
https://openalex.org/W2044610872,"We evaluated whether black race is associated with higher incidence of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) among a cohort of blacks and whites of similar, generally low socioeconomic status, and whether risk factor patterns differ among blacks and whites and explain the poorly understood racial disparity in ESRD. Incident diagnoses of ESRD among 79,943 black and white participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) were ascertained by linkage with the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) from 2002 through 2009. Person-years of follow up were calculated from date of entry into the SCCS until date of ESRD diagnosis, date of death, or September 1, 2009, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident ESRD among black and white participants in relation to baseline characteristics. After 329,003 person-years of follow-up, 687 incident cases of ESRD were identified in the cohort. The age-adjusted ESRD incidence rate was 273 (per 100,000) among blacks, 3.5-fold higher than the rate of 78 among whites. Risk factors for ESRD included male sex (HR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.9), low income (HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.8 for income below vs. above $15,000), smoking (HR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.02-1.4) and histories of diabetes (HRs increasing to 9.4 (95% CI 7.4-11.9) among those with ≥20 years diabetes duration) and hypertension (HR = 2.9; 95% CI 2.3-3.7). Patterns and magnitudes of association were virtually identical among blacks and whites. After adjustment for these risk factors, blacks continued to have a higher risk for ESRD (HR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.9-3.0) relative to whites. The black-white disparity in risk of ESRD was attenuated but not eliminated after control for known risk factors in a closely socioeconomically matched cohort. Further research characterizing biomedical factors, including CKD progression, in ESRD occurrence in these two racial groups is needed."
https://openalex.org/W1970760700,"Background Flavonoids are widely proposed as very interesting compounds with possible chemopreventive and therapeutic capacities. Methods & Results In this study, we showed that in vitro treatment with the flavonoid Luteolin induced caspase-dependent cell death in a model of human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) derived cells, representing a matched pair of primary tumor and its metastasis. Notably, no cytotoxic effects were observed in normal human keratinocytes when treated with similar doses of Luteolin. Luteolin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by inhibition of AKT signaling, and sensitivity decreased with tumor progression, as the primary MET1 SCC cells were considerably more sensitive to Luteolin than the isogenic metastatic MET4 cells. Extensive intracellular vacuolization was observed in Luteolin-treated MET4 cells, which were characterized as acidic lysosomal vacuoles, suggesting the involvement of autophagy. Transmission electron microscopy, mRFP-GFP-LC3 assay and p62 protein degradation, confirmed that Luteolin stimulated the autophagic process in the metastatic MET4 cells. Blocking autophagy using chloroquine magnified Luteolin-induced apoptosis in the metastatic SCC cells. Conclusion Together, these results suggest that Luteolin has the capacity to induce selectively apoptotic cell death both in primary cutaneous SCC cells and in metastatic SCC cells in combination with chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagosomal degradation. Hence, Luteolin might be a promising agent for the treatment of cutaneous SCC."
https://openalex.org/W2072756858,"Background Common mental disorders, particularly unipolar depressive disorders, rank among the top 5 with respect to the global burden of disease. As a major public health concern, antepartum depression and anxiety not only affects the individual woman, but also her offspring. Data on the prevalence of common mental disorders in pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. We provide results from Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. Methods We subsequently recruited and screened n = 1030 women in the third trimester of their pregnancy for depressed mood, general anxiety, and perceived disability using the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9), the 7-item Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and the World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS 2.0, 12-item version). In addition to estimates of means and prevalence, a hierarchical linear regression model was calculated to determine the influence of antepartum depression and anxiety on disability. Results In Ghana, 26.6% of women showed substantially depressed mood. In Côte d'Ivoire, this figure was even higher (32.9%). Clear indications for a generalized anxiety disorder were observed in 11.4% and 17.4% of pregnant women, respectively. Comorbidity of both conditions was common, affecting about 7.7% of Ghanaian and 12.6% of Ivorian participants. Pregnant women in both countries reported a high degree of disability regarding everyday activity limitations and participation restrictions. Controlled for country and age, depression and anxiety accounted for 33% of variance in the disability score. Conclusions Antepartum depression and anxiety were highly prevalent in our sample and contributed substantially to perceived disability. These serious threats to health must be further investigated and more data are needed to comprehensively quantify the problem in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2089314940,"The chloride channel calcium-activated (CLCA) family are secreted proteins that regulate both chloride transport and mucin expression, thus controlling the production of mucus in respiratory and other systems. Accordingly, human CLCA1 is a critical mediator of hypersecretory lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis, that manifest mucus obstruction.

CaCC activation requires cleavage to unmask the N-terminal fragment of CLCA1, which can independently gate CaCCs. Gating of CaCCs mediated by CLCA1 does not appear to involve proteolytic cleavage of the channel because a mutant N-terminal fragment deficient in proteolytic activity is able to induce currents comparable with that of the native fragment.

Most importantly, there is evidence that CLCA1 stimulates an increase in mucus production by initiating a MAPK signaling pathway to express mucins (the major protein component of mucus) in humans, a pathway that is highly activated in humans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.Alevy Y.G. Patel A.C. Romero A.G. Patel D.A. Tucker J. Roswit W.T. Miller C.A. Heier R.F. Beyers D.E. Brett T.J. Holtzman M.J. IL-13-induced airway mucus production is attenuated by MAPK13 inhibition.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of CLCA function in signaling for mucus overproduction could lead to effective anti-mucus therapies. Other studies suggest that CLCA proteins are also associated with the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF); mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel found in the apical membranes of mucosal epithelial cells, disrupt normal chloride transport, resulting in insufficiently salted and hydrated mucus. Fatal intestinal disease found in CFTR-deficient mice, however, is corrected by overexpression of native mouse CLCA3 (an orthologue of human CLCA1) (17.Young F.D. Newbigging S. Choi C. Keet M.

Consistent with this observation, a mutation in the CLCA1 gene is found in a subset of CF patients with more severe intestinal disease (18.van der Doef H.P. Slieker M.G. Staab D. Alizadeh B.Z. Seia M. Colombo C. van der Ent C.K. Nickel R. Witt H. Houwen R.H. Association of the CLCA1 p.S357N variant with meconium ileus in European patients with cystic fibrosis.J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2010; 50: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that CLCA1 may function to alleviate CFTR deficiency symptoms by increasing endogenous CaCC activity and compensating for defective CFTR-mediated chloride transport. To that end, an understanding of the mechanism of activation could also be exploited to produce effective CF therapies. In the present study, we aimed to better understand CLCA1 function with an analysis of CLCA processing. We recognized that proteolytic processing is critical to signaling function for other proteins (19.Turk B. Targeting proteases: successes, failures, and future prospects.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) and that CLCA proteins are uniformly subjected to proteolytic cleavage within the secretory pathway to yield N- and C-terminal CLCA fragments of ∼70 and 38 kDa, respectively (3.Patel A.C. Brett T.J. Holtzman M.J. The role of CLCA proteins in inflammatory airway disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, using a combination of sequence analysis, structure prediction, and biochemical, biophysical, and electrophysiological techniques, we demonstrate that all CLCA proteins contain a consensus cleavage motif, which is recognized by a novel zincin metalloprotease domain located within the N terminus of CLCA itself. In addition to self-proteolysis, we also demonstrate that CLCA paralogues are capable of cross-proteolysis. Finally, we demonstrate that this self-cleavage event is a required step for CLCA1-based activation of CaCCs, which is mediated solely through the N-terminal fragment. Taken together, these data support a paradigm of CLCA activation through self-proteolysis to unmask an N-terminal fragment capable of gating CaCCs. Constructs were generated using standard PCR and molecular biology techniques. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For determination of proteolytic cleavage sites, full-length mature-form CLCA proteins (i.e. without their endogenous signal sequences) were cloned into the pHLsec vector (20.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) containing an optimized signal sequence and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Soluble CLCAs were designed by omitting C-terminal membrane anchors from those CLCAs that contain them (i.e. human CLCA2, human CLCA4, mouse CLCA4). Specifically, constructs contained the following residues: CLCA1 22–914; CLCA2 32–899; CLCA4 22–876; mouse CLCA3 22–913; mouse CLCA4 22–897. Mutations were introduced into the full-length CLCA1 pHLsec construct using Phusion mutagenesis (New England Biolabs) for mutational analysis of the cleavage site and predicted active site residues. Full-length CLCA1 and select mutants containing the optimized signal sequences were subcloned from pHLsec constructs into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). A dual-tagged CLCA1 construct in pCDNA3.1 was made by inserting a FLAG tag directly after the signal sequence and a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of the protein. Mammalian cell expression constructs encompassing the protease and VWA domain of CLCA1 (22–477), CLCA2 (32–455), and CLCA4 (22–459) as well as the substrate region (285–915) of CLCA1 were cloned into pHLsec with C-terminal hexahistidine tags. A tag-free bacterial expression construct composed of the protease and VWA domain of CLCA1 (22–477) was cloned into pET23b. Mammalian expression constructs of CLCA1 N-terminal fragment (22–695) and C-terminal fragment (696–915) were cloned into the pHLsec vector containing an optimized signal sequence and C-terminal hexahistidine tag (20.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Proteins in mammalian expression vectors were expressed by transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells using 293Fectin cultured in serum-free FreeStyle 293 media (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection, and proteins were purified to homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography. CLCA1 22–477 was expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble protein that was recovered from inclusion bodies, denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and refolded by rapid dilution into buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 400 mm arginine, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2. The resulting soluble protein was purified by gel filtration followed by ion exchange chromatography. The protein was well folded as assessed by circular dichroism. Full-length CLCA proteins were expressed by transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells as described above. Culture supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection, and C-terminal fragments were captured and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. C-terminal fragments were isolated by SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer and then analyzed by N-terminal sequencing (Edman degradation) to determine the site of proteolytic cleavage. The first 5 residues were identified in each case. Additionally, intracellular processing of CLCA1 was assessed by immunoprecipitating the C-terminal fragment from the lysates of washed lung epithelial H292 cells transfected with a CLCA1-expressing adenovirus. Isolation and analysis were performed as described above. CLCA sequences and naming were based on recent nomenclature as recently reviewed (3.Patel A.C. Brett T.J. Holtzman M.J. The role of CLCA proteins in inflammatory airway disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mutants were expressed in 293F cells as described above. Culture supernatants and cell lysates were collected 72 h after transfection and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies that recognize either the N-terminal fragment (anti-N-CLCA1 mAb 8D3; epitope region: 477–695) or the C-terminal fragment (anti-His6 antibody, Bethyl Laboratories). Processing of the dual-tagged hCLCA1 construct was analyzed using anti-FLAG antibody (M2 mAb, Sigma) in addition to the other antibodies. To test the CLCA1 tobacco etch virus (TEV) mutant for cleavage by exogenously added TEV protease, transfection was carried out as above followed by the addition of TEV protease to the culture medium (to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) 48 h after transfection. Samples were collected after 72 h after transfection and analyzed as above. Purified protease (CLCA1 22–477, CLCA2 32–455, and CLCA4 22–459) and substrate (CLCA1 285–915) were produced as described above. Digestion experiments were carried out by incubating substrate (0.5 μm) and protease (2.0 μm) in 100 μl of digestion buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2) at 37 °C for 18 h with samples taken at discrete time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot using the anti-CLCA1 mAb 8D3. Digestion experiments in the presence of inhibitors were carried out with GM-6001 (Millipore), Marimastat (Tocris), Batimastat (Tocris), or Zeynepstat001 at 40 μm or Halt (Thermo) at 1× concentration. All inhibitor stocks were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A fluorogenic peptide substrate consisting of a donor-acceptor FRET pair conjugated to the human CLCA1 cleavage sequence was synthesized by AnaSpec (DABCYL-QQSGALYIPG-EDANS). Experiments were carried out at 37 °C in the digestion buffer described above. Reaction progress was monitored using a BioTek plate fluorometer (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 490 nm). Refolded CLCA1 (22–477) was used as the protease. For reactions in the presence of inhibitors, [protease] = 10 μm, [substrate] = 3.25 μm, and [inhibitor] = 20 or 40 μm, respectively. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Synthesis of Zeynepstat001 is described in the supplemental material. Mutations predicted to interfere with the metalloprotease activity of CLCA1 (H156A, E157Q) or a disrupted cleavage site (contra) were generated using the pCDNA3.1 expression vector; cDNAs encoding the N-terminal or C-terminal fragments of CLCA1 were cloned into pHLsec, as described above. HEK293T cells were plated in 6-well dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 105 units/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin. At 80% confluency, cells were transfected with the relevant plasmids using 293Fectin transfection reagent at a 1 μg of DNA to 2 μl of 293Fectin ratio, and the amount of DNA per well was kept constant at 2 μg. For identification of expressing cells, 1% of EGFP-pCDNA3.1 plasmid was added to all transfection mixtures. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated at low density on glass coverslips. Expression of wild-type (WT), mutant, and fragment proteins was confirmed by Western blot of culture supernatants 48 h after transfection, as described above. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, 48–72 h after transfection. Cells that fluoresced under ultraviolet light were selected for analysis. Micropipettes were prepared from nonheparinized hematocrit glass (Kimble-Chase) on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument) and filled to a typical electrode resistance of 2 megaohms with pipette solution containing 126 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Hepes and 10 mm EGTA, in the absence or presence of 9.95 mm CaCl2 to attain 10 μm free Ca2+, as calculated by means of the CaBuf program (available through KU Leuven). The standard extracellular solution contained 126 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 30 mm sucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2. To determine the background currents, the cells were superfused with a Cl−-free solution containing 126 mm Na+ gluconate, 10 mm Hepes, 10.5 mm sucrose, 7 mm Ca2+ gluconate, and 3.5 mm Mg2+ gluconate. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris. After formation of a gigaohm seal and establishment of whole-cell configuration, cells were voltage-clamped at −80 mV. A pulse protocol was applied in which membrane potential (Vm) was held at −80 mV for 500 ms and stepped to a test value for 1000 ms before returning to the holding potential for an additional 500 ms. The test potential varied from −100 to +80 mV in 20 mV increments. Currents were measured at the end of the 1000-ms voltage pulse. Membrane capacitance was calculated from the integral of the current transient in response to 10-mV depolarizing pulses and was monitored for stability throughout the experiment. Data were filtered at 2 kHz, and signals were digitized at 5 kHz with a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices). Axoscope and pClamp software (Molecular Devices) were used for pulse protocol application and data acquisition. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (version 10.1, Molecular Devices) and Excel (Microsoft). SigmaPlot 10.0 (Systat Software) and CorelDRAW X3 13.0 (Corel Corp.) were used for statistics and figure preparation. Results are presented as mean ± S.E., and unpaired Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical differences between groups. Proteolytic processing plays a central role in almost all biological networks, and dysregulation is implicated in a broad range of diseases (19.Turk B. Targeting proteases: successes, failures, and future prospects.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we sought to investigate the role of proteolytic processing in CLCA protein function. Mammals express 4–8 CLCA family members, predominantly at mucosal surfaces. All CLCAs have been observed to undergo proteolytic processing when expressed in mammalian cells; the protein gets cleaved into two fragments of ∼70 kDa of the N terminus and 38 kDa of the C terminus (3.Patel A.C. Brett T.J. Holtzman M.J. The role of CLCA proteins in inflammatory airway disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We reasoned that elucidation of the cleavage site might allow for identification of the protease responsible for this activity. To facilitate this analysis, we generated tagged soluble expression constructs of the three human CLCA proteins (CLCA1, CLCA2, and CLCA4), as well as two mouse CLCAs (CLCA3 and CLCA4), and expressed each of them in mammalian cells (Fig. 1A). Cleavage sites were determined by amino-terminal sequencing of secreted C-terminal fragments from media supernatants. All five of the CLCA proteins were cleaved at a common site (Fig. 1B). Because our data and previous studies indicated that CLCA proteins are processed intracellularly (7.Mundhenk L. Alfalah M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. Naim H.Y. Gruber A.D.

Murine mCLCA5 is expressed in granular layer keratinocytes of stratified epithelia.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 133: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we also analyzed CLCA1 retrieved from cell lysates to investigate the possibility of sequential processing. This sample displayed the same cleavage site as the fully secreted proteins found in supernatants. Analysis of all known CLCA sequences from higher mammals reveals a high degree of conservation in this region (Fig. 1B), consistent with a consensus cleavage sequence shared among CLCA family proteins (Fig. 1C) and a common protease, or family of proteases, responsible for CLCA cleavage. To verify the location of the cleavage site, we tested the effect of mutations to the experimentally determined cleavage site sequence on proteolytic processing of CLCA1 (Fig. 2A). A point mutation (A696P) or variations that matched the cleavage sequence in other CLCAs (CLCA2 and CLCA4) did not affect proteolytic cleavage of CLCA1; in contrast, variations that significantly altered the consensus sequence (contra, TEV) abolished proteolytic processing (Fig. 2B). These mutations did not grossly affect protein folding as all variant proteins were robustly secreted into the media supernatants. Furthermore, TEV protease added to cultures expressing the TEV CLCA1 variant, in which the TEV protease cleavage site replaced the consensus site, was not cleaved either (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the cleavage site is not surface-exposed to exogenous proteases and may only be accessible to the internal metalloprotease domain in the natively folded full-length protein. Taken together, these results pinpoint the location of the proteolytic cleavage site in CLCA proteins and imply that a common protease with specific access to the site is responsible for cleavage of all human CLCA proteins. Extensive bioinformatic searching of the MEROPS protease database (23.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. MEROPS: the peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) using the CLCA consensus cleavage sequence did not provide any reasonable candidates for the protease responsible for cleaving CLCA family members. Thus, we decided to revisit the untested hypothesis that the N-terminal CLCA-N domain itself houses a metalloprotease domain similar to that of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (24.Pawłowski K. Lepistö M. Meinander N. Sivars U. Varga M. Wieslander E. Novel conserved hydrolase domain in the CLCA family of alleged calcium-activated chloride channels.Proteins. 2006; 63: 424-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, when various CLCA-N domain sequences were submitted to the updated PHYRE2 fold prediction server (25.Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar), most predictions were high-confidence hits to zincin metalloprotease catalytic domains. The CLCA-N domain contains 8 cysteine residues that are invariant across all family members (3.Patel A.C. Brett T.J. Holtzman M.J. The role of CLCA proteins in inflammatory airway disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). With 2 of these cysteines lying in the predicted catalytic region (amino acids 22–199) (Fig. 3C) and 6 in an adjacent cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 200–283) (26.Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. The ADAM metalloproteinases.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), it is most likely that the CLCA-N domain is architecturally similar to the ADAM or ADAMTS family of zinc metalloproteases, rather than MMPs. Like the CLCA-N domain, ADAM and ADAMTS contain disulfide bonds in their catalytic regions (Fig. 3A) (27.Tallant C. Marrero A. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Matrix metalloproteinases: fold and function of their catalytic domains.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of zinc metalloproteases contain a common HEXXHXXGXXH motif, which includes the catalytically required glutamate (bold) and zinc-chelating residues (3 histidine residues) (27.Tallant C. Marrero A. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Matrix metalloproteinases: fold and function of their catalytic domains.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). CLCA sequences in the predicted catalytic region are almost completely invariant and reveal a similar but unique catalytic motif: HEXXHXXXGXXDE (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have reported that mutations of Glu-157 in human CLCA1 (24.Pawłowski K. Lepistö M. Meinander N. Sivars U. Varga M. Wieslander E.

However, the role of FoxM1, the signaling involved in its activation and its role in leukemia are poorly known. Here, we demonstrate by gene promoter analysis, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that FoxM1 is a new target of the STAT3 transcriptional activator. Additionally, FoxM1 is transcriptionally dependent on STAT3 signaling activation. Furthermore, we verified that FoxM1 is crucial for K562 cell proliferation, cell cycle checkpoints and viability and could be related to chemotherapeutic resistance. By microarray analysis, we determined the signaling pathways related to FoxM1 expression and its role in DNA repair using K562 cells. Our results revealed new signaling involved in FoxM1 expression and its role in leukemic cells that elucidate cellular mechanisms associated with the development of leukemia and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2028813093,"A better understanding of the impact of global climate change requires information on the locations and characteristics of populations affected. For instance, with global sea level predicted to rise and coastal flooding set to become more frequent and intense, high-resolution spatial population datasets are increasingly being used to estimate the size of vulnerable coastal populations. Many previous studies have undertaken this by quantifying the size of populations residing in low elevation coastal zones using one of two global spatial population datasets available - LandScan and the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP). This has been undertaken without consideration of the effects of this choice, which are a function of the quality of input datasets and differences in methods used to construct each spatial population dataset. Here we calculate estimated low elevation coastal zone resident population sizes from LandScan and GRUMP using previously adopted approaches, and quantify the absolute and relative differences achieved through switching datasets. Our findings suggest that the choice of one particular dataset over another can translate to a difference of more than 7.5 million vulnerable people for countries with extensive coastal populations, such as Indonesia and Japan. Our findings also show variations in estimates of proportions of national populations at risk range from <0.1% to 45% differences when switching between datasets, with large differences predominantly for countries where coarse and outdated input data were used in the construction of the spatial population datasets. The results highlight the need for the construction of spatial population datasets built on accurate, contemporary and detailed census data for use in climate change impact studies and the importance of acknowledging uncertainties inherent in existing spatial population datasets when estimating the demographic impacts of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2076055471,"Quorum sensing regulates cell density-dependent phenotypes and involves the synthesis, excretion and detection of so-called autoinducers. Vibrio harveyi strain ATCC BAA-1116 (recently reclassified as Vibrio campbellii), one of the best-characterized model organisms for the study of quorum sensing, produces and responds to three autoinducers. HAI-1, AI-2 and CAI-1 are recognized by different receptors, but all information is channeled into the same signaling cascade, which controls a specific set of genes. Here we examine temporal variations of availability and concentration of the three autoinducers in V. harveyi, and monitor the phenotypes they regulate, from the early exponential to the stationary growth phase in liquid culture. Specifically, the exponential growth phase is characterized by an increase in AI-2 and the induction of bioluminescence, while HAI-1 and CAI-1 are undetectable prior to the late exponential growth phase. CAI-1 activity reaches its maximum upon entry into stationary phase, while molar concentrations of AI-2 and HAI-1 become approximately equal. Similarly, autoinducer-dependent exoproteolytic activity increases at the transition into stationary phase. These findings are reflected in temporal alterations in expression of the luxR gene that encodes the master regulator LuxR, and of four autoinducer-regulated genes during growth. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal a tight correlation between the HAI-1/AI-2 ratio as input and levels of receptor-mediated phosphorylation of LuxU as output. Our study supports a model in which the combinations of autoinducers available, rather than cell density per se, determine the timing of various processes in V. harveyi populations."
https://openalex.org/W2006218987,"Cancer vaccines are designed to expand tumor antigen-specific T cells with effector function. However, they may also inadvertently expand regulatory T cells (Treg), which could seriously hamper clinical efficacy. To address this possibility, we developed a novel assay to detect antigen-specific Treg based on down-regulation of surface CD3 following TCR engagement, and used this approach to screen for Treg specific to the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen in melanoma patients treated with the NY-ESO-1/ISCOMATRIXTM cancer vaccine. All patients tested had Treg (CD25bright FoxP3+ CD127neg) specific for at least one NY-ESO-1 epitope in the blood. Strikingly, comparison with pre-treatment samples revealed that many of these responses were induced or boosted by vaccination. The most frequently detected response was toward the HLA-DP4-restricted NY-ESO-1157–170 epitope, which is also recognized by effector T cells. Notably, functional Treg specific for an HLA-DR-restricted epitope within the NY-ESO-1115–132 peptide were also identified at high frequency in tumor tissue, suggesting that NY-ESO-1-specific Treg may suppress local anti-tumor immune responses. Together, our data provide compelling evidence for the ability of a cancer vaccine to expand tumor antigen-specific Treg in the setting of advanced cancer, a finding which should be given serious consideration in the design of future cancer vaccine clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2061966564,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 30 is a novel estrogen receptor. Recent studies suggest that activation of the GPR30 confers rapid cardioprotection in isolated rat heart. It is unknown whether chronic activation of GPR30 is beneficial or not for heart failure. In this study we investigated the cardiac effect of sustained activation or inhibition of GPR30. Female Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into 7 groups #2Q1: sham surgery (Sham), bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), OVX+estrogen (E2), OVX+isoproterenol (ISO), OVX+ISO+G-1, OVX+ISO+E2+G15, OVX+ISO+E2. ISO (85 mg/kg×17 day, sc) was given to make the heart failure models. G-1(120 µg/kg·d×14 day) was used to activate GPR30 and G15 (190 µg/kg·d×14 day) was used to inhibit GPR30. Concentration of brain natriuretic peptide in serum, masson staining in isolated heart, contractile function and the expression of β1 and β2- adrenergic receptor (AR) of ventricular myocytes were also determined. Our data showed that ISO treatment led to heart failure in OVX rats. G-1 or E2 treatment decreased concentration of brain natriuretic peptide, reduced cardiac fibrosis, and enhanced contraction of the heart. Combined treatment with β1 (CGP20712A) and β2-AR (ICI118551) antagonist abolished the improvement of myocardial function induced by G-1. We also found that chronic treatment with G-1 normalized the expression of β1-AR and increased the expression of β2-AR. Our results indicate that chronic activation of the GPR30 with its agonist G-1 attenuates heart failure by normalizing the expression of β1-AR and increasing the expression of β2-AR."

Currently it is not clear how the SMN protein levels are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In this report, we find that Usp9x, a deubiquitinating enzyme, stably associates with the SMN complex via directly interacting with SMN. Usp9x deubiquitinates SMN that is mostly mono- and di-ubiquitinated. Knockdown of Usp9x promotes SMN degradation and reduces the protein levels of SMN and the SMN complex in cultured mammalian cells. Interestingly, Usp9x does not deubiquitinate nuclear SMNΔ7, the main protein product of the SMN2 gene, which is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Together, our results indicate that SMN and SMNΔ7 are differently ubiquitinated; Usp9x plays an important role in stabilizing SMN and the SMN complex, likely via antagonizing Ub-dependent SMN degradation."

Data was analyzed for 170 triage encounters and presented as median {25-75(th) centile}. Thirty-three percent of patients (56 of 170) experienced an adverse outcome. sEng levels (ng/ml) were significantly elevated in patients who subsequently experienced adverse outcomes compared to those who did not (32.3 {18.1, 55.8} vs 4.8 {3.2, 8.6}, p<0.0001). At a 10% false positive rate, sEng had higher detection rates of adverse outcomes than the combination of highest systolic blood pressure, proteinuria and abnormal laboratory tests (80.4 {70.0, 90.8} vs 63.8 {51.4, 76.2}, respectively). Subjects in the highest quartile of sEng were more likely to deliver early compared to those in the lowest quartile (HR: 14.96 95% CI: 8.73-25.62, p<0.0001). Natural log transformed sEng correlated positively with log sFlt1 levels (r = 0.87) and inversely with log PlGF levels (r = -0.79) (p<0.0001 for both). Plasma sEng had comparable area under the curve for prediction of adverse outcomes as measurement of sFlt1/PlGF ratio (0.88 {0.81, 0.95} for sEng versus 0.89 {0.83, 0.95} for sFlt1/PlGF ratio, p = 0.74).In women with suspected preeclampsia presenting prior to 34 weeks of gestation, sEng performs better than standard clinical evaluation in detecting adverse maternal and fetal outcomes occurring within two weeks of presentation. Soluble endoglin was strongly correlated with sFlt1 and PlGF levels, suggesting common pathogenic pathways leading to preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2040883911,"bla(OXA-48) is a globally emerging carbapenemase-encoding gene. The progenitor of bla(OXA-48) appears to be a Shewanella species. The presence of the bla(OXA-48)-like gene was investigated for two Shewanella xiamenensis strains.Strain WCJ25 was recovered from post-surgical abdominal drainages, while S4 was the type strain of S. xiamenensis. Species identification for WCJ25 was established by sequencing the 16S rDNA and gyrB genes. PCR was used to screen the bla(OXA-48)-like genes and to obtain their complete sequences. A phylogenetic tree of the bla(OXA-48)-like genes was constructed. The genetic context of the bla(OXA-48)-like gene in strain WCJ25 was investigated by inverse PCR using self-ligated AseI- or RsaI-restricted WCJ25 DNA fragments as template, while that in strain S4 was determined by PCR mapping using that in WCJ25 as template.A new bla(OXA-48) variant, designated bla(OXA-48b), with four silent nucleotide differences from the bla(OXA-48) (designated bla(OXA-48a)) found in the Enterobacteriaceae was identified in strain S4. Strain WCJ25 had a new bla(OXA-48)-like variant, bla(OXA-199), with five nucleotide differences from bla(OXA-48)a and bla(OXA-48b). The OXA-199 protein has three amino acid substitutions (H37Y, V44A and D153G) compared with OXA-48. Both bla(OXA-48b) and bla(OXA-199) were found adjacent to genes encoding a peptidase (indicated as orf), a protein of unknown function (sprT), an endonuclease I (endA), and a ribosomal RNA methyl transferase (rsmE) upstream and to transcriptional regulator gene lysR and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase-encoding gene downstream. In addition, the insertion sequence ISShes2 was found inserted downstream of bla(OXA-199) but not of bla(OXA-48b).

https://openalex.org/W1997382225,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is the most aluminum (Al)-tolerant crop among small-grain cereals, but the mechanism underlying its high Al resistance is still not well understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying high Al-tolerance, we performed a comparative genome-wide transcriptional analysis by comparing expression profiling between the Al-tolerance cultivar (Koshihikari) and an Al-sensitive mutant star1 (SENSITIVE TO AL RHIZOTOXICITY 1) in both the root tips and the basal roots. Exposure to 20 µM AlCl3 for 6 h resulted in up-regulation (higher than 3-fold) of 213 and 2015 genes including 185 common genes in the root tips of wild-type and the mutant, respectively. On the other hand, in the basal root, genes up-regulated by Al were 126 and 2419 including 76 common genes in the wild-type and the mutant, respectively. These results indicate that Al-response genes are not only restricted to the root tips, but also in the basal root region. Analysis with genes up- or down-regulated only in the wild-type reveals that there are other mechanisms for Al-tolerance except for a known transcription factor ART1-regulated one in rice. These mechanisms are related to nitrogen assimilation, secondary metabolite synthesis, cell-wall synthesis and ethylene synthesis. Although the exact roles of these putative tolerance genes remain to be examined, our data provide a platform for further work on Al-tolerance in rice."

After removal of the signal peptide, Shh is processed to the mature, active form through autocleavage and a series of lipid modifications, including the attachment of palmitate. Covalent attachment of palmitate to the N-terminal cysteine of Shh is catalyzed by Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat) and is critical for proper signaling. The sequences within Shh that are responsible for palmitoylation by Hhat are not known. Here we show that the first six amino acids of mature Shh (CGPGRG) are sufficient for Hhat-mediated palmitoylation. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to determine the role of each amino acid and the positional sequence requirement in a cell-based Shh palmitoylation assay. Mutation of residues in the GPGR sequence to Ala had no effect on palmitoylation, provided that a positively charged residue was present within the first seven residues. The N-terminal position exhibited a strong but not exclusive requirement for Cys. Constructs with an N-terminal Ala were not palmitoylated. However, an N-terminal Ser served as a substrate for Hhat, but not the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog Rasp, highlighting a critical difference between the mammalian and fly enzymes. These findings define residues and regions within Shh that are necessary for its recognition as a substrate for Hhat-mediated palmitoylation.

https://openalex.org/W1997525490,"Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the effect of acute bilateral jugular vein compression on: (1) pial artery pulsation (cc-TQ); (2) cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV); (3) peripheral blood pressure; and (4) possible relations between mentioned parameters. Methods Experiments were performed on a group of 32 healthy 19–30 years old male subjects. cc-TQ and the subarachnoid width (sas-TQ) were measured using near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding (NIR-T/BSS), CBFV in the left anterior cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler, blood pressure was measured using Finapres, while end-tidal CO2 was measured using medical gas analyser. Bilateral jugular vein compression was achieved with the use of a sphygmomanometer held on the neck of the participant and pumped at the pressure of 40 mmHg, and was performed in the bend-over (BOPT) and swayed to the back (initial) position. Results In the first group (n = 10) during BOPT, sas-TQ and pulse pressure (PP) decreased (−17.6% and −17.9%, respectively) and CBFV increased (+35.0%), while cc-TQ did not change (+1.91%). In the second group, in the initial position (n = 22) cc-TQ and CBFV increased (106.6% and 20.1%, respectively), while sas-TQ and PP decreases were not statistically significant (−15.5% and −9.0%, respectively). End-tidal CO2 remained stable during BOPT and venous compression in both groups. Significant interdependence between changes in cc-TQ and PP after bilateral jugular vein compression in the initial position was found (r = −0.74). Conclusions Acute bilateral jugular venous insufficiency leads to hyperkinetic cerebral circulation characterised by augmented pial artery pulsation and CBFV and direct transmission of PP into the brain microcirculation. The Windkessel effect with impaired jugular outflow and more likely increased intracranial pressure is described. This study clarifies the potential mechanism linking jugular outflow insufficiency with arterial small vessel cerebral disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011126139,"Centriolar satellites are PCM-1-positive granules surrounding centrosomes. Proposed functions of the centriolar satellites include protein targeting to the centrosome, as well as communication between the centrosome and surrounding cytoplasm. CEP90 is a centriolar satellite protein that is critical for spindle pole integrity in mitotic cells. In this study, we examined the biological functions of CEP90 in interphase cells. CEP90 physically interacts with PCM-1 at centriolar satellites, and this interaction is essential for centrosomal accumulation of the centriolar satellites and eventually for primary cilia formation. CEP90 is also required for BBS4 loading on centriolar satellites and its localization in primary cilia. Our results imply that the assembly and transport of centriolar satellites are critical steps for primary cilia formation and ciliary protein recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2033295943,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from somatic cells by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors (TFs). However, the optimal cell type and the easy reprogramming approaches that minimize genetic aberrations of parent cells must be considered before generating the iPSCs. This paper reports a method to generate iPSCs from adult human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) without the use of a feeder layer, by ectopic expression of the defined transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC using a polycistronic plasmid. The results, based on the expression of pluripotent marker, demonstrated that the iPSCs have the characteristics similar to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The iPSCs differentiated into three embryonic germ layers both in vitro by embryoid body generation and in vivo by teratoma formation after being injected into immunodeficient mice. More importantly, the plasmid DNA does not integrate into the genome of human iPSCs as revealed by Southern blotting experiments. Karyotypic analysis also demonstrated that the reprogramming of hADSCs by the defined factors did not induce chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, this technology provides a platform for studying the biology of iPSCs without viral vectors, and can hopefully overcome immune rejection and ethical concerns, which are the two important barriers of ESC applications."
https://openalex.org/W2064904613,"Objective No optimal housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been identified for CD4+ T cells from non-depressive asthmatic and depressive asthmatic adults for normalizing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays. The aim of present study was to select appropriate HKGs for gene expression analysis in purified CD4+ T cells from these asthmatics. Methods Three groups of subjects (Non-depressive asthmatic, NDA, n = 10, Depressive asthmatic, DA, n = 11, and Healthy control, HC, n = 10 respectively) were studied. qPCR for 9 potential HKGs, namely RNA, 28S ribosomal 1 (RN28S1), ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLP0), actin, beta (ACTB), cyclophilin A (PPIA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glucuronidase, beta (GUSB) and ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A), was performed. Then the data were analyzed with three different applications namely BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. Results The analysis of gene expression data identified B2M and RPLP0 as the most stable reference genes and showed that the level of PPIA was significantly different among subjects of three groups when the two best HKGs identified were applied. Post-hoc analysis by Student-Newman-Keuls correction shows that depressive asthmatics and non-depressive asthmatics exhibited lower expression level of PPIA than healthy controls (p<0.05). Conclusions B2M and RPLP0 were identified as the most optimal HKGs in gene expression studies involving human blood CD4+ T cells derived from normal, depressive asthmatics and non-depressive asthmatics. The suitability of using the PPIA gene as the HKG for such studies was questioned due to its low expression in asthmatics."
https://openalex.org/W2106524444,"Sexual dimorphism is widespread among carnivorans, and has been an important evolutionary factor in social ecology. However, its presence in sabertoothed felids remains contentious. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of extant Panthera and the sabertoothed felid Smilodon fatalis. S. fatalis has been reported to show little or no sexual dimorphism but to have been intraspecifically variable in skull morphology. We found that large and small specimens of S. fatalis could be assigned to male and female sexes with similar degrees of confidence as Panthera based on craniomandibular shape. P. uncia is much less craniomandibularly variable and has low levels of sexual size-dimorphism. Shape variation in S. fatalis probably reflects sexual differences. Craniomandibular size-dimorphism is lower in S. fatalis than in Panthera except P. uncia. Sexual dimorphism in felids is related to more than overall size, and S. fatalis and the four large Panthera species show marked and similar craniomandibular and dental morphometric sexual dimorphism, whereas morphometric dimorphism in P. uncia is less. Many morphometric-sexually dimorphic characters in Panthera and Smilodon are related to bite strength and presumably to killing ecology. This suggests that morphometric sexual dimorphism is an evolutionary adaptation to intraspecific resource partitioning, since large males with thicker upper canines and stronger bite forces would be able to hunt larger prey than females, which is corroborated by feeding ecology in P. leo. Sexual dimorphism indicates that S. fatalis could have been social, but it is unlikely that it lived in fusion-fission units dominated by one or a few males, as in sub-Saharan populations of P. leo. Instead, S. fatalis could have been solitary and polygynous, as most extant felids, or it may have lived in unisexual groups, as is common in P. leo persica."
https://openalex.org/W1968209486,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a disorder characterized by simultaneous fat accumulation and chronic inflammation in the liver. In this study, Pin1 expression was revealed to be markedly increased in the livers of mice with methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH, a rodent model of NASH. In addition, Pin1 KO mice were highly resistant to MCD-induced NASH, based on a series of data showing simultaneous fat accumulation, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver. In terms of Pin1-induced fat accumulation, it was revealed that the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its target genes were higher in the livers of Pin1 KO mice than in controls. Thus, resistance of Pin1 KO mice to hepatic steatosis is partially attributable to the lack of Pin1-induced down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, although multiple other mechanisms are apparently involved. Another mechanism involves the enhancing effect of hematopoietic Pin1 on the expressions of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 through NF-κB activation, eventually leading to hepatic fibrosis. Finally, to distinguish the roles of hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic Pin1 in NASH development, mice lacking Pin1 in either nonhematopoietic or hematopoietic cells were produced by bone marrow transplantation between wild-type and Pin1 KO mice. The mice having nonhematopoietic Pin1 exhibited fat accumulation without liver fibrosis on the MCD diet. Thus, hepatic Pin1 appears to be directly involved in the fat accumulation in hepatocytes, whereas Pin1 in hematopoietic cells contributes to inflammation and fibrosis. In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that Pin1 plays critical roles in NASH development. This report also raises the possibility that hepatic Pin1 inhibition to the appropriate level might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for NASH."

Using a generalized linear model, we explored the effects of time (month) on mean relative search volume for all four terms.Models suggest a significant effect of month on mean search volume for all four terms. Search activity for all four terms was highest in January with observable declines throughout the remainder of the year.These findings demonstrate discernable temporal patterns of search activity for four areas of behavior change.

https://openalex.org/W2029109210,"Despite the active research in this field, molecular mechanisms underlying exercise-induced beneficial effects on brain physiology and functions are still matter of debate, especially with regard to biological processes activated by regular exercise affecting the onset and progression of hippocampal aging in individuals unfamiliar with habitual physical activity. Since such responses seem to be mediated by changes in antioxidative, antiglycative and metabolic status, a possible exercise-induced coordinated response involving redox, methylglyoxal- and sirtuin-related molecular networks may be hypothesized. In this study, hippocampi of CD1 mice undergoing the transition from mature to middle age were analyzed for redox-related profile, oxidative and methylglyoxal-dependent damage patterns, energy metabolism, sirtuin1 and glyoxalase1 expression after a 2- or 4-mo treadmill running program. Our findings suggested that the 4-mo regular running lowered the chance of dicarbonyl and oxidative stress, activated mitochondrial catabolism and preserved sirtuin1-related neuroprotection. Surprisingly, the same cellular pathways were negatively affected by the first 2 months of exercise, thus showing an interesting biphasic response. In conclusion, the duration of exercise caused a profound shift in the response to regular running within the rodent hippocampus in a time-dependent fashion. This research revealed important details of the interaction between exercise and mammal hippocampus during the transition from mature to middle age, and this might help to develop non-pharmacological approaches aimed at retarding brain senescence, even in individuals unfamiliar with habitual exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2159813273,"Pigeon 'milk' and mammalian milk have functional similarities in terms of nutritional benefit and delivery of immunoglobulins to the young. Mammalian milk has been clearly shown to aid in the development of the immune system and microbiota of the young, but similar effects have not yet been attributed to pigeon 'milk'. Therefore, using a chicken model, we investigated the effect of pigeon 'milk' on immune gene expression in the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) and on the composition of the caecal microbiota. Chickens fed pigeon 'milk' had a faster rate of growth and a better feed conversion ratio than control chickens. There was significantly enhanced expression of immune-related gene pathways and interferon-stimulated genes in the GALT of pigeon 'milk'-fed chickens. These pathways include the innate immune response, regulation of cytokine production and regulation of B cell activation and proliferation. The caecal microbiota of pigeon 'milk'-fed chickens was significantly more diverse than control chickens, and appears to be affected by prebiotics in pigeon 'milk', as well as being directly seeded by bacteria present in pigeon 'milk'. Our results demonstrate that pigeon 'milk' has further modes of action which make it functionally similar to mammalian milk. We hypothesise that pigeon 'lactation' and mammalian lactation evolved independently but resulted in similarly functional products."

Mice in which Cstf2t was knocked out had a phenotype that was only detected in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, giving us the opportunity to examine CstF-64 function in an isolated developmental system. We performed massively parallel clonally amplified sequencing of cDNAs from testes of wild type and Cstf2t−/− mice. These results revealed that loss of τCstF-64 resulted in large-scale changes in patterns of genome expression. We determined that there was a significant overrepresentation of RNAs from introns and intergenic regions in testes of Cstf2t−/− mice, and a concomitant use of more distal polyadenylation sites. We observed this effect particularly in intronless small genes, many of which are expressed retroposons that likely co-evolved with τCstF-64. Finally, we observed overexpression of long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) sequences in Cstf2t−/− testes. These results suggest that τCstF-64 plays a role in 3′ end determination and transcription termination for a large range of germ cell-expressed genes."
https://openalex.org/W2171336799,"Reduced turnover of extracellular matrix has a role in renal fibrosis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is associated with many glomerular diseases, but the histological association of MMPs and human renal fibrosis is unclear.This is a retrospective study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the review of patients' medical records, data analysis and pathological specimens staining with waiver of informed consents. Specimens of forty-six patients were examined by immunohistochemical stain of MMP-9 in nephrectomized kidneys, and the association of renal expression of MMP-9 and renal fibrosis was determined. MMP-9 expression in individual renal components and fibrosis was graded as high or low based on MMP-9 staining and fibrotic scores.Patients with high interstitial fibrosis scores (IFS) and glomerular fibrosis scores (GFS) had significantly higher serum creatinine, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and urothelial cell carcinoma. Univariate analysis showed that IFS and GFS were negatively associated with normal and atrophic tubular cytoplasmic MMP-9 expression and IFS was positively correlated with atrophic tubular nuclear MMP-9 expression. Multivariate stepwise regression indicated that MMP-9 expression in atrophic tubular nuclei (r = 0.4, p = 0.002) was an independent predictor of IFS, and that MMP-9 expression in normal tubular cytoplasm (r = -0.465, p<0.001) was an independent predictor of GFS.Interstitial fibrosis correlated with MMP-9 expression in the atrophic tubular nuclei. Our results indicate that renal fibrosis is associated with a decline of MMP-9 expression in the cytoplasm of normal tubular cells and increased expression of MMP-9 in the nuclei of tubular atrophic renal tubules."

Herein we report that life in this radioactive environment has led to alteration of the developing soybean seed proteome in a specific way that resulted in the production of fertile seeds with low levels of oil and β-conglycinin seed storage proteins. Soybean seeds were harvested at four, five, and six weeks after flowering, and at maturity from plants grown in either non-radioactive or radioactive plots in the Chernobyl area. The abundance of 211 proteins was determined. The results confirmed previous data indicating that alterations in the proteome include adaptation to heavy metal stress and mobilization of seed storage proteins. The results also suggest that there have been adjustments to carbon metabolism in the cytoplasm and plastids, increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and decreased condensation of malonyl-acyl carrier protein during fatty acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1972801561,"We previously demonstrated the functional expression in newborn rat neocortical astrocytes of glutamine transporter (GlnT = slc38a1) believed to predominate in neurons over astroglia in the brain. In order to evaluate the possible role of this transporter in neurogenesis, we attempted to establish stable transfectants of GlnT in mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells endowed to proliferate for self-renewal and differentiate into progeny cells such as neurons and astroglia, in addition to in vitro pharmacological profiling of the green tea ingredient theanine, which is shown to be a potent inhibitor of glutamine transport mediated by GlnT in cultured neurons and astroglia.The full-length coding region of rat GlnT was inserted into a vector for gene transfection along with selection by G418, followed by culture with all-trans retinoic acid under floating conditions and subsequent dispersion for spontaneous differentiation under adherent conditions. Stable overexpression of GlnT led to marked increases in the size of round spheres formed during the culture for 4 days and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide reduction, with concomitant promotion of subsequent differentiation into cells immunoreactive for a neuronal marker protein. In these stable GlnT transfectants before differentiation, drastic upregulation was seen for mRNA expression of several proneural genes with a basic helix-loop-helix domain such as NeuroD1. Although a drastic increase was seen in NeuroD1 promoter activity in stable GlnT transfectants, theanine doubled NeuroD1 promoter activity in stable transfectants of empty vector (EV), without affecting the promoter activity already elevated in GlnT transfectants. Similarly, theanine promoted cellular proliferation and neuronal differentiation in stable EV transfectants, but failed to further stimulate the acceleration of both proliferation and neuronal differentiation found in stable GlnT transfectants.GlnT would promote both proliferation and neuronal differentiation through a mechanism relevant to the upregulation of particular proneural genes in undifferentiated P19 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004545938,"DNA transposons have become important vectors for efficient non-viral integration of transgenes into genomic DNA. The Sleeping Beauty (SB), piggyBac (PB), and Tol2 transposable elements have distinct biological properties and currently represent the most promising transposon systems for animal transgenesis and gene therapy. A potential obstacle, however, for persistent function of integrating vectors is transcriptional repression of the element and its genetic cargo. In this study we analyze the insulating effect of the 1.2-kb 5'-HS4 chicken β-globin (cHS4) insulator element in the context of SB, PB, and Tol2 transposon vectors. By examining transgene expression from genomically inserted transposon vectors encoding a marker gene driven by a silencing-prone promoter, we detect variable levels of transcriptional silencing for the three transposon systems in retinal pigment epithelium cells. Notably, the PB system seems less vulnerable to silencing. Incorporation of cHS4 insulator sequences into the transposon vectors results in 2.2-fold and 1.5-fold increased transgene expression levels for insulated SB and PB vectors, respectively, but an improved persistency of expression was not obtained for insulated transgenes. Colony formation assays and quantitative excision assays unveil enhanced SB transposition efficiencies by the inclusion of the cHS4 element, resulting in a significant increase in the stable transfection rate for insulated SB transposon vectors in human cell lines. Our findings reveal a positive impact of cHS4 insulator inclusion for SB and PB vectors in terms of increased transgene expression levels and improved SB stable transfection rates, but also the lack of a long-term protective effect of the cHS4 insulator against progressive transgene silencing in retinal pigment epithelium cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011893941,"It is known that the conservation of protein-coding genes is associated with their sequences both various species, such as animals and plants. However, the association between microRNA (miRNA) conservation and their sequences in various species remains unexplored. Here we report the association of miRNA conservation with its sequence features, such as base content and cleavage sites, suggesting that miRNA sequences contain the fingerprints for miRNA conservation. More interestingly, different species show different and even opposite patterns between miRNA conservation and sequence features. For example, mammalian miRNAs show a positive/negative correlation between conservation and AU/GC content, whereas plant miRNAs show a negative/positive correlation between conservation and AU/GC content. Further analysis puts forward the hypothesis that the introns of protein-coding genes may be a main driving force for the origin and evolution of mammalian miRNAs. At the 5' end, conserved miRNAs have a preference for base U, while less-conserved miRNAs have a preference for a non-U base in mammals. This difference does not exist in insects and plants, in which both conserved miRNAs and less-conserved miRNAs have a preference for base U at the 5' end. We further revealed that the non-U preference at the 5' end of less-conserved mammalian miRNAs is associated with miRNA function diversity, which may have evolved from the pressure of a highly sophisticated environmental stimulus the mammals encountered during evolution. These results indicated that miRNA sequences contain the fingerprints for conservation, and these fingerprints vary according to species. More importantly, the results suggest that although species share common mechanisms by which miRNAs originate and evolve, mammals may develop a novel mechanism for miRNA origin and evolution. In addition, the fingerprint found in this study can be predictor of miRNA conservation, and the findings are helpful in achieving a clearer understanding of miRNA function and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2050473908,"Previous studies suggest that loss of γ-secretase activity in postnatal mouse brains causes age-dependent memory impairment and neurodegeneration. Due to the diverse array of γ-secretase substrates, it remains to be demonstrated whether loss of cleavage of any specific substrate(s) is responsible for these defects. The bulk of the phenotypes observed in mammals deficient for γ-secretase or exposed to γ-secretase inhibitors are caused by the loss of Notch receptor proteolysis. Accordingly, inhibition of Notch signaling is the main cause for untoward effects for γ-secretase inhibitors as therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we wished to determine if loss of canonical Notch signaling is responsible for the age-dependent neurodegeneration observed upon γ-secrectase deficiency in the mouse brain. We generated postnatal forebrain-specific RBPj conditional knockout (cKO) mice using the CamKII-Cre driver and examined behavior and brain pathology in 12-18 month old animals. Since all four mammalian Notch receptor homologues signal via this DNA binding protein, these mice lack canonical Notch signaling. We found that loss of RBPj in mature excitatory neurons was well tolerated, with no evidence for neurodegeneration or of learning and memory impairment in mice aged up to 18 months. The only phenotypic deficit we observed in the RBPj-deficient mice was a subtle abnormality in olfactory preferences, particularly in females. We conclude that the loss of canonical Notch signaling through the four receptors is not responsible for age-dependent neurodegeneration or learning and memory deficits seen in γ-secretase deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2092731895,"Organisms allocate resources to reproduction in response to the costs and benefits of current and future reproductive opportunities. According to the differential allocation hypothesis, females allocate more resources to high-quality males. We tested whether a fish species lacking parental care (zebrafish, Danio rerio) expresses male size-dependent differential allocation in monogamous spawning trials. In addition, we tested whether reproductive allocation by females is affected by previous experience of different-quality males, potentially indicating plasticity in mate choice. To that end, females were conditioned to large, small or random-sized males (controls) for 14 days to manipulate females' expectations of the future mate quality. Females showed a clear preference for large males in terms of spawning probability and clutch size independent of the conditioning treatment. However, when females experienced variation in male size (random-sized conditioning treatment) they discriminated less against small males compared to females conditioned to large and small males. This might suggest that differential allocation and size-dependent sexual selection is of less relevance in nature than revealed in the present laboratory study."
https://openalex.org/W1965276119,"O-N-acetylglucosaminylation is a reversible post-translational modification which presents a dynamic and highly regulated interplay with phosphorylation. New insights suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might be involved in striated muscle physiology, in particular in contractile properties such as the calcium activation parameters. By the inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, we investigated the effect of the increase of soleus O-GlcNAcylation level on the contractile properties by establishing T/pCa relationships. We increased the O-GlcNAcylation level on soleus biopsies performing an organ culture of soleus treated or not with PUGNAc or Thiamet-G, two O-GlcNAcase inhibitors. The enhancement of O-GlcNAcylation pattern was associated with an increase of calcium affinity on slow soleus skinned fibers. Analysis of the glycoproteins pattern showed that this effect is solely due to O-GlcNAcylation of proteins extracted from skinned biopsies. We also characterized the O-GlcNAcylated contractile proteins using a proteomic approach, and identified among others troponin T and I as being O-GlcNAc modified. We quantified the variation of O-GlcNAc level on all these identified proteins, and showed that several regulatory contractile proteins, predominantly fast isoforms, presented a drastic increase in their O-GlcNAc level. Since the only slow isoform of contractile protein presenting an increase of O-GlcNAc level was MLC2, the effect of enhanced O-GlcNAcylation pattern on calcium activation parameters could involve the O-GlcNAcylation of sMLC2, without excluding that an unidentified O-GlcNAc proteins, such as TnC, could be potentially involved in this mechanism. All these data strongly linked O-GlcNAcylation to the modulation of contractile activity of skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2019594860,"The liver must keep equilibrium between immune tolerance and immunity in order to protect itself from pathogens while maintaining tolerance to food antigens. An imbalance between these two states could result in an inflammatory liver disease. The aims of this study were to identify factors responsible for a break of tolerance and characterize the subsequent restoration of liver immune homeostasis. A pro-inflammatory environment was created in the liver by the co-administration of TLR ligands CpG and Poly(I:C) in presence or absence of activated liver-specific autoreactive CD8(+) T cells. Regardless of autoreactive CD8(+) T cells, mice injected with CpG and Poly(I:C) showed elevated serum ALT levels and a transient liver inflammation. Both CpG/Poly(I:C) and autoreactive CD8(+)T cells induced expression of TLR9 and INF-γ by the liver, and an up-regulation of homing and adhesion molecules CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Transferred CFSE-labeled autoreactive CD8(+) T cells, in presence of TLR3 and 9 ligands, were recruited by the liver and spleen and proliferated. This population then contracted by apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Up-regulation of FasL and PD-L1 in the liver was observed. In conclusion, TLR-mediated activation of the innate immune system results in a pro-inflammatory environment that promotes the recruitment of lymphocytes resulting in bystander hepatitis. Despite this pro-inflammatory environment, the presence of autoreactive CD8(+) T cells is not sufficient to sustain an autoimmune response against the liver and immune homeostasis is rapidly restored through the apoptosis of T cells."

Although general impairments in manual dexterity are well-documented in older adults, it is unclear how these sensorimotor impairments influence the ability of older adults to dexterously manipulate fixed, low-friction surfaces in particular. 21 young and 18 older (65+ yrs) adults produced maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and steady submaximal forces (2.5 and 10% MVC) with the fingertip of the index finger. A Teflon covered custom-molded splint was placed on the fingertip. A three-axis force sensor was covered with either Teflon or sandpaper to create low- and high-friction surfaces, respectively. Maximal downward forces (F(z)) were similar (p = .135) for young and older adults, and decreased by 15% (p<.001) while pressing on Teflon compared to sandpaper. Fluctuations in F(z) during the submaximal force-matching tasks were 2.45× greater (p<.001) for older adults than in young adults, and reached a maximum when older adults pressed against the Teflon surface while receiving visual feedback. These age-associated changes in motor performance are explained, in part, by altered muscle activity from three hand muscles and out-of-plane forces. Quantifying the ability to produce steady fingertip forces against low-friction surfaces may be a better indicator of impairment and disability than the current practice of evaluating maximal forces with pinch meters. These age-associated impairments in dexterity while interacting with low-friction surfaces may limit the use of the current generation of computing interfaces by older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2082745401,"The folding pathway, three-dimensional structure and intrinsic dynamics of proteins are governed by their amino acid sequences. Internal protein surfaces with physicochemical properties appropriate to modulate conformational fluctuations could play important roles in folding and dynamics. We show here that proteins contain buried interfaces of high polarity and low packing density, coined as LIPs: Light Interfaces of high Polarity, whose physicochemical properties make them unstable. The structures of well-characterized equilibrium and kinetic folding intermediates indicate that the LIPs of the corresponding native proteins fold late and are involved in local unfolding events. Importantly, LIPs can be identified using very fast and uncomplicated computational analysis of protein three-dimensional structures, which provides an easy way to delineate the protein segments involved in dynamics. Since LIPs can be retained while the sequences of the interacting segments diverge significantly, proteins could in principle evolve new functional features reusing pre-existing encoded dynamics. Large-scale identification of LIPS may contribute to understanding evolutionary constraints of proteins and the way protein intrinsic dynamics are encoded."
https://openalex.org/W2015508594,"β-Thalassemias and abnormal hemoglobin variants are among the most common hereditary abnormalities in humans. Molecular characterization of the causative genetic variants is an essential part of the diagnostic process. In geographic areas with high hemoglobinopathy prevalence, such as the Mediterranean region, a limited number of genetic variants are responsible for the majority of hemoglobinopathy cases. Developing reliable, rapid and cost-effective mutation-specific molecular diagnostic assays targeting particular populations greatly facilitates routine hemoglobinopathy investigations. We developed a one-tube single-nucleotide primer extension assay for the detection of eight common Mediterranean β-thalassemia mutations: Codon 5 (-CT); CCT(Pro)->C-, Codon 6 (-A); GAG(Glu)->G-G, Codon 8 (-AA); AAG(Lys)->-G, IVS-I-1 (G->A), IVS-I-6 (T->C), IVS-I-110 (G->A), Codon 39 (C->T), and IVS-II-745 (C->G), as well as the hemoglobin S variant beta 6(A3) Glu>Val. We validated the new assay using previously genotyped samples obtaining 100% agreement between independent genotyping methods. Our approach, applicable in a range of Mediterranean countries, offers a combination of high accuracy and rapidity exploiting standard techniques and widely available equipment. It can be further adapted to particular populations by including/excluding assayed mutations. We facilitate future modifications by providing detailed information on assay design."
https://openalex.org/W1982991042,"Theoretical and empirical work indicates that the central nervous system is able to stabilize motor performance by selectively suppressing task-relevant variability (TRV), while allowing task-equivalent variability (TEV) to occur. During unperturbed bipedal standing, it has previously been observed that, for task variables such as the whole-body center of mass (CoM), TEV exceeds TRV in amplitude. However, selective control (and correction) of TRV should also lead to different temporal characteristics, with TEV exhibiting higher temporal persistence compared to TRV. The present study was specifically designed to test this prediction. Kinematics of prolonged quiet standing (5 minutes) was measured in fourteen healthy young participants, with eyes closed. Using the uncontrolled manifold analysis, postural variability in six sagittal joint angles was decomposed into TEV and TRV with respect to four task variables: (1) center of mass (CoM) position, (2) head position, (3) trunk orientation and (4) head orientation. Persistence of fluctuations within the two variability components was quantified by the time-lagged auto-correlation, with eight time lags between 1 and 128 seconds. The pattern of results differed between task variables. For three of the four task variables (CoM position, head position, trunk orientation), TEV significantly exceeded TRV over the entire 300 s-period.The autocorrelation analysis confirmed our main hypothesis for CoM position and head position: at intermediate and longer time delays, TEV exhibited higher persistence than TRV. Trunk orientation showed a similar trend, while head orientation did not show a systematic difference between TEV and TRV persistence. The combination of temporal and task-equivalent analyses in the present study allow a refined characterization of the dynamic control processes underlying the stabilization of upright standing. The results confirm the prediction, derived from computational motor control, that task-equivalent fluctuations for specific task variables show higher temporal persistence compared to task-relevant fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2040207004,"In humans, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells represent a small but significant population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a high degree of variability. In this study, pursuant to our goal of identifying an appropriate non-human primate model suitable for pre-clinical glycolipid testing, we evaluated the percentage and function of iNKT cells in the peripheral blood of pig-tailed macaques. First, using a human CD1d-tetramer loaded with α-GalCer (α-GalCer-CD1d-Tet), we found that α-GalCer-CD1d-Tet(+) CD3(+) iNKT cells make up 0.13% to 0.4% of pig-tailed macaque PBMCs, which are comparable to the percentage of iNKT cells found in human PBMCs. Second, we observed that a large proportion of Vα24(+)CD3(+) cells are α-GalCer-CD1d-Tet(+)CD3(+) iNKT cells, which primarily consist of either the CD4(+) or CD8(+) subpopulation. Third, we found that pig-tailed macaque iNKT cells produce IFN-γ in response to α-GalCer, as shown by ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS), as well as TNF-α, as shown by ICCS, indicating that these iNKT cells are fully functional. Interestingly, the majority of pig-tailed macaque iNKT cells that secrete IFN-γ are CD8(+)iNKT cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that the pig-tailed macaques exhibit potential as a non-human animal model for the pre-clinical testing of iNKT-stimulating glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1980359141,"Bacteriophages φ29 and Nf from Bacillus subtilis start replication of their linear genomes at both ends using a protein-primed mechanism by means of which the DNA polymerase initiates replication by adding dAMP to the terminal protein, this insertion being directed by the second and third 3′ terminal thymine of the template strand, respectively. In this work, we have obtained evidences about the role of the 3′ terminal base during the initiation steps of φ29 and Nf genome replication. The results indicate that the absence of the 3′ terminal base modifies the initiation position carried out by φ29 DNA polymerase in such a way that now the third position of the template, instead of the second one, guides the incorporation of the initiating nucleotide. In the case of Nf, although the lack of the 3′ terminal base has no effect on the initiation position, its absence impairs further elongation of the TP-dAMP initiation product. The results show the essential role of the 3′ terminal base in guaranteeing the correct positioning of replication origins at the polymerization active site to allow accurate initiation of replication and further elongation."
