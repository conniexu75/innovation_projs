https://openalex.org/W2129859001,"Direct transfer of the normal cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to airway epithelium was evaluated using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vector containing normal human CFTR cDNA (Ad-CFTR). In vitro Ad-CFTR-infected CFPAC-1 CF epithelial cells expressed human CFTR mRNA and protein and demonstrated correction of defective cAMP-mediated Cl- permeability. Two days after in vivo intratracheal introduction of Ad-CFTR in cotton rats, in situ analysis demonstrated human CFTR gene expression in lung epithelium. PCR amplification of reverse transcribed lung RNA demonstrated human CFTR transcripts derived from Ad-CFTR, and Northern analysis of lung RNA revealed human CFTR transcripts for up to 6 weeks. Human CFTR protein was detected in epithelial cells using anti-human CFTR antibody 11-14 days after infection. While the safety and effectiveness remain to be demonstrated, these observations suggest the feasibility of in vivo CFTR gene transfer as therapy for the pulmonary manifestations of CF."

https://openalex.org/W1540911990,"The mammalian tachykinin system consists of three distinct peptides, substance P, substance K, and neuromedin K, and possesses three corresponding receptors. In this investigation we examined intracellular signal transduction of the individual tachykinin receptors by transfection and stable expression of these receptor cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The three receptors commonly showed a rapid and marked stimulation in both phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis and cyclic AMP formation in response to tachykinin interaction. Direct linkage of the three receptors to both phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase was evidenced by the finding that tachykinin, added together with GTP, activated these enzyme activities in membrane preparations derived from tachykinin receptor-expressing cells. The stimulation of cyclic AMP formation was less efficient than that of PI hydrolysis in receptor-expressing cells as well as their membrane preparations (about 1 order of magnitude difference in the effective peptide concentrations). However, the stimulatory responses of the PI hydrolysis and cyclic AMP formation in both receptor-expressing cells and their membrane preparations were induced in complete agreement with the tachykinin binding selectivity of each subtype of the receptors. This investigation demonstrated unequivocally that the tachykinin receptors have the potential to couple directly to both phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase and to stimulate PI hydrolysis and cyclic AMP formation."
https://openalex.org/W1577922858,"Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA was purified to homogeneity, as a monomer, from a K12 derivative deficient in both OmpF and OmpC porins. When proteoliposomes reconstituted from the purified OmpA, phospholipids, and lithium dodecyl sulfate were tested for permeability to small molecules by osmotic swelling, it was found that OmpA produced apparently nonspecific diffusion channels that allowed the penetration of various solutes. The pore-forming activity was destroyed by the heat denaturation of the OmpA protein, and the use of an OmpA-deficient mutant showed that the activity was not caused by copurifying contaminants. The size of the OmpA channel, estimated by comparison of diffusion rates of solutes of different sizes, was rather similar to that of E. coli OmpF and OmpC porins, i.e. about 1 nm in diameter. The rate of penetration of L-arabinose caused by a given amount of OmpA protein, however, was about a hundredfold lower than the rate produced by the same amount of E. coli OmpF porin. The addition of large amounts of lithium dodecyl sulfate to the reconstitution mixture increased the permeability through the OmpA channel, apparently by facilitating the correct insertion of OmpA into the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1594300713,"In patch-clamp experiments on rat liver mitoplasts, the 1.3 nanosiemens (in 150 mM KCl) mitochondrial megachannel was activated by Ca2+ and competitively inhibited by Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+. Cyclosporin A, which inhibits the megachannel, also showed a competitive behavior versus Ca2+. The pore is regulated by pH in the physiological range; lower pH values cause its closure in a Ca(2+)-reversible manner. The modulating sites involved in these effects are located on the matrix side of the membrane. As illustrated in the companion paper (Bernardi, P., Vassanelli, S., Veronese, P., Colonna, R., Szabo, I., and Zoratti, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2934-2939), the calcium-induced permeability transition of mitochondria is affected by these various agents in a similar manner. The results support the identification of the megachannel with the pore believed to be involved in the permeabilization process. The kinetic characteristics of the single channel events support the idea that the megachannel is composed of cooperating subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1545653070,"Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited disease in humans, caused by a deficiency of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, that we have used as a model for developing liver-directed gene therapies. Our strategy is to reconstitute hepatic LDL receptor expression in vivo by administering a DNA-protein complex that is capable of targeting the delivery of functional LDL receptor genes to hepatocytes. Infusion of this DNA-protein complex into the peripheral circulation of a rabbit animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia resulted in hepatocyte-specific gene transfer and a temporary amelioration of hypercholesterolemia. This noninvasive approach to gene therapy should have applications in the treatment of a wide spectrum of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1674497257,"We report the molecular cloning and DNA sequence of the gene encoding the biotin carboxylase subunit of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The biotin carboxylase gene encodes a protein of 449 residues that is strikingly similar to amino-terminal segments of two biotin-dependent carboxylase proteins, yeast pyruvate carboxylase and the alpha-subunit of rat propionyl-CoA carboxylase. The deduced biotin carboxylase sequence contains a consensus ATP binding site and a cysteine-containing sequence preserved in all sequenced bicarbonate-dependent biotin carboxylases that may play a key catalytic role. The gene encoding the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is located upstream of the biotin carboxylase gene and the two genes are cotranscribed. As previously reported by others, the BCCP sequence encoded a protein of 16,688 molecular mass. However, this value is much smaller than that (22,500 daltons) obtained by analysis of the protein. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified BCCP protein confirmed the deduced amino acid sequence indicating that BCCP is a protein of atypical physical properties. Northern and primer extension analyses demonstrate that BCCP and biotin carboxylase are transcribed as a single mRNA species that contains an unusually long untranslated leader preceding the BCCP gene. We have also determined the mutational alteration in a previously isolated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (fabE) mutant and show the lesion maps within the BCCP gene and results in a BCCP species defective in acceptance of biotin. Translational fusions of the carboxyl-terminal 110 or 84 (but not 76) amino acids of BCCP to beta-galactosidase resulted in biotinated beta-galactosidase molecules and production of one such fusion was shown to result in derepression of the biotin biosynthetic operon."
https://openalex.org/W1608169825,"Loss of growth regulation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) may be an important step in carcinogenesis. We have used a cell fusion system to show that inhibition of growth by TGF-beta can be restored to carcinoma cell lines that are unresponsive to the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. In a previous study, the EJ bladder carcinoma line was fused to the SW480 colon adenocarcinoma line and found to produce nontumorigenic hybrid cells along with one hybrid cell clone of low tumorigenicity. Here we show that the capacity of the nontumorigenic hybrid cells to respond to either TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2 has been restored, while the parental or tumorigenic hybrid cells show little or no inhibition of growth following TGF-beta treatment. Cross-linking analyses with labeled TGF-beta 1 demonstrated much higher levels of the type II (85 kDa) receptor in the hybrid cells compared with the parental tumor lines. Both the parental and tumorigenic hybrid cell lines were capable of responding to TGF-beta as evidenced by increased levels of mRNA for fibronectin, type IV collagenase, and plasminogen activator inhibitor after treatment with TGF-beta 1. These results suggest that the type II receptor is necessary for mediating the effects of TGF-beta on inhibition of growth but not on gene activation of the hybrid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016400146,"Hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of Paramecium stimulates adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) formation. Manipulations of the K+ resting conductance of the ciliate by adaptation in different buffers affected excitability of the cAMP generating system. Blockade of K+ channels inhibited hyperpolarization-stimulated cAMP formation. A mutant of Paramecium that is unable to control its K+ resting conductance had a defect in cAMP formation. Purified adenylyl cyclase, when incorporated into an artificial lipid bilayer membrane, revealed properties of a voltage-independent K+ channel. This indicates that the adenylyl cyclase of Paramecium has a secondary function as carrier of the K+ resting conductance. A hyperpolarization-activated K+ efflux appears to directly regulate adenylyl cyclase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2012163065,"Ligand-gated ion channels are oligomeric membrane proteins in which homologous subunits specifically recognize one another and assemble around an aqueous pore. To identify domains responsible for the specificity of subunit association, we used a dominant-negative assay in which truncated subunits of the mouse muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were coexpressed with the four wild-type subunits in transfected COS cells. Fragments of the alpha, delta, and gamma subunits consisting solely of the extracellular N-terminal domain blocked surface expression of the AChR and the formation of alpha delta heterodimers, an early step in the assembly pathway of the AChR. Immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments showed that an N-terminal fragment of the alpha subunit forms a specific complex with the intact delta subunit. Thus the extracellular N-terminal domain of the alpha, delta, and gamma subunits contains the information necessary for specific subunit association."
https://openalex.org/W1569766708,"A number of neuropeptides have been described which are present in the insect nervous system. The physiological role of these neuropeptides has not yet been clarified. We have characterized a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA coding for a protein, NKD, whose sequence resembles that of mammalian G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors. This protein shows 38% homology with the mammalian tachykinin NK3 receptor within the transmembrane domain region. Stable cell lines expressing this cDNA are responsive to Locusta migratoria tachykinin but not to other peptides of the tachykinin family. The expression of this gene is detected principally in adult fly heads, but also in the adult body and in embryos. Interestingly, NKD mRNA is detected at very early stages of Drosophila embryonic development (3 h) and reaches the highest level of expression at 12-16 h, a time which correlates with the period of major neuronal development. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that NKD is expressed in the central nervous system, as well as in subsets of neurons in each segment of the developing ventral ganglia. The cytological localization of this gene is at position 86C on the Drosophila third chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1566399506,"The mechanisms by which phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and cAMP attenuate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2) induced by ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) was studied in the human Jurkat T-cell line. It has previously been shown that stimulation of Jurkat cells with antibodies to CD3, components of the TCR, elicits a rapid and transient phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, the predominant PLC isozyme in Jurkat cells, at multiple tyrosine residues and that such tyrosine phosphorylation leads to activation of PLC-gamma 1. Prior incubation of Jurkat cells with PMA or forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP concentrations, prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 as well as the hydrolysis of PtdIns 4,5-P2 induced by ligation of CD3. Dose-response curves of PMA and of forskolin for the inhibition of PLC-gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and of PtdIns 4,5-P2 hydrolysis were similar. These results suggest that the inhibition of PtdIns 4,5-P2 hydrolysis by PMA and cAMP is attributable to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA or forskolin stimulated the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 at serine 1248. PMA treatment also elicited the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 at an unidentified serine site. Phosphopeptide map analysis indicated that the sites of PLC-gamma 1 phosphorylated in Jurkat cells treated with PMA and forskolin are the same as those phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), respectively. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with antibodies to CD3 also elicited phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 at serine 1248 and at the unidentified serine site phosphorylated in PLC-gamma 1 from PMA-treated cells. Thus, phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 by PKC or PKA at serine 1248 may modulate the interaction of PLC-gamma 1 with the protein tyrosine kinase or the protein tyrosine phosphatase; this altered interaction may, at least in part, be responsible for the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 seen in PMA- and forskolin-treated Jurkat cells. Furthermore, in the absence of PMA, activation of PKC by diacylglycerol provides a negative feedback signal responsible for reducing the phosphotyrosine contents of PLC-gamma 1."
https://openalex.org/W1647156299,"Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) are small, nonenzymic glycoproteins that stimulate lysosomal degradation of various sphingolipids. SAP-1, SAP-2, and two additional potential activator proteins are derived from a common precursor by proteolytic processing. A severe case of sphingolipid storage disease that led to death within 16 weeks was attributed to a possible total deficiency of the SAPs generated by this gene (Harzer, K., Paton, B. C., Poulos, A., Kustermann-Kuhn, B., Roggendorf, W., Grisar, T., and Popp, M. (1989) Eur. J. Pediatr. 149, 31-39). Analysis of the SAP precursor cDNA from the patient and his fetal sibling showed an A to T transversion in the initiation codon. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization revealed that both parents are heterozygous carriers for this mutation. In pulse-chase experiments using antisera raised against SAP-1 or SAP-2, no cross-reacting material could be detected in the patients' fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1584201864,"The chorionic gonadotropin beta (CG beta) subunit is encoded by a multigene cluster composed of six homologous sequences (genes or pseudogenes). They are primarily distinguished by sequences in the 5' nontranslated region of the first exon. To determine which CG beta genes are active in vivo, we employed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. DNA complementary to RNA from placenta tissue and a choriocarcinoma cell line was subjected to polymerase chain reaction with CG beta-specific primers. The amplified DNA was cloned into M13 and sequenced. Most of steady-state CG beta mRNAs are transcribed from CG beta genes, 5, 3, and 8. The level of expression is beta 5 greater than beta 3 = beta 8 greater than beta 7, beta 1/2. Transcripts from the CG beta 1 and CG beta 2 genes, which were previously considered pseudogenes because of their noncanonical splice site, were detected. These CG beta transcripts arising from alternative splicing sites in the CG beta 1/2 genes were also detected in polysomes which suggests they are translation-competent. Northern blotting with a CG beta 1/2 probe revealed low amounts of CG beta 1/2 transcripts which were smaller than the transcripts of the other genes. The results indicate that at least five, and possibly all six, CG beta genes are transcribed in vivo, and at least one of them (CG beta 1 and/or CG beta 2) undergoes alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1589164600,"Menadione (MD; 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), a redox cycling quinone was shown to induce single (ss)- and double (ds)-strand DNA breaks in human MCF-7 cells. This DNA damage was mediated via the hydroxyl radical as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) studies utilizing the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide. The free radical production and DNA damage were shown to play a role in MD cytotoxicity as revealed by the reversal of MD toxicity and inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by exogenously added catalase. The role of NADPH quinone acceptor oxidoreductase in the metabolism of MD was evaluated. Purified quinone acceptor oxidoreductase in combination with MD resulted in the production of significant levels of the hydroxyl radical as measured by ESR. Dicumarol, an inhibitor of quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, decreased the production of the hydroxyl radical and attenuated DNA strand breaks in MCF-7 cells treated with MD."
https://openalex.org/W1571856798,"A high yield, photoactivated cross-linking reaction between a modified tRNA and RNase P RNA was used as a quantitative assay of substrate binding affinity. The cross-linking assay allows the effects of metal ions on substrate binding to be measured independently and in the absence of the pre-tRNA cleavage reaction. The results of this assay, in conjunction with the conventional cleavage assay, support the following conclusions about the nature of the RNase P RNA-tRNA binding interaction. (i) Monovalent cations act primarily to enhance enzyme-substrate binding, presumably by functioning as counterions. This enhancement can be attributed to a reduction in the tRNA off-rate. (ii) Although divalent cation is required for cleavage, the enzyme-substrate complex can form in the absence of divalent cation; the essential role of divalent cation in the reaction is thus catalytic. (iii) Ca2+ is as efficient as Mg2+ in promoting binding but supports catalysis only at a low rate."
https://openalex.org/W2100444545,"Previously, we described the stepwise translocation of a large amino-terminal fragment of apolipoprotein B (apo B15) in which the nascent secretory chain translocates through a series of distinct, nonintegrated transmembrane intermediates with large domains exposed to the cytoplasm. Thus, apo B15 appears to stop and restart translocation at several points. We have identified a sequence of amino acids in apo B15 that confers this behavior on a heterologous chimeric protein. In addition, we dissect pausing into two distinct steps, stopping and restarting, thereby trapping otherwise transient intermediates. Finally, we demonstrate the function of a second “pause transfer” sequence over 200 amino acids downstream in apo B15 that restarts translocation posttranslationally, suggesting that multiple pause transfer sequences are involved in the biogenesis of apolipoprotein B."
https://openalex.org/W1502136504,"The translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondrion, and the chloroplast has recently been shown to involve homologues of the highly conserved 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family. In this study, we have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA clone encoding a cognate 70-kDa heat shock protein of the spinach chloroplast envelope (SCE70). The cDNA insert is 2,535 base pairs long and codes for 653 amino acid residues of a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 71,731 daltons. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high degree of homology with HSP70 proteins from other organisms. Southern genomic and RNA analyses reveal different hybridization patterns than that observed for a heat-inducible 70-kDa protein gene. The protein synthesized from the SCE70 cDNA insert co-migrates with a 70-kDa polypeptide of the chloroplast envelope following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis and import studies indicate that SCE70 is associated with the chloroplast outer envelope. The import data suggest that SCE70 is targeted to the envelope membrane via a pathway different from other plastidic precursors but similar to that recently reported for outer envelope proteins SOE1 and OM14."
https://openalex.org/W1601211391,"Using the cDNA coding for the human interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR), the IFNAR gene has been physically mapped relative to the other loci of the chromosome 21q22.1 region. 32,906 base pairs covering the IFNAR gene have been cloned and sequenced. Primer extension and solution hybridization-ribonuclease protection have been used to determine that the transcription of the gene is initiated in a broad region of 20 base pairs. Some aspects of the polymorphism of the gene, including noncoding sequences, have been analyzed; some are allelic differences in the coding sequence that induce amino acid variations in the resulting protein. The exon structure of the IFNAR gene and of that of the available genes for the receptors of the cytokine/growth hormone/prolactin/interferon receptor family have been compared with the predictions for the secondary structure of those receptors. From this analysis, we postulate a common origin and propose an hypothesis for the divergence from the immunoglobulin superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1534202329,"Thymocyte-activating molecule (THAM) was initially characterized as a developmentally regulated, dimeric cell-surface molecule capable of activating mouse thymocytes and T lymphocytes upon monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated cross-linking. We recently obtained structural evidence indicating that this molecule is the mouse homologue of the human T cell-activating ectoenzyme CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV, DPP IV). We describe here the cloning and the characterization of THAM cDNA. Two clones (3.3 and 2.8 kilobases) were isolated. THAM-3.3 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2,280 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 760 amino acids having a calculated size of 87,500 Da. Complete N-glycosylation at each of the nine potential sites would result in a mature 110,000-Da molecule. Protein sequence comparisons revealed a significant homology (in particular in the COOH-terminal domain) between THAM and the rat or human DPP IV or the yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B molecules (92, 85, and 30% sequence identity, respectively). Structural comparison of serine proteases (i.e. acyl-amino acid hydrolase or prolyl endopeptidase) with the most conserved domain of THAM identified a stretch of 200 amino acids containing a putative catalytic triad arranged in a novel topological order (Ser-624, Asp-702, and His-734) thereby defining a subfamily of nonclassical serine proteases. Expression of THAM during thymus ontogeny was found to be mainly regulated at the transcriptional level as determined by RNase protection assay. To investigate directly some of the functions which have been ascribed to DPP IV, we transfected an ovalbumin/Aq-reactive, THAM- T hybridoma cell line with THAM-3.3 cDNA. The resultant transfectants acquired (i) DPP IV enzymatic activity that precisely paralleled the density of surface-expressed THAM; (ii) an Mr = 115,000 (reduced) and 110,000/128,000 (nonreduced) molecule that could be immunoprecipitated by the THAM-specific mAb H194-112; and (iii) the capacity of being triggered by this mAb to release interleukin-2. These data indicate that a single cDNA species can encode a multifunctional molecule (e.g. activation signal-transducing structure and ectopeptidase), the heterodimeric state of which very likely results from a differential post-translational modification of the same protein core."
https://openalex.org/W1572191397,"The hepatitis B virus envelope gene encodes three transmembrane proteins in frame; S, the product of S gene; M, the product of M (pre-S2 + S) gene; and L, the product of L (pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S) gene. Unlike the S and M proteins, attempts to efficiently synthesize L proteins and assemble them into L protein particles in various eukaryotic cells have been unsuccessful, probably because of the presence of the pre-S1 peptide with an unknown function which appears to be inhibitory to the host secretory apparatus. To investigate the role of the pre-S1 peptide, we constructed an L gene fused with a synthetic gene for chicken-lysozyme signal peptide (C-SIG) at the 5'-terminal and placed the resultant gene under the control of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter. After the fused-C-SIG peptide was correctly processed by the yeast secretory apparatus, a yeast transformant synthesized a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa at a level of 42% of the total soluble protein. Electron micrographic observation showed that the gene products assembled into 23-nm spherical and filamentous particles. The pre-S peptide of the gene product was deposited into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and well-glycosylated. It seemed that the gene products were accumulated as particles in certain specific membrane structures of the yeast secretory apparatus. Moreover, both the amount of mRNAs specific for the L gene and the in vivo stability of the synthesized L proteins did not change significantly by the addition of the C-SIG gene. These findings indicated that, if the pre-S1 peptide penetrates the ER membrane efficiently, the L proteins can be synthesized cotranslationally, translocate across the ER membrane with its S region, and then assemble by themselves into the particle form. Therefore, the pre-S1 peptide may involve weak or reduced signal peptide activity for recognition by the secretory apparatus and/or for the transport of the pre-S peptide into the ER lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1568159422,"We investigate the enzymatic basis for the inefficient extension of single base mismatches by DNA polymerase compared with the extension of correct base pairs. Inefficient mismatch extension could result from either a reduced binding of the enzyme to mispaired versus correctly paired DNA template-primer termini, or from a lowered intrinsic rate of extension of mispairs by a bound enzyme, or from a combination of both factors. Avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase is used to measure the affinities (equilibrium dissociation constants) for the four matched and twelve mismatched base pair configurations situated at a primer 3'-terminus. The binding affinities are analyzed by two different assays employing polyacrylamide gels. The first assay uses steady-state kinetics to measure the efficiency of elongating correct and incorrect base pairs and to evaluate the enzyme's dissociation constants for matched and mismatched termini. The estimated KD values obtained in the steady-state analysis fall within a range of approximately 0.1-20 nM. The efficiencies of extending two of the mispairs, G.G and C.C, are too low to allow a determination of KD by the kinetics method. The second assay uses equilibrium binding to measure the ratio of polymerase bound to matched compared with mismatched termini, KDright/KDwrong. The affinity ratios, including values for G.G and C.C mispairs, are in the range of about 0.4-4.2. While around 1 order of magnitude difference is observed in the relative binding affinities of the polymerase for matched and mismatched primer termini, the relative extension efficiencies vary over more than 5 orders of magnitude. Therefore, it appears that inefficient mismatch extension is caused primarily by a kinetic block inhibiting elongation from mispaired primer 3'-termini rather than to a difference in binding."
https://openalex.org/W1511209598,"The response of endothelial cells to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is complex, involving the induction and suppression of multiple genes and gene products. Differential screening of a TNF-stimulated, cycloheximide-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cell library has resulted in the cloning of several novel cDNAs whose protein products are involved in the primary response of the endothelium to TNF. One of these cDNAs, designated B12, is further characterized here. B12 is encoded by a 3.5-kilobase transcript and is induced rapidly and transiently by TNF. Transcript expression is found to be developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with B12 message being differentially expressed in the heart and liver during mouse embryogenesis. The open reading frame of B12 predicts a 316-amino acid sequence rich in charged residues, particularly at the carboxyl terminus, and has neither significant homology to other known proteins nor to any extent sequence motifs. B12 is found to be a highly conserved single-copy gene which is located in the q22----q23 region of human chromosome 17. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a large portion of the B12 open reading frame immunoprecipitate a 36-kilodalton polypeptide from wheat germ lysates programmed to translate in vitro transcribed B12 mRNA. The B12 protein is further shown to be induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by TNF, and the protein is shown to be rapidly degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2096316556,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasians, primarily affecting epithelial tissues of the lung and gut. Mutations in a single gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), are responsible for this disease. Whether a physiological defect exists in the immune system of CF patients has remained controversial. A chloride ion transport defect has been described in human CF-derived lymphocytes; however, it has not been possible to detect CFTR mRNA in lymphocytes. We report here that normal human B-lymphoblasts display whole cell Cl- conductances induced by calcium-mediated pathways, volume regulation, and cAMP which are equivalent to currents described in epithelial cells. B-lymphoblasts from CF-affected humans demonstrated defective Cl- conductance regulation by cAMP but preserved regulation by calcium-mediated and volume regulation mechanisms. CFTR involvement in cAMP regulation of Cl- conductance in lymphocytes is further supported by our demonstration of the presence of appropriately spliced CFTR mRNA segments in human B and T lymphocytes as detected by an optimized reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction approach. The identity of the amplified products was confirmed by hybridization to CFTR-specific probes and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the 3'-end of the gene was found in a T cell cDNA library. We conclude that CFTR mRNA is expressed in lymphocytes, consistent with the cAMP regulation of chloride transport present in normal lymphocytes but defective in CF-derived lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1499325546,"Phage T5 injects its DNA into Escherichia coli cells in two steps; 8% of the chromosome is first injected, and then there is a pause during which proteins encoded by this DNA fragment are synthesized allowing the remaining DNA to be injected. Using a potassium-selective electrode, we show that the injection of the two DNA fragments is associated with an efflux in two steps, of cytoplasmic potassium. The rate of efflux is linearly related to the number of added phages suggesting that each phage induces the formation of at least one channel in the inner membrane. The first efflux occurs even in depolarized cells suggesting that the insertion and the opening of the channel can take place in the absence of the electrochemical gradient of protons (delta mu H+). The channel is in a closed configuration during the time required for the synthesis of the phage-encoded proteins; this closing and the second efflux are prevented by the depolarization of the cell. The insertion of the channel in the inner membrane requires a fluid membrane. The results obtained suggest that the function of this channel is to translocate phage T5 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1514821046,"Human erythrocyte tropomodulin is a novel tropomyosin regulatory protein that binds to the end of erythrocyte tropomyosin and blocks heat-to-tail association of tropomyosin along actin filaments. It has been proposed to play a role in modulating the association of tropomyosin with the spectrin-actin complex in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Immunoscreening of a human fetal liver cDNA expression library in lambda gt11, followed by 5'-end extension by polymerase chain reaction from the same library, yielded a composite cDNA sequence of 2665 base pairs (bp). It contains a 34-bp 5'-untranslated region, a 1.6-kilobase (kb) 3'-untranslated region, and a complete open reading frame of 1077 bp that encodes a protein of 359 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kDa and a pI of 4.8. Authenticity of the tropomodulin cDNA was confirmed by a complete sequence match of 49 predicted amino acids with the sequences of three tryptic peptides of the erythrocyte tropomodulin. The sequence has no internal repeats and no significant homology with any known proteins. Secondary structure predictions indicate that tropomodulin may consist of a series of seven or eight short alpha-helical segments and fold into a somewhat compact shape. The tropomyosin binding activity has been mapped to an N-terminal region containing residues 39-138. Nine independent PCR clones, five from a human reticulocyte cDNA library and four from the fetal liver cDNA library, revealed identical N-terminal 103 amino acids, suggesting that the sequence reported here may also be of erythrocyte tropomodulin. Northern analysis of human reticulocyte RNA showed two hybridizing bands of 2.7 and 1.6 kb, indicating that the 2665-bp cDNA sequence reported here was that of the longer transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1559723998,"Submandibular gland-A (SMG-A) is a major secretory product of the neonatal rat submandibular gland but is not synthesized by the acinar cells of the adult gland. The leucine-rich protein is a predominant product of the adult rat parotid gland. Preliminary data had indicated that the leucine-rich protein and SMG-A might be identical proteins whose expression was differently regulated in the parotid and submandibular salivary glands. cDNA clones encoding SMG-A and the leucine-rich protein were identified by homology to a major mouse parotid gland product, parotid secretory protein (PSP), and characterized. The leucine-rich protein shares extensive sequence homology with mouse PSP throughout its 5'-untranslated, protein coding and 3'-untranslated regions, prompting our suggestion that it should henceforth be referred to as rat PSP. SMG-A is more divergent, having greatest identity with rat and mouse PSP in its signal peptide and 3'-untranslated sequences. Transcripts homologous to SMG-A and rat PSP, but more closely related to SMG-A, were identified in rat sublingual gland by Northern blot analysis. These findings indicate that rat SMG-A and PSP arise from alternatively regulated members of a multigene family."
https://openalex.org/W1533254395,"A controversy has surrounded the questions of whether or not guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is a specific inhibitor of bacterial rRNA and tRNA synthesis, especially during normal exponential growth, and whether the RNA polymerase is the target of ppGpp action. To answer these questions, a pBR322-derived plasmid, pKT28, was constructed that carries the Escherichia coli relA gene encoding a ppGpp synthetase under control of the lacUV5 promoter. The plasmid was used to transform the ppGpp reporter strain VH271 in which expression of beta-galactosidase from an rrnB P1 promoter is inhibited by ppGpp. In the presence of high concentrations of lac inducer, bacteria of the transformed strain accumulate ppGpp with the result that synthesis of rRNA and beta-galactosidase is inhibited and growth ceases. At low concentrations of inducer, growth is only reduced and cells form small white colonies on X-gal indicator plates. After continued incubation, these colonies form blue sectors of faster growing mutant cells. Phage P1 transduction experiments showed that these mutants have mutations cotransducing with rpoB, the gene encoding the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase. One particular mutant strain, KT13, had acquired partial resistance to ppGpp inhibition of rRNA synthesis. The mutation in this strain was cloned by in vivo recombination into an rpoB plasmid. The presence of this plasmid conferred increased resistance to overproduction of ppGpp. These results suggest that ppGpp is a specific inhibitor of rRNA synthesis, even in the absence of amino acid starvation, and that RNA polymerase is involved as the target of ppGpp action."
https://openalex.org/W1961301813,"The interaction of vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin III (VN.TAT) complex with endothelial cells (EC) was investigated. Binding was specific and time- and concentration-dependent. Kinetics revealed an apparent dissociation constant of 16 nM and 1.7 x 10(5) binding sites/endothelial cell. The binding determinant of the ternary complex was located on the VN moiety. Since the association of VN to TAT adds its specific properties to the VN.TAT complex, the involvement of the heparin binding domain and the cell attachment site of VN was investigated. Neither addition of RGD peptide nor blocking of the vitronectin receptor with a monoclonal antibody interfered with VN.TAT binding to EC. Addition of heparin, a VN-derived peptide comprising two heparin binding consensus sequences or a monoclonal antibody directed against the heparin binding domain on VN, completely inhibited VN.TAT binding to EC. These results indicate that the interaction is mediated through the heparin binding domain of VN. Digestion of heparan sulfate proteoglycans resulted in a decrease of VN.TAT binding to EC, indicating the involvement of heparin-like structures on the EC surface. Our findings point to an unrecognized mechanism by which VN may act as scavenger in order to enhance the clearance of end products of the clotting system via binding of the ternary VN.TAT complex to the luminal surface of EC."
https://openalex.org/W1548761791,"An 83-amino acid cholecystokinin peptide with a sulfated tyrosine and an amidated carboxyl terminus (CCK-83) was purified from human intestinal mucosa. The purified peptide was chemically characterized, and its bioactivity was compared to CCK-8. Several post-translational processing steps such as cleavage at basic residues, sulfation, and amidation are necessary to form biologically active cholecystokinin from its nascent prepropeptide. The discovery of CCK-83 gives new insight into the order of preprohormone processing. The processing of prepro-CCK appears to be in the order of: 1) signal peptidase cleavage, 2) tyrosine sulfation, 3) cleavage after a carboxyl-terminal pair of basic residues, 4) carboxypeptidase B-like cleavage of these basic residues, 5) amidation (which results in the formation of CCK-83), and 6) cleavage at monobasic residues by endopeptidases (which results in the smaller molecular forms of cholecystokinin). The characterization of biologically active CCK-83 with a sulfated tyrosine and an amidated carboxyl terminus establishes the site of signal peptidase action and suggests an order of post-translational modifications that give rise to the various molecular forms of cholecystokinin."
https://openalex.org/W1544124378,"Like mechanical load in vivo, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) selectively provokes cardiac expression of fetal genes including skeletal alpha-actin (SkA). Antithetically, acidic FGF (aFGF) suppresses SkA transcription. To define sites controlling SkA transcription in cardiac muscle cells, rat cardiac myocytes were transfected with internal-deletion and block-substitution mutations in the SkA promoter, including three motifs resembling the fos serum response element (SRE). The upstream, central, and proximal SREs each contributed to basal expression in cardiac myocytes. To determine whether identical elements mediate induction by bFGF versus inhibition by aFGF, the proximal SRE (SRE1) and fos SRE were positioned upstream from a neutral promoter. In cardiac myocytes, both the SRE1 and fos SRE were expressed at levels up to one-third that of the SkA promoter (nucleotides -202 to -11). Neither was expressed in quiescent cardiac fibroblasts. bFGF augmented SRE1-CAT activity, whereas aFGF produced no change; the fos SRE was induced by both. The transcriptional and mitogenic actions of aFGF were contingent on the presence of a putative nuclear translocation motif. Thus 1) the SkA SRE1 and fos SRE each suffice for tissue specificity in cardiac myocytes; 2) unlike the c-fos SRE, the SkA SRE1 is induced selectively by bFGF yet not aFGF; 3) sequences alternative or in addition to the SRE1 are obligatory for aFGF to suppress the SkA promoter; and 4) possible differences in intracellular localization are one basis for divergent actions of aFGF and bFGF in cardiac muscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W1556062727,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by tumor-promoting phorbol esters leads to the phosphorylation of an 80-kilodalton PKC substrate (known as MARCKS) in murine fibroblasts. In BALB/c 3T3 cells stably transformed by v-Src, phorbol esters were unable to induce phosphorylation of MARCKS. Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assays showed that both PKC protein levels and kinase activity were unchanged in v-Src-transformed relative to the parental nontransformed BALB/c 3T3 cells. However, MARCKS protein levels were reduced in v-Src-transformed cells relative to nontransformed cells. MARCKS RNA levels were also correspondingly reduced in v-Src-transformed cells. Nuclear run-on assays showed decreased transcription of MARCKS in v-Src-transformed cells. Thus, the absence of MARCKS in v-Src-transformed cells could be explained by a down-regulation of MARCKS transcription. Inhibiting the protein tyrosine kinase activity of v-Src with herbimycin A restored MARCKS RNA levels, MARCKS transcription, and MARCKS protein, suggesting that down-regulation of MARCKS in v-Src-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells is a direct effect of v-Src."
https://openalex.org/W1541868958,"The translocation of the alpha subunits of Gs from the membrane to the cytosol by iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, was studied in mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells. In the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), iloprost stimulated the adenylate cyclase activity, caused the release of both 42- and 45-kDa proteins reactive with the anti Gs alpha carboxyl-terminal antibody, RM/1, from the membrane and attenuated cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the 42- and 45-kDa proteins in the membrane. The iloprost-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and release of Gs alpha from the membrane were markedly suppressed by RM/1. Cholera toxin treatment also stimulated the adenylate cyclase activity and release of Gs alpha from the membrane, and iloprost synergistically potentiated these actions of cholera toxin. In mastocytoma cells, iloprost induced the translocation of both 42- and 45-kDa Gs alpha from the membrane to the cytosol, 45-kDa Gs alpha remaining in the cytosol for a longer time than 42- kDa Gs alpha. Whereas 42-kDa Gs alpha in the cytosol was eluted at the position of Mr = approximately 40,000 45-kDa Gs alpha was eluted at the position of Mr = approximately 120,000 from a Superose 12 gel filtration column. In contrast, both 42- and 45-kDa Gs alpha released in vitro from the membrane by iloprost plus GTP gamma S were eluted at the position of Mr = approximately 40,000, but only 45-kDa Gs alpha was eluted at the position of Mr = approximately 120,000 when it was incubated with cytosol. These results taken together demonstrate that iloprost induces the translocation of both 42- and 45-kDa Gs alpha from the membrane to the cytosol and that only the 45-kDa Gs alpha released exists in the cytosol as a soluble complex with unidentified component(s) in mastocytoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587775583,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) synergistically suppress activities of the promoter and enhancer of the human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells as analyzed by transient transfection assays using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as a reporter. In contrast to the AFP gene, albumin promoter and enhancer activities were not affected by EGF and TPA. Unexpectedly, however, Northern blot analysis revealed that the albumin mRNA level as well as the AFP mRNA level were reduced by treatment with EGF and TPA. We propose that in HuH-7 cells, the AFP enhancer stimulates the albumin promoter as well as the AFP promoter; and consequently, inhibition of the AFP enhancer by EGF and TPA results in reduction of both AFP and albumin mRNA levels. The significance of the involvement of the AFP enhancer in albumin transcription is discussed in relation to the inverse pattern of expression of the AFP and albumin genes in neonatal growth."
https://openalex.org/W1562856445,"When quiescent cells are stimulated to enter the cell cycle, the thymidine kinase (TK) gene is transcriptionally activated at the border of G1 and S. In this report we show that the human TK promoter contains multiple protein-binding sites. By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a protein-binding site on the human TK promoter required for conferring G1-S-regulated transcription to a heterologous promoter and dissociated it functionally from an adjacent protein-binding domain containing an inverted CCAAT motif required for high basal level expression. Substitution-mutation of this site results in constitutive expression of the neo reporter gene in serum-stimulated fibroblasts, as well as in cells arrested in mid-G1 by a temperature-sensitive mutation. The regulatory domains for the human TK promoter exhibit interesting symmetrical features, including a set of CCAAT motifs and sites similar to the novel Yi protein-binding site recently discovered in the mouse TK promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2128366287,"Factors which stimulate the release of von Willebrand factor (vWf) from endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies and which induce the expression of the leukocyte-binding adhesion molecule P-selectin (PADGEM, GMP-140, CD62) on the endothelial cell surface remain incompletely characterized. Fibrin but not fibrinogen is a potent stimulus for the release of stored von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells. Removal of fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen occurs during the formation of fibrin, and the removal of fibrinopeptide B is a requirement for fibrin to induce vWf secretion. The cleavage of fibrinopeptide A by reptilase enzyme forms a fibrin gel yet it is incapable of stimulating Weibel-Palade body degranulation. As a consequence of removing fibrinopeptide B, B beta 15-42 becomes the new NH2 terminus of the beta chain of fibrin. We have shown that the peptide B beta 15-42 in solution inhibits the release of vWf stimulated by fibrin. In addition, B beta 15-42 coupled to ovalbumin supports the binding and spreading of endothelial cells, while a scrambled form of this peptide coupled to the same carrier does not. We investigated whether these determinants near the amino terminus of the beta chain of fibrin bind to a specific protein on the surface of endothelial cells. A 130-kDa protein was isolated from surface-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells by specific binding to B beta 15-42 immobilized on Sepharose. This glycoprotein was eluted with the B beta 15-42 peptide in solution but not with the scrambled form of this peptide. The fibrin-derived peptides B beta 19-26 and B beta 37-56-cysteine were also incapable of eluting the 130-kDa protein bound to immobilized B beta 15-42 as were the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine RGDS tetrapeptide and EDTA. The 130-kDa protein is recognized neither by antibodies to the known integrins found on endothelial cells nor by antibodies to CD31 (endoCAM, PECAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin family of receptors found on endothelial cells. The beta chain of fibrin thus contains a sequence near its amino terminus which specifically binds to what is likely a novel endothelial cell surface protein. This glycoprotein may promote endothelial cell adhesion to fibrin during the wound healing process and is a candidate for a receptor involved in fibrin-mediated release of Weibel-Palade bodies from endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1503477521,"Incubation of isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats with 20 mM LiCl for 1 h decreased glucose production from lactate, pyruvate, and alanine. In addition, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression in FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells was inhibited by treatment with LiCl. Lithium was also able to counteract the increased PEPCK mRNA levels caused by both Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone, in a concentration-dependent manner. A chimeric gene containing the PEPCK promoter (-550 to +73) linked to the amino-3-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) structural gene was transduced into FTO-2B cells using a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus. In these infected cells, 20 mM LiCl decreased both the concentration of neo mRNA transcribed from the PEPCK-neo chimeric gene and mRNA from the endogenous PEPCK gene. Lithium also inhibited the stimulatory effect of Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone on both genes. The stability of neo mRNA was not altered by lithium, since in cells infected with retrovirus containing only the neo gene transcribed via the retroviral 5'-LTR and treated with 20 mM LiCl, no change in neo mRNA levels was observed. The intraperitoneal administration of LiCl to rats caused a decrease in hepatic PEPCK mRNA, indicating that lithium could also modify gene expression in vivo. The effects of lithium were not due to an increase in the concentration of insulin in the blood but were correlated with an increase in hepatic glycogen and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. These results indicate that lithium ions, at concentrations normally used therapeutically for depression in humans, can inhibit glucose synthesis in the liver by a mechanism which can selectively modify the expression of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase."
https://openalex.org/W1548240869,"Binding of the adhesive ligand fibrinogen and the monoclonal antibody PAC1 to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa is dependent on cell activation and inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing peptides. Previously, we identified a sequence in a hypervariable region of PAC1 (mu-CDR3) that mimics the activity of the antibody. Here we examine whether monoclonal antibodies to this idiotypic determinant in PAC1 can mimic GP IIb-IIIa by binding to fibrinogen. Mice were immunized with a peptide derived from the mu-CDR3 of PAC1. Four antibodies were obtained that recognized fibrinogen as well as a recombinant form of the variable region of PAC1. However, they did not bind to other RGD-containing proteins, including von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Several studies suggested that these anti-PAC1 peptide antibodies were specific for GP IIb-IIIa recognition sites in fibrinogen. Three such sites have been proposed: two RGD-containing regions in the A alpha chain, and the COOH terminus of the gamma chain (gamma 400-411). Two of the antibodies inhibited fibrinogen binding to activated platelets, and all four antibodies bound to the fibrinogen A alpha chain on immunoblots. Antibody binding to immobilized fibrinogen was partially inhibited by monoclonal antibodies specific for the two A alpha chain RGD regions. However, the anti-PAC1 peptide antibodies also bound to plasmin-derived fibrinogen fragments X and D100, which contain gamma 400-411 but lack one or both A alpha RGD regions. This binding was inhibited by an antibody specific for gamma 400-411. When fragment D100 was converted to D80, which lacks gamma 400-411, antibody binding was reduced significantly (p less than 0.01). Electron microscopy of fibrinogen-antibody complexes confirmed that each antibody could bind to sites on the A alpha and gamma chains. These studies demonstrate that certain anti-PAC1 peptide antibodies mimic GP IIb-IIIa by binding to platelet recognition sites in fibrinogen. Furthermore, they suggest that the gamma 400-411 region of fibrinogen may exist in a conformation similar to that of an A alpha RGD region of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1838141821,"An expression vector for bovine NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was constructed from two DNA fragments that were derived from beef liver poly(A+) RNA using the polymerase chain reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 3 lysine residues of the reductase, previously implicated in the formation of active-site charge pairs with carboxylate residues of cytochrome b5, was then used to obtain the purified catalytic domains of flavoproteins modified at each of these sites. The observed marked decreases in catalytic efficiencies of substitutions of a negative charge at the normally positively charged residues with the catalytic domain of cytochrome b5 are consistent with their participation in the formation of charge pairs with carboxylate groups of the hemeprotein to optimize rapid electron transfer from the reductase flavin to the heme of the cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1527581446,"Co-expression of cytokeratin (CK) pairs has been found to be associated with specific epithelial cell types whose expressions are developmentally regulated. In the prostate, CK 8 and 18 have been identified as luminal cell-specific markers, and CK 5 and 15 have been identified as basal cell-specific markers. In this study, we report the cloning and sequencing of a full-length CK 8 cDNA (1.9 kilobases) from a rat ventral prostate (VP) cDNA library. Although the open reading frame shares 90% homology with mouse CK 8 sequences, nucleotide comparison revealed that rat CK 8 cDNA comprises a species-specific sequence on both 5' and 3' ends. The steady-state levels of CK 8 mRNA were elevated in VP, seminal vesicle (SV), and liver of a castrated rat but not in the other organs such as the coagulating gland, bladder, and thymus. Unlike the other androgen-repressed genes, elevated CK 8 mRNA levels persisted even after the glandular involution was completed, indicating that CK 8 is a new class of androgen-repressed gene. The regression of CK 8 expression may be androgen receptor-mediated, since androgen but not estrogen administration to castrated hosts repressed the CK 8 mRNA levels, and this effect can be antagonized by the simultaneous administration of an antiandrogen (4-hydroxyflutamide). Immunohistochemical staining of prostatic tissues reveals that the CK 8 filamentous structure is shifted reversibly from a uniform distribution to a predominantly basal surface upon androgen deprivation. We noted that the steady-state levels of CK 8 protein remain rather constant throughout the various hormonal treatment, and the steady-state levels of CK 8 mRNA and the rate of CK 8 protein synthesis are consistently elevated. These results suggest that the turnover rate of CK 8 protein may be elevated in the prostatic epithelium from the castrated host. Similarly, the steady-state levels of CK 15 and 18 mRNA in VP and SV are also repressed in an androgen-dependent manner. These data, taken together, indicate that pairwise control of luminal (and possibly basal) specific cytokeratin gene expression remains intact in both VP and SV tissues and that the levels of CK mRNAs expression are negatively regulated by androgen."

https://openalex.org/W1600537272,"A human pancreas-specific protein (PASP), previously characterized as a serum marker for acute pancreatitis and pancreatic graft rejection, has been identified as pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B (PCPB). cDNAs encoding PASP/PCPB were isolated from a human pancreas cDNA library using a combination of nucleic acid hybridization screening and immunoscreening with antisera raised against native PASP. The deduced amino acid sequence of PASP/PCPB cDNA predicts the translation of a 416-amino acid preproenzyme with a 15-amino acid signal/leader peptide and a 95-amino acid activation peptide. The proenzyme portion of this protein has 76% identity with rat PCPB and 84% identity with bovine carboxypeptidase B. DNA and RNA blot analyses indicate that human PCPB mRNA (1,400 nucleotides) is transcribed from a single locus in the human genome in a tissue-specific fashion. N-terminal sequencing of native PASP and the specific immunoreactivity of bacterially expressed PASP/PCPB with native PASP antibodies confirm the identification of PASP as human pancreatic PCPB."
https://openalex.org/W1529962599,Thyroglobulin secreted in the medium by Fisher rat thyroid line-5 (FRTL-5) cells cultured in the presence of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) shows a slower electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a higher density position in a CsCl gradient than thyroglobulin secreted by FRTL-5 cells cultured in the absence of TSH for 5-7 days. Such a TSH effect is much less or not evident when secreted thyroglobulin is digested with peptide N-glycohydrolase F or when intracellular thyroglobulin is compared. Intracellular thyroglobulin migrates faster than thyroglobulin secreted either in the presence or in the absence of TSH. Evaluation of the mannose and galactose content of thyroglobulin demonstrates that intracellular thyroglobulin has more mannose and less galactose than extracellular thyroglobulin; it also shows that TSH decreases the mannose content of thyroglobulin while increasing its galactose content. Bio-Gel P6 chromatography shows that TSH increases the complex type carbohydrate chains while decreasing the high mannose chains in the secreted thyroglobulin. High mannose type oligosaccharides were characterized by atom bombardment-mass spectrometry analysis. Treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 microM) of FRTL-5 cells cultured with or without TSH causes the appearance of a fast migrating form of thyroglobulinin in the culture medium. Bio-Gel P6 chromatography shows that A23187 causes a dramatic decrease of the complex carbohydrate chains of the secreted thyroglobulin.
https://openalex.org/W1507963528,"We have shown previously that the stable overproduction of protein kinase C beta I (cPKC beta I) in rat 6 (R6) embryo fibroblasts results in multiple cellular growth abnormalities. To characterize the pathways through which cPKC beta I acts to exert its effects, we have undertaken a biochemical analysis of the cell line R6-PKC3. The subcellular distribution of cPKC beta I in unstimulated R6-PKC3 cells was approximately 80% cytosolic and approximately 20% membrane bound, and treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in translocation and down-regulation of an appreciable fraction of the cPKC beta I enzyme. However, long term TPA treatment was not sufficient to down-regulate all of the overproduced enzyme from both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Two-dimensional gel analysis of 32P-labeled cellular phosphoproteins from either untreated or TPA-treated cultures revealed only minor qualitative differences between R6-PKC3 cells and a vector control cell line, R6-C1. On the other hand, several quantitative differences in the level of phosphorylation of discrete protein spots were seen. The most prominent phosphoprotein was a previously described 80/87-kDa protein designated MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate). Compared with R6-C1 cells, R6-PKC3 cells exhibited a 2-3-fold increase in the basal level of phosphorylation of MARCKS and after treatment with TPA, displayed a dramatic prolongation in phosphorylation of this protein. Additionally, treatment of R6-PKC3 cells with TPA led to a prolonged increase in both the cytosolic and total cellular level of the MARCKS protein and a pronounced decrease in the level of MARCKS mRNA. Taken together, these results indicate that overproduction of cPKC beta I markedly alters several parameters of the MARCKS protein which may be responsible, at least in part, for the altered phenotype of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536947266,"Abstract A cation channel has been identified in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle that oscillates open and closed in a regular manner. In an experimental system of patch-clamped reconstituted plasma membrane in phospholipid bilayers, the oscillations are calcium-dependent and constitute regular closing events due to inhibition of the channel by calcium with a Ki of 2.2 +/- 1 x 10(-6) M, followed by reopening. There are 3.7 +/- 1 calcium binding sites/channel. With sodium as the current vehicle, conductance is increased by voltage, insulin (Km = 5 +/- 0.6 x 10(-9) M), and hydrolyzable guanine nucleotides. Cyclic GMP alone with increase the conductance with a Km of 3.7 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) M. In the absence of calcium, the unitary conductance with insulin + GTP or cGMP at 150 mM NaCl is 153 picosiemens. Sodium current is insensitive to 10(-5) M tetrodotoxin but inhibited by mu-conotoxin (Ki = 5 x 10(-8) M). These findings in the reconstituted system were verified in patch-clamped whole muscle cells where an insulin and cGMP-dependent sodium current inhibited by mu-conotoxin could be demonstrated. In the whole cell experiments, slow calcium-dependent oscillations of the sodium current were also detected."
https://openalex.org/W1604606786,"The reaction of Co(II)bleomycin with dioxygen has been investigated. Dioxygen binds to the Co(II) complex within the time of mixing according to electron spin resonance and uv-visible spectroscopy and dioxygen analysis. Then, two dioxygenated cobalt centers react, releasing 1 mol of O2 and forming an intermediate characterized by a few highly shifted 1H NMR resonances and loss of the ESR spectrum. This is thought to be a dioxygen-bridged dimer of cobalt bleomycin molecules. Time-dependent absorbance and dioxygen measurements yield the same second order rate constant for this step of the reaction. According to uv-visible and NMR spectral analysis, the intermediate decays into diamagnetic products in a first order rate process. High performance liquid chromatography and 1H NMR studies demonstrate that the product contains two bleomycin species of equal concentration. One component is Co(III)bleomycin, designated Form II. The other is the peroxide adduct of Co(III)bleomycin, Form I, as determined by direct determination of hydrogen peroxide, which is slowly released from the product at low pH. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide is readily detected during the reaction of Co(II)Blm with O2. In isolation, Form I is unstable at pH 7 and is converted within 24 h into a mixture of Form I and Form II."
https://openalex.org/W2132705424,"The aerobic oxidation of Co(II)bleomycin bound to calf thymus DNA has been investigated in relation to the mechanism of reaction in solution in the absence of DNA. Kinetics of dioxygenation of the Co(II) complex were followed by spectrophotometric and electron spin resonance spectroscopy as well as dioxygen analysis. The reaction is slower than when carried out in solution; its rate is inversely related to the ratio of DNA base pairs to Co(II)bleomycin. The subsequent oxidation reaction, observed spectrophotometrically and by dioxygen analysis, is second order in cobalt complex. The calculated second order rate constant is also inversely related to the base pair to metal complex ratio. Once this ratio exceeds three, the reaction rate slows significantly with each additional increment of DNA added to the starting reaction mixture. Taking advantage of the high stability of O(2)-Co(II)bleomycin bound to greater than a 3-fold excess of DNA base pairs, it could be demonstrated that the rate constant for oxidation of two O(2)-Co(II)bleomycin molecules is much slower than that for O(2)-Co(II)bleomycin plus Co(II)bleomycin. With the same technique it was observed that the metal centers of O(2)-Co(II)bleomycin and Fe(II)bleomycin also undergo oxidation. The binding to DNA of both solution products of the oxidation of Co(II)bleomycin by O2 was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Peroxy-Co(III)bleomycin, Form I, binds with higher affinity than Co(III)bleomycin, Form II. At lower ionic strength, the size of the DNA binding site for each form is about 2 base pairs/molecule of drug."
https://openalex.org/W1634153810,"Alginate is believed to be a major virulence factor in the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. Guanosine diphospho-D-mannose dehydrogenase (GDPmannose dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.132) is a key enzyme in the alginate biosynthetic pathway which catalyzes the oxidation of guanosine diphospho-D-mannose (GDP-D-mannose) to GDP-D-mannuronic acid. In this paper, we report the structural analysis of GMD by limited proteolysis using three different proteases, trypsin, submaxillary Arg-C protease, and chymotrypsin. Treatment of GMD with these proteases indicated that the amino-terminal part of this enzyme may fold into a structural domain with an apparent molecular mass of 25-26 kDa. Multiple proteolytic cleavage sites existed at the carboxyl-terminal end of this domain, indicating that this segment may represent an exposed region of the protein. Initial proteolysis also generated a carboxyl-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 16-17 kDa which was further digested into smaller fragments by trypsin and chymotrypsin. The proteolytic cleavage sites were localized by partial amino-terminal sequencing of the peptide fragments. Arg-295 was identified as the initial cleavage site for trypsin and Tyr-278 for chymotrypsin. Catalytic activity of GMD was totally abolished by the initial cleavage. However, binding of the substrate, GDP-D-mannose, increased stability toward proteolysis and inhibited the loss of enzyme activity. GMP and GDP (guanosine 5'-mono- and diphosphates) also blocked the initial cleavage, but NAD and mannose showed no effect. These results suggest that binding of the guanosine moiety at the catalytic site of GMD may induce a conformational change that reduces the accessibility of the cleavage sites to proteases. Binding of [14C]GDP-D-mannose to the amino-terminal domain was not affected by the removal of the carboxyl-terminal 16-kDa fragment. Furthermore, photoaffinity labeling of GMD with [32P]arylazido-beta-alanine-NAD followed by proteolysis demonstrated that the radioactive NAD was covalently linked to the amino-terminal domain. These observations imply that the amino-terminal domain (25-26 kDa) contains both the substrate and cofactor binding sites. However, the carboxyl-terminal fragment (16-17 kDa) may possess amino acid residues essential for catalysis. Thus, proteolysis had little effect on substrate binding, but totally eliminated catalysis. These biochemical data are in complete agreement with amino acid sequence analysis for the existence of substrate and cofactor sites of GMD. A linear peptide map of GMD was constructed for future structure/functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1550071037,"The redundant genetic codons NNU and NNC (where N is A, T, G, or C) specify the same amino acid and are decoded by their cognate tRNAs, which contain either a guanosine or a modified base in the wobble position of the anticodons. Since tRNAs with an adenosine in the wobble position of the anticodon, which are complementary to the NNU codons, are not found naturally, we have generated a tRNA(Phe) with AAA anticodon and examined how an adenosine in the wobble position would affect its biological function in Escherichia coli. We found that the tRNA(Phe) with GAA anticodon (wild-type) repressed the expression of the pheA gene via tRNA(Phe)-mediated attenuation of transcription, whereas the tRNA(Phe) with AAA anticodon did not influence the expression of the pheA gene. Furthermore, elevated levels of tRNA(Phe)(AAA) did not support the growth of an E. coli strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the pheS gene at 42 degrees C. Since the presence of a multicopy plasmid carrying the gene that encodes tRNA(Phe)(GAA), a substrate for phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase, enables the E. coli strain carrying the pheS(Ts) mutation to grow at 42 degrees C, the above observation suggests that unlike tRNA(Phe)(GAA), tRNA(Phe)(AAA) is not a good substrate for phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. Therefore, we postulate that the presence of adenosine at the wobble position of anticodons was specifically eliminated and the tRNAs with guanosine or a modified base in the wobble position were selected to decode both NNU and NNC codons in E. coli."
