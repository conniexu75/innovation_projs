https://openalex.org/W3109998099,"Time and intimacy drive transmission A minority of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmit most infections. How does this happen? Sun et al. reconstructed transmission in Hunan, China, up to April 2020. Such detailed data can be used to separate out the relative contribution of transmission control measures aimed at isolating individuals relative to population-level distancing measures. The authors found that most of the secondary transmissions could be traced back to a minority of infected individuals, and well over half of transmission occurred in the presymptomatic phase. Furthermore, the duration of exposure to an infected person combined with closeness and number of household contacts constituted the greatest risks for transmission, particularly when lockdown conditions prevailed. These findings could help in the design of infection control policies that have the potential to minimize both virus transmission and economic strain. Science , this issue p. eabe2424"
https://openalex.org/W3104955345,"Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5' extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development."
https://openalex.org/W3103254795,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a global health crisis, and yet our understanding of the disease and potential treatment options remains limited. The infection occurs through binding of the virus with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane. Here, we established a screening strategy to identify drugs that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiac cells and lung organoids. Target analysis of hit compounds revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with antiandrogenic drugs reduced ACE2 expression and protected hESC-derived lung organoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, clinical data on COVID-19 patients demonstrated that prostate diseases, which are linked to elevated androgen, are significant risk factors and that genetic variants that increase androgen levels are associated with higher disease severity. These findings offer insights on the mechanism of disproportionate disease susceptibility in men and identify antiandrogenic drugs as candidate therapeutics for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3109446039,"This study evaluates the impacts of renewable energy, environmental taxes, environmental technology, and financial development on carbon emissions in OECD economies from 1995 to 2015 by employing system-GMM and quantile regression approaches. Our empirical analysis indicates that environmental tax negatively affects carbon emissions; economic growth impedes environmental quality by increasing carbon emissions. Further, renewable energy consumption, environmental technology, and financial development improve environmental quality by decreasing carbon emissions. We suggest that changes in policymaking to promote sustainable economic growth and environmental quality should be prevent environmental degradation, but also inspire greater investments in new technologies and energy expertise in the renewables industry."
https://openalex.org/W3106672018,"Homeostatic plasticity is hypothesized to bidirectionally regulate neuronal activity around a stable set point to compensate for learning-related plasticity, but to date only upward firing rate homeostasis (FRH) has been demonstrated in vivo. We combined chronic electrophysiology in freely behaving animals with an eye-reopening paradigm to enhance firing in primary visual cortex (V1) and found that neurons bidirectionally regulate firing rates around an individual set point. Downward FRH did not require N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signaling and was associated with homeostatic scaling down of synaptic strengths. Like upward FRH, downward FRH was gated by arousal state but in the opposite direction: it occurred during sleep, not during wake. In contrast, firing rate depression associated with Hebbian plasticity happened independently of sleep and wake. Thus, sleep and wake states temporally segregate upward and downward FRH, which might prevent interference or provide unopposed homeostatic compensation when it is needed most."
https://openalex.org/W3108403662,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released from cancer cells and oncogenic mutations in ctDNA can be measured from plasma samples. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of mutations in ctDNA. We analyzed serial plasma samples (n = 80) from ten metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with a known KRAS mutation in their primary tumor. The patients were undergoing oncological treatment with bevacizumab in combination with alternating capecitabine and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Baseline ddPCR KRAS mutation allele frequency (MAF) values ranged from 0% to 63%. The first radiologic response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) evaluation was performed 45–63 days after the initiation of treatment, and by this time three patients had an undetectable level of KRAS mutation, one had a MAF value of 0.5%, and one had a MAF value of 3% that had been reduced by 95% from the baseline value. In three of these patients the RECIST assessment was stable disease and in two partial response. In seven patients, ddPCR MAF values increased before radiological disease progression or death, while one patient remained disease-free with an undetectable KRAS mutation level. Next, we analyzed all available plasma samples with the Idylla ctKRAS system (n = 60), and found that the overall degree of agreement between ddPCR and Idylla was almost perfect (kappa value = 0.860). We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect treatment-induced mutations in the last serial plasma sample of each patient, but were unable to find any new mutations when compared to the primary tumor. This study shows that ddPCR and Idylla are equally efficient for the detection of KRAS mutations in the liquid biopsies from mCRC patients and that ctDNA may indicate the disappearance of treatment responsive KRAS positive mCRC clones and serve as an early sign of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3110636648,"In order to analyze how a signal transduction network converts cellular inputs into cellular outputs, ideally one would measure the dynamics of many signals within the network simultaneously. We found that, by fusing a fluorescent reporter to a pair of self-assembling peptides, it could be stably clustered within cells at random points, distant enough to be resolved by a microscope but close enough to spatially sample the relevant biology. Because such clusters, which we call signaling reporter islands (SiRIs), can be modularly designed, they permit a set of fluorescent reporters to be efficiently adapted for simultaneous measurement of multiple nodes of a signal transduction network within single cells. We created SiRIs for indicators of second messengers and kinases and used them, in hippocampal neurons in culture and intact brain slices, to discover relationships between the speed of calcium signaling, and the amplitude of PKA signaling, upon receiving a cAMP-driving stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3108607545,"Objective Muscle-strengthening exercise (use of weight machines, free weights, push-ups, sit-ups), has multiple independent health benefits, and is a component of the Global physical activity guidelines. However, there is currently a lack of multi-country muscle-strengthening exercise prevalence studies. This study describes the prevalence and correlates of muscle-strengthening exercise across multiple European countries. Methods Data were drawn from the European Health Interview Survey Wave 2 (2013–14), which included nationally representative samples (n = 3,774–24,016) from 28 European countries. Muscle-strengthening exercise was assessed using the European Health Interview Survey Physical Activity Questionnaire. Population-weighted proportions were calculated for (1) “insufficient” (0–1 days/week) or (2) “sufficient” muscle-strengthening exercise (≥2 days/week). Prevalence ratios were calculated using multivariate Poisson regression for those reporting sufficient muscle-strengthening by country and by sociodemographic/lifestyle characteristics (sex, age, education, income, self-rated health etc.). Results Data were available for 280,605 European adults aged ≥18 years. Overall, 17.3% (95% CI = 17.1%-17.5%) reported sufficient muscle-strengthening exercise (≥2 days/week). Muscle-strengthening exercise was geographically patterned with the lowest prevalence reported in South-eastern European countries (Romania, Malta and Cyprus: range: 0.7%-7.4%), and the highest prevalence in the Nordic countries (Iceland, Sweden, and Denmark: range: 34.1%-51.6%). Older age, insufficient aerobic activity, poorer self-rated health, lower income/education, being female, and being overweight/obese were significantly associated with lower likelihood of reporting sufficient muscle-strengthening exercise, independently of other characteristics. Conclusions Most European adults do not report sufficient muscle-strengthening exercise, and prevalence estimates varied considerably across countries. Low participation in muscle-strengthening exercise is widespread across Europe, and warrants public health attention."
https://openalex.org/W3107083841,"Stipitate kelp species such as Laminaria digitata dominate most cold-water subtidal rocky shores and form underwater forests which are among the most productive coastal systems worldwide. Laminaria also sustains rich bacterial communities which offer a variety of biotechnological applications. However, to date, in-depth studies on the diversity and uniqueness of bacterial communities associated with this macroalgal species, their ecological role and their interactions with the alga are under-represented. To address this, the epibacterial populations associated with different thallus regions (holdfast, stipe, meristem, blade) of this brown seaweed were investigated using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. The results show that epibacterial communities of the brown seaweed are significantly different and specific to the thallus region, with the shared bacterial population comprising of only 1.1% of the total amplicon sequence variants. The diverse holdfast and blade tissues formed distinct clusters while the meristem and stipe regions are more closely related. The data obtained further supports the hypothesis that macroalgal bacterial communities are shaped by morphological niches and display specificity."

https://openalex.org/W3110227809,"This study used LENA recording devices to capture infants’ home language environments and examine how qualitative differences in adult responding to infant vocalizations related to infant vocabulary. Infant-directed speech and infant vocalizations were coded in samples taken from daylong home audio recordings of 13-month-old infants. Infant speech-related vocalizations were identified and coded as either canonical or non-canonical. Infant-directed adult speech was identified and classified into different pragmatic types. Multiple regressions examined the relation between adult responsiveness, imitating, recasting, and expanding and infant canonical and non-canonical vocalizations with caregiver-reported infant receptive and productive vocabulary. An interaction between adult like-sound responding (i.e., the total number of imitations, recasts, and expansions) and infant canonical vocalizations indicated that infants who produced more canonical vocalizations and received more adult like-sound responses had higher productive vocabularies. When sequences were analyzed, infant canonical vocalizations that preceded and followed adult recasts and expansions were positively associated with infant productive vocabulary. These findings provide insights into how infant-adult vocal exchanges are related to early vocabulary development."
https://openalex.org/W3108160583,"Exposure to the natural environment is increasingly considered to benefit psychological health. Recent reports in the literature also suggest that outdoor exposure that includes recreational pursuits such as surfing or fishing coupled with opportunities for social interaction with peers may be beneficial to Armed Forces Veterans experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Two studies were conducted to evaluate this possibility. In particular, these studies aimed to test the hypothesis that a brief group outdoor activity would decrease participants’ symptoms as assessed by established measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety and perceived stress, and increase participants’ sense of general social functioning and psychological growth. Experiment one employed a repeated measures design in which UK men and women military veterans with PTSD (N = 30) participated in a group outdoor activity (angling, equine care, or archery and falconry combined). Psychological measures were taken at 2 weeks prior, 2 weeks post, and at 4 month follow up. We obtained a significant within participant main effect indicating significant reduction in PTSD symptoms. Experiment two was a waitlist controlled randomised experiment employing an angling experience (N = 18) and 2 week follow up. In experiment 2 the predicted interaction of Group (Experimental vs. Waitlist Control) X Time (2 weeks pre vs. 2 weeks post) was obtained indicating that the experience resulted in significant reduction in PTSD symptoms relative to waitlist controls. The effect size was large. Additional analyses confirmed that the observed effects might also be considered clinically significant and reliable. In sum, peer outdoor experiences are beneficial and offer potential to complement existing provision for military veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Trial registration The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. The studies reported in this manuscript are registered as clinical trials at ISRCTN: Pilot ID– ISRCTN15325073 RCT ID– ISRCTN59395217"
https://openalex.org/W3110190165,"Online shopping behavior has the characteristics of rich granularity dimension and data sparsity and presents a challenging task in e-commerce. Previous studies on user behavior prediction did not seriously discuss feature selection and ensemble design, which are important to improving the performance of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed an SE-stacking model based on information fusion and ensemble learning for user purchase behavior prediction. After successfully using the ensemble feature selection method to screen purchase-related factors, we used the stacking algorithm for user purchase behavior prediction. In our efforts to avoid the deviation of the prediction results, we optimized the model by selecting ten different types of models as base learners and modifying the relevant parameters specifically for them. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset show that the SE-stacking model can achieve a 98.40% F1 score, approximately 0.09% higher than the optimal base models. The SE-stacking model not only has a good application in the prediction of user purchase behavior but also has practical value when combined with the actual e-commerce scene. At the same time, this model has important significance in academic research and the development of this field."
https://openalex.org/W3108662514,"Background The viral load and tissue distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain important questions. The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). Conclusions COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day survival or disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3107884824,"Bunch rot in grapes is an aggressive disease and needs to be controlled during the postharvest period. We investigate the antifungal potential of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim., Zanthoxylum rhetsa , Cuminum cyminum , Coriandrum sativum , and Zingiber montanum (J. Koenig) Link ex A. Dietr. essential oils against Aspergillus aculeatus that cause bunch rot disease on postharvest grapes. C . cyminum essential oil exhibited stronger significantly inhibition percentage of 95.08% than other treatments in in vitro assay. Cumin aldehyde (33.94%) and α-terpinen-7-al (32.20%) were identified as major volatile compounds in C . cyminum oil. Antifungal potential of C . cyminum oil was then tested in conidia germination and in vitro tests compared to cumin aldehyde and α-terpinen-7-al. Their EC 50 values against the conidial germination were also estimated. Significant reduction of conidia germination was also detected in C . cyminum essential oil and cumin aldehyde at a concentration of 1,000 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. EC 50 values of the C . cyminum essential oil, cumin aldehyde, and α-terpinen-7-al were 67.28 μg/mL, 9.31 μg/mL, and 13.23 μg/mL, respectively. In vivo assay, the decrease of the disease severity (0.69%) and incidence (1.48%) percentage of A . aculeatus on grape berries treated at 1,000 μg/mL of C . cyminum essential oil was significantly greater than that obtained from other treatments after 10 days incubation. In addition, grape berries treated with C . cyminum essential oil decreased weight loss and retained fruit firmness. The changing of total soluble solids, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity are also delayed in treated fruits. Therefore, essential oil of C . cyminum may be applied as a biological antifungal agent to control A . aculeatus in postharvest grapes without any negative effects on its quality."
https://openalex.org/W3108313369,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a deadly disease that is rising in prevalence due to population aging. While the disease is complex and poorly understood, one well-documented driver of valvulopathy is serotonin agonism. Both serotonin overexpression, as seen with carcinoid tumors and drug-related agonism, such as with Fenfluramine use, are linked with various diseases of the valves. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine if genetic ablation or pharmacological antagonism of the 5-HT 2B serotonin receptor (gene: Htr2b ) could improve the hemodynamic and histological progression of calcific aortic valve disease. Htr2b mutant mice were crossed with Notch1 +/- mice, an established small animal model of CAVD, to determine if genetic ablation affects CAVD progression. To assess the effect of pharmacological inhibition on CAVD progression, Notch1 +/- mice were treated with the 5-HT 2B receptor antagonist SB204741. Mice were analyzed using echocardiography, histology, immunofluorescence, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Htr2b mutant mice showed lower aortic valve peak velocity and mean pressure gradient–classical hemodynamic indicators of aortic valve stenosis–without concurrent left ventricle change. 5-HT 2B receptor antagonism, however, did not affect hemodynamic progression. Leaflet thickness, collagen density, and CAVD-associated transcriptional markers were not significantly different in any group. This study reveals that genetic ablation of Htr2b attenuates hemodynamic development of CAVD in the Notch1 +/- mice, but pharmacological antagonism may require high doses or long-term treatment to slow progression."
https://openalex.org/W3107955173,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a global public health burden originating in epidermal stem and progenitor cells (ESPCs) of the skin and mucosa. To understand how genetic risk factors contribute to SCC, studies of ESPC biology are imperative. Children with Fanconi anemia (FA) are a paradigm for extreme SCC susceptibility caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in FA DNA repair pathway genes. To discover epidermal vulnerabilities, patient-derived pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) conditional for the FA pathway were differentiated into ESPCs and PSC-derived epidermal organotypic rafts (PSC-EORs). FA PSC-EORs harbored diminished cell-cell junctions and increased proliferation in the basal cell compartment. Furthermore, desmosome and hemidesmosome defects were identified in the skin of FA patients, and these translated into accelerated blistering following mechanically induced stress. Together, we demonstrate that a critical DNA repair pathway maintains the structure and function of human skin and provide 3D epidermal models wherein SCC prevention can now be explored."
https://openalex.org/W3107701060,"Purpose Ectopic Cushing Syndrome (EAS) is a rare condition responsible for about 5–20% of all Cushing syndrome cases. It increases the mortality of affected patients thus finding and removal of the ACTH-producing source allows for curing or reduction of symptoms and serum cortisol levels. The aim of this study is to present a 20-year experience in the diagnosis and clinical course of patients with EAS in a single Clinical Centre in Southern Poland as well as a comparison of clinical course and outcomes depending on the source of ectopic ACTH production–especially neuroendocrine tumors with other neoplasms. Methods Twenty-four patients were involved in the clinical study with EAS diagnosed at the Department of Endocrinology between years 2000 and 2018. The diagnosis of EAS was based on the clinical presentation, hypercortisolemia with high ACTH levels, high dose dexamethasone suppression test and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone tests. To find the source of ACTH various imaging studies were performed. Results Half of the patients were diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, whereby muscle weakness was the leading symptom. Typical cushingoid appearance was seen in merely a few patients, and weight loss was more common than weight gain. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors had significantly higher midnight cortisol levels than the rest of the group. Among patients with infections, we observed a significantly higher concentrations of cortisol 2400 levels in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Chromogranin A correlated significantly with potassium in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and there was a significant correlation between ACTH level and severity of hypokalemia. Conclusion EAS is not common, but if it occurs it increases the mortality of patients; therefore, it should be taken into consideration in the case of coexistence of severe hypokalemia with hypertension and muscle weakness, especially when weight loss occurs. Because the diagnosis of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor worsens the prognosis-special attention should be paid to these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3109369253,"Objectives Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are considered an emerging threat worldwide. Data covering the clinical impact of MDRO colonization in patients with solid malignancies, however, is widely missing. We sought to determine the impact of MDRO colonization in patients who have been diagnosed with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are at known high-risk for invasive infections. Materials and methods Patients who were screened for MDRO colonization within a 90-day period after NSCLC diagnosis of all stages were included in this single-center retrospective study. Results Two hundred and ninety-five patients were included of whom 24 patients (8.1%) were screened positive for MDRO colonization (MDRO pos ) at first diagnosis. Enterobacterales were by far the most frequent MDRO detected with a proportion of 79.2% (19/24). MDRO colonization was present across all disease stages and more present in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus. Median overall survival was significantly inferior in the MDRO pos study group with a median OS of 7.8 months (95% CI, 0.0–19.9 months) compared to a median OS of 23.9 months (95% CI, 17.6–30.1 months) in the MDRO neg group in univariate (p = 0.036) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.02). Exploratory analyses suggest a higher rate of non-cancer-related-mortality in MDRO pos patients compared to MDRO neg patients (p = 0.002) with an increased rate of fatal infections in MDRO pos patients (p = 0.0002). Conclusions MDRO colonization is an independent risk factor for inferior OS in patients diagnosed with NSCLC due to a higher rate of fatal infections. Empirical antibiotic treatment approaches should cover formerly detected MDR commensals in cases of (suspected) invasive infections."
https://openalex.org/W3109423659,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proved a globally prevalent outbreak since December 2019. As a focused country to alleviate the epidemic impact, China implemented a range of public health interventions to prevent the disease from further transmission, including the pandemic lockdown in Wuhan and other cities. This paper establishes China’s mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic. This approach is successfully applied to a network of Chinese provinces and the epidemic strength is smoothly interpreted by flow maps. Through this node-to-node interpretation of transmission risks, both overall and detailed epidemic hazards are properly analyzed, which can provide valuable intervention advice during public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W3109952886,"Background Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy were two of the most significant disasters of the 21 st century that critically impacted communities and the health of their residents. Despite the assumption that disasters affect access to healthcare, to our knowledge prior studies have not rigorously examined availability of healthcare providers following disasters. Objective The objective of this study was to examine availability of healthcare providers following large-scale hurricanes. Methods Using historical data on healthcare providers from the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System and county-level population characteristics, we conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine the effect of large-scale hurricanes on healthcare provider availability in the short-term and long-term. We separately examined availability of primary care physicians, medical specialists, surgeons, and nurse practitioners. A difference-in-differences analysis was used to control for time variant factors comparing county-level health care provider availability in affected and unaffected counties the year before Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, to five years after each storm. Results Counties affected by Hurricane Katrina compared to unaffected locales experienced a decrease of 3.59 primary care physicians per 10,000 population (95% CI: -6.5, -0.7), medical specialists (decrease of 5.9 providers per 10,000 (95% CI: -11.3, -0.5)), and surgeons (decrease of 2.1 (95% CI: -3.8, -0.37)). However, availability of nurse practitioners did not change appreciably. Counties affected by Hurricane Sandy exhibited less pronounced changes. Changes in availability of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, medical specialists, and surgeons were not statistically significant. Conclusion Large-scale hurricanes appear to affect availability of healthcare providers for up to several years following impact of the storm. Effects vary depending on the characteristics of the community. Primary care physicians and medical specialists availability was the most impacted, potentially having long-term implications for population health in the context of disaster recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3110441125,"Children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic events demonstrate a variety of posttraumatic symptoms, including recurrent nightmares, as well as adverse reactions in the school setting. The current study examined nightmare symptoms, posttraumatic stress, sleep disturbance, and self- and teacher-reported school functioning of 64 youths in the Gaza Strip, ages 12 to 16, who have lived through three wars and experience ongoing conflict and political insecurity. Students were treatment-seeking for sleep-problems and reported, on average, five nightmares per week for an average of three years, with concomitant disrupted sleep, fear of going to sleep, and not feeling rested in the morning. Both teachers and students reported that participants exhibited impaired academic functioning and daytime sleepiness. The content of the students’ nightmares demonstrated frightening themes of being under attack and loss of self-efficacy/control; threat levels were high, and almost 60% included the threat of death. Approximately half of the nightmares included surreal elements in addition to more realistic scenes of violence. Participants in the study demonstrated substantial posttraumatic sleep problems with intensely distressing, frequent and chronic nightmares, andnightmare symptoms were associated with impairment in school functioning. Given the disruptive and distressing nature of these students’ nightmare disturbance, we suggest that increasing self-efficacy in relation to the experience of recurrent nightmares may be a good point of intervention with these recurrently traumatized youth. Thus, increasing the understanding of students’ nightmare symptoms may lead to ameliorating the suffering of youths in war zones and may have positive effects on their school functioning."
https://openalex.org/W3110473073,"Liver fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, mainly composed of collagen. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) mediate liver fibrosis by secreting collagen. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a cofactor of prolyl-hydroxylases that modify newly synthesized collagen on the route for secretion. Unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize ascorbic acid and its role in liver fibrosis remains unclear. Here, we determined the effect of ascorbic acid and prolyl-hydroxylase inhibition on collagen production and secretion by human HSCs. Primary human HSCs (p-hHSCs) and the human HSCscell line LX-2 were treated with ascorbic acid, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) and/or the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). Expression of collagen-I was analyzed by RT-qPCR (COL1A1), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Collagen secretion was determined in the medium by Western blotting for collagen-I and by HPLC for hydroxyproline concentrations. Expression of solute carrier family 23 members 1 and 2 (SLC23A1/SLC23A2), encoding sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters 1 and 2 (SVCT1/SVCT2) was quantified in healthy and cirrhotic human tissue. In the absence of ascorbic acid, collagen-I accumulated intracellularly in p-hHSCs and LX-2 cells, which was potentiated by TGFβ. Ascorbic acid co-treatment strongly promoted collagen-I excretion and enhanced extracellular hydroxyproline concentrations, without affecting collagen-I (COL1A1) mRNA levels. DMOG inhibited collagen-I release even in the presence of ascorbic acid and suppressed COL1A1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA/ACTA2) mRNA levels, also under hypoxic conditions. Hepatocytes express both ascorbic acid transporters, while p-hHSCs and LX-2 express the only SVCT2, which is selectively enhanced in cirrhotic livers. Human HSCs rely on ascorbic acid for the efficient secretion of collagen-I, which can be effectively blocked by hydroxylase antagonists, revealing new therapeutic targets to treat liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3107244840,"The ongoing trend toward agricultural intensification in Southern Amazonia makes it essential to explore the future impacts of this development on the extent of natural habitats and biodiversity. This type of analysis requires information on future pathways of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) under different socio-economic conditions and policy settings. For this purpose, the spatially explicit land-use change model LandSHIFT was applied to calculate a set of high-resolution land-use change scenarios for the Brazilian states Para and Mato Grosso. The period of the analysis were the years 2010–2030. The resulting land-use maps were combined with maps depicting vertebrate species diversity in order to examine the impact of natural habitat loss on species ranges as well as the overall LULCC-induced effect on vertebrate diversity as expressed by the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII). The results of this study indicate a general decrease in biodiversity intactness in all investigated scenarios. However, agricultural intensification combined with diversified environmental protection policies show least impact of LULCC on vertebrate species richness and conservation of natural habitats compared to scenarios with low agricultural intensification or scenarios with less effective conservation policies."
https://openalex.org/W3108721115,"GABA is synthesized by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), which has two isoforms, namely, GAD65 and GAD67, encoded by the Gad2 and Gad1 genes, respectively. GAD65-deficient (Gad2-/- ) mice exhibit a reduction in brain GABA content after 1 month of age and show spontaneous seizures in adulthood. Approximately 25% of Gad2-/- mice died by 6 months of age. Our Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein expression ratio of GAD65 to GAD67 in the brain was greater in rats than in mice during postnatal development, suggesting that the contribution of each GAD isoform to GABA functions differs between these two species. To evaluate whether GAD65 deficiency causes different phenotypes between rats and mice, we generated Gad2-/- rats using TALEN genome editing technology. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses with new antibodies demonstrated that the GAD65 protein was undetectable in the Gad2-/- rat brain. Gad2-/- pups exhibited spontaneous seizures and paroxysmal discharge in EEG at postnatal weeks 3-4. More than 80% of the Gad2-/- rats died at postnatal days (PNDs) 17-23. GABA content in Gad2-/- brains was significantly lower than those in Gad2+/- and Gad2+/+ brains at PND17-19. These results suggest that the low levels of brain GABA content in Gad2-/- rats may lead to epilepsy followed by premature death, and that Gad2-/- rats are more severely affected than Gad2-/- mice.

The goal of our study was to describe the ear cerumen microbiota of healthy dogs, within the same animal and between different animals, and to compare the cerumen microbiota of otitis affected dogs with that of healthy animals. The present study included 26 healthy dogs, 16 animals affected by bilateral otitis externa and 4 animals affected by monolateral otitis externa. For each animal cerumen samples from the right and left ear were separately collected with sterile swabs, and processed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), and taxonomical assignment and clustering were performed using QIIME 2 software. Our results indicate that the bacterial community of the cerumen in healthy dogs was characterized by extensive variability, with the most abundant phyla represented by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. The analysis of both alpha and beta diversity between pairs of left and right ear samples from the same dog within the group of affected animals displayed higher differences than between paired samples across healthy dogs. Moreover we observed reduced bacterial richness in the affected group as compared with controls and increased variability in population structure within otitis affected animals, often associated with the proliferation of a single bacterial taxon over the others. Moreover, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas resulted to be the bacterial genera responsible for most distances between the two groups, in association with differences in the bacterial community structure. The cerumen microbiota in healthy dogs exhibits a complex bacterial population which undergoes significant modifications in otitis affected animals."
https://openalex.org/W3110545451,"In science, sleeping beauties (SBs) denotes a special phenomenon of the diffusion of scientific knowledge based on citation trajectories, the awakening of which is also measured through changes in the citations index. However, the rapid advancement of social media has altered the mode of scientific communication and knowledge diffusion. This study aims to re-identify SBs and its Prince from the perspective of comprehensive indicators, which involves the analysis of Altmetrics indexes and Citation index, and investigate the awakening mechanism of A-SB to supplement the research on the awakening mechanism of SBs. By combining Ab index, we redefined the Prince, which makes A-SB receive high attention after a long Sleeping period and reflects the most prominent academic or social behavior that awakens and sustains the Awakening of A-SB. Then we conducted empirical research on the retrieved PLOS Biology collection and examined Prince after identifying the A-SB. The analysis and summary of the characteristics of the identified A-SB and Prince revealed the SBs’ awakening mechanism under the comprehensive trajectory based on Altmetrics from the three dimensions of the influence between the indicators, the overall evolution trajectory of A-SB, and literature bibliometric attributes. In the trajectory of Delayed Recognition stage of A-SB, we define the Dogsleep of SBs, which mirrors that the instability of the Sleeping of SBs will generate a specific negative impact on Prince of A-SB and Awakening intensity. Besides, the literature bibliometric attributes cannot reflect the tendency of users to read academic papers, which again proves that the traditional citation index cannot be neglected in the awakening mechanism of A-SB. Overall, this study demonstrates the addition of the Altmetrics indexes as a useful complement, illustrating the inheritance and connection between the SBs based on the comprehensive trajectory and the SBs based on the citation diffusion trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W3110599975,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, sometimes creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. Methods A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO 2 and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. Findings To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL/cmH 2 O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection."
https://openalex.org/W3108248925,"Ethologically relevant chemical senses and behavioral habits are likely to coadapt in response to selection. As olfaction is involved in intrinsically motivated behaviors in mice, we hypothesized that selective breeding for a voluntary behavior would enable us to identify novel roles of the chemosensory system. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) is an intrinsically motivated and naturally rewarding behavior, and even wild mice run on a wheel placed in nature. We have established 4 independent, artificially evolved mouse lines by selectively breeding individuals showing high VWR activity (High Runners; HRs), together with 4 non-selected Control lines, over 88 generations. We found that several sensory receptors in specific receptor clusters were differentially expressed between the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of HRs and Controls. Moreover, one of those clusters contains multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism loci for which the allele frequencies were significantly divergent between the HR and Control lines, i.e., loci that were affected by the selective breeding protocol. These results indicate that the VNO has become genetically differentiated between HR and Control lines during the selective breeding process. Although the role of the vomeronasal chemosensory receptors in VWR activity remains to be determined, the current results suggest that these vomeronasal chemosensory receptors are important quantitative trait loci for voluntary exercise in mice. We propose that olfaction may play an important role in motivation for voluntary exercise in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3109480998,"Background There are conflicting reports on the association of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) in cardiovascular disease development, including endothelial function and hypertension. We tested whether ucOC is related to blood pressure and endothelial function in older adults, and if ucOC directly affects endothelial-mediated vasodilation in the carotid artery of rabbits. Methods In older adults, ucOC, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BAFMD) were measured (n = 38, 26 post-menopausal women and 12 men, mean age 73 ± 0.96). The vasoactivity of the carotid artery was assessed in male New Zealand White rabbits following a four-week normal or atherogenic diet using perfusion myography. An ucOC dose response curve (0.3–45 ng/ml) was generated following incubation of the arteries for 2-hours in either normal or high glucose conditions. Results ucOC levels were higher in normotensive older adults compared to those with stage 2 hypertension (p &lt; 0.05), particularly in women (p &lt; 0.01). In all participants, higher ucOC was associated with lower PWV (p &lt; 0.05), but not BAFMD (p &gt; 0.05). In rabbits, ucOC at any dose did not alter vasoactivity of the carotid artery, either following a normal or an atherogenic diet (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Increased ucOC is associated with lower blood pressure and increased arterial stiffness, particularly in post-menopausal women. However, ucOC administration has no direct short-term effect on endothelial function in rabbit arteries. Future studies should explore whether treatment with ucOC, in vivo , has direct or indirect effects on blood vessel function."
https://openalex.org/W3110163911,"Despite its five meters length, the megamouth shark ( Megachasma pelagios Taylor, Compagno &amp; Struhsaker, 1983) is one of the rarest big sharks known in the world (117 specimens observed and documented so far). This filter-feeding shark has been assumed to be a luminous species, using its species-specific white band to produce bioluminescence as a lure trap. Another hypothesis was the use of the white band reflectivity to attract prey or for social recognition purposes. However, no histological study has ever been performed to confirm these assumptions so far. Two hypotheses about the megamouth shark's luminescence arose: firstly, the light emission may be intrinsically or extrinsically produced by specific light organs (photophores) located either on the upper jaw white band or inside the mouth; secondly, the luminous appearance might be a consequence of the reflection of prey luminescence on the white band during feeding events. Aims of the study were to test these hypotheses by highlighting the potential presence of specific photophores responsible for bioluminescence and to reveal and analyze the presence of specialized light-reflective structures in and around the mouth of the shark. By using different histological approaches (histological sections, fluorescent in situ hybridization, scanning electron microscopy) and spectrophotometry, this study allows to unravel these hypotheses and strongly supports that the megamouth shark does not emit bioluminescence, but might rather reflect the light produced by bioluminescent planktonic preys, thanks to the denticles of the white band."
https://openalex.org/W3110530632,"Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a prevalent condition among the elderly population that eventually requires aortic valve replacement. The lack of reliable biomarkers for AVS poses a challenge for its early diagnosis and the application of preventive measures. Untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics was applied in 46 AVS cases and 46 controls to identify plasma and urine metabolites underlying AVS risk. Multivariate data analyses were performed on pre-processed data (e.g. spectral peak alignment), in order to detect changes in metabolite levels in AVS patients and to evaluate their performance in group separation and sensitivity of AVS prediction, followed by regression analyses to test for their association with AVS. Through untargeted analysis of 190 urine and 130 plasma features that could be detected and quantified in the GC-MS spectra, we identified contrasting levels of 22 urine and 21 plasma features between AVS patients and control subjects. Following metabolite assignment, we observed significant changes in the concentration of known metabolites in urine (n = 14) and plasma (n = 15) that distinguish the metabolomic profiles of AVS patients from healthy controls. Associations with AVS were replicated in both plasma and urine for about half of these metabolites. Among these, 2-Oxovaleric acid, elaidic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, estrone, myo-inositol showed contrasting trends of regulation in the two biofluids. Only trans-Aconitic acid and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol showed consistent patterns of regulation in both plasma and urine. These results illustrate the power of metabolomics in identifying potential disease-associated biomarkers and provide a foundation for further studies towards early diagnostic applications in severe heart conditions that may prevent surgery in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3108030352,"Background The prevalence of gestational hypertension and diabetes in pregnancy is increasing worldwide. Diet is a modifiable factor that may influence these conditions, but few studies have examined the association between diet quality and blood pressure and glucose profiles among pregnant women. Data are especially scarce for women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of global pregnancies occur, and in urban settings. We, therefore, assessed these associations among 174 pregnant women in the Asian megacity of Jakarta in a cross-sectional study of the Brain Probiotic and LC-PUFA Intervention for Optimum Early Life (BRAVE) project. Methods Trained field-enumerators collected socio-demographic characteristics, measured Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), and assessed diet by two 24-hour recalls, which were used to calculate the Alternate Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy (AHEI-P). Blood pressure was measured by automated sphygmomanometer, and fasting blood glucose by capillary glucometer. General linear models were used to identify associations. Results The median AHEI-P score was 47.4 (IQR 19.1–76.6). The middle tertile of the AHEI-P score (39.59–56.58) was associated with a 0.4 SD (standardized effect size, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.06; p = 0.02) lower diastolic blood pressure compared with the lowest tertile (&lt;39.59), after adjustment for level of education, smoking status, MUAC, gestational age, history of hypertension, and family history of hypertension. However, no associations were found between the AHEI-P score and systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. Conclusion Higher diet quality was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure among pregnant women in an urban LMIC community, but not with systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. A behavioral change intervention trial would be warranted to confirm the influence of diet quality on blood pressure and glucose levels and among pregnant women, and even before pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3108469987,"To investigate the feasibility of using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to evaluate the treatment response of metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) in the 4T1 mammary tumor model of locally advanced breast cancer.Twelve Balb/c mice with metastatic breast cancer were divided into treated and untreated (control) groups. The treated group (n = 6) received five treatments of anti-metabolite agent 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) in the span of two weeks. dMRI and DCE-MRI were acquired for both treated and control groups before and after MCT. Immunohistochemically staining and measurements were performed after the post-MRI measurements for comparison.The control mice had significantly (p<0.005) larger tumors than the MCT treated mice. The DCE-MRI analysis showed a decrease in contrast enhancement for the control group, whereas the MCT mice had a more stable enhancement between the pre-chemo and post-chemo time points. This confirms the antiangiogenic effects of 5FU treatment. Comparing amplitude of enhancement revealed a significantly (p<0.05) higher enhancement in the MCT tumors than in the controls. Moreover, the MCT uptake rate was significantly (p<0.001) slower than the controls. dMRI analysis showed the MCT ADC values were significantly larger than the control group at the post-scan time point.dMRI and DCE-MRI can be used as potential biomarkers for assessing the treatment response of MCT. The MRI and pathology observations suggested that in addition to the cytotoxic effect of cell kills, the MCT with a cytotoxic drug, 5FU, induced changes in the tumor vasculature similar to the anti-angiogenic effect."
https://openalex.org/W3108776487,"The association between blood pressure (BP) and bladder cancer (BC) risk remains unclear with confounding by smoking being of particular concern. We investigated the association between BP and BC risk among men using conventional survival-analysis, and by Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis in an attempt to disconnect the association from smoking. We additionally investigated the interaction between BP and N-acetyltransferase-2 ( NAT2 ) rs1495741, an established BC genetic risk variant, in the association. Populations consisting of 188,167 men with 502 incident BC’s in the UK-biobank and 27,107 men with 928 incident BC’s in two Swedish cohorts were used for the analysis. We found a positive association between systolic BP and BC risk in Cox-regression survival analysis in the Swedish cohorts, (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation [SD]: 1.14 [95% confidence interval 1.05–1.22]) and MR analysis (odds ratio per SD: 2-stage least-square regression, 7.70 [1.92–30.9]; inverse-variance weighted estimate, 3.43 [1.12–10.5]), and no associations in the UK-biobank (HR systolic BP: 0.93 [0.85–1.02]; MR OR: 1.24 [0.35–4.40] and 1.37 [0.43–4.37], respectively). BP levels were positively associated with muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) (HRs: systolic BP, 1.32 [1.09–1.59]; diastolic BP, 1.27 [1.04–1.55]), but not with non-muscle invasive BC, which could be analyzed in the Swedish cohorts only. There was no interaction between BP and NAT2 in relation to BC on the additive or multiplicative scale. These results suggest that BP might be related to BC, more particularly MIBC. There was no evidence to support interaction between BP and NAT2 in relation to BC in our study."
https://openalex.org/W3106576989,"Reading is a unique human cognitive skill and its acquisition was proven to extensively affect both brain organization and neuroanatomy. Differently from western sighted individuals, literacy rates via tactile reading systems, such as Braille, are declining, thus imposing an alarming threat to literacy among non-visual readers. This decline is due to many reasons including the length of training needed to master Braille, which must also include extensive tactile sensitivity exercises, the lack of proper Braille instruction and the high costs of Braille devices. The far-reaching consequences of low literacy rates, raise the need to develop alternative, cheap and easy-to-master non-visual reading systems. To this aim, we developed OVAL, a new auditory orthography based on a visual-to-auditory sensory-substitution algorithm. Here we present its efficacy for successful words-reading, and investigation of the extent to which redundant features defining characters (i.e., adding specific colors to letters conveyed into audition via different musical instruments) facilitate or impede auditory reading outcomes. Thus, we tested two groups of blindfolded sighted participants who were either exposed to a monochromatic or to a color version of OVAL. First, we showed that even before training, all participants were able to discriminate between 11 OVAL characters significantly more than chance level. Following 6 hours of specific OVAL training, participants were able to identify all the learned characters, differentiate them from untrained letters, and read short words/pseudo-words of up to 5 characters. The Color group outperformed the Monochromatic group in all tasks, suggesting that redundant characters’ features are beneficial for auditory reading. Overall, these results suggest that OVAL is a promising auditory-reading tool that can be used by blind individuals, by people with reading deficits as well as for the investigation of reading specific processing dissociated from the visual modality."
https://openalex.org/W3110026001,"Neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) causes disabling and incurable contractures, or limb stiffness, which result from proteasome-mediated protein degradation impairing the longitudinal growth of neonatally denervated muscles. We recently showed in a mouse model that the 20S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, prevents contractures after NBPI. Given that contractures uniquely follow neonatal denervation, the current study tests the hypothesis that proteasome inhibition during a finite window of neonatal development can prevent long-term contracture development. Following neonatal forelimb denervation in P5 mice, we first outlined the minimum period for proteasome inhibition to prevent contractures 4 weeks post-NBPI by treating mice with saline or bortezomib for varying durations between P8 and P32. We then compared the ability of varying durations of longer-term proteasome inhibition to prevent contractures at 8 and 12 weeks post-NBPI. Our findings revealed that proteasome inhibition can be delayed 3-4 days after denervation but is required throughout skeletal growth to prevent contractures long term. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition becomes less effective in preventing contractures beyond the neonatal period. These therapeutic effects are primarily associated with bortezomib-induced attenuation of 20S proteasome β1 subunit activity. Our collective results, therefore, demonstrate that temporary neonatal proteasome inhibition is not a viable strategy for preventing contractures long term. Instead, neonatal denervation causes a permanent longitudinal growth deficiency that must be continuously ameliorated during skeletal growth. Additional mechanisms must be explored to minimize the necessary period of proteasome inhibition and reduce the risk of toxicity from long-term treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3109879696,"Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor associated with high degree of resistance to treatment. Given its heterogeneity, it is important to understand the molecular landscape of this tumor for the development of more effective therapies. Because of the different genetic profiles of patients with GBM, we sought to identify genetic variants in Lebanese patients with GBM (LEB-GBM) and compare our findings to those in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Methods We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify somatic variants in a cohort of 60 patient-derived GBM samples. We focused our analysis on 50 commonly mutated GBM candidate genes and compared mutation signatures between our population and publicly available GBM data from TCGA. We also cross-tabulated biological covariates to assess for associations with overall survival, time to recurrence and follow-up duration. Results We included 60 patient-derived GBM samples from 37 males and 23 females, with age ranging from 3 to 80 years (mean and median age at diagnosis were 51 and 56, respectively). Recurrent tumor formation was present in 94.8% of patients (n = 55/58). After filtering, we identified 360 somatic variants from 60 GBM patient samples. After filtering, we identified 360 somatic variants from 60 GBM patient samples. Most frequently mutated genes in our samples included ATRX , PCDHX11 , PTEN , TP53 , NF1 , EGFR , PIK3CA , and SCN9A . Mutations in NLRP5 were associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese GBM cohort (p = 0.002). Mutations in NLRP5 were associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese GBM cohort (p = 0.002). EGFR and NF1 mutations were associated with the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in our LEB-GBM cohort, respectively. Conclusions Our WES analysis confirmed the similarity in mutation signature of the LEB-GBM population with TCGA cohorts. It showed that 1 out of the 50 commonly GBM candidate gene mutations is associated with decreased overall survival among the Lebanese cohort. This study also highlights the need for studies with larger sample sizes to inform clinicians for better prognostication and management of Lebanese patients with GBM."

The original sequences are converted into eight intermediate files and six final files. Then, the LZ77 algorithm is used to compress the six final files. The results show that the compression time is decreased by 83% and the decompression time is decreased by 54% on average.The compression rate is almost the same as Nour and Sharawi’s method which is the fastest method so far. What’s more, our method has a wider range of application than Nour and Sharawi’s method. Compared to some very advanced compression tools at present, such as XM and FCM-Mx, the time for compression in our method is much smaller, on average decreasing the time by more than 90%."
https://openalex.org/W3110622083,"Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) molecule expressed on the leukocytes is known to function as a co-receptor for class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding to T cell receptor (TCR) on helper T cells. We previously identified two CD4 alleles (CD4.A and CD4.B) in a Microminipig population based on nucleotide sequencing and PCR detection of their gene sequences. However, CD4.B protein expression was not examined because of the unavailability of a reactive antibody to a CD4.B epitope. In this study, we have produced two swine-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD4.B molecules, one that recognizes only CD4.B (b1D7) and the other that recognizes both the CD4.A and CD4.B alleles (x1E10) and that can be used to distinguish CD4 T cell subsets by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Using these two mAbs, we identified CD4.A and CD4.B allele-specific proteins on the surface of CD4.A (+/+) and CD4.B (+/+) T cells at a similar level of expression. Moreover, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from CD4.A (+/+) and CD4.B (+/+) swine with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) in vitro similarly activated both groups of cells that exhibited a slight increase in the CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) cell ratio. A large portion of the DP cells from the allelic CD4.A (+/+) and CD4.B (+/+) groups enhanced the total CD4 and class I swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) expression. The x1E10 mAb delayed and reduced the TSST-1-induced activation of CD4 T cells. Thus, CD4.B appears to be a functional protein whose expression on activated T cells is analogous to CD4.A."
