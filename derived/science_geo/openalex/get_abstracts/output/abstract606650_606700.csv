https://openalex.org/W2790556376,"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative bacterium and zoonotic pathogen responsible for a wide range of diseases, ranging from mild diarrhea, enterocolitis, lymphatic adenitis to persistent local inflammation. The Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin D (InvD) molecule belongs to the invasin (InvA)-type autotransporter proteins, but its structure and function remain unknown. In this study, we present the first crystal structure of InvD, analyzed its expression and function in a murine infection model, and identified its target molecule in the host. We found that InvD is induced at 37 °C and expressed in vivo 2–4 days after infection, indicating that InvD is a virulence factor. During infection, InvD was expressed in all parts of the intestinal tract, but not in deeper lymphoid tissues. The crystal structure of the C-terminal adhesion domain of InvD revealed a distinct Ig-related fold that, apart from the canonical β-sheets, comprises various modifications of and insertions into the Ig-core structure. We identified the Fab fragment of host-derived IgG/IgA antibodies as the target of the adhesion domain. Phage display panning and flow cytometry data further revealed that InvD exhibits a preferential binding specificity toward antibodies with VH3/VK1 variable domains and that it is specifically recruited to a subset of B cells. This finding suggests that InvD modulates Ig functions in the intestine and affects direct interactions with a subset of cell surface-exposed B-cell receptors. In summary, our results provide extensive insights into the structure of InvD and its specific interaction with the target molecule in the host.

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the family of Enterobacteriaceae. This zoonotic pathogen is responsible for a wide range of diseases ranging from mild diarrhea, enterocolitis, lymphatic adenitis to sequelae such as reactive arthritis and iritis (1Dube P. Interaction of Yersinia with the gut: mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune evasion.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 337 (19812980): 61-91PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission of Y. pseudotuberculosis occurs via the oral–fecal route. Once in the intestine, the bacteria have to penetrate through the epithelial cell layer to colonize and invade their hosts. For this purpose Y. pseudotuberculosis utilizes a variety of multifunctional adhesins (2Chauhan N. Wrobel A. Skurnik M. Leo J.C. Yersinia adhesins: an arsenal for infection.Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2016; 10 (27068449): 949-96310.1002/prca.201600012Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bacterial adhesins have in common that they target specific host cell receptors or components of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, adhesins mediate bacterial attachment to mammalian cells and activate host cell signaling cascades, leading to bacterial uptake and efficient dissemination to Peyer’s patches, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), 4The abbreviations used are: mLNmesenteric lymph nodeADadhesion domainAilattachment and invasion locusBIgbacterial immunoglobulin-likeCFUcolony-forming unitEibE. coli immunoglobulin-bindingHEp-2human epithelial type 2InvDinvasinDMIDMoraxella catarrhalis IgD-binding proteinPpLprotein L from Peptostreptococcus magnusr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationSbistaphylococcal binder of IgGscFvsingle chain fragment variableSIgAsecretory IgASpAprotein A from Staphylococcus aureusYadAYersinia adhesin ATEVtobacco etch virusBMEβ-mercaptoethanolIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosidePDBProtein Data BankIgimmunoglobulin. liver, and spleen.

InvA is the major adhesion factor of Y. pseudotuberculosis and is sufficient to promote tight binding to cells by exploiting β1 integrins as cellular receptors (15Isberg R.R. Leong J.M.

The interaction between InvA and β1 integrins activates actin rearrangement resulting in the internalization of bacteria (16Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E.

In addition to InvA, four additional invasins InvB (lfp), InvC, InvD, and InvE have been identified in Y. pseudotuberculosis (18Pisano F. Kochut A. Uliczka F. Geyer R. Stolz T. Thiermann T. Rohde M.

We recently reported the structure of InvE (20Sadana P. Mönnich M. Unverzagt C. Scrima A. Structure of the Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesin InvasinE.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28370712): 1182-119510.1002/pro.3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but further details regarding the specific function of InvE as well as of InvD remain elusive. All five invasins share a common architecture. They consist of the following: (i) an N-terminal β-barrel–like domain, which is responsible for anchoring invasins in the bacterial outer membrane; (ii) repetitive immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, which vary significantly in number among all the invasins; and (iii) typically a C-terminal C-type lectin-like domain, often described as the capping or adhesion domain, which provides specificity for interaction with host-derived factors, as seen for the interaction between InvA and β1 integrins. The C-terminal domains of InvA, InvB, and InvC share a sequence similarity of 33–42% (sequence identity 16–24%) and are thus likely to share a common fold. In contrast, the InvD C-terminal domain is not related to any of the other four invasins and only shares a sequence similarity of 17% or less (identity 11% or less) (20Sadana P. Mönnich M. Unverzagt C. Scrima A. Structure of the Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesin InvasinE.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28370712): 1182-119510.1002/pro.3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study, we gained insight into the structure and function of InvD. We present the crystal structure of the InvD adhesion domain along with two Ig-like domains at 2.6 Å resolution. The InvD adhesion domain adopts a novel fold, raising the question of the identity of its host-derived target. We show that InvD is predominantly induced at 37 °C and expressed within the intestinal tract during infection. Moreover, we identify immunoglobulins (Igs) with VH3/VK1 variable domains as its host-derived target molecule. In summary, after structural determination of InvA (21Hamburger Z.A. Brown M.S. Isberg R.R. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of invasin: a bacterial integrin-binding protein.Science. 1999; 286 (10514372): 291-29510.1126/science.286.5438.291Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and InvE (20Sadana P. Mönnich M. Unverzagt C. Scrima A. Structure of the Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesin InvasinE.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28370712): 1182-119510.1002/pro.3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), our work presents structural and functional details for a novel member of the Yersinia invasin family and provides insights into the potential role of InvD during infection. Sequence analysis of InvD using a combination of BLAST, Pfam (ID: A0A0H3B1G5), and Signal-BLAST identifies a putative signal peptide between residues 32 and 57, sharing 46% sequence identity (73% similarity) with the signal peptide (residues 20–45) in the “putative attaching and effacing protein homolog” (UNIPROT:P36943-EAEH_ECOLI). This N-terminal sequence stretch is followed by a region (residues 146–421) assigned as domain of unknown function (DUF3442), predicted to form a β-barrel domain structure required for anchoring the protein in the bacterial outer membrane. The putative β-barrel domain is followed by 13 bacterial Ig-like (BIg) domains (Fig. 1A). Of these, the first 12 BIg-domains share high sequence identity in the range of 56–97% (72–100% similarity), whereas BIg13 is significantly different from BIg1–12 (sequence identity 22–28%; similarity 40–47%) (Fig. S1). BIg1–13 are capped by a predicted C-terminal domain (residues 1829–1976) with no similarity to known proteins, which, according to the canonical domain architecture, we assumed to harbor the adhesion or host–interaction domain. To gain insight into the structure and function of the putative adhesion domain (hereafter referred to as the AD), we tested three expression constructs: InvD1640 that comprises BIg12/13-AD (residues 1640–1976); InvD1737 including BIg13–AD (residues 1737–1976); and InvD1838 covering only the AD (residues 1838–1976) (Fig. 1A). Of these, InvD1640 and InvD1737 resulted in soluble, monodisperse protein samples expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography, whereas the AD alone was not soluble. Of the two InvD constructs expressed and purified, only the construct InvD1640, comprising BIg12/13-AD, yielded crystals of sufficient quality for structural determination. InvD1640 crystallized in space group P43 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Table 1). The overall structure of the construct is rod-like, with a length of 12.9 nm, and it reveals three domains: two BIg domains (BIg12, residues 1640–1736; BIg13, residues 1737–1837) and the C-terminal AD (residues 1838–1976) (Fig. 1, B and C). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are highly similar, and they superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.923 Å. The separate superimposition of BIg13/AD or BIg12 results in a lower r.m.s.d. of 0.814 and 0.761 Å, respectively, indicative of a minor structural flexibility between BIg12 and BIg13. Structure description hereafter will be focusing on one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. We have additionally confirmed the overall rod-shaped architecture by small-angle X-ray scattering. The χ value of the fit to the scattering data using InvD1640 structure as model equals 1.09, and the model is in very good agreement with the calculated small-angle X-ray scattering envelope (Fig. 1, D and E). In the crystal structure, small differences between the structure and the small-angle X-ray scattering envelope are seen in the orientation of BIg12, indicating that the junction between BIg12 and BIg13 allows for minor flexibility, in line with the small differences seen between the structures of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In summary, the low r.m.s.d., in comparing the two molecules in the asymmetric unit in conjunction with the very good agreement with the small-angle X-ray scattering data and the high-protease stability (Fig. 1, F and G), suggests that the three domains form a chain with only a low degree of conformational flexibility between BIg13 and AD.Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab Both the BIg12 and BIg13 adopt a β-sandwich fold resembling eukaryotic members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Immunoglobulin superfamily domains have been previously classified into V, C1, C2, I1, and I2 sets according to the strand arrangement (22Bodelón G. Palomino C. Fernández L.Á. Immunoglobulin domains in Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria: from pathogenesis to applications in antibody technologies.FEMS Microbiol.

The first sheet in BIg12 and BIg13 comprises strands ABED, and the second comprises strands A′GFC (Fig. 2A, B, and E). Despite the lower sequence identity between BIg12 and BIg13 (compared with BIg1–12), their structures are highly similar and superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 1.58 Å (93 aligned residues, residues 1640GNLS…ITLA1736, 1737PGAL…VTIT1837) (Fig. 2C). The kink in strand A/A′ and crossover to the opposite sheet (forming strand A′), the presence of strand D, as well as the lack of strand C″ are reminiscent of the I1 set with ABED and A′GFCC′. Even though BIg12 and BIg13 lack strand C′, which has also been observed previously in other I1 set domains (24Tan K. Casasnovas J.M. Liu J.H. Briskin M.J. Springer T.A. Wang J.H. The structure of immunoglobulin superfamily domains 1 and 2 of MAdCAM-1 reveals novel features important for integrin recognition.Structure. 1998; 6 (9655832): 793-80110.1016/S0969-2126(98)00080-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we propose to classify both BIg12 and BIg13 as the I1 set. The contact area between BIg12 and BIg13 comprises an interface of 199 Å2 with a total of 13 interacting residues (seven on BIg12 and six on BIg13). Although these interactions partially stabilize the relative orientation of BIg12–BIg13 and rod-like arrangement, the rather small interface is likely to allow for a minor degree of flexibility in solution, as seen in the small-angle X-ray scattering data (Fig. 1, D and E) and the minor differences between the domain arrangements of the two molecules in the crystal structure. The C-terminal adhesion domain (AD) comprises residues 1838–1976 with a molecular mass of 14.8 kDa. It is mainly composed of β-strands with a single α-helix at the tip of the rod-shaped protein. Interestingly, the AD shares 37 and 27% sequence identity to BIg12 and BIg13, respectively. This is also reflected in the high degree of structural similarity of the two BIg domains with the core structure of the adhesion domain (Fig. 2D). The overall topology of the AD core is reminiscent of an immunoglobulin fold with the two canonical β-sheets, the four-stranded anti-parallel GFCC′-sheet and the three-stranded ABE-sheet (Fig. 2, A, B, and E). Based on this topology, the core of the adhesion domain can be classified as C2 set, due to the lack of strand A/A′ subdivision, lack of strand D, combined with the presence of strand C′. However, apart from the canonical strands present in the immunoglobulin superfamily fold, various modifications of and insertions into the core structure can be observed: (i) an elongated linker region is present between strand A and B; (ii) a short helix is inserted between strands E and F that also includes a disulfide bridge formed between Cys-1859 and Cys-1939; (iii) two short antiparallel β-strands (I/I′) are inserted connecting strands B and C and enlarge the interaction surface with BIg13; moreover, (iv) an additional insertion between strands C and C′ composed of two antiparallel β-strands (C′*/C*) is present, which in combination with (v), the extended strand F, form a third antiparallel three-stranded β-sheet (C′*C*F), sharing strand F with the canonical GFCC′ sheet. Compared with BIg12–BIg13, the BIg13–AD interdomain interface spans a significantly larger area of 317 Å2 attributed to 19 interacting residues in total (9 on BIg13 and 10 on AD). These interactions, the high-protease stability of the BIg13–AD construct (Fig. 1F) and the fit to the small-angle X-ray scattering envelope, suggest that these two domains, BIg13 and AD, form a rigid unit with low-conformational flexibility. Despite the structural homology of the AD core to the immunoglobulin superfamily, taking the insertions into account, the AD adopts a distinct fold. A search for structural similarity to InvD–AD (including the insertions) results only in weak structural similarity (r.m.s.d. >3 Å) with proteins of various functions. These include the following: (i) Adnectin, a monobody with specificity for different proteins (25Lipovsek D. Adnectins: engineered target-binding protein therapeutics.Protein Eng. Des.

Analysis based on the primary sequence, however, reveals four structurally uncharacterized Yersinia proteins in the database, which share more than 65% sequence identity (similarity 76–97%) with the AD of InvD (Fig. 3A). Of these, three belong to different strains of the Y. pseudotuberculosis species, and one belongs to the species Yersinia wautersii. We mapped the sequence conservation on the structure of InvD–AD to identify potential functional patches with a high conservation rate (Fig. 3, B and C), and we identified two major, highly conserved patches on the surface. The first one is a large surface generated by the C′CFG sheet extending to the opposite sheet on strand A and the short antiparallel β-strands inserted between strands B and C. The second patch is located at the tip of the AD and comprises residues of the α-helix and the C*/C′* β-turn. The two highly conserved patches are separated by a deep cleft in the protein with lower conservation, extending from strands C*/C′* to strands E, B, and partially A (Fig. 3, B and C). To gain more information about the contribution of InvD to virulence, we first analyzed the expression pattern of InvD in response to temperature and growth phase using an invD-luxCDABE reporter fusion strain. The invD-luxCDABE was maximally expressed at 37 °C throughout the growth curve. At 25 °C expression was generally lower (Fig. 4A). This is in strong contrast to InvA, which is more strongly expressed at 25 °C to prime the bacteria for uptake during the early stages of the infection (Fig. 4B) (29Isberg R.R. Swain A. Falkow S. Analysis of expression and thermoregulation of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis inv gene with hybrid proteins.Infect. Immun. 1988; 56 (2840402): 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that InvD is required at later time points of the infection. To gain more information about the expression and role of InvD for the infection, BALB/c mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) were orally infected with 9 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII harboring an invD-luxCDABE reporter construct. Bioluminescence was detected in anesthetized mice using the in vivo imaging system. Barely any signal was found in mice infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis expressing/harboring a promoterless luciferase gene as negative control. In contrast, light emission was observed in the intestinal tract of mice infected with bacteria harboring the invD-luxCDABE. No activity or only a very low luciferase activity could be measured before and during the early time points of the infection (after 6 h, 1 day), but a substantial bioluminescent signal was detectable at days 2–4 after infection (Fig. 4C), indicating that the invD gene is expressed during the acute phase of infection. To assess invD expression within different tissues at single cell level, BALB/c mice were infected orally with 3 × 108 CFU of Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII containing a constitutive gapA-dsred2 and an invD-gfpmut3.1 construct. Microscopic analyses of organ cryosections were performed 3 days post-infection, and bacteria were detected and visualized via the DsRed2 signal.

https://openalex.org/W2790013071,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovial inflammation and is the most common chronic condition worldwide today. However, most treatments have focused on pain relief and OA symptoms. For these reasons, many ongoing studies are currently trying to develop efficient and successful therapies based on its pathology. Animal models that mimic the histopathology and symptoms of OA have a critical role in OA research and make it possible to investigate both secondary osteoarthritic changes due to a precedent event such as traumatic injury and naturally occurring changes for the development of therapeutics which can be tested in preclinical and clinical OA trials. We induced OA in various animal models including rats, rabbits and guinea pigs by chemical, surgical and naturally occurring methods. In particular, the Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig is very attractive as an OA animal model because OA slowly progresses which is similar to human primary OA. Thus, this animal model mimics the pathophysiological process and environment of human primary OA. Besides the spontaneous OA model, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) as well as a chemical technique using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) were used to induce OA. We found that ACLT in the rat model induced OA changes in the histology and micro-CT image compared to OVX. The osteoarthritic change significantly increased following ACLT surgery in the rabbit model. Furthermore, we identified that OA pathogenic changes occurred in a time-dependent manner in spontaneous Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. The MIA injection model is a rapid and minimally invasive method for inducing OA in animal models, whereas the spontaneous OA model has a slow and gradual progression of OA similar to human primary OA. We observed that histological OA change was extraordinarily increased at 9 ½ months in the spontaneous OA model, and thus, the grade was similar with that of the MIA model. Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2793050429,"Abstract Liver tumor-initiating cells (TICs), the drivers for liver tumorigenesis, accounts for liver tumor initiation, metastasis, drug resistance and relapse. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway emerges as a critical modulator in liver TIC self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin initiation in liver tumorigenesis and liver TICs is still elusive. Here, we examined the expression pattern of 10 Wnt receptors (FZD1–FZD10), and found only FZD6 is overexpressed along with liver tumorigenesis. What’s more, a divergent lncRNA of FZD6, termed lncFZD6 , is also highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncFZD6 drives liver TIC self-renewal and tumor initiation capacity through FZD6-dependent manner. LncFZD6 interacts with BRG1-embedded SWI/SNF complex and recruits it to FZD6 promoter, and thus drives the transcriptional initiation of FZD6 by chromatin remodeling. WNT5A, a ligand of FZD6, is highly expressed in liver non-TICs and drives the self-renewal of liver TICs through lncFZD6 -BRG1-FZD6-dependent manner. Through FZD6 transcriptional regulation in cis, lncFZD6 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver TICs. LncFZD6 -BRG1-Wnt5A/β-catenin pathway can serve as a target for liver TIC elimination. Altogether, lncFZD6 promotes Wnt/β-catenin activation and liver TIC self-renewal through BRG1-dependent FZD6 expression."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of health education programs based on the self-efficacy theory on foot self-care behaviour for older adults with diabetes.A randomised controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks among older adults with diabetes in elderly care facility in Peninsular Malaysia. Six elderly care facility were randomly allocated by an independent person into two groups (intervention and control). The intervention group (three elderly care facility) received a health education program on foot self-care behaviour while the control group (three elderly care facility) received standard care. Participants were assessed at baseline, and at week-4 and week-12 follow-ups. The primary outcome was foot-self-care behaviour. Foot care self-efficacy (efficacy expectation), foot care outcome expectation, knowledge of foot care and quality of life were the secondary outcomes. Data were analysed with Mixed Design Analysis of Variance using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22.0.184 respondents were recruited but only 76 met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Foot self-care behaviour, foot care self-efficacy (efficacy expectation), foot care outcome expectation and knowledge of foot care improved in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). However, some of these improvements did not significantly differ compared to the control group for QoL physical symptoms and QoL psychosocial functioning (p > 0.05).The self-efficacy enhancing program improved foot self-care behaviour with respect to the delivered program. It is expected that in the future, the self-efficacy theory can be incorporated into diabetes education to enhance foot self-care behaviour for elderly with diabetes living in other institutional care facilities.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12616000210471."

The integration of immigrant communities may be affected by social polarization and spatial segregation. How are these dynamics evolving over time? To what extent the different policies launched to tackle these problems are working? These are critical questions traditionally addressed by studies based on surveys and census data. Such sources are safe to avoid spurious biases, but the data collection becomes an intensive and rather expensive work. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on immigrant integration in 53 world cities by introducing an innovative approach: an analysis of the spatio-temporal communication patterns of immigrant and local communities based on language detection in Twitter and on novel metrics of spatial integration. We quantify the Power of Integration of cities –their capacity to spatially integrate diverse cultures– and characterize the relations between different cultures when acting as hosts or immigrants."
https://openalex.org/W2790702737,"Trastuzumab is the only target to be approved as the first-line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer, but ubiquitous resistance decreases its therapeutic benefit. In this study, we found HER4, phosphorylation HER4 (p-HER4) and the mesenchymal marker Vimentin increased in trastuzumab-resistant cells (MKN45TR and NCI-N87TR), while epithelial markers expressions in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines and animal models decreased. Additionally, silencing HER4 prevented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and led to decreased proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. The expression of YAP1, a vital downstream interacted target of HER4, decreased when HER4 was knocked down. Interestingly, stimulation of NRG1 could compromise the inhibitory impact and rescue cell survival; whereas, transfection of siYAP1 sensitized trastuzumab-treated cells. Expression analysis of the proteins in patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) mice showed that HER4, p-HER4, YAP1, and Vimentin were clearly upregulated in the trastuzumab-resistant mice compared to mice without trastuzumab resistance. However, HER2 and E-cadherin were downregulated in response to continuous treatment with trastuzumab. These findings elucidated that the central role of the HER4-YAP1 axis in trastuzumab resistance of HER2-positive gastric cancer cells through induction of EMT. Hence, regulating the HER4-YAP1 axis might be a promising strategy for clinical interventions in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer."

In this study, DEAD box polypeptide 27 (DDX27) was identified to be highly amplified in both TCGA CRC (474/615) and primary CRC (47/103), which was positively correlated with its mRNA overexpression. High DDX27 mRNA (N = 199) and protein expression (N = 260) predicted poor survival in CRC patients. Ectopic expression of DDX27 increased CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, but suppressed apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of DDX27 exerted opposite effects in vitro and significantly inhibited murine xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Up-regulation of DDX27 enhanced and prolonged TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) was identified as a binding partner of DDX27. DDX27 increased nuclear NPM1 and NF-κB-p65 interaction to enhance DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Silencing NPM1 abrogated DDX27-activating NF-κB signaling and its tumor-promoting function. Together, DDX27 is overexpressed and plays a pivotal oncogenic role in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2790063750,"Background Vector control remains the sole effective method to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission, although a vaccine for dengue has recently become available and testing of its efficacy and coverage is being performed in multiple places. Entomological surveillance is a key factor in alerting authorities to possible outbreaks, but until now natural DENV infection of mosquito populations has been scarcely used as an early warning system to monitor fluctuating prevalence of infected mosquitoes. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of adult and larval/pupae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus with DENV in urban areas in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Methodology/Principal findings Immature insect forms (larvae and pupae) were collected from April 2011 to March 2012, whereas the collection of adults was conducted along 3 years: May 2011 to April 2014. Total RNAs of the samples were extracted and the nested reverse transcriptase PCR assay for detecting and typing DENV was performed. Of the 1333 immature insects collected during the study period, 1186 (89%) were A. aegypti and 147 (11%) A. albopictus. DENV-4 was identified in pools of A. aegypti larvae. The rate of DENV infection in immature A. aegypti was expressed as MIR = 3.37. DENV wasnot detected in immature A. albopictus. A total of 1360 adult female mosquitoes of the Aedes genus were captured from May 2011 to April 2014. Of this total, 1293 were A. aegypti (95%) and 67 were A. albopictus (5%). From the 130 pools studied, 27 (20.7%) were positive for DENV. DENV-1 was identified in 2/27 (7.4%) pools; 1of A. albopictus and 1 of A. aegypti. DENV-2 was identified in only 1/27 (3.7%) A. aegypti pools. DENV-4 was the most prevalent, identified in 24/27 (88.8%) of the positive pools, with 19 being of A. aegypti and 5 of A. albopictus pools. The minimum infection rate for adults of the Aedes genus was 19.8, considering both A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Conclusions/Significance This work represents the most complete study to date on the interaction between dengue viruses and Aedes mosquitoes in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, and raises important questions about a possible role of A. albopictus in the transmission of dengue virus in Brazil."

https://openalex.org/W2792462054,"South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with 19% of the global number of people living with HIV, 15% of new infections and 11% of AIDS-related deaths. Even though HIV testing is mandated in all hospital-based facilities in South Africa (SA), it is rarely implemented in the Emergency Department (ED). The ED provides episodic care to large volumes of undifferentiated who present with unplanned injury or illness. Thus, the ED may provide an opportunity to capture patients with undiagnosed HIV infection missed by clinic-based screening programs.In this prospective exploratory study, we implemented the National South African HIV testing guidelines (counselor initiated non-targeted universal screening with rapid point of care testing) for 24-hours a day at Frere Hospital in the Eastern Cape from September 1st to November 30th, 2016. The purpose of our study was to quantify the burden of undiagnosed HIV infection in a South African ED setting. Furthermore, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the nationally recommended HIV testing strategy in the ED. All patients who presented for care in the ED during the study period, and who were clinically stable and fully conscious, were eligible to be approached by HIV counseling and testing (HCT) staff to receive a rapid point-of-care HIV test. A total of 2355 of the 9583 (24.6%) patients who presented to the ED for care during the study period were approached by the HCT staff, of whom 1714 (72.8%) accepted HIV testing. There was a high uptake of HIV testing (78.6%) among a predominantly male (58%) patient group who mostly presented with traumatic injuries (70.8%). Four hundred (21.6%) patients were HIV positive, including 115 (6.2%) with newly diagnosed HIV infection. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was twice as high in females (29.8%) compared to males (15.4%). Both sexes had a similar prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV infection (6.0% for all females and 6.4% for all males) in the ED.Overall there was high HIV testing acceptance by ED patients. A non-targeted testing approached revealed a high HIV prevalence with a significant burden of undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED. Unfortunately, a counselor-driven HIV testing approach fell short of meeting the testing needs in this setting, with over 75% of ED patients not approached by HCT staff."

We have previously shown that PLCΕ-catalyzed hydrolysis of Golgi-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in cardiac myocytes depends on G protein βγ subunits released upon stimulation with endothelin-1. PLCΕ binds and is directly activated by Ras family small GTPases, but whether they directly interact with Gβγ has not been demonstrated. To identify PLCΕ domains that interact with Gβγ, here we designed various single substitutions and truncations of WT PLCΕ and tested them for activation by Gβγ in transfected COS-7 cells. Deletion of only a single domain in PLCΕ was not sufficient to completely block its activation by Gβγ, but blocked activation by Ras. Simultaneous deletion of the C-terminal RA2 domain and the N-terminal CDC25 and cysteine-rich domains completely abrogated PLCΕ activation by Gβγ, but activation by the GTPase Rho was retained. In vitro reconstitution experiments further revealed that purified Gβγ directly interacts with a purified fragment of PLCΕ (PLCΕ-PH-RA2) and increases PIP2 hydrolysis.

We recently found that Gβγ-dependent regulation of PLCΕ at the Golgi apparatus in cardiac myocytes regulates local PI4P hydrolysis, protein kinase D (PKD) activation, gene expression, and hypertrophy (18Malik S. deRubio R.G. Trembley M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Smrcka A.V. G protein βγ subunits regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a perinuclear Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate hydrolysis pathway.Mol.

Thus understanding how PLCΕ is regulated by Gβγ is important to fully understand this process. Here we identified two independent domains of PLCΕ that are involved in its regulation by Gβγ and demonstrate direct interactions between Gβγ and PLCΕ. These data place PLCΕ activation directly downstream of GPCRs. G protein–dependent activation of PLCΕ is difficult to reconstitute with purified G proteins (12Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. Phospholipase CΕ: a novel Ras effector.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11179219): 743-75410.1093/emboj/20.4.743Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K.

Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Activation of phospholipase C-Ε by heterotrimeric G protein βγ-subunits.J. Biol.

When Gβ and γ subunits are transfected in the absence of transfected PLC, increased IP accumulation is observed because of stimulation of endogenous PLCs present in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, B and C) (19Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Activation of phospholipase Cβ2 by the α and βγ subunits of trimeric GTP-binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90 (8389480): 5297-530110.1073/pnas.90.11.5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, cells co-transfected with Gβγ and PLCΕ markedly increased IP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm that free Gβγ is necessary for activation of PLCΕ in COS-7 cells, we included Gαi1 in the co-transfection to bind and sequester free Gβγ. In the presence of Gαi1, Gβγ-dependent accumulation of IP was inhibited (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that activation of PLCΕ by Gβγ requires free Gβγ and confirms previously reported Gβγ-dependent activation of PLCΕ (16Wing M.R. Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Activation of phospholipase C-Ε by heterotrimeric G protein βγ-subunits.J. Biol.

Gutkind J.S. Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase pathway mediated by G-protein βγ subunits.Nature. 1994; 369 (8196770): 418-42010.1038/369418a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Mutation of the lysine residues 2150 and 2152 in the PLCΕ RA2 domain to glutamate (Fig. 2A) inhibits activation of PLCΕ by Ras (12Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. Phospholipase CΕ: a novel Ras effector.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11179219): 743-75410.1093/emboj/20.4.743Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the mutants showed similar expression of PLCΕ WT and Lys-Glu (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether activation of PLCΕ by Gβγ in COS-7 cells is mediated indirectly through endogenous activated Ras, we tested PLCΕ 2150/2152 Lys-Glu for activation by Gβγ and Rho to rule out indirect activation by endogenous Ras. Co-transfection of PLCΕ Lys-Glu with Gβγ or constitutively active Rho (RhoG14V) in COS-7 cells resulted in marked accumulation of IP (Fig. 2C, left and middle panels) in contrast to constitutively activated Ras (RasG12V) co-transfected cells (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results confirm previously published data indicating that activation of PLCΕ by Gβγ or Rho is independent of endogenous Ras activation in COS-7 cells (16Wing M.R. Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Activation of phospholipase C-Ε by heterotrimeric G protein βγ-subunits.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11641393): 48257-4826110.1074/jbc.C100574200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether the RA2 domain of PLCΕ is required for its activation by Gβγ, we next deleted residues 2114–2281 composing the RA2 domain and tested for activation by Gβγ, Rho, and Ras (Fig. 2A). The unstimulated basal activity of PLCΕ-ΔRA2 when co-transfected with empty vector was significantly lower than PLCΕ WT despite similar levels of expression (Fig. 2, B and D). RasG12V was unable to activate this mutant as expected (Fig. 2D, right panel). Co-transfection of this mutant with RhoG14V caused significant accumulation of IP but not to the levels of PLCΕ WT indicating the enzyme is still active and can be activated (Fig. 2D, middle panel). Gβγ transfection resulted in a small but statistically significant increase in IP accumulation when PLCΕ-ΔRA2 was co-transfected compared to control with Gβγ only transfected (Fig. 2D, left panel). The reduced levels of IP accumulation may be because of the lower basal activity of PLCΕ-ΔRA2. However, because the Rho activation is relatively robust it suggests that the RA2 domain is important for Gβγ stimulation. This will be explored in more detail later. To investigate the involvement of the N-terminal domains of PLCΕ in Gβγ-mediated activation, a series of N-terminal truncations of PLCΕ were created (Fig. 3A). It has been reported that the N-terminal domains are not essential for PLCΕ activation by Gβγ or Rho (17Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. Direct activation of phospholipase C-Ε by Rho.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12900402): 41253-4125810.1074/jbc.M306904200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The basal activity of PLCΕ-CDC25-RA2 was significantly higher than PLCΕ WT when co-transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3C), whereas PLCΕ-PH-RA2 and EF-RA2 had decreased basal activity compared with PLCΕ WT (Fig. 3, D and E). There was no correlation between expression levels of the mutant PLCΕ proteins (Fig. 3B) and observed basal activities (Fig. 3, C–E). PLCΕ-PH-RA2 and EF-RA2 had significantly reduced capacity for activation by free Gβγ, whereas activation by RhoG14V was largely retained (Fig. 3, C–E). The reduced accumulation of IP in the presence of the mutants (PH-RA1 and EF-RA2) and Gβγ or RhoG14V may be because of their lower basal activity, however, Gβγ stimulation of the EF-RA2 PLCΕ was still minimal. Overall, our results indicate that deletion of the N-terminal domains is not sufficient to completely inhibit activation of PLCΕ by Gβγ but significantly reduces it. The results of the foregoing experiments could indicate that some PLCΕ activation by Gβγ requires interaction with only the catalytic core. An alternate hypothesis is that PLCΕ activation by Gβγ may involve multiple interaction sites at the C terminus and the N terminus. To test these hypotheses, we made a series of combined truncations of PLCΕ that lack both the N- and C-terminal domains as shown in Fig. 4A. COS-7 cells were transfected with either Gβγ or RhoG14V and one of the mutant PLCΕ constructs shown in Fig. 4A. A Western blot showing expression levels of these constructs is seen in Fig. 4B. Although the basal activity of CDC25-RA1 is significantly lower than PLCΕ WT as shown in Fig. 4C, co-transfection with Gβγ resulted in a small but statistically significant accumulation of IP relative to control without PLCΕ co-expression. RhoG14V was also able to activate this mutant. Deletion of the CDC25 domain completely eliminated Gβγ-dependent accumulation of IP above levels of cells transfected with Gβγ alone (Fig. 4D, left panel). In contrast, co-transfection of this PLCΕ mutant with RhoG14V resulted in some Rho-stimulated accumulation of IP, confirming that this construct can be activated to some level (Fig. 4D, right panel). EF-RA1 is also not activated upon co-transfection with Gβγ. In this case co-transfection with RhoG14V also did not result in accumulation of IP above levels of cells transfected with Gβγ or Rho alone (Fig. 4E). These data together suggest that PLCΕ activation by Gβγ requires both the N (cysteine-rich and CDC25 domains) and C termini (RA2 domain) for full activation of PLCΕ. Confounding interpretation of these experiments is the reduction in basal activity associated with many of the domain deletion mutations. In particular, the EF-RA1 construct shows little basal activity and no activation by either Rho or Gβγ. We hypothesized that this could be because of a loss in membrane association of the enzyme. To test this, we designed a EF-RA1 variant with a C-terminal CAAX box to allow for C-terminal prenylation and constitutive membrane localization as shown in previous studies (21Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Structural and mechanistic insights into Ras association domains of phospholipase CΕ.Mol.

Western blot analysis of the mutants showed similar levels of expression of EF-RA1 and EF-RA1 CAAX, which were slightly increased relative to PLCΕ WT expression (Fig. 5B). In contrast to EF-RA1 transfected cells, EF-RA1 CAAX transfected cells showed elevated basal activity above empty vector transfected cells, indicating that this construct was indeed active when localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the EF-RA1 CAAX mutant rescued activation by Rho but not Gβγ (Fig. 5C). The data indicate that a PLCΕ mutant lacking the cysteine-rich, CDC25, and RA2 domains can be activated by Rho when targeted to the membrane, but cannot be stimulated by Gβγ. These data strongly support these domains as being required for Gβγ activation. To test whether Gβγ directly interacts with PLCΕ, PLCΕ truncations lacking the cysteine-rich and CDC25 domains (PH-RA2), or the cysteine-rich, CDC25, and RA2 domains (PH-RA1) were expressed and purified (Figs. 6A and 7A). To test for direct binding of Gβγ to PLCΕ, purified biotinylated Gβγ (bGβγ) was mixed with purified PLCΕ-PH-RA2 and precipitated with neutravidin beads. PLCΕ-PH-RA2 was readily detected associated with beads bound to bGβγ, but not beads alone (Fig. 6B). The two bands observed are likely the result of proteolysis that occurs during the incubation. To test the specificity of Gβγ interaction with PLCΕ, purified PLCΕ-PH-RA2 and bGβγ were incubated with or without Gαi1-GDP to sequester free Gβγ. Gαi1-GDP strongly inhibited the pulldown of PLCΕ-PH-RA2 by bGβγ (Fig. 6, B and C), demonstrating a direct and specific interaction between PLCΕ and Gβγ.Figure 7Deletion of the PLCΕ RA2 domain inhibits binding and activation by Gβγ.

Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. Direct activation of phospholipase C-Ε by Rho.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12900402): 41253-4125810.1074/jbc.M306904200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Gandarillas N.L. Bunney T.D. Josephs M.B. Gierschik P. Katan M. In vitro reconstitution of activation of PLCΕ by Ras and Rho GTPases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 462 (19160682): 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to test the specificity of Gβγ activation of PLCΕ, purified PLCΕ-PH-RA2 and Gβγ were incubated with or without Gαi1-GDP in reconstituted lipid vesicles containing inositol PIP2, and the amount of [3H]IP3 produced was measured. Fig. 6D shows a small but statistically significant increase in PIP2 hydrolysis by PLCΕ-PH-RA2 when Gβγ is added. This activation was inhibited by Gαi1-GDP confirming that this increase is through direct interactions of PLCΕ with Gβγ. This is also the first direct demonstration of Gβγ-dependent activation of PLCΕ using reconstituted proteins. Our data from the COS-7 cell co-transfection experiments indicate that PLCΕ activation by Gβγ requires both the N terminus (cysteine-rich and CDC25 domains) and C terminus (RA2 domain) that are potentially compensatory in the absence of one or the other. Therefore, we hypothesized that if PLCΕ is directly regulated by Gβγ binding to the RA2 domain, Gβγ will bind to PLCΕ-PH-RA2 but not PH-RA1. To test this, purified bGβγ and N- and C-terminally truncated PLCΕ mutants (PH-RA2 or PH-RA1) were incubated and then precipitated with neutravidin beads. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, PLCΕ-PH-RA2 was strongly pulled down with bGβγ bound to beads. In contrast PLCΕ-PH-RA1 was only weakly pulled down with bGβγ. We next tested the ability of purified Gβγ to activate purified PLCΕ-PH-RA2 or PH-RA1 in reconstituted lipid vesicles containing [3H]PIP2. PH-RA1 had significantly less basal activity than PH-RA2 (Fig. 7D). Gβγ also activated PLCΕ-PH-RA2, but not PH-RA1, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7D) consistent with the decreased binding of Gβγ to PH-RA1 (Fig. 7B) and the lack of activation of this construct in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4D). Overall, these results suggest that the activation of PLCΕ involves a direct interaction with Gβγ that requires the C terminus RA2 domain and the N-terminal cysteine-rich and CDC25 domains. In our previous work we showed that inhibiting Gβγ with the C terminus of G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2ct), or with gallein, inhibited PLCΕ-dependent PI4P hydrolysis in cardiac myocytes (18Malik S. deRubio R.G. Trembley M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Smrcka A.V. G protein βγ subunits regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a perinuclear Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate hydrolysis pathway.Mol.

To date, direct regulation of PLCΕ by Gβγ has not been reported. If indeed free Gβγ subunits activate PLCΕ, Gαi1-GDP should form an inactive heterotrimer with Gβγ, preventing PLCΕ activation. We confirmed that co-transfection of cells with cDNAs encoding Gβγ, PLCΕ, and Gαi1 completely prevented activation of PLCΕ mediated by free Gβγ. Our results also demonstrate that Gβγ directly interacts with PLCΕ to increase PIP2 hydrolysis. In addition, the results from domain deletion analysis of PLCΕ show an unexpected involvement of the RA2 and CDC25 domains in the activation of PLCΕ by Gβγ. Regulation of PLCΕ by Ras is through direct binding to the RA2 domain (12Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. Phospholipase CΕ: a novel Ras effector.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11179219): 743-75410.1093/emboj/20.4.743Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The regulation of PLCΕ by Gβγ is not understood. It was previously reported that PLCΕ lacking the N-terminal domains retained activation by Gβγ subunits, Ras, and Rho, suggesting activation was not dependent upon the PLCΕ N-terminal domains (17Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. Direct activation of phospholipase C-Ε by Rho.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12900402): 41253-4125810.1074/jbc.M306904200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, it was also reported that PLCΕ-CDC25-C2 can be stimulated by Gβγ subunits, but not by Ras, suggesting that Gβγ activation was independent of the RA2 domain (17Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. Direct activation of phospholipase C-Ε by Rho.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12900402): 41253-4125810.1074/jbc.M306904200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our results generally support these findings. The most compelling data indicating that Gβγ may be interacting with both the CDC25 domain and the RA2 domain is that simultaneous deletion of the N-terminal cysteine-rich and CDC25 domains and the RA2 C-terminal domain resulted in complete loss of activation by free Gβγ, but not Rho (Fig. 4D). Further evidence that the CDC25 and RA2 domains interact with Gβγ is that simultaneous deletion of the N-terminal cysteine-rich, CDC25, and PH domains and the RA2 C-terminal domain led to loss of PLCΕ activation. Addition of a CAAX sequence to target this mutant to the membrane rescued Rho activation but not Gβγ activation (Figure 4, Figure 5). Because deletion of the cysteine-rich domain alone has no effect on Gβγ regulation, these data support a role for both the N-terminal CDC25 domain and the C-terminal RA2 domain in Gβγ-dependent activation of PLCΕ. The inability of Gβγ to activate the PLCΕ-PH-RA1 mutant in COS-7 cells implies that this mutant lacks a binding site for Gβγ. The purified PLCΕ-PH-RA1 protein had enzymatic activity but was not activated by Gβγ and only weakly bound to Gβγ in pulldown assays for protein binding supporting the COS-7 cell data. Purified PLCΕ-PH-RA2, which retains one of the two Gβγ-binding sites (RA2) implicated in the transfection experiments, bound Gβγ more strongly than PLCΕ-PH-RA1, and was activated by Gβγ, implicating the RA2 domain as a binding site for Gβγ. These results demonstrate for the first time that PLCΕ is directly stimulated by G protein βγ subunits and a requirement for the RA2 domain. The activation of PLCΕ-PH-RA2 by Gβγ in vitro may be weak because it is missing the important CDC25 domain–binding site, or because as has been raised previously, PLCΕ activation is notoriously difficult to activate in vitro. We have been unable to purify full-length PLCΕ to discriminate between these possibilities. In summary we have demonstrated that PLCΕ is directly regulated by Gβγ through binding to the RA2 domain with additional contributions from the CDC25 domain. Potential mechanisms for regulation of PLCΕ by Gβγ are shown in Fig. 8. In the first scenario, free Gβγ interacts with and activates PLCΕ by binding to the N-terminal CDC25 domain and to the C-terminal RA2 domain through two independent sites, and interaction with both is required for full activation. An alternative model is that, in the three-dimensional structure of PLCΕ, the RA2 and CDC25 domains are in close proximity and form a single Gβγ-binding site. Our previous observation using a neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) model of cardiac hypertrophy showed that PLCΕ-mediated PI4P hydrolysis at the Golgi is Gβγ-dependent (18Malik S. deRubio R.G. Trembley M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Smrcka A.V. G protein βγ subunits regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a perinuclear Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate hydrolysis pathway.Mol.

Furthermore, PLCΕ is also implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and has been shown to localize to a subcellular compartment in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (23Zhang L. Malik S. Pang J. Wang H. Park K. Yule D. Blaxall B.C. Smrcka A.V. Phospholipase CΕ hydrolyzes perinuclear phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to regulate cardiac hypertrophy.Cell. 2013; 153 (23540699): 216-22710.1016/j.cell.2013.02.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that Gβγ activation of PLCΕ is direct and likely occurs at the Golgi apparatus in cardiac myocytes. These studies extend our knowledge of the regulation of PLCΕ by Gβγ and could result in novel strategies for targeting PLCΕ regulation in hypertrophy, heart failure, and other diseases linked to PLCΕ activation. Full-length WT rat PLCΕ pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-FLAG (a kind gift of Dr. Grant Kelley) was used in most experiments. AVI-Gβ1, Gγ2, and enhanced YFP (EYFP) were in pCI-neo vector. HA-tagged HRasG12V was in pDCR. RhoG14V was in 3× HA pcDNA3.1+ vector. Gαi1 was in pcDNA3.1+. Rabbit anti-PLCΕ (2163) was used as described previously (24Wang H. Oestreich E.A. Maekawa N.

Variations of the WT rat PLCΕ pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-FLAG were generated using QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) and manufacturer’s protocol followed. The following constructs were verified by sequencing: pCMV-scriptPLCΕ Lys-Glu–FLAG (lysine residues 2150 and 2152 in the RA2 domain changed to glutamate), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-CDC-RA2-FLAG (Δ2–393), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-PH-RA2-FLAG (Δ2–836), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-EF-RA2-FLAG (Δ2–1197), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-CDC25-RA1-FLAG (394–2113), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-PH-RA1-FLAG (837–2113), pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-EF-RA1-FLAG (1198–2113). pCMV-scriptPLCΕ-EF-RA1-CAAX (C-terminal amino acids 175–188 of KRAS4B (KKKKKKSKTKCVIM) was made using a modified Quik Change Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis protocol. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-PLCΕ 2163 antibody. The cDNAs PLCΕ-PH-RA2 (837–2281) and PH-RA1 (837–2098) variants used for in vitro assays were subcloned into pFastBac HTA to yield N-terminal His-tagged protein. Baculoviruses were generated using a recombinant baculovirus system (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells (Invitrogen or Expression Systems) were used for virus production and protein expression. Cells were infected with baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1, harvested at 48–72 h post infection, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC. COS-7 cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105cells per well and maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. The following day, indicated vectors were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent (2 μl Lipofectamine per 1 μg of DNA). Total DNA varied from 700 to 900 ng per well and included EYFP control vector as necessary to maintain equal amount of DNA per well within individual experiments. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the culture medium was changed to low-inositol Ham’s F-10 medium (Gibco) containing 1.5 μCi/well Myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (Perkin Elmer) for 12–16 h. Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphate was quantitated after the addition of 10 mm LiCl for 1 h to inhibit inositol monophosphate phosphatases. Media were aspirated and cells washed with 1× PBS, followed by the addition of ice-cold 50 mm formic acid to lyse cells. Soluble cell lysates containing [3H]inositol phosphate were transferred onto Dowex AGX8 chromatography columns to separate total IP by anion exchange chromatography. Columns were washed with 50 mm and eluted with 100 mm formic acid into scintillation vials containing scintillation fluid and counted.

This emerging crisis was identified initially through a telemetry study when 7 of 19 of collared elephants were poached within a year of being fitted with a satellite-GPS collar. Subsequent follow up of ground teams confirmed the human caused death or disappearance of at least 19 elephants, including the seven collared individuals, within a 35 km2 area in less than two years. The carcasses of 40 additional elephants were found in areas located across south-central Myanmar once systematic surveys began by our team and collaborators. In addition to the extreme rate of loss, this study documents the targeting of elephants for their skin instead of the more common ivory, an increasing trend in Myanmar. Intensive research programs focused on other conservation problems identified this issue and are now encouraging local authorities to prioritize anti-poaching efforts and improve conservation policies within the country. Myanmar represents one of the last remaining countries in Asia with substantial wildlands suitable for elephants. Increasing rates of human-elephant conflict and poaching events in this country pose a dire threat to the global population."
https://openalex.org/W2793756681,"Background Injuries are very common and can occur at any point of time in a day. Unintended injuries in kindergarten children are the most common and need immediate life saving care which is known as first aid. This study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors of first aid among kindergarten teachers of Lideta sub-city Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among kindergarten teachers. Data was collected using pretested, structured and self-administered questionnaire S1 File. The collected data was entered in to Epi Data version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between kindergarten teachers’ knowledge and attitudes towards first aid and different variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI and p<0.05 were computed to determine the presence of the association. Result One hundred and ninety-four teachers participated in the study with a response rate of 95%. Only 40% of the teachers were knowledgeable and 75% of them had positive attitude for first aid. Eighty percent of teachers encountered with children in need of first aid. Kindergarten teachers older than 35 years [AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: (1.02, 16.9)], five years’ experience [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.6)], having previous first aid training [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.7)], source of first aid information and teachers serving in private kindergarten are associated with having knowledge of first aid. Long time experience, type of kindergarten, previous training, and exposure to children in need of first aid were positive association with attitude towards first aid. Conclusion Low first aid knowledge and high positive attitude among kindergarten teachers. Having long time experience, being older age, previous first aid training, and serving in private kindergarten were positively associated with first aid knowledge and positive attitude. Creating awareness and including first aid courses in the kindergarten teachers’ curriculum need to be considered."

It is not known, however, how the transport of this protein cargo is achieved. Favored models suggest that the TatA component supports transport by weakening the membrane upon full translocon assembly. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism, we now demonstrate in vivo that the N terminus of TatA can indeed destabilize the membrane, resulting in a lowered membrane energization in growing cells. We found that in full-length TatA, this effect is counterbalanced by its amphipathic helix. Consistent with these observations, the TatA N terminus induced proton leakage in vitro, indicating membrane destabilization. Fluorescence quenching data revealed that substrate binding causes the TatA hinge region and the N-terminal part of the TatA amphipathic helix to move toward the membrane surface. In the presence of TatBC, substrate binding also reduced the exposure of a specific region in the amphipathic helix, indicating a participation of TatBC. Of note, the substrate-induced reorientation of the TatA amphipathic helix correlated with detectable membrane weakening. We therefore propose a two-state model in which membrane-destabilizing effects of the short TatA membrane anchor are compensated by the membrane-immersed N-terminal part of the amphipathic helix in a resting state. We conclude that substrate binding to TatABC complexes switches the position of the amphipathic helix, which locally weakens the membrane on demand to allow substrate translocation across the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2791342636,"Increasing fishing effort has caused declines in shark populations worldwide. Understanding biological and ecological characteristics of sharks is essential to effectively implement management measures, but to fully understand drivers of fishing pressure social factors must be considered through multidisciplinary and integrated approaches. The present study aimed to use fisher and trader knowledge to describe the shark catch and product supply chain in Northeastern Brazil, and evaluate perceptions regarding the regional conservation status of shark species. Non-systematic observations and structured individual interviews were conducted with experienced fishers and traders. The demand and economic value of shark fins has reportedly decreased over the last 10 years while the shark meat trade has increased slightly, including a small increase in the average price per kilogram of meat. Several threatened shark species were reportedly often captured off shore and traded at local markets. This reported and observed harvest breaches current Brazilian environmental laws. Fishing communities are aware of population declines of several shark species, but rarely take action to avoid capture of sharks. The continuing capture of sharks is mainly due to a lack of knowledge of environmental laws, lack of enforcement by responsible authorities, and difficulties encountered by fishers in finding alternative income streams. National and regional conservation measures are immediately required to reduce overfishing on shark populations in Northeastern Brazil. Social and economic improvements for poor fishing communities must also be implemented to achieve sustainable fisheries."

Records of 600 PTCL patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2014 were analyzed including PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS, 174 patients), angoimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL, 144), ALK+anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 74), ALK-ALCL (103), extranodal NK-cell lymphoma (ENKL, 54), or others (51). With a median follow up of 57 months, 13 patients (4 PTCL-NOS, 1 AITL, 4 ALK+ALCL, 2 ALK-ALCL, 2 ENKL) experienced CNS relapse. One-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse were 1.5% (95%CI: 0.7-2.8%) and 2.1% (95%CI: 1.1-3.5%), respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 1.8% in PTCL-NOS, 0.7% in AITL, 5.4% in ALK+ALCL, 2.1% in ALK-ALCL and 3.7% in ENKL. Extranodal involvement >1 site was the only significant factor associated with higher chance of CNS relapse (HR: 4.9, 95%CI: 1.6-15.0, p = 0.005). Patients with ALK+ALCL who had extranodal involvement >1 (N = 19) had very high risk of CNS relapse with one year cumulative incidence of 17% (95%CI: 4%-37%), all occurring within six months after diagnosis. All patients with CNS relapse eventually died (median, 1.5 months; range, 0.1-10.1 months). CNS relapse in patients with PTCL is rare event but the risk varies by subtype. ALK+ALCL patients with extranodal involvement >1 site have a very high risk of early CNS relapse, and thus evaluation of CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis and possible CNS-directed prophylaxis may be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2793105902,"Introduction Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up. Methods The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations. Results Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated. Based on results of reliability and validity-testing including subjects with JIA (n = 70) and non-JIA controls (n = 19), seven measures received a “high recommendation” score. Those measures were associated with posterior mandibular height, occlusal cant, mandibular asymmetry, mandibular inclination, and anterior/posterior lower face height. Nine other measures were “moderately recommended” and five received a “somewhat recommendation” score. Conclusion Seven morphometric measures were considered very useful in the 3D assessment of growth deviation in patients with TMJ disease associated with JIA. These variables can be used to standardize the description of dentofacial deformities and to plan corrective interventions."

Using the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, we analyze the campaign descriptions and the performance of over 70,000 projects. We look empirically at the effect of information quantity (word count) on funding success (as measure by amount raised and number of backers). Within this empirical approach, we test whether an excessive amount of information will affect funding success. To do so, we test for the non-linearity (quadratic) effect of our independent variable (word count) using regression analysis. Consistent with the hypothesis that excess information will negatively affect funds raised and number of contributors, we observe a consistent U-shaped relationship between campaign text length and overall success which suggest that an optimal number of words exists within crowdfunding texts and that going over this point will reduce a project’s chance of fundraising success."
https://openalex.org/W2791286752,"Urbanization is a global process that has taken billions of people from the rural countryside to concentrated urban centers, adding pressure to existing water resources. Many cities are specifically reliant on renewable freshwater regularly refilled by precipitation, rather than fossil groundwater or desalination. A precipitationshed can be considered the “watershed of the sky” and identifies the origin of precipitation falling in a given region. In this paper, we use this concept to determine the sources of precipitation that supply renewable water in the watersheds of the largest cities of the world. We quantify the sources of precipitation for 29 megacities and analyze their differences between dry and wet years. Our results reveal that 19 of 29 megacities depend for more than a third of their water supply on evaporation from land. We also show that for many of the megacities, the terrestrial dependence is higher in dry years. This high dependence on terrestrial evaporation for their precipitation exposes these cities to potential land-use change that could reduce the evaporation that generates precipitation. Combining indicators of water stress, moisture recycling exposure, economic capacity, vegetation-regulated evaporation, land-use change, and dry-season moisture recycling sensitivity reveals four highly vulnerable megacities (Karachi, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing). A further six megacities were found to have medium vulnerability with regard to their water supply. We conclude that understanding how upwind landscapes affect downwind municipal water resources could be a key component for understanding the complexity of urban water security."
https://openalex.org/W2791137056,"In this paper, explicit Model Predictive Control(MPC) is employed for automated lane-keeping systems. MPC has been regarded as the key to handle such constrained systems. However, the massive computational complexity of MPC, which employs online optimization, has been a major drawback that limits the range of its target application to relatively small and/or slow problems. Explicit MPC can reduce this computational burden using a multi-parametric quadratic programming technique(mp-QP). The control objective is to derive an optimal front steering wheel angle at each sampling time so that autonomous vehicles travel along desired paths, including straight, circular, and clothoid parts, at high entry speeds. In terms of the design of the proposed controller, a method of choosing weighting matrices in an optimization problem and the range of horizons for path-following control are described through simulations. For the verification of the proposed controller, simulation results obtained using other control methods such as MPC, Linear-Quadratic Regulator(LQR), and driver model are employed, and CarSim, which reflects the features of a vehicle more realistically than MATLAB/Simulink, is used for reliable demonstration."

Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios."

Seminars featuring medical TV series such as “House MD” might serve as door-opener to attract medical students to learn more about rare diseases. The TV series “House MD” is troublesome for the main character Dr. House is an excellent diagnostician but at the same time a rather misanthropic person. Therefore, lecturing medicine with the help of “House MD” requires constant evaluation. From 2008 to 2016 we are using the well-known TV series “House MD” continuously to attract medical students and teach them about rare diseases as well as diagnostic strategies. We collected from 213 students a detailed questionnaire assessing their learning experience. 76.6% of our students (n = 157) reported to watching medical dramas on a regular basis. The Dr. House seminar was compared to traditional seminars and our students reported an improved learning effect (69.9%), better concentration (89.7%), higher motivation to participate (88.7%), and more fun (86.7%) (all p<0.001). The students see Dr. House’s behavior quite critically. Likert assessment on a 5-point scale identified strong disagreement with Dr. House´s interpersonal skills in dealing with his colleagues (median = 1) and patients (median = 1). At the same time, the students strongly agreed with his outstanding diagnostic (median = 5) and therapeutic capabilities (median = 4). Medical students visiting a Dr. House teaching seminar are highly motivated to learn more about rare diseases. They were positively influenced by TV series such as Dr. House to improve their diagnostic and clinical skills. At the same time, they are critical enough not to see Dr. House as a role model for their own personality. Well performed medical TV shows such as Dr. House can successfully be used in an educational setting to motivate medical students to come into seminars to learn more about rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2793588056,"Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana."
https://openalex.org/W2792580573,"Dystrophin, encoded by the DMD gene, is critical for maintaining plasma membrane integrity during muscle contraction events. Mutations in the DMD gene disrupting the reading frame prevent dystrophin production and result in severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); in-frame internal deletions allow production of partly functional internally deleted dystrophin and result in less severe Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Many known BMD deletions occur in dystrophin's central domain, generally considered to be a monotonous rod-shaped domain based on the knowledge of spectrin family proteins. However, the effects caused by these deletions, ranging from asymptomatic to severe BMD, argue against the central domain serving only as a featureless scaffold. We undertook structural studies combining small-angle X-ray scattering and molecular modeling in an effort to uncover the structure of the central domain, as dystrophin has been refractory to characterization. We show that this domain appears to be a tortuous and complex filament that is profoundly disorganized by the most severe BMD deletion (loss of exons 45–47). Despite the preservation of large parts of the binding site for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in this deletion, computational approaches failed to recreate the association of dystrophin with nNOS. This observation is in agreement with a strong decrease of nNOS immunolocalization in muscle biopsies, a parameter related to the severity of BMD phenotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2794418354,"This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011-12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved 'district' and 'community' characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother's socio-economic status such as her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the maternal autonomy indicators: mother's ability to move around freely and her control over resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institutional birth, mother's antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration."
https://openalex.org/W2789483697,"Introduction Amongst patients with incurable cancer approaching death, cachexia is common and associated with adverse outcomes. The term cachexia lacks a universally accepted definition and there is no consensus regarding which variables are to be measured. Furthermore, an elevated C-reactive protein is a common clinical challenge in this patient group. This study aims to add to the ongoing discussion regarding the definition of cancer cachexia and to study the role of C-reactive protein and s-albumin in this context. Material and methods A 1-year cohort, consisting of 155 cancer patients enrolled in a specialized palliative home care team in the city of Östersund, Sweden, that were deceased during the year of 2015 was studied. Laboratory measures were studied within 0–30 and 31–60 days prior to death. C-reactive protein >10 mg/L and coinciding s-albumin <30 g/L was referred to as “laboratory cachexia”. Also, the number of days from the first found “laboratory cachexia” until death was noted. Results The prevalence of “laboratory cachexia” was 85% 0–30 days prior to death compared to 66% 31–60 days prior to death (p<0.01). The majority of patients (75%) had an onset of “laboratory cachexia” within 0–120 days prior to death, with a median of 47 days. The median values for C-reactive protein and s-albumin within 0–30 days prior to death were 84mg/L and 23g/L respectively. Discussion Could markedly deranged values of C-reactive protein and s-albumin, such as found in this study, signal a relatively short remaining survival time in patients with incurable cancer and no clinical signs of ongoing infection? The role of “laboratory cachexia” in this context as well as the cut off values for the laboratory measures included may be further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2790830327,"There is growing interest in the use of critical slowing down and critical fluctuations as early warning signals for critical transitions in different complex systems. However, while some studies found them effective, others found the opposite. In this paper, we investigated why this might be so, by testing three commonly used indicators: lag-1 autocorrelation, variance, and low-frequency power spectrum at anticipating critical transitions in the very-high-frequency time series data of the Australian Dollar-Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc-Japanese Yen exchange rates. Besides testing rising trends in these indicators at a strict level of confidence using the Kendall-tau test, we also required statistically significant early warning signals to be concurrent in the three indicators, which must rise to appreciable values. We then found for our data set the optimum parameters for discovering critical transitions, and showed that the set of critical transitions found is generally insensitive to variations in the parameters. Suspecting that negative results in the literature are the results of low data frequencies, we created time series with time intervals over three orders of magnitude from the raw data, and tested them for early warning signals. Early warning signals can be reliably found only if the time interval of the data is shorter than the time scale of critical transitions in our complex system of interest. Finally, we compared the set of time windows with statistically significant early warning signals with the set of time windows followed by large movements, to conclude that the early warning signals indeed provide reliable information on impending critical transitions. This reliability becomes more compelling statistically the more events we test."

The age-related decrease in sperm quality as indicated by reduction of sperm concentration, sperm mobility and osmotic tolerance was associated to variation in the level of specific water-soluble and liposoluble metabolites. In particular, the highest levels of isoleucine, phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine and valine were found at 32 weeks of age, whereas aspartate, lactate, creatine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine levels increased during the ageing. Lipid composition also changed during the ageing: diunsaturated fatty acids level increased from 32 to 56 weeks of age, whereas a reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids content was observed at 56 weeks. The untargeted approach attempts to give a wider picture of metabolic changes occurring in ageing suggesting that the reduction of sperm quality could be due to a progressive deficiency in mitochondrial energy producing systems, as also prompted by the negative correlation found between sperm mobility and the increase in certain mitochondrial metabolites."

Unfortunately, this paper indicates that their protocol is still vulnerable to the user impersonation attack, privileged insider attack and server spoofing attack. Furthermore, their protocol cannot provide the perfect forward secrecy. As a remedy of these aforementioned problems, we propose a biometrics-based authentication and key agreement scheme for multi-server environments. Compared with various related schemes, our protocol achieves the stronger security and provides more functionality properties. Besides, the proposed protocol shows the satisfactory performances in respect of storage requirement, communication overhead and computational cost. Thus, our protocol is suitable for expert systems and other multi-server architectures. Consequently, the proposed protocol is more appropriate in the distributed networks."

Unfortunately, this scale is currently unavailable in Japanese, precluding its widespread use in Japanese hospitals.To translate and verify the validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the FLACC Behavioral Scale.Back-translation was first conducted by eight medical researchers, then an available sample of patients at the University of Tsukuba Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (from May 2017 to August 2017) was enrolled in a clinical study. Two researchers evaluated the validity of the translated FLACC Behavioral Scale by weighted kappa coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Observational pain was simultaneously measured by the visual analog scale (VAS obs) and reliability was evaluated by correlation analysis.The original author approved the translation. For the clinical study, a total of 121 observations were obtained from 24 pediatric patients. Agreement between observers was highly correlated for each of the FLACC categories (Face: κ = 0.85, Leg: κ = 0.74, Activity: κ = 0.89, Cry: κ = 0.93, Consolability: κ = 0.93) as well as the total score (Total: κ = 0.95,). Correlation analysis demonstrated a good criterion validation between the FLACC scale and the VAS obs. (r = 0.96).Our Japanese version of the FLACC Behavioral Scale shows high validity and reliability."

HilD controls the expression of the genes within the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and of several genes located outside SPI-1, which are mainly required for Salmonella invasion of host cells. The expression, amount, and activity of HilD are tightly controlled by the activities of several factors. The HilE protein represses the expression of the SPI-1 genes through its interaction with HilD; however, the mechanism by which HilE affects HilD is unknown. In this study, we used genetic and biochemical assays revealing how HilE controls the transcriptional activity of HilD. We found that HilD needs to assemble in homodimers to induce expression of its target genes. Our results further indicated that HilE individually interacts with each the central and the C-terminal HilD regions, mediating dimerization and DNA binding, respectively. We also observed that these interactions consistently inhibit HilD dimerization and DNA binding. Interestingly, a computational analysis revealed that HilE shares sequence and structural similarities with Hcp proteins, which act as structural components of type 6 secretion systems in Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, our results uncover the molecular mechanism by which the Hcp-like protein HilE controls dimerization and DNA binding of the virulence-promoting transcriptional regulator HilD.

https://openalex.org/W2793537984,"IGF-I is a growth factor, which is expressed in virtually all tissues. The circulating IGF-I is however derived mainly from the liver. IGF-I promotes wound healing and its levels are decreased in wounds with low regenerative potential such as diabetic wounds. However, the contribution of circulating IGF-I to wound healing is unknown. Here we investigated the role of systemic IGF-I on wound healing rate in mice with deficiency of liver-derived IGF-I (LI-IGF-I-/- mice) during normal (normoglycemic) and impaired wound healing (diabetes).LI-IGF-I-/- mice with complete inactivation of the IGF-I gene in the hepatocytes were generated using the Cre/loxP recombination system. This resulted in a 75% reduction of circulating IGF-I. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin in both LI-IGF-I-/- and control mice. Wounds were made on the dorsum of the mice, and the wound healing rate and histology were evaluated. Serum IGF-I and GH were measured by RIA and ELISA respectively. The expression of IGF-I, IGF-II and the IGF-I receptor in the skin were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The local IGF-I protein expression in different cell types of the wounds during wound healing process was analyzed using immunohistochemistry.The wound healing rate was similar in LI-IGF-I-/- mice to that in controls. Diabetes significantly delayed the wound healing rate in both LI-IGF-I-/- and control mice. However, no significant difference was observed between diabetic animals with normal or reduced hepatic IGF-I production. The gene expression of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-I receptor in skin was not different between any group of animals tested. Local IGF-I levels in the wounds were similar between of LI-IGF-I-/- and WT mice although a transient reduction of IGF-I expression in leukocytes in the wounds of LI-IGF-I-/- was observed seven days post wounding.Deficiency in the liver-derived IGF-I does not affect wound healing in mice, neither in normoglycemic conditions nor in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2790051307,"Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote-1) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote-1) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2793497596,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has key roles in animal reproduction, including spermatogenesis and ovarian maturation. Many factors influence FSH secretion. However, despite the broad functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) via the regulation of target genes, little is known about their roles in FSH secretion. Our previous results suggested that miR-186-5p targets the 3' UTR of FSHb; therefore, we examined whether miR-186-5p could regulate FSH secretion in rat anterior adenohypophyseal cells. miR-186-5p was transfected into rat anterior pituitary cells. The expression of FSHb and the secretion of FSH were examined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. A miR-186-5p mimic decreased the expression of FSHb compared with expression in the control group and decreased FSH secretion. In contrast, both the mRNA levels and secretion of FSH increased in response to miR-186-5p inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that miR-186-5p regulates FSH secretion by directly targeting the FSHb 3' UTR, providing additional functional evidence for the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2791419962,"Background 
Genotyping and georeferencing in tuberculosis (TB) have been used to characterize the distribution of the disease and occurrence of transmission within specific groups and communities.


Objective 
The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that diabetes mellitus (DM) and pulmonary TB may occur in spatial and molecular aggregations.


Material and methods 
Retrospective cohort study of patients with pulmonary TB. The study area included 12 municipalities in the Sanitary Jurisdiction of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. Patients with acid-fast bacilli in sputum smears and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum cultures were recruited from 1995 to 2010. Clinical (standardized questionnaire, physical examination, chest X-ray, blood glucose test and HIV test), microbiological, epidemiological, and molecular evaluations were carried out. Patients were considered “genotype-clustered” if two or more isolates from different patients were identified within 12 months of each other and had six or more IS6110 bands in an identical pattern, or < 6 bands with identical IS6110 RFLP patterns and spoligotype with the same spacer oligonucleotides. Residential and health care centers addresses were georeferenced. We used a Jeep hand GPS. The coordinates were transferred from the GPS files to ArcGIS using ArcMap 9.3. We evaluated global spatial aggregation of patients in IS6110-RFLP/ spoligotype clusters using global Moran´s I. Since global distribution was not random, we evaluated “hotspots” using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Using bivariate and multivariate analysis we analyzed sociodemographic, behavioral, clinic and bacteriological conditions associated with “hotspots”. We used STATA® v13.1 for all statistical analysis.


Results 
From 1995 to 2010, 1,370 patients >20 years were diagnosed with pulmonary TB; 33% had DM. The proportion of isolates that were genotyped was 80.7% (n = 1105), of which 31% (n = 342) were grouped in 91 genotype clusters with 2 to 23 patients each; 65.9% of total clusters were small (2 members) involving 35.08% of patients. Twenty three (22.7) percent of cases were classified as recent transmission. Moran`s I indicated that distribution of patients in IS6110-RFLP/spoligotype clusters was not random (Moran`s I = 0.035468, Z value = 7.0, p = 0.00). Local spatial analysis showed statistically significant spatial aggregation of patients in IS6110-RFLP/spoligotype clusters identifying “hotspots” and “coldspots”. GI* statistic showed that the hotspot for spatial clustering was located in Camerino Z. Mendoza municipality; 14.6% (50/342) of patients in genotype clusters were located in a hotspot; of these, 60% (30/50) lived with DM. Using logistic regression the statistically significant variables associated with hotspots were: DM [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 7.04, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 3.03–16.38] and attending the health center in Camerino Z. Mendoza (aOR18.04, 95% CI 7.35–44.28).


Conclusions 
The combination of molecular and epidemiological information with geospatial data allowed us to identify the concurrence of molecular clustering and spatial aggregation of patients with DM and TB. This information may be highly useful for TB control programs."
https://openalex.org/W2792607517,"FOXQ1 is a member of the forkhead-box transcription factor family that has important functions in development, cancer, aging, and many cellular processes. The role of FOXQ1 in cancer biology has raised intense interest, yet much remains poorly understood. We investigated the possible function of the two zebrafish orthologs (foxq1a and foxq1b) of human FOXQ1 in innate immune cell development and function. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to create null mutations of foxq1a and foxq1b in zebrafish. Using a combination of molecular, cellular, and embryological approaches, we characterized single and double foxq1a bcz11 and foxq1b bcz18 mutants. This study provides the first genetic mutant analyses of zebrafish foxq1a and foxq1b. Interestingly, we found that foxq1a, but not foxq1b, was transcriptionally regulated during a bacterial response, while the expression of foxq1a was detected in sorted macrophages and upregulated in foxq1a-deficient mutants. However, the transcriptional response to E. coli challenge of foxq1a and foxq1b mutants was not significantly different from that of their wildtype control siblings. Our data shows that foxq1a may have a role in modulating bacterial response, while both foxq1a and foxq1b are not required for the development of macrophages, neutrophils, and microglia. Considering the implicated role of FOXQ1 in a vast number of cancers and biological processes, the foxq1a and foxq1b null mutants from this study provide useful genetic models to further investigate FOXQ1 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2790370743,"Several recent studies have claimed that rodents have good visual recognition abilities. However, the extent to which rats can recognize other rats and distinguish between males and females using visual information alone remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the ability of rats to visually recognize mirror, video-recorded, and still images and to discriminate between images of males and females. Rats were tested in a place preference apparatus with a mirror, a video-recorded image of a rat, or a still image of a rat at one end. The data were assessed using t-test with Bonferroni correction. Male and female rats spent significantly more time in the mirror chamber and the video-recorded image chamber than in their respective blank chambers (P < 0.05), and male rats also spent more time in the chamber containing a still image. Furthermore, it was found that male rats exhibited significantly more sniffing behavior around the mirror than in the blank chamber (P < 0.05), whereas female rats were no significant differences in the sniffing behaviors in the mirror, moving or still image experiments. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether the rat in the image was the same or opposite sex. These results indicate that rats can process the differences in mirror, video-recorded, and still images as visual information, but are unable to use this information to distinguish between the sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2791377680,"Basal airway epithelial cells (AEC) constitute stem/progenitor cells within the central airways and respond to mucosal injury in an ordered sequence of spreading, migration, proliferation, and differentiation to needed cell types. However, dynamic gene transcription in the early events after mucosal injury has not been studied in AEC. We examined gene expression using microarrays following mechanical injury (MI) in primary human AEC grown in submersion culture to generate basal cells and in the air-liquid interface to generate differentiated AEC (dAEC) that include goblet and ciliated cells. A select group of ~150 genes was in differential expression (DE) within 2–24 hr after MI, and enrichment analysis of these genes showed over-representation of functional categories related to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Network-based gene prioritization and network reconstruction using the PINTA heat kernel diffusion algorithm demonstrated highly connected networks that were richer in differentiated AEC compared to basal cells. Similar experiments done in basal AEC collected from asthmatic donor lungs demonstrated substantial changes in DE genes and functional categories related to inflammation compared to basal AEC from normal donors. In dAEC, similar but more modest differences were observed. We demonstrate that the AEC transcription signature after MI identifies genes and pathways that are important to the initiation and perpetuation of airway mucosal inflammation. Gene expression occurs quickly after injury and is more profound in differentiated AEC, and is altered in AEC from asthmatic airways. Our data suggest that the early response to injury is substantially different in asthmatic airways, particularly in basal airway epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2791766039,"Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2791288603,"Light and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are among the important environmental factors influencing plant growth and forest regeneration. We used Quercus acutissima, a dominant broadleaf tree species native to the deciduous forests of Northern China, to study the combined effects of light exposure and N addition on leaf physiology and individual plant growth. In the greenhouse, we exposed Quercus acutissima seedlings to one of two light conditions (8% and 80% of full irradiation) and one of three N treatments (0, 6, and 12 g N m-2 y-1). After 87 d, we observed that nitrogen deposition had no significant effects on the seedlings regardless of light exposure. In addition, shade significantly reduced plant height, basal diameter, leaf number, total biomass, gas exchange capacity, and carbohydrate content. In contrast, however, shade significantly increased the amount of photosynthetic pigment, above-ground biomass allocation, and specific leaf area. There was also a hierarchical plasticity among the different seedling characteristics. Compared to traits of growth, biomass, biomass allocation and leaf morphology, the leaf physiology, including photosynthetic pigment, gas exchange, carbohydrate, and PUNE, is more sensitive to light conditions. Among the biomass allocation parameters, the leaf and root mass ratios had a relatively low phenotypic plasticity. The seedlings had high foliar physiological plasticity under various light conditions. Nevertheless, we recommend high irradiance to maintain vigorous seedling growth and, in turn, promote the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2794425435,"Direct volume rendering has become an essential tool to explore and analyse 3D medical images. Despite several advances in the field, it remains a challenge to produce an image that highlights the anatomy of interest, avoids occlusion of important structures, provides an intuitive perception of shape and depth while retaining sufficient contextual information. Although the computer graphics community has proposed several solutions to address specific visualization problems, the medical imaging community still lacks a general volume rendering implementation that can address a wide variety of visualization use cases while avoiding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new open source framework called the Programmable Ray Integration Shading Model, or PRISM, that implements a complete GPU ray-casting solution where critical parts of the ray integration algorithm can be replaced to produce new volume rendering effects. A graphical user interface allows clinical users to easily experiment with pre-existing rendering effect building blocks drawn from an open database. For programmers, the interface enables real-time editing of the code inside the blocks. We show that in its default mode, the PRISM framework produces images very similar to those produced by a widely-adopted direct volume rendering implementation in VTK at comparable frame rates. More importantly, we demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by showing how several volume rendering techniques can be implemented in PRISM with no more than a few lines of code. Finally, we demonstrate the simplicity of our system in a usability study with 5 medical imaging expert subjects who have none or little experience with volume rendering. The PRISM framework has the potential to greatly accelerate development of volume rendering for medical applications by promoting sharing and enabling faster development iterations and easier collaboration between engineers and clinical personnel."
https://openalex.org/W2791900285,"Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at NaV1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus Dendrobates) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (Dendrobates pumilio and D. granuliferus) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (D. auratus). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at NaV1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2792399650,"Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate different clusters of anthropometric indicators (body mass index | BMI |, waist circumference | WC |, waist-to-height ratio | WHtR |, triceps skinfold |TR SF|, subscapular skinfold |SE SF|, sum of the triceps and subscapular skinfolds | ΣTR + SE |, and sum of the triceps, subscapular and suprailiac folds | ΣTR + SE + SI|) associated with the VO2max levels in adolescents. Methods The study included 1,132 adolescents (aged 14–19 years) enrolled in public schools of São José, Santa Catarina, Brazil, in the 2014 academic year. The dependent variable was the cluster of anthropometric indicators (BMI, WC, WHtR, TR SF, SE SF, SI SF, ΣTR + SE and ΣTR + SE + SI) of excess body fat. The independent variable was maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), estimated by the modified Canadian aerobic fitness test—mCAFT. Control variables were: age, skin color, economic level, maternal education, physical activity and sexual maturation. Multinomial logistic regression was used for associations between the dependent and independent variables. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify the association between adolescents with all anthropometric indicators in excess and independent variables. Results One in ten adolescents presented all anthropometric indicators of excess body fat. Multinomial regression showed that with each increase of one VO2max unit, the odds of adolescents having three, four, five or more anthropometric indicators of excess body fat decreased by 0.92, 0.85 and 0.73 times, respectively. In the binary regression, this fact was reconfirmed, demonstrating that with each increase of one VO2max unit, the odds of adolescents having simultaneously the eight anthropometric indicators of excess body fat decreased by 0.55. Conclusion It was concluded that with each increase of one VO2max unit, adolescents decreased the odds of simultaneously presenting three or more anthropometric indicators of excess body fat, regardless of biological, economic and lifestyle factors. In addition, the present study identified that one in ten adolescents had all anthropometric indicators of excess body fat."
https://openalex.org/W2792183715,"Feed costs account for over 70% of the annual expenditures in cow/calf production. During the production year the cow uses nutrients to support conceptus growth, milk production, work (grazing and locomotion), and maintenance requirements. The majority of the nutrients are used to support maintenance. Substrate cycling has been identified as one of the major contributors toward energy expenditure associated with maintenance in mature cows. The objective of this study was to determine whether beef cows that differ in the efficiency of weight gain differ in the relative abundance of transcripts for metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. Mature beef cows were subjected to feed restriction followed by ad libitum feed. Adipose tissue from twelve cows with high (n = 6) and low (n = 6) gain based on growth performance during the ad libitum feeding period was evaluated for transcriptome expression differences. A total of 496 genes were differentially expressed and passed Bonferroni correction for the animals with greater gain between restriction and realimentation and 491 genes were differentially expressed among animals with lesser gains between feed restriction and realimentation. Of these two differentially expressed gene lists, 144 genes were common between animals with greater and those with lesser gain. Enriched biological processes included the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport chain and fatty acid metabolic processes. Specific to adipose tissue of low gaining animals was glycolysis and to high gain animals was coenzyme, steroid, cellular amino acid, nitrogen compound metabolic processes, and sensory perception. The oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were commonly associated with the high gain animals between feed restriction and realimentation, as well as with the low gaining animals between the two time points. Unique to the high gaining animals were valine degradation and LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function pathways. In this discovery study, genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appear to be critical to mature cows during times of abundant feed after feed restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2792781694,"The complement system is highly implicated in both the prevalence and progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Complement system inhibitors therefore have potential therapeutic value in managing excessive activation of the complement pathways in retinal degenerations. The vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) has been shown to be effective as a complement inhibitor in neuroinflammatory models including traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. We aimed to investigate the potential of VCP as a therapeutic molecule for retinal degenerations. In this study, we investigated the effect, localisation and delivery of VCP to the rodent retina. Complement inhibition activity of VCP was tested using a hemolytic assay. Photoreceptor cell death, inflammation and retinal stress were assayed to determine if any retinal toxicity was induced by an intravitreal injection of VCP. The effect of VCP was investigated in a model of photo-oxidative retinal degeneration. Localisation of VCP after injection was determined using a fluorescein-tagged form of VCP, as well as immunohistochemistry. Finally, a copolymer resin (Elvax) was trialled for the slow-release delivery of VCP to the retina. We found that a dose equivalent to 20μg VCP when intravitreally injected into the rat eye did not cause any photoreceptor cell death or immune cell recruitment, but led to an increase in GFAP. In photo-oxidative damaged retinas, there were no differences in photoreceptor loss, retinal stress (Gfap) and inflammation (Ccl2 and C3) between VCP and saline-injected groups; however, Jun expression was reduced in VCP-treated retinas. After VCP was injected into the eye, it was taken up in all layers of the retina but was cleared within 1–3 hours of delivery. This study indicates that a method to sustain the delivery of VCP to the retina is necessary to further investigate the effect of VCP as a complement inhibitor for retinal degenerations."
