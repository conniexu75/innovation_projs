In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-κB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling. Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between −119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1β+Aβ42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.

The innate immune response and inflammatory signaling play determinant roles in brain homeostasis, neuroprotection, and repair; however, altered or excessive signaling in these injury defense systems contributes to the irreversible degeneration of brain cells, as typified in the common, age-related neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer disease (AD). 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβ42amyloid β 42 amino acid peptideHAGhuman astroglialIL-1RIL-1 receptorIRAKinterleukin-1 receptor-associated kinasemiRNAmicroRNAPDTCpyrrolidine dithiocarbamateTIRToll and IL-1RTLRToll-like receptorHNGhuman neuronal glialPMIpost-mortem intervalANOVAanalysis of varianceTRAF6TNF, receptor-associated factor 6. In innate immune signaling members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) or IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) superfamily, via their common Toll and IL-1R (TIR) domains, act as extracellular sensors to detect pathogens and cytotoxic molecules. This enables cells to respond to toxins and inflammatory cytokines by mounting effective neuroprotective immune responses (1Eikelenboom P. van Exel E. Hoozemans J.J. Veerhuis R.

A family of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) in the human genome, including IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, and IRAK-M, are key mediators in the immune pathways utilized by TLR/IL-1R (TIR) signaling (3Tan L.

By means of their integral kinase and multiple adaptor functions, IRAKs initiate diverse downstream signaling processes and a cascade of events that can eventually lead to the induction of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB. Further recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO/IKKα/β) and adaptor proteins either enhance or mis-regulate both the innate immune response and inflammatory gene expression (5Lukiw W.J.

Abundant DNA array, Northern, RT-PCR, and Western gene expression analysis of AD brains have repeatedly shown a significant disruption in the homeostatic expression of essential brain genes and a progressive up-regulation of inflammatory gene expression, driven in part by overactivation of transcription factor NF-κB. This supports both the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease processes (9Colangelo V. Schurr J. Ball M.J. Pelaez R.P. Bazan N.G. Lukiw W.J. J. Neurosci.

Components of this innate immunity and inflammatory pathway are known to play a central role in driving neuropathology, in part via overexpression of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and up-regulating the generation of the 42-amino acid amyloid β 42 (Aβ42) peptide. These in turn induce transcription from the proinflammatory prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene and stimulate apoptotic brain cell death and neural tissue degeneration (5Lukiw W.J.

In this report we have significantly expanded, refined, and advanced our earlier studies on miRNA-146a-mediated signaling in AD brain and in stressed brain cells. No miRNAs have as yet been functionally linked to specific IRAK signaling in the human brain. These studies were undertaken to further understand the involvement of the brain-enriched, stress-induced miRNA-146a in the molecular-genetic mechanism that drives TLR/IL-1R-IRAK-NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling and AD-type change in primary cultures of human astroglial (HAG) cells, a highly specialized cell type known to contribute to the brain innate immune and inflammatory response. Human recombinant IL-1β (I4019) and Aβ42 peptide (D2534) were purchased from Sigma and used as previously described (5Lukiw W.J. Pelaez R.P. Martinez J. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HNG and HAG primary cells, maintenance medium, and bullet packs (BulletKit CC-3185) containing growth factors were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD). Human-specific anti-actin (A2103), anti-β-tubulin III (neuron-specific; T8660), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (glial specific; G9269), anti-IRAK-1 (B5, sc-55530, and C-19; sc-1894), anti-IRAK-2 (B-22, sc-130788, and G-20, sc-23652), anti-IRAK-4 (H-100, sc-99154), anti-IRAK-M (C-20, sc-23656), anti-MyD88 (N-19, sc-8196), and anti-TRAF6 (C-16, sc-33897) primary antibodies were obtained from Sigma or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hoechst 33258 (H-1398; Invitrogen) and all other reagents were of the highest grades commercially available and were used without further purification. With the emergence of sophisticated techniques for gene expression analysis, the quality of tissues being studied becomes increasingly critical. Brain tissues used in these studies were carefully selected from several hundred potential specimens obtained from archived tissues or extracts at the LSU Neuroscience Center, New Orleans LA, the University of California at Irvine, California, and the Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR. Human brain tissues were used in accordance with the institutional review board at the LSU Health Sciences Center and donor institutions (6Ringwood L. Li L.

For both tissues and cells a guanidine isothiocyanate/silica gel-based membrane total RNA purification system was utilized to isolate total miRNA RNA from each sample (PureLinkTM, Invitrogen). Total RNA concentrations were quantified using RNA 6000 Nano LabChips and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Caliper Technologies, Mountainview, CA; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA yield was typically about 1.3 μg of total RNA per mg wet weight of tissue. No significant differences between the spectral purity or molecular size of small RNA between AD and control tissue samples were noted (Table 1). Total small RNA samples were typically run out on 15% Tris borate-EDTA-urea polyacrylamide denaturing gels (TBE-urea; Invitrogen) and after ethidium bromide staining total miRNA species (<25 nucleotides) were excised and end-labeled using [γ-32P]δATP (6000 Ci/mmol) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen) and as previously described (11Lukiw W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2150607823,"Among the hallmarks of aged organisms are an accumulation of misfolded proteins and a reduction in skeletal muscle mass (""sarcopenia""). We have examined the effects of aging and dietary restriction (which retards many age-related changes) on components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in muscle. The hindlimb muscles of aged (30 months old) rats showed a marked loss of muscle mass and contained 2-3-fold higher levels of 26S proteasomes than those of adult (4 months old) controls. 26S proteasomes purified from muscles of aged and adult rats showed a similar capacity to degrade peptides, proteins, and an ubiquitylated substrate, but differed in levels of proteasome-associated proteins (e.g. the ubiquitin ligase E6AP and deubiquitylating enzyme USP14). Also, the activities of many other deubiquitylating enzymes were greatly enhanced in the aged muscles. Nevertheless, their content of polyubiquitylated proteins was higher than in adult animals. The aged muscles contained higher levels of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, involved in eliminating misfolded proteins, and MuRF1, which ubiquitylates myofibrillar proteins. These muscles differed from ones rapidly atrophying due to disease, fasting, or disuse in that Atrogin-1/MAFbx expression was low and not inducible by glucocorticoids. Thus, the muscles of aged rats showed many adaptations indicating enhanced proteolysis by the UPS, which may enhance their capacity to eliminate misfolded proteins and seems to contribute to the sarcopenia. Accordingly, dietary restriction decreased or prevented the aging-associated increases in proteasomes and other UPS components and reduced muscle wasting."

This is an important finding because it is only the second mutation identified in this gene that causes ALS. In order to investigate the pathogenic effects of this mutation, we have used a motor neuron cell line and tissue-specific expression of the mutant protein in Drosophila. We provide substantial evidence for the pathogenic effects of this mutation in abolishing the effect of wild type VAPB in the unfolded protein response, promoting ubiquitin aggregate formation, and activating neuronal cell death. We also report that expression of the mutant protein in the Drosophila motor system induces aggregate deposition, endoplasmic reticulum disorganization, and chaperone up-regulation both in neurons and in muscles. Our integrated analysis of the pathogenic effect of the T46I mutation and the previously identified P56S mutation indicate extensive commonalities in the disease mechanism for these two mutations.

https://openalex.org/W1967455875,"Despite a positive correlation between chronic kidney disease and atherosclerosis, the causative role of uremic toxins in leukocyte-endothelial interactions has not been reported. We thus examined the effects of indoxyl sulfate, a uremic toxin, on leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells and the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with indoxyl sulfate significantly enhanced the adhesion of human monocytic cells (THP-1 cell line) to TNF-α-activated HUVEC under physiological flow conditions. Treatment with indoxyl sulfate enhanced the expression level of E-selectin, but not that of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, in HUVEC. Indoxyl sulfate treatment enhanced the activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in TNF-α-activated HUVEC. Inhibitors of JNK and NF-κB attenuated indoxyl sulfate-induced E-selectin expression in HUVEC and subsequent THP-1 adhesion. Furthermore, treatment with the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin and the glutathione donor N-acetylcysteine inhibited indoxyl sulfate-induced enhancement of THP-1 adhesion to HUVEC. Next, we examined the in vivo effect of indoxyl sulfate in nephrectomized chronic kidney disease model mice. Indoxyl sulfate-induced leukocyte adhesion to the femoral artery was significantly reduced by anti-E-selectin antibody treatment. These findings suggest that indoxyl sulfate enhances leukocyte-endothelial interactions through up-regulation of E-selectin, presumably via the JNK- and NF-κB-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024944232,"The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras exists in solution in two different conformational states when complexed with different GTP analogs such as GppNHp or GppCH2p. State 1 has only a very low affinity to effectors and seems to be recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas state 2 represents the high affinity effector binding state. In this work we investigate Ras in complex with the physiological nucleoside triphosphate GTP. By polarization transfer 31P NMR experiments and effector binding studies we show that Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP also exists in a dynamical equilibrium between the weakly populated conformational state 1 and the dominant state 2. At 278 K the equilibrium constant between state 1 and state 2 of C-terminal truncated wild-type Ras(1–166) K12 is 11.3. K12 of full-length Ras is >20, suggesting that the C terminus may also have a regulatory effect on the conformational equilibrium. The exchange rate (kex) for Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP is 7 s−1 and thus 18-fold lower compared with that found for the Ras·GppNHp complex. The intrinsic GTPase activity substantially increases after effector binding for the switch I mutants Ras(Y32F), (Y32R), (Y32W), (Y32C/C118S), (T35S), and the switch II mutant Ras(G60A) by stabilizing state 2, with the largest effect on Ras(Y32R) with a 13-fold increase compared with wild-type. In contrast, no acceleration was observed in Ras(T35A). Thus Ras in conformational state 2 has a higher affinity to effectors as well as a higher GTPase activity.

These observations can be used to explain why many mutants have a low GTPase activity but are not oncogenic. The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras is involved in cellular signal transduction pathways inducing proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis of cells. It functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In the active conformation Ras is able to bind different effector proteins such as Raf kinase or RalGDS with nanomolar affinity by interacting with its switch I region. Thus signals can be transmitted resulting in the corresponding cellular response. When bound to guanosine triphosphates Ras exists in two different conformational states, defined as states 1 and 2, which are in chemical equilibrium in solution (1Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Spoerner M. Nuehs A. Ganser P. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R.

FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These conformational states are actually only defined for Ras with guanosine triphosphate bound (T), a state that may be different from a state with guanine diphosphate bound (D). Therefore, we will denote the two states in the following as state 1(T) and 2(T) whenever the nucleotide ligand is of concern. The equilibrium between the two states is strongly influenced by the nature of the guanine nucleotide bound to Ras and can be shifted by interaction with effector proteins or regulators such as GTPase activation proteins (GAPs). 2The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase activating proteinGppNHpguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGppCH2pguanosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphateRaf-RBDRas binding domain of Raf kinase (rapid fibrosarcoma)RalGDSRal guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulatorRasprotein product of the proto-oncogene ras (rat sarcoma)RBDRas binding domainGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. It was found that GTP analogs GppNHp and GppCH2p partially shift the equilibrium toward state 1. For the complex of wild-type Ras with physiological GTP itself the existence of the two states could not be shown yet. However, for the slowly hydrolyzing mutants Ras(Q61H) and Ras(Q61L) a second weakly populated state could be observed. Because at this time functional data were not available, from an analysis of the chemical shift changes it was tentatively assigned to state 2, whereas the mainly populated state in Ras complexed with GTP was assumed to be state 1 (1Geyer M.

Binding studies using NMR spectroscopy as well as calorimetric or fluorescence-based methods show that these conformational equilibria directly influence the interaction between Ras and its effectors (3Spoerner M.

Very recent results lead to the assumption that state 1(T) of Ras is recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and thus could represent an important conformational state in the Ras activation/inactivation cycle (14Kalbitzer H.R. Spoerner M. Ganser P. Hozsa C. Kremer W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 16714-16719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutation of a specific threonine residue (Thr-35 in Ras), totally conserved in all members of the Ras superfamily, to serine drastically decreases the affinity of Ras to its effectors, although this threonine residue is not directly involved in effector binding (15Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Vetter I.R. Linnemann T. Wohlgemuth S. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These mutations affect Ras to become a partial loss-of-function mutant, which can still trigger the MAP kinase pathway by interacting with Raf kinases but binds too weakly to RalGDS and thus cannot activate the Ral-dependent signaling pathway (17White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Both the hydroxyl group and the methyl group of Thr-35 are necessary for Ras to stabilize its crucial effector binding conformation, which is essential for effector binding at physiological concentrations (11Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4944-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because this conserved threonine residue plays such an important role in the switch between the active and inactive state we have studied its role in terms of the GTPase activity by investigating Ras mutants T35S and T35A, as well as other selected Ras variants containing mutations in the P-loop, the switch I and switch II regions, respectively. In this work we elucidate the importance of this dynamic behavior of Ras in the physiological GTP-bound state in terms of effector interactions as well as the intrinsic GTPase activity. Wild-type and mutants of full-length human H-Ras (residues 1–189) and the truncated variant Ras(1–166) (residues 1–166) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before (18Tucker J.

The final purity of the protein was >95% as judged from the SDS-PAGE. Nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP was performed by incubation of Ras in the presence of 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 and 50-fold excess of GTP as described by John et al. (19John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration. The Ras concentration was determined by measuring the concentration of bound nucleotide using C18-reversed phase chromatography with a calibrated detector system. Ras-binding domains of human RalGDS (RalGDS-RBD, residues 11 to 97) and human Raf-1 (Raf-RBD, residues 51 to 131) were expressed in E. coli and purified as described before (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A.

For binding studies aliquots of a highly concentrated (5–7 mm) Raf-RBD or RalGDS-RBD solution contained in the same buffer was added in appropriate amounts to the samples. 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance-500 NMR spectrometer operating at 31P frequency of 202 MHz. Measurements were performed in a 10-mm probe using 8- or 10-mm Shigemi sample tubes at various temperatures. Two-dimensional 31P-31P NOESY (22Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 2.5 s and a total repetition time of 10 s. Protons were decoupled during t1 evolution by a proton 180° pulse and during t2 by a GARP (23Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) sequence with a strength of the B1-field of 900 Hz. 31P longitudinal relaxation times (T1) were determined at 278 K by an inversion recovery sequence using a repetition time of 20 s. The obtained signal integrals were fitted by a three parameter fit to the Equation 1, Mz(t)=M0+(Mz(0)-M0)e-tT1(Eq. 1) with Mz(t) the z-magnetization (signal integral) at time t, and M0 the magnetization in thermal equilibrium. Protons were decoupled during magnetization recovery and data acquisition by GARP (23Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) sequence. The 31P NMR saturation transfer experiments were performed at 278 K using a strength of the B1 field of 18 Hz. A total repetition time of 20 s was used for each scan. For identifying the resonance frequency of state 1, a presaturation time of 1 s was used. To determine the rate of exchange, presaturation was applied for 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 s at the frequency of the low populated state of the γ-phosphorus. 100 cycles of the experiments, each with 8 scans, were added to avoid instability effects of the sample or the spectrometer, respectively. For determination of direct saturation effects the same experiments was performed applying presaturation at corresponding frequencies up- or downfield of the observed signal, respectively. If no direct saturation effects can be observed, data can be fitted by Equation 2. IA(τ)=IA(0)1τA+1T1A(1τAexp[-τ(1τA+1T1A)]+1T1A)(Eq. 2) With IA(τ) the area of the non-saturated signal after saturation of resonance B for the time τ, and T1A the longitudinal relaxation time of signal A (estimated from inversion recovery experiment). The mean lifetime τA of the protein in state A is related to the rate constant kAB of the transition from state A to state B by kAB = 1/τA (see e.g. Ref. 24Hausser K.H. Kalbitzer H.R. NMR in Medicine and Biology, Structure Determination, Tomography, in Vivo Spectroscopy. Springer, Heidelberg1991Google Scholar). The effects of direct saturation can be approximated by Equation 3. IA(τ)=IA(0)a+1T1A(a exp[-τ(a+1T1A)]+1T1a)(Eq. 3) The value for the correction factor a can be calculated from a fit of Equation 3 and be inserted into Equation 4.

To determine the kinetics of intrinsic GTPase reaction by Ras, 100 μm Ras·GTP in 40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol were incubated at 310 K. Care was taken that free nucleotide was completely removed to ensure the single turnover reaction. At different times of incubation samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the nucleotides afterward were separated by HPLC using a C18 reversed phase column with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetra butyl-ammonium bromide, 7% acetonitrile as buffer. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 254 nm and the lines corresponding to GDP and GTP were integrated. The percentage of GTP compared with the total nucleotide at different incubation times was determined. A single exponential function was fitted to the values. For each Ras variant the rates of hydrolysis were determined as a function of the concentrations of RBD added. Hydrolysis rates given are measured at saturation that was usually observed when the RBD concentration was 1.5 times the Ras concentration. Therefore the given maximum rate constant should represent the values of the Ras variants totally complexed with effector. The only exception was Ras(V29G/I36G), which shows an estimated affinity to Raf-RBD of ∼1 mm as derived from the 31P NMR titration and GTPase activation experiments. In the GTP-bound form Ras(wt) seems to exist exclusively in one conformational state corresponding to three single signals in the 31P NMR spectrum, one for each phosphorus of the bound nucleotide (Fig. 1A). The 31P NMR spectrum of Ras(T35A) shows one set of resonances too, but with different chemical shift values compared with that obtained for wild-type Ras. In contrast, the serine mutant Ras(T35S) shows a pair of resonance lines for the γ-phosphate group, indicating an equilibrium of two states in solution (Fig. 1A). The chemical shift value of the more intense line corresponds to that found in Ras(T35A), the weaker line corresponds to that found in the wild-type protein (Table 1).TABLE 131P NMR chemical shifts, free energies, and GTPase activities of wild-type Ras·Mg2+·GTP and T35 mutants in the absence and presence of effector proteinsProtein-complexα−Phosphateβ−Phosphateγ−PhosphateK12ΔG12aMeasurements were performed at 278 K at pH 7.4.

Open table in a new tab The 31P resonances of Ras·Mg2+·GTP were assigned earlier by comparison of the chemical shifts of free Mg2+·GTP with bound GTP (1Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Rösch P. Wittinghofer A. Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Leberman R. Schlichting I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because binding of nucleotides to proteins can induce large chemical shift changes, a direct transfer of resonance assignments from the unbound to the bound state can be precarious. We therefore performed a two-dimensional 31P-31P NOESY experiment on Ras(T35A)·Mg2+·GTP. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 1B. The assignment of the resonance of the β-phosphate can be directly deduced from the cross-peak patterns because only that shows cross-peaks to the two other phosphate 31P resonances. The chemical shift of the β-phosphate of bound nucleotide (−15.23 ppm) largely differs from that of free Mg2+·GTP (−19.22 ppm; Table 1). In free Mg2+·GTP the chemical shifts of the α- and γ-phosphates are 10.57 and −5.58 ppm, respectively, at pH 7.4, as used herein and in all other experiments performed. The frequencies of the other resonances at −11.14 and −6.39 ppm are rather close to the corresponding chemical shift values and can thus be assigned to the α- and γ-phosphates of the bound GTP. With these experiments, the earlier used chemical shift assignment could thus be confirmed. In analogy to the results obtained for several GTP analogs complexed with Ras, the conformation of Ras(T35A)·Mg2+·GTP should therefore correspond to state 1. In Ras(T35S)·Mg2+·GTP, two lines are observed for the γ-phosphate group, one with the same frequency as that observed in Ras(T35A)·Mg2+·GTP and thus assigned to state 1, although the high-field shifted resonance line is assigned to state 2 (Fig. 1A). Correspondingly, we conclude that Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP occurs predominantly in state 2. For Ras(T35S)·Mg2+·GTP, the equilibrium constant K12 can be directly determined from the integrals of the two γ-phosphate lines under the experimental conditions used here. At 278 K, K12 is 0.29 ± 0.2 (Table 1). For Ras(T35A)·Mg2+·GTP and Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP such a determination is more difficult, because direct inspection of the spectra does not allow the unambiguous identification of lines assignable to an alternate state. However, the frequencies where these resonances are to be expected can be deduced from the spectrum of the Ras(T35S) mutant. For the γ-phosphate line of Ras(T35A)·Mg2+·GTP a resonance line for state 2 is expected at −8.6 ppm. Here, no resonance line is visible. From the signal-to-noise ratio an upper limit for K12 can be given as 0.04. For Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP a very weak signal is visible at the position where the resonance of state 1 is to be expected (Fig. 1A). Provided that the resonance line in question for Ras(wt)·Mg2+·GTP is indeed at −6.6 ppm, we performed a 31P NMR saturation transfer experiment. Fig. 2A shows the integrals of the γ-phosphate resonance of state 2 as a function of the presaturation frequencies used. Indeed, a clear minimum of the integral for a saturation frequency at −6.59 ppm was obtained. This indicates that a polarization transfer from the saturated signal to the observed signal takes place that confirms the existence of a second state in dynamic equilibrium with state 2 in full-length wild-type Ras although at a low population. For a weak, long saturation a Lorentzian response function is to be expected. However, for frequencies close to the reporter resonance additional direct saturation of the resonance line leads to a distortion of response curve as it observed in Fig. 2A. The same experiment was performed for frequencies positioned symmetrically on the other side of the reporter signal as control for direct saturation effects. Performing the analogous experiments using the T35A mutant with presaturation frequencies at the resonance position expected for state 2 of the γ-phosphate signal, only direct saturation effects could be observed (data not shown). Recently we were provided access to a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm Cryo-QNP probe with high sensitivity, the ratio of the two γ-phosphate lines of the C-terminal-truncated wild-type Ras(1–166)·Mg2+·GTP could be evaluated quantitatively in a measurement of a highly concentrated sample (Fig. 2B). The C-terminal-truncated Ras(1–166) was taken, because of its use in x-ray as well as in previous NMR structural investigations. The equilibrium constant K12 was determined as 11.3 from the integrals of the γ-phosphate lines. Using this equilibrium constant the resonance positions of the α- and β-phosphate lines of state 1, respectively, could be derived from a line fit deconvolution of the spectra (Fig. 2B, broken line, and Table 1). One would expect a slight shift of the equilibrium toward state 1 by truncation of the Ras-protein according to the results obtained earlier for Ras·Mg2+·GppNHp complexes of full-length and truncated Ras-protein (10Spoerner M. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For full-length Ras·Mg2+·GTP an upper limit for K12 <20 can be estimated from signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra (Fig. 1), indicating indeed an approximate 2-fold more pronounced prevalence for state 1 of the truncated variant compared with full-length Ras. To estimate the exchange rates between states 1 and 2 we measured the time dependence of the saturation transfer using Ras(1–166). Therefore we varied duration for presaturation on the γ-phosphate resonance frequency corresponding to state 1. The values obtained are presented in Fig. 2C. For the fit of the data direct saturation effects were corrected using the data obtained from a presaturation experiment at a frequency with the same distance up-field to the reporter signal (see “Experimental Procedures”). We estimated a life time τ2 of state 2 of 2 s corresponding to a rate constant k21 of 0.5 s−1 for the transition from state 2 to state 1 at 278 K (Table 2). Assuming an equilibrium constant of 11.3, an exchange rate kex of 7 ± 2 s−1 can be derived, which is about 18 times smaller compared with the ones obtained for Ras in complex with the GTP analogs GppNHp and GppCH2p at the same temperature (1Geyer M.

As no crystal structure of ISGF3 has been solved, the exact DNA binding contacts or even the stoichiometry of the ISGF3 complex remains unclear. Based on the structures of STAT1 and IRF dimers, models for ISGF3 have been proposed in which the major and minor grooves of the ISRE are occupied by the DNA binding domains of IRF9 and STAT1 on respective sides of the DNA (13.tenOever B.R.

In this model, STAT1 interacts with the hydrogen:donor:acceptor:acceptor (HDAA) groups and three repetitive methyl:acceptor:donor:acceptor (MADA) groups provided in the major groove of CTTT base pairing, in addition to the neighboring acceptor:hydrogen:acceptor (ADA) groups associated with the minor groove of A:T or T:A base pairing. The opposing minor groove of CTTT (providing AHA, ADA, ADA, and ADA contacts respectively) is occupied by IRF9 as well as the major groove of the A and T downstream base pairing (14.Fujii Y.

While IRF9 is an integral component of ISGF3 and is essential in mediating IFN-induced transcriptional activity, two additional members, namely IRF3 and IRF7, function independently and are responsible for the induction of IFN (30.Lin R.

Upon cellular infection, IRF3 and IRF7 are phosphorylated by nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK)-related kinase IKKϵ (also called IKK-i) or TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) (32.Baum A. García-Sastre A. Amino Acids. 2010; 38: 1283-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), form hetero- and homodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and transcribe IFNβ and the various IFNα genes (33.Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Whereas IRF3 is ubiquitously expressed (34.Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), basal IRF7 expression is limited to hematopoietic cells, with the highest expression level in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (35.Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J. Amrute S. Yeow W.S. Megjugorac N. Dai J. Feng D. Chung E. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 74: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Other cell types upregulate IRF7 upon stimulation with IFN-I/-III and/or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (36.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Regardless of cell type, phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and IRF7 results in nuclear localization and binding to IRF-E sites, with IRF7 showing significantly more promiscuity with regards to IRF-E variation (30.Lin R. Génin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The IRF3-specific transcriptome that results following IRF3 activation has been determined and compromises a small subset of genes, most notably IFNβ (38.Wang N. Dong Q. Li J. Jangra R.K. Fan M.

Genes Immun. 2008; 9: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, similar studies focusing on the transcriptional potential of IRF7 have also been performed and yielded similar results, albeit demonstrating a greater diversity of genes mediated by both autocrine IFN-I signaling and the greater binding capacity of IRF7 (42.Barnes B.J. Richards J. Mancl M. Hanash S. Beretta L. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45194-45207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is widely accepted that IRF3 and IRF7 are essential components required for the establishment of the antiviral state, with their primary function residing in the activation of ISGF3 through the synthesis of IFN-I and/or IFN-III. In an effort to determine the in vivo contribution of IFN-I/-III to the antiviral response, we performed influenza A virus infections in mice encoding genetic disruptions in the receptors for both IFN-I and -III signaling (43.Mordstein M. Kochs G. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Paludan S.R. Klucher K. Staeheli P. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, transcriptional profiling of infected lung tissue revealed that a significant portion of virus-induced genes were “interferon-stimulated genes” despite the complete absence of ISGF3 activation. Given this intriguing discovery, we sought to determine the functional redundancy between the transcriptomes of ISGF3 and IRFs, most notably IRF7. To address this question, we systematically compared binding of IRF7 and ISGF3 to a variety of ISRE motifs encoded upstream of the transcriptional start sites of those “ISGs” induced in the absence of IFN signaling. Here we demonstrate that IRF7 and ISGF3 can engage identical DNA motifs and also define the properties that confer IRF7 and/or ISGF3 specificity. Furthermore, we define the IRF7 transcriptome in the absence of IFN-I and IFN-III signaling. Taken together, we find a significant overlap between the genes induced by IRF7 and ISGF3 suggesting that transcription factor redundancy evolved to ensure the induction of the antiviral state. We used the recombinant influenza A virus strains SC35M wild type (SC35M-wt), SC35M-ΔNS1 (44.Kochs G. Koerner I. Thiel L. Kothlow S. Kaspers B. Ruggli N. Summerfield A. Pavlovic J. Stech J. Staeheli P. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), deficient in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and PR/8/34 NS1-R38AK41A (45.Donelan N.R. Basler C.F. García-Sastre A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13257-13266Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), harboring two amino acid substitutions in NS1. B6.A2G-Mx1-IFNAR1−/−-IL28Rα−/− mice (43.Mordstein M. Kochs G. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Paludan S.R. Klucher K. Staeheli P. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), carrying intact Mx1 alleles and defective alleles for IFNAR1 and IL28Rα were bred locally, in accordance with institution animal care guidelines. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 μg per gram body weight) and xylazine (5 μg per gram body weight) before intranasal infection with 105 plaque forming units (pfu) of either SC35M-wt or SC35M-ΔNS1 in 50 μl of PBS containing 0.3% BSA. Animals treated with PBS/0.3% BSA served as negative controls. HEK293T, 2FTGH, U3A (46.McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Müller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from pools of Irf3−/−, Irf7−/−, or Irf3−/−Irf7−/− knock-out mice and were a kind gift of Michael S. Diamond (Washington University School of Medicine). Primary MEFs were also cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of DNA was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). siRNA against human IRF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected at a final concentration of 50 nm in Opti-MEM I-reduced serum medium (Invitrogen), using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Where indicated, cells were treated with 15–30 IU/ml of human IFNβ (BEI resources). For inhibition of translation, primary MEFs were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma). 1 × 106 primary MEFs or 3 × 106 A549 cells were transfected with 4 μg or 24 μg respectively of poly(I:C) (Sigma) using Lipofectamine 2000. Infection of cells with PR/8/34 NS1-R38AK41A, was performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 in complete medium. Mammalian expression plasmids encoding flag-tagged human IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2 were generated using the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the pCAGGS plasmid (47.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for Flag-tagged human IKKϵ was generated by inserting the open reading frame (ORF) of IKKϵ into MCS of pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma). The reporter construct encoding for firefly luciferase under control of the human ISG15-ISRE was constructed, by inserting an annealed oligonucleotide harboring the ISG15-ISRE sequence (forward: 5′-AGCTTCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGC-3′; reverse: 5′-TCGAGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTCCCGAGA-3′) into the MCS of pLuc-MCS (Stratagene). To generate cells stably expressing GFP, IRF7, or STAT1 a lentiviral vector was used. The respective ORFs were inserted into a minimal HIV-1 provirus termed V1 (48.Evans M.J. von Hahn T. Tscherne D.M. Syder A.J. Panis M. Wölk B. Hatziioannou T. McKeating J.A. Bieniasz P.D. Rice C.M. Nature. 2007; 446: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) via the restriction enzyme SfiI. 2 × 105 HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.1 μg per expression plasmid together with 0.2 μg of the ISG15-ISRE-dependent luciferase construct and 10 ng of a construct constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase to normalize for transfection efficiency. Empty vector served to fill up each transfection reaction to 0.6 μg of total plasmid. 14 h post-transfection (hpt) medium was changed and 15 IU/ml of IFNβ was added. Luciferase activity was determined 24 hpt using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). 2 × 106 HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg per expression plasmid and empty vector served to fill up each transfection reaction to 4 μg of total plasmid. 14hpt medium was changed and 15 IU/ml of IFNβ was added. Whole cell extracts were obtained 24 hpt, and EMSAs were performed as described previously (13.tenOever B.R. Ng S.L. Chua M.A. McWhirter S.M. García-Sastre A. Maniatis T. Science. 2007; 315: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis, 1 μg of antibody, specific to STAT1α p91 (C-111), STAT2 (H-190), ISGF3γ p48 (H-143), IRF3 (FL-425), IRF7 (G-8) (all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Flag (M2, Sigma), or control IgG was used. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (49.Perez J.T. Varble A. Sachidanandam R. Zlatev I. Manoharan M. García-Sastre A. tenOever B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11525-11530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to β-actin (Abcam), Flag (M2), STAT1α p91 (C-111), IRF3 (FL-425), and IRF7 (G-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were all used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and antibodies specific to ISG56 (Thermo Scientific) and MxA were used at a 1:1000 dilution. qPCR was performed as previously described (49.Perez J.T. Varble A. Sachidanandam R. Zlatev I. Manoharan M. García-Sastre A. tenOever B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11525-11530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Primers used for qPCR can be found in supplemental Table S1. Both affymetrix analyses were performed at the biopolymers facility at Harvard Medical School, and data were analyzed on the gene pattern server. Lungs from infected and mock-treated mice were harvested at the indicated time points and total RNA was isolated. RNA from three lungs per cohort was pooled to perform standard affymetrix analysis. The heat map depicts a subset of genes that were induced in Flu-ΔNS1-infected samples at least three times over mock-treated samples. The complete data of the affymetrix analysis can be found at NCBI GEO, with the accession number GSE24695. For analysis of IRF7-driven genes in U3A cells, U3A cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding for Flag-tagged IRF7 and Flag-tagged IKKϵ in a ratio of 1:1. Control U3A cells were transfected with a GFP-encoding plasmid. 4 hpt, medium was changed and 25 IU/ml of type I IFN was added. Total RNA was isolated 20 hpt. Standard affymetrix analysis was performed in replicates on U133A 2.0 affymetrix chips. Genes, significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated at least 2-fold in samples transfected with IRF7 and IKKϵ are shown in the heat map. ISGs were identified with the INTERFEROME database. Cells detect invading viruses by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with specific receptors, leading to activation of several signaling pathways ultimately resulting in the induction of IFN-I and -III. Autocrine and paracrine signaling of IFNs in response to PAMP detection results in the up-regulation of ∼100 antiviral genes, generating a cellular environment non-conducive to productive virus infection. To identify virus-inducible, IFN-independent genes, we treated knock-out mice, deficient for both functional type I and III IFN receptors (IFNAR1−/−IL28Rα−/−) with recombinant influenza A virus strains, which were either wild type (Flu-wt) or lacked the IFN-antagonistic viral product NS1 (Flu-ΔNS1) (43.Mordstein M. Kochs G. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Paludan S.R. Klucher K. Staeheli P. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 50.Hale B.G. Randall R.E. Ortin J. Jackson D. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 51.Wolff T. Ludwig S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009; 29: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection (hpi), lungs of infected and uninfected mice were harvested, and total RNA was isolated. As expected, lungs from Flu-ΔNS1-infected mice demonstrated strong transcriptional induction of IFNβ and IFNλ2 mRNA after 24 and 48 hpi as compared with Flu-wt infections (Fig. 1A). Transcriptional induction of IFN was not the result of differences in viral load as levels of nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA were comparable at each time point analyzed between both viral cohorts (Fig. 1A). RNA derived from pooled lungs of ΔNS1 infected mice were extracted and analyzed by affymetrix-based microarray. Fig. 1B depicts a subset of genes up-regulated at least 3-fold in IFNAR1−/−IL28Rα−/− mice infected, as compared with uninfected, mice. Of note, other ISGs such as Mx1 were not up-regulated under these conditions. Subsequent validation of the array was confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 1C). Given the activation of IRF3/7 in response to an NS1-deficient influenza A virus infection (50.Hale B.G. Randall R.E. Ortin J. Jackson D. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), transcriptional induction, in the absence of IFN signaling, presumably reflects the activity of these transcription factors. This is supported by the observation that IFNβ is highly induced in response to Flu-ΔNS1, a gene requiring the cooperative binding of two heterodimeric IRF3/IRF7 complexes (21.Panne D. Maniatis T. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1111-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It however is surprising that, in addition to IFNβ, many virus-inducible genes have also been characterized as ISGs (marked in green in Fig. 1B) despite the complete loss of ISGF3 activity. These results suggest that the paradigm of antiviral signaling being the transcriptional consequence of IFN-mediated ISGF3 activation is incorrect and that a layer of redundancy exists to induce a similar transcriptome, presumably to aid in the intracellular combat against viral infection. As the predicted protein:DNA contacts occupied by IRF3/7 and ISGF3 share many common bases within their respective DNA binding motifs, we speculated that IRF7 may perform functionally redundant roles to ISGF3. IRF7, unlike IRF3, is more promiscuous in its DNA binding (30.Lin R. Génin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), is inducible by IFN (36.Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and is found at high basal concentrations only in critical viral response cells such as pDCs (35.Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J. Amrute S. Yeow W.S. Megjugorac N. Dai J. Feng D. Chung E. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 74: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 52.Honda K.

To address this question, we aimed to identify an ISRE that could be bound by both ISGF3 and IRF7 with relative equal affinities. For these purposes, we focused on the manipulation of a well-characterized ISRE motif from the IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) (40.Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 41.Andersen J. VanScoy S. Cheng T.F. Gomez D. Reich N.C.

To this end, IRF7 or the components of ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, IRF9) were exogenously produced in fibroblasts and activated with either IKKϵ or IFNβ (Fig. 2A). To check functionality of the exogenous proteins, we performed a reporter assay utilizing an ISG15 ISRE-dependent luciferase construct. Expression of IRF7 or ISGF3, in the absence of stimulation, did not result in significant activation; however, activation of IRF7 with IKKϵ or ISGF3 with either IKKϵ or IFNβ led to strong induction of luciferase (Fig. 2B). This activity correlated to the engagement of an ISG15 ISRE oligonucleotide as measured by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 2C). IRF7 bound to the ISG15 ISRE as a homodimer, but not as a heterodimer with IRF3, as only an antibody generated against the Flag-tagged IRF7, but not against IRF3, could modulate the migration of the complex (Fig. 2C). ISGF3 migration was impacted by antibodies against STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, confirming formation of a functional ISGF3 complex (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, IRF9 binding to the oligonucleotide could be easily detected by EMSA, presumably as a monomer based on molecular mass, even in the absence of IFN treatment (Fig. 2C). Monomeric IRF9 binding is inversely correlated to the assembly of ISGF3 in which the additional binding of STAT1 and STAT2 is greatest in the presence of IFNβ and IKKϵ as previously described (13.tenOever B.R. Ng S.L. Chua M.A. McWhirter S.M. García-Sastre A. Maniatis T. Science. 2007; 315: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the exogenous expression and activation of IRF7 and ISGF3 reconstitutes a valid model to study binding redundancies between these transcription factors. To ascertain the requirements for IRF7 and ISGF3 binding, we performed EMSAs on the aforementioned IRF7 and ISGF3 extracts beginning first with the wild-type ISG15 ISRE (ISG15wt, Fig. 3A). This ISRE element corresponds with the enhancer used in the luciferase reporter shown in Fig. 2B. The ISG15-ISRE consists of two overlapping ISRE core sequences as defined by the GAAA motif found in characterized ISRE and IRF-E sites (Fig. 3A, blue box). Surprisingly, while the ISG15 ISRE encodes a complete ISGF3 (GAAANNGAAACT (5.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar) and IRF motif (AANNGAAANNGAAA (14.Fujii Y. Shimizu T. Kusumoto M. Kyogoku Y. Taniguchi T. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5028-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) the probe itself was found to only strongly associate with IRF7. To further refine the binding sites of IRF7 and ISGF3, and to ascertain whether overlap between the transcription factor motifs is evident, we began by minimizing the ISG15 ISRE to a single core sequence flanked with adjacent nucleotides (nts) from the human ISG15-promoter (gray boxes in Fig. 3B, ISG15core+wt in which the core is referenced as nt 1–12, the 5′-flanking sequence −1 to −7, and the 3′-flanking region +1 to +8). Motif minimization resulted in minimal reduction of IRF7 binding but a sig"
https://openalex.org/W1967516237,"Tonic inhibition in the brain is mediated largely by specialized populations of extrasynaptic receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs). In the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus, tonic inhibition is mediated primarily by GABAAR subtypes assembled from α4β2/3 with or without the δ subunit. Although the gating of these receptors is subject to dynamic modulation by agents such as anesthetics, barbiturates, and neurosteroids, the cellular mechanisms neurons use to regulate their accumulation on the neuronal plasma membrane remain to be determined. Using immunoprecipitation coupled with metabolic labeling, we demonstrate that the α4 subunit is phosphorylated at Ser443 by protein kinase C (PKC) in expression systems and hippocampal slices. In addition, the β3 subunit is phosphorylated on serine residues 408/409 by PKC activity, whereas the δ subunit did not appear to be a PKC substrate. We further demonstrate that the PKC-dependent increase of the cell surface expression of α4 subunit-containing GABAARs is dependent on Ser443. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of Ser443 acts to increase the stability of the α4 subunit within the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby increasing the rate of receptor insertion into the plasma membrane. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of Ser443 increases the activity of α4 subunit-containing GABAARs by preventing current run-down. These results suggest that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the α4 subunit plays a significant role in enhancing the cell surface stability and activity of GABAAR subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition.

Nusser Z. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). These receptors are pentameric, anion-selective ion channels that can be assembled from eight subunit classes: α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ϵ, θ, π, and ρ(1–3)(2–3). This large number of receptor subunits provides the basis for a significant degree of heterogeneity of GABAAR structure and function. However, previous studies suggest that in the brain, the majority of phasic inhibition is dependent upon a few GABAARs subunits, namely the α, β, and γ2 subunits located within synaptic sites (2.Rudolph U. Crestani F. Möhler H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 188-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3.Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, these receptors are specific targets for brief exposures to high concentrations of GABA, resulting in short lived, but significant, hyperpolarization. In contrast, tonic inhibition is characterized by a sustained reduction in the cell's input resistance, effectively reducing the probability of action potential generation (1.Farrant M. Nusser Z.

Tonic inhibition is the result of persistent activation by GABAARs consisting primarily of α, β, and δ subunits located within peri- or extrasynaptic sites (1.Farrant M. Nusser Z. Nat. Rev.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7520-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Little is known about the endogenous mechanism by which neurons control the functional properties of GABAAR subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition. It has long been established that a direct relationship exists between the number of synaptic GABAARs at the cell surface and the strength of inhibition at the synapse (29.Nusser Z. Cull-Candy S. Farrant M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 30.Nusser Z. Hájos N. Somogyi P. Mody I. Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Therefore, modulating the insertion and removal rate of GABAARs into or from the cell membrane has a marked affect on the amplitude of inhibitory synaptic currents (31.Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One way in which modulation occurs is via posttranslational modifications of the synaptic GABAAR. Specifically, the phosphorylation of key residues on synaptic GABAAR subunits regulates the extent to which the GABAAR will interact with protein complexes responsible for endocytosis from and insertion to the cell membrane; however, the significance of these regulatory processes for subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition remains largely unknown (32.Tretter V. Moss S.J. Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33.Tang X. Hernandez C.C. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation plays a role in regulating the functional expression of GABAARs containing α4 subunits. Our results reveal that the α4 subunit is phosphorylated on Ser443 within the intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (TM3 and TM4) in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. Activating PKC also resulted in higher steady state cell surface accumulation of GABAARs containing the α4 subunit that was dependent on enhanced insertion into the plasma membrane when expressed in a mammalian cell line. Consistent with this, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Ser433 produced a robust enhancement in GABA-induced currents in this expression system. Finally, we also observed that PKC activity increased both the phosphorylation and cell surface stability of the α4 subunit in hippocampal slices, a phenomenon that should be correlated with an increase in tonic inhibition. Together, these experiments establish a crucial role for PKC in regulating the functional expression of GABAAR subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition via direct phosphorylation of the α4 subunit.DISCUSSIONThe hippocampus is responsible for the formation of various types of memory in mammals. Pivotal to this role, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus acts as an information-processing center between afferent connections from the entorhinal cortex and efferent connections to cornu ammonis region 3 of the hippocampus (53.Carlson G.C. Coulter D.A. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specifically, the dentate gyrus is responsible for filtering out stimulus-related high frequency firing from the entorhinal cortex and organizing it into a coherent signal that the rest of the hippocampus can utilize (54.Behr J. Lyson K.J. Mody I. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1726-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Compromising filtering function of the dentate gyrus leads to epileptiform activity in downstream hippocampal structures (55.Heinemann U. Beck H. Dreier J.P. Ficker E. Stabel J. Zhang C.L. Epilepsy Res. Suppl. 1992; 7: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). The filter-like function of the dentate gyrus is due to the intrinsic low excitability of granule cells residing in this region. This low excitability is a result of the high levels of protein expression of the GABAA α4 subunit, creating a significant degree of tonic inhibition (10.Chandra D. Jia F. Liang J. Peng Z. Suryanarayanan A. Werner D.F. Spigelman I. Houser C.R. Olsen R.W. Harrison N.L. Homanics G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15230-15235Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the cellular mechanisms that control the activity of the α4 subunit is crucial for better comprehending the complex mechanisms of memory formation as well as other higher brain functions where α4 subunit-mediated tonic inhibition has been shown to play a role.Here we have begun to analyze the endogenous mechanisms that neurons utilize to regulate the efficacy of tonic inhibition, focusing on the possible role that direct phosphorylation may play in these processes. For these studies, we used receptors composed of α4β3 and α4β3δ subunits because both of these combinations have been demonstrated to be present within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as measured using biochemical and electrophysiological experiments (5.Brünig I. Scotti E. Sidler C. Fritschy J.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 443: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6.Sun C. Sieghart W. Kapur J. Brain Res. 2004; 1029: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7.Jia F. Pignataro L. Schofield C.M. Yue M. Harrison N.L. Goldstein P.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4491-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8.Bencsits E. Ebert V. Tretter V. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19613-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9.Mortensen M. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 841-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We initiated these studies by determining if the α4 subunit is phosphorylated by expressing this protein in COS-7 cells and measuring the amount of radiolabeled phosphate that covalently bonds to the α4 subunit. This revealed that the α4 subunit is phosphorylated basally, and activation of PKC enhances subunit phosphorylation. Peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis showed that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the α4 subunit occurs on a serine residue in one distinct phosphopeptide region. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that the α4 subunit is phosphorylated at Ser443, an amino acid located in the major intracellular domain between TM3 and TM4. In addition to our recombinant studies, we also showed that PKC leads to high levels of α4 subunit serine phosphorylation in hippocampal slices from adult male mice. We also analyzed the phosphorylation of the δ and β3 subunits in our study. Consistent with studies on GABAAR subtypes that mediate phasic inhibition, Ser408/409 in the β3 subunit were phosphorylated by PKC activity when expressed with α4. However, at least in COS-7 cells, only low levels of δ subunit phosphorylation were seen. Thus, these results suggest that the primary PKC substrates with GABAAR subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition are Ser443 in the α4 subunit and Ser408/409 in β3.To begin ascertaining the functional consequences of phosphorylation on tonic inhibition, we looked at the effect PKC activation had on the cell surface stability of the α4 subunit. The activation of PKC leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of α4 subunit protein at the cell surface in both transfected COS-7 cells and hippocampal slices, as measured by biotinylation. The Ser443 phosphorylation site plays a crucial role in this enhancement because mutation of this residue did not result in elevated levels of α4 subunit protein at the cell surface of COS-7 cells. At this point, it was clear that Ser443 is essential in mediating the effects of PKC activity on α4 subunit cell surface accumulation. To begin to address the underlying mechanism, we measured the rate of insertion of the α4 subunit into the cell membrane using a BBS fluorescent insertion assay. Here we discovered that over a 10-min period, more mutant α4 was being inserted into the COS-7 cell membrane than wild type α4 subunit. This increased rate of insertion was also paralleled with an increase in stability of newly translated α4S433A subunit compared with wild type α4 when expressed alone in COS-7 cells. Given that the α4 subunit is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum in homomeric expression, this result suggests that phosphorylation of Ser443 acts to regulate the stability of the α4 subunit in this intracellular compartment, which would be predicted to increase receptor assembly, leading to increased insertion into the plasma membrane.To investigate this possibility, we measured the amount of protein degradation using an [35S]methionine pulse-chase assay and found that the α4 subunit Ser443 mutant was more stable in the endoplasmic reticulum over a 4-h period. Taking these results together, we see a situation in which the mutant version of the α4 subunit is not only degraded less but is inserted faster into the cell membrane. At first glance, this seems at odds with our results showing that Ser443 is a critical residue for the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the α4 subunit that leads to higher levels of this protein on the cell surface. How is it then that ablating this phosphorylation site prevents α4 from being phosphorylated but still causes the mutant protein to be inserted at a faster rate? One answer to this question is that mutation of Ser443 to an alanine results in phosphorylation mimic of the α4 subunit. That is to say that masking the hydroxyl group that is normally found in a serine residue by removing it, which is what we do when we replace this residue with an alanine, is tantamount to masking it by covalently attaching a phosphate group. Both situations may lead to similar protein conformational changes that result in the α4 subunit being more stable and therefore being inserted at a faster rate. We can further draw this conclusion from our electrophysiological studies, which suggest a similar occurrence. In these studies, we found that PKC activation reverses the run down that normally occurs in non-treated HEK293 cells expressing the wild-type α4 subunit, as is expected from our biotinylation studies. Interestingly, HEK293 cells expressing the α4 phosphomutant do not exhibit any run down, either in the presence or absence of PKC activation. That is to say that the mutant by itself is protected by the run-down effect that is normally observed in the wild-type α4 subunit. If this is the case, it is logical to conclude that the reason PKC does not exert an effect on the mutant α4 subunit is that the protein is already acting as if it is constitutively phosphorylated and is being inserted into the membrane at a maximal rate.Here we have for the first time a description of a PKC-dependent mechanism that regulates the activity of a GABAAR subunit that is primarily expressed in extrasynaptic sites. Our laboratory has shown in the past that synaptic GABAARs are highly regulated by kinase and phosphatase activity (32.Tretter V. Moss S.J. Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Due to the plethora of kinases and phosphatases that exert an effect on synaptic GABAARs and the different brain regions and cell types in which this activity has been observed, phosphorylation regulates synaptic inhibition in a multitude of ways. However, one common facet of phosphoregulation of synaptic GABAARs, with respect to cell surface stability, is that it modulates the endocytosis of the receptor. In contrast, we have shown in this study that kinase activity affects the insertion of extrasynaptic GABAAR subtypes. Synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition are two fundamentally different ways a neuron can regulate its excitability; therefore, it is important that the neuron be able to regulate each form by modulating different cellular mechanisms.In summary, our studies demonstrate that the α4 subunit, a protein critical for tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, is phosphorylated by PKC on Ser443. This phosphorylation leads to an increase in the functional expression of the α4 subunit-containing GABAAR by increasing its stability and enhancing the rate at which this receptor is inserted into the plasma membrane. Therefore, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the α4 subunit may have profound effects on the efficacy of tonic inhibition mediated by GABAARs.

Nusser Z. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). These receptors are pentameric, anion-selective ion channels that can be assembled from eight subunit classes: α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ϵ, θ, π, and ρ(1–3)(2–3). This large number of receptor subunits provides the basis for a significant degree of heterogeneity of GABAAR structure and function. However, previous studies suggest that in the brain, the majority of phasic inhibition is dependent upon a few GABAARs subunits, namely the α, β, and γ2 subunits located within synaptic sites (2.Rudolph U. Crestani F. Möhler H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 188-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3.Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, these receptors are specific targets for brief exposures to high concentrations of GABA, resulting in short lived, but significant, hyperpolarization. In contrast, tonic inhibition is characterized by a sustained reduction in the cell's input resistance, effectively reducing the probability of action potential generation (1.Farrant M. Nusser Z.

In this study, we have employed FRET between identical fluorophores (homo-FRET) to monitor the dimerization and oligomerization state of the EGFR before and after receptor activation. Our data show that, in the absence of ligand, ∼40% of the EGFR molecules were present as inactive dimers or predimers.

Our data show that EGFR oligomerization is the result of EGFR signaling and enhances EGFR internalization. The EGF receptor (EGFR 2The abbreviations used are: EGFREGF receptorFKBPFK506-binding proteinmGFPmonomeric GFP. ; ErbB1) has an essential role in the regulation of growth and differentiation of a large range of cell types. The EGFR belongs to the ErbB family, all four members of which have been implicated in the development of different cancers (1Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). The first step in the signal transduction cascade is the binding of its ligand such as EGF or TGF-α to the ectodomain, which provokes receptor dimerization and oligomerization. Deletion of the dimerization domain, which is present in domain II of the EGFR ectodomain, blocks receptor activation completely, demonstrating that receptor dimerization is critical for the allosteric activation of the tyrosine kinase (2Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W.

Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase results in cross-phosphorylation of the receptors, and the phosphotyrosines in the intracellular domain serve subsequently as docking sites for adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Shc and enzymes such as phospholipase Cγ, which contain phosphotyrosine-specific SH2 (Src homology 2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Eventually, the active ligand-receptor complex becomes internalized via both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways, followed by the intracellular transport to lysosomes, where the ligand-receptor complexes are degraded (4Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). EGF receptor FK506-binding protein monomeric GFP. Although EGF binding and dimerization seem to be strictly connected, both microscopic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that, in resting cells, the receptor is already found on the cell surface as non-active dimers, the so-called predimers. This phenomenon was initially discovered using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of the EGFR: in the resting cell, ∼35% of the total receptor population was present as receptor predimers (5van Belzen N. Rijken P.J. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed by chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation studies with differentially tagged EGFRs (6Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol.

More recently, also advanced light microscopic methods have been used to address this question. EGFR predimerization has now been demonstrated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, FRET, and single-molecule imaging (9Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J.

Recent structural data showed that the dimerization of the C-terminal part of the kinase prevents kinase activation and represents a mechanism through which the EGFR tyrosine kinase is inhibited in resting cells (16Jura N.

Factors controlling EGFR predimer formation, ligand-induced oligomerization, and the function of both phenomena are poorly understood. In this study, we have used homo-FRET imaging to investigate the regulation of EGFR predimerization and oligomerization. We recently developed a homo-FRET imaging method that allows quantification of the degree of protein clustering on a subcellular level (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is based on FRET between identical fluorophores (homo-FRET), meaning that the nanometer proximity between identical reporter fluorophores such as GFP is detected with high sensitivity. Application of this method showed that, in the resting cell, ∼40% of the total EGFR population was already present as predimers (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A large increase in receptor oligomerization was seen after ligand binding. EGFR predimers were formed independently of kinase activity, whereas EGF-induced receptor clustering was found to require both kinase activity and the substrate tyrosine residues. Inducing predimerization/oligomerization using FK506-binding protein (FKBP) dimerization domains demonstrated that receptor predimer formation enhances EGFR internalization. To create the FKBP-monomeric GFP (mGFP)-containing constructs, mGFP was first PCR-amplified from pEGFP-N1 using primers 5′-atatactagtatggtgagcaagggcgaggagctgttc-3′ and 5′-atatggatccttacttgtacagctcgtccatgccgagagt-3′, which introduced the flanking restriction sites SpeI and BamHI (underlined). The enhanced GFP PCR product was inserted into the corresponding sites of pC4-Fv1E (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) to produce pC4-Fv1E-GFP. A monomeric variant of enhanced GFP (mGFP) was constructed by sited-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-cagtccaagctgagcaaagaccccaacgagaagcgcgatcac-3′ and 5′-gtgatcgcgcttctcgttggggtctttgctcagcttggactg-3′ (with the mutated codons in boldface) as described previously (18Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), resulting in the FKBP-mGFP plasmid. pcDNA3-EGFR-9YF was made by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene mutagenesis kit) of the human EGFR cDNA, resulting in tyrosine-to-phenylalanine transitions at positions 845, 974, 992, 1045, 1068, 1086, 1101, 1148, and 1173. The EGFR constructs were PCR-amplified with primers 5′-atatatcaattgatgcgaccctccgggacggccg-3′ and 5′-atatattctagatgctccaataaattcactgctttgtgg-3′, introducing flanking MunI and XbaI sites (underlined), and inserted into pC4-Fv1E-mGFP. To construct EGFR-mGFP and EGFR-K721A-mGFP, the FKBP domain was removed by digestion with XbaI and SpeI and self-ligation. For cells stably expressing the gene products, the EGFR constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1-zeo (Invitrogen). The final constructs were amplified in Escherichia coli, purified using an endotoxin-free plasmid isolation kit, and confirmed by sequencing. A431 (ATCC CRL-1555), NIH 3T3 2.2 and Her14 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 7.5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 under humidified conditions. Transient transfection with all constructs was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells stably expressing EGFR-FKBP-mGFP or its mutants were produced using selective growth conditions (500 μm Zeocin) and FACS. For microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days to 50% confluency. The internalization rate constant (Ke) was determined as described previously (19Fallon L. Bélanger C.M. Corera A.T. Kontogiannea M. Regan-Klapisz E. Moreau F. Voortman J. Haber M. Rouleau G. Thorarinsdottir T. Brice A. van Bergen En Henegouwen P.M. Fon E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 24-well CellBIND plates to 80% confluency and serum-starved overnight in 0.5% FCS-supplemented DMEM. Cells were incubated for 1 h with ice-cold binding medium (DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with either 1 μm AP20187 or 0.1% ethanol (mock). EGF (Oxford Biotechnology) was labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method, yielding a typical specific activity of >400,000 cpm/ng. The EGb4 nanobody (15 μg) was labeled with 1 mCi of 125I in lodogen-coated glass tubes with a typical specific activity of >1500 cpm/ng. Subsequently, 1 ng/ml 125I-EGF or 125I-EGb4 was added in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 3, 6, 9, and 12 min at 37 °C. To collect surface-bound EGF, cells were incubated for 5 min with ice-cold acid wash buffer (for EGF, 150 mm NaCl and 25 mm NaOH/CH3COOH, pH 3.8; and for EGb4, 250 mm NaCl and 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5), and internalized EGF was collected in 1 m NaOH. The ratio of internalized and surface radioactivity was plotted against time, yielding the internalization rate constant (Ke). NIH 3T3 2.2 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with the indicated constructs and incubated overnight in 0.5% FCS-supplemented DMEM, followed by incubation with 1 μm AP20187 for 1 h, with 8 nm EGF for 10 min, or with a combination of both. After washing, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture). The EGFR-FKBP-mGFP constructs were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science), size-separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Fluorescence anisotropy microscopy was performed essentially as described previously (20Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Optics Express. 2007; 15: 6934-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A 473-nm pulsed diode laser (BDL-473, Becker & Hickl) operating at 50 MHz was directly coupled to a modified confocal scan head (C1, Nikon Instruments Europe B. V., Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). A linear polarizer (Meadowlark, Frederick, CO) was positioned in the laser beam to define the excitation polarization direction. The microscope was equipped with a ×60 (numerical aperture = 1.20) water immersion objective (Plan Apo, Nikon). For GFP, a value of r0 = 0.38 was found instead of the theoretical value of 0.4. The emission light was split into a parallel and perpendicular channel with a broadband polarizing beam splitter cube (OptoSigma, Santa Ana, CA). The two emission channels were coupled to LIMO detection systems (Nikon) (21de Grauw C.J. Gerritsen H.C. Appl. Spectrosc. 2001; 55: 670-678Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), equipped with an internal photon-counting photomultiplier tube. All images were recorded in a 160 × 160-pixel mode, covering an area of 50 × 50 μm. The procedures of data analysis, synchronization, and correction for sensitivity differences between the two channels were based on using reference dyes. Anisotropy analysis showed that rinf/rmono values between 1 and 0.87 were found in the monomeric situation, whereas the dimers generated values between 0.87 and 0.77 and between 0.77 and 0, with a mean value of 0.72, corresponding to oligomers. The cluster size images were calculated using anisotropy images. Binning with a factor of 2 was required to obtain sufficient signal to discriminate NAV = 1, NAV = 2, and NAV ≥ 3. The dimerization/oligomerization state of the EGFR in the cell was analyzed by homo-FRET imaging, a method that we developed previously (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For these studies, the EGFR was fused to a monomeric variant of enhanced GFP (A206K), which has a reduced dimerization binding affinity (KD = ∼74 mm) (18Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Homo-FRET imaging was done with a confocal time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging microscope (20Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Optics Express. 2007; 15: 6934-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which allows for direct quantification of the number of fluorophores in a nanometer scale cluster (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This method is based upon the fact that GFP monomers have high anisotropy, which decreases with increasing degree of clustering. The measured (steady-state) anisotropy (r) relates directly to cluster size (N), which, in addition, depends on the efficiency of the energy transfer and the relative orientation of the fluorophores (22Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1569-1583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This relation is simplified when the limiting anisotropy (rinf) in the time-resolved anisotropy decay is measured instead of the steady-state anisotropy because rinf is not affected by variations in the efficiency of energy transfer (20Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Optics Express. 2007; 15: 6934-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The calibration value for the anisotropy of GFP monomers (rmono; theoretically 0.4 but often lower due to high numerical aperture objectives) is determined using a solution of 10 μm GFP in 50:50 glycerol/buffer. At this concentration, GFP can be considered as monomeric because this concentration is well below the affinity value for GFP dimerization (KD = 110 μm) (18Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). To determine the degree of protein clustering in the cell, we used reference proteins that contain one copy of mGFP and one or two copies of the dimerization domain from FKBP. With these reference proteins, either dimerization or oligomerization can be induced by the addition of the ligand for the FKBP domain: AP20187 (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Control experiments revealed that our EGFR-FKBP-mGFP constructs were not activated by the addition of AP20187 (supplemental Fig. S1). Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which are devoid of endogenous EGFR (clone 2.2), were stably transfected with a vector encoding mGFP or EGFR-mGFP (for an overview of all EGFR constructs used in this study, see Fig. 1A). FACS was performed to obtain comparable expression levels of the fluorescent constructs, which related to ∼50,000 proteins/cell. Control experiments demonstrated that activation of the EGFR-mGFP construct was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type EGFR, which is in agreement with other studies (15Clayton A.H. Walker F. Orchard S.G. Henderson C. Fuchs D. Rothacker J. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30392-30399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine the anisotropy (rinf), at least five cells per condition were analyzed, and the average value of rinf per cell was used for statistical analysis. The results are presented as the degree of polarization (rinf/rmono). Comparison of cells expressing mGFP or EGFR-mGFP showed that EGFR-mGFP had a significant higher loss of anisotropy compared with cytoplasmic mGFP (Fig. 1B). To prove that the anisotropy loss was due to homo-FRET in receptor predimers, we recorded the average time-resolved anisotropy decay (supplemental Fig. S2). A typical homo-FRET profile was observed: an immediate drop in r (<1 ns) that leveled off to rinf, demonstrating that homo-FRET occurs with high efficiency. This is an important parameter that confirms that the reference constructs can be used. In previous work, we showed that the amount of depolarization due to homo-FRET can be directly related to the degree of clustering (17Bader A.N. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. en Henegouwen P.M. Gerritsen H.C. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2613-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For EGFR-mGFP in resting cells, the relative anisotropy value (rinf/rmono) was 0.89. This corresponds to a fraction of clusters of 0.4, which means that 40% of all EGFR molecules are part of a predimer or precluster. As a control experiment, we coexpressed EGFR-mGFP in cells with a high level of endogenous EGFRs (3 × 105 and 2 × 106 receptors/cell for Her14 and A431 cells, respectively). This is based upon the idea that heterodimerization of EGFR-mGFP with endogenous EGFR does not result in homo-FRET, resulting in anisotropy values similar to the mGFP control values (10Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Barisas B.G. Heintzmann R. Post J.N. Lidke K.A. Clayton A.H. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Jovin T.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anisotropy analysis demonstrated that this was indeed the case: the anisotropy of EGFR-mGFP in these cells was increased in Her14 and A431 cells to the situation observed for mGFP (Fig. 1B). In addition, we analyzed whether this predimer formation was dependent upon the concentration of EGFRs by plotting the intensity values of individual pixels against their anisotropy value. No differences in anisotropy values were apparent in pixels with higher intensities (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that EGFR predimer formation is concentration-independent. In conclusion, our data show that ∼40% of the total EGFR-mGFP population is predimerized in the plasma membrane of non-stimulated NIH 3T3 2.2 cells. We next investigated the effect of EGF on the oligomerization state of the EGFR using homo-FRET imaging. Cells expressing EGFR-mGFP were treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 8 nm EGF and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. In the resting cell, EGFR-mGFP was located primarily in the plasma membrane, with more intense staining in membrane ruffles (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In EGF-stimulated cells, EGFR-mGFP became increasingly present in intracellular vesicles, reflecting the EGF-induced internalization of the active EGFR (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Effects on anisotropy (rinf) are indicated in false colors: a clear effect of EGF on the anisotropy was observed, reflecting the EGF-induced oligomerization (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Note that also the internalized receptors in the early endosomes were oligomerized. Using the reference rinf values of monomers, dimers, and oligomers, we converted the anisotropy values into a cluster size image (Fig. 2C). In the resting state, the EGFR population was found as a mixture of monomers and dimers. After treatment of the cell with EGF, the majority of EGFRs were found in nanoscale clusters of three or more receptors per cluster (Fig. 2C). From a direct comparison of the average depolarization rinf/rmono with reference values (Fig. 2B), we can conclude that EGFR-mGFP forms large clusters upon stimulation with EGF. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the rinf is calculated on the basis of Gaussian fitting of the anisotropy values of all pixels in the image. To demonstrate the homogeneity in the response, the anisotropy values of two representative cells from both conditions are presented and show a true shift in the mean value of rinf (supplemental Fig. S4). In conclusion, comparison of the calculated average anisotropy values from non-stimulated and EGF-stimulated EGFR-mGFP-expressing cells demonstrated a significant decrease in anisotropy and consequently an increase in EGFR clustering in EGF-stimulated cells. To analyze the role of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in the oligomerization of EGFR, a kinase-dead EGFR construct (EGFR-K721A) was fused to mGFP. Cells expressing wild-type EGFR-mGFP or EGFR-K721A-mGFP were incubated for different time periods with 8 nm EGF, fixed, and analyzed by homo-FRET imaging. For EGFR-K721A-mGFP, the distribution pattern was similar at time 0 to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3, A and B). After EGF stimulation, intracellular vesicles appeared after 10–20 min, indicative of receptor internalization (Fig. 3, A and B), which is in agreement with our previous studies (23Stoorvogel W. Kerstens S. Fritzsche I. den Hartigh J.C. Oud R. van der Heyden M.A. Voortman J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11562-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the K721A and wild-type receptors displayed similar anisotropy values (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the kinase-dead EGFR forms predimers to a similar extent as the wild-type EGFR; thus, predimer formation is kinase-independent. For the wild-type receptors, the anisotropy values decreased within 5 min to values corresponding to receptor oligomers (Fig. 3, A–C). Ligand-induced EGFR oligomerization was maintained for at least 20 min after stimulation. A gradual increase in anisotropy was seen from 10 to 45 min after activation, which might be caused by receptor dissociation or lysosomal degradation of receptor oligomers. The effect of EGF on the oligomerization of the kinase-dead mutant was analyzed for the same period of time. Remarkably, this mutant did not display any change in anisotropy for the entire observation period of 45 min, indicating that the amount of receptor predimers is not affected and that kinase-dead EGFRs do not oligomerize. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the EGFR predimer formation is kinase-independent, whereas the ligand-induced EGFR oligomerization is kinase-dependent. Consequently, the monomer/predimer ratio in the plasma membrane is not affected by the binding of EGF. Because kinase activity was found to be essential for EGFR oligomerization, we wanted to see whether preventing tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR had similar effects on receptor oligomerization. To investigate this, we used an EGFR mutant in which nine C-terminal tyrosine residues at positions 845, 974, 992, 1045, 1068, 1086, 1101, 1148, and 1173 were mutated to phenylalanines (EGFR-9YF). Control experiments show that phosphorylation of the wild-type EGFR-FKBP-mGFP protein was induced by EGF, in contrast to the K721A and 9YF mutants (Fig. 4A). NIH 3T3 2.2 cells stably expressing these constructs were left untreated or were stimulated with 8 nm EGF for 10 min and fixed. In the absence of ligand, the anisotropy of the wild-type and mutant K721A and 9YF receptors was similar, reflecting a similar degree of predimer formation (Fig. 4B). As expected, the wild-type receptor showed a decrease in anisotropy after EGF stimulation, reflecting an increase in homo-FRET and consequently in receptor oligomerization. EGF treatment of cells expressing the K721A or 9YF mutant did not result in a change in anisotropy compared with untreated cells. This result demonstrates that the kinase-dependent EGFR oligomerization requires the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the EGFR. An important question concerns the possible function of both receptor predimer formation and receptor oligomerization. Modeling of EGFR activation via monomers and predimers predicts that activation via the predimers would result in 100-fold faster activation or phosphorylation of the receptor (13Teramura Y. Ichinose J. Takagi H. Nishida K. Yanagida T. Sako Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4215-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consequently, the predimerization or even pre-oligomerization would result in faster signaling and higher sensitivity of the cell for EGF. To test a role for EGFR predimer/oligomer formation in signaling, we expressed EGFR fused to one or two copies of FKBP (Fig. 1A). Cells were either left untreated or were pretreated with 1 μm AP20187 for 1 h to induce predimer/oligomer formation, followed by incubation with 8 nm EGF for 9 min at 37 °C. Anisotropy analysis already showed that incubation of the cells expressing this construct led to a reduction in anisotropy, reflecting the increase in EGFR predimers (Fig. 2B). However, combined treatment with AP20187 and EGF did not, at least under the conditions used, enhance receptor activation compared with EGF alone (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5). Also, downstream targets of EGFR signaling such as Akt and MAPK were not affected, indicating that no function for receptor predimerization in the EGFR activation process could be discerned (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5). Moreover, similar results were obtained with an EGFR construct with two copies of FKBP, which became pre-oligomerized (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5). Further refinement of this analysis with additional time intervals (3–12 min) and lower ligand concentrations (0.25–8 nm EGF) yielded similar results. This approach was subsequently used to investigate a possible role for EGFR clustering in receptor internalization. The internalization rate constant (Ke) was determined using a single-domain llama antibody, or nanobody, that does not activate the receptor or compete for EGF binding (24Hofman E.G. Ruonala M.O. Bader A.N. van den Heuvel D. Voortman J. Roovers R.C. Verkleij A.J. Gerritsen H.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing the EGFR-FKBP-mGFP or EGFR-2×FKBP-mGFP construct were either left untreated or pretreated with AP20187 to induce EGFR predimerization or pre-oligomerization, respectively, and then incubated with radiolabeled anti-EGFR nanobody (125I-EGb4) in the absence of EGF or in the presence of a high concentration EGF (8 nm EGF). The data show that, in the control situation, the monovalent EGb4 nanobody was internalized at a low rate, reflecting fluid-phase endocytosis (Fig. 5B). The addition of EGF stimulated the internalization rate constant significantly, demonstrating the dominant role for kinase activity in the internalization process. However, internalization rate constants were dramatically increased after predimerization of the EGFR prior to EGF treatment. Remarkably, pre-oligomerization of the recept"

Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. We identify Lys-117, which resides near the catalytic triad, as the primary site of ubiquitination in wild type and pathogenic ataxin-3. Further studies indicate that ubiquitin-dependent activation of ataxin-3 at Lys-117 is important for its ability to reduce high molecular weight ubiquitinated species in cells. Ubiquitination at Lys-117 also facilitates the ability of ataxin-3 to induce aggresome formation in cells. Finally, structure-function studies support a model of activation whereby ubiquitination at Lys-117 enhances ataxin-3 activity independent of the known ubiquitin-binding sites in ataxin-3, most likely through a direct conformational change in or near the catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2025494761,"Kallikrein-related peptidase-8 (KLK8) is a relatively uncharacterized epidermal protease. Although proposed to regulate skin-barrier desquamation and recovery, the catalytic activity of KLK8 was never demonstrated in human epidermis, and its regulators and targets remain unknown. Herein, we elucidated for the first time KLK8 activity in human non-palmoplantar stratum corneum and sweat ex vivo. The majority of stratum corneum and sweat KLK8 was catalytically active, displaying optimal activity at pH 8.5 and considerable activity at pH 5. We also showed that KLK8 is a keratinocyte-specific protease, not secreted by human melanocytes or dermal fibroblasts. KLK8 secretion increased significantly upon calcium induction of terminal keratinocyte differentiation, suggesting an active role for this protease in upper epidermis. Potential activators, regulators, and targets of KLK8 activity were identified by in vitro kinetic assays using pro-KLK8 and mature KLK8 recombinant proteins produced in Pichia pastoris. Mature KLK8 activity was enhanced by calcium and magnesium ions and attenuated by zinc ions and by autocleavage after Arg(164). Upon screening KLK8 cleavage of a library of FRET-quenched peptides, trypsin-like specificity was observed with the highest preference for (R/K)(S/T)(A/V) at P1-P1'-P2'. We also demonstrated that KLK5 and lysyl endopeptidase activate latent pro-KLK8, whereas active KLK8 targets pro-KLK11, pro-KLK1, and LL-37 antimicrobial peptide activation in vitro. Together, our data identify KLK8 as a new active serine protease in human stratum corneum and sweat, and we propose regulators and targets that augment its involvement in a skin barrier proteolytic cascade. The implications of KLK8 elevation and hyperactivity in desquamatory and inflammatory skin disease conditions remain to be studied."

The mechanism underlying DJ-1-related selective vulnerability in the dopaminergic pathway is, however, not known. DJ-1 has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation, and one of transcriptional target genes for DJ-1 is the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, the product of which is a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. It has been reported that DJ-1 is a neuroprotective transcriptional co-activator that sequesters a transcriptional co-repressor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) from the TH gene promoter. In this study, we found that knockdown of human DJ-1 by small interference RNA in human dopaminergic cell lines attenuated TH gene expression and 4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine production but that knockdown or knock-out of mouse DJ-1 in mouse cell lines or in mice did not affect such expression and TH activity. In reporter assays using the human TH gene promoter linked to the luciferase gene, stimulation of TH promoter activity was observed in human cells, but not mouse cells, that had been transfected with DJ-1. Although human DJ-1 and mouse DJ-1 were associated either with human or with mouse PSF, TH promoter activity inhibited by PSF was restored by human DJ-1 but not by mouse DJ-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the complex of PSF with DJ-1 bound to the human but not the mouse TH gene promoter. These results suggest a novel species-specific transcriptional regulation of the TH promoter by DJ-1 and one of the mechanisms for no reduction of TH in DJ-1-knock-out mice.

Tyrosine is converted to l-DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and l-DOPA is then converted to dopamine by l-DOPA decarboxylase. TH is, therefore, a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis and is used as a marker for dopaminergic neurons. It has been reported that PSF, a transcription co-repressor, binds to the promoter region of the TH gene to repress its expression and that human DJ-1 binds to PSF to sequester the PSF·co-repressor complex, leading to activation of TH gene expression in cultured human cells (20Zhong N. Kim C.Y. Rizzu P. Geula C. Porter D.R. Pothos E.N. Squitieri F. Heutink P. Xu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20940-20948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional activation of the TH gene by DJ-1, we have reported that DJ-1 activated TH and l-DOPA decarboxylase through direct binding to TH and l-DOPA decarboxylase in an oxidative status of DJ-1-dependent manner (23Ishikawa S. Taira T. Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Maita C. Maita H. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28832-28844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although human DJ-1 activates TH gene expression in cultured human dopaminergic cells, the reason why knock-out of DJ-1 expression did not affect the dopamine level in mice is not known.In this study, we compared the roles of human DJ-1 and mouse DJ-1 in expression of the TH gene, and we found that DJ-1 activates TH expression at the transcriptional level in human cells but not in mouse cells due to loss of PSF·DJ-1 binding to the mouse TH gene, suggesting different regulatory systems of the TH gene by DJ-1 in humans and mice.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that expression of the TH gene and TH activity were reduced in DJ-1-knockdown human cells but not in DJ-1-knockdown or DJ-1-knock-out mouse cells and that this occurred at the transcriptional level, where PSF, a transcription co-repressor, was sequestered from the promoter region by DJ-1 in human cells. Although mouse DJ-1 was associated with mouse PSF, ChIP assays showed that the recognition sequence was absent in the mouse TH promoter, meaning that there was no repression of TH gene expression by PSF in mouse cells. These findings indicate a species-specific regulation of TH gene expression by DJ-1 and PSF. It has been reported that PSF binds to the promoter region of the TH gene to repress its expression and that human DJ-1 binds to PSF to sequester the PSF·co-repressor complex, leading to activation of TH gene expression in cultured human cells (36Meulener M. Whitworth A.J. Armstrong-Gold C.E. Rizzu P. Heutink P. Wes P.D. Pallanck L.J. Bonini N.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1572-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In DJ-1-knock-out mice, however, no severe phenotype, including loss of dopamine, has been reported (13Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys.

Our study, therefore, shows one reason for no loss of dopamine in DJ-1-knock-out mice.In reporter assays using luciferase gene-linked promoters from human and mouse TH genes, stimulation of TH promoter activity by DJ-1 was observed in the homologous combination between the human TH promoter, human DJ-1, and human cells but not between human TH promoter, human DJ-1, and mouse cells or between mouse TH promoter, mouse DJ-1, and mouse cells. Furthermore, stimulation of human TH promoter activity by human DJ-1 was specific to dopaminergic cells (Fig. 3). Luciferase activity in mouse Neuro-2a cells was higher than that in human SH-SY5Y cells (supplemental Fig. 1). The expression levels of DJ-1 in Neuro-2a and SH-SY5Y cells are similar. Because transfection efficiency of plasmid DNA in Neuro-2a cells is higher than that in SH-SY5Y cells, it is thought that high luciferase activity in Neuro-2a cells was obtained due to different transfection efficiency. Expression levels of endogenous DJ-1 in all of the cells are at a similar level (Fig. 3E), and luciferase activity corresponding to the human TH promoter was stimulated by transfected FLAG-human DJ-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Because two plasmid DNAs, expression vectors for luciferase and FLAG-DJ-1, are generally transfected into the same cell at high frequency, luciferase activities obtained are thought to be responses to transfected FLAG-DJ-1 but not to endogenous DJ-1. Although it has been reported that PSF binds to the region spanning −2909 to −2707 upstream of the transcriptional start site to repress expression of the human TH gene, the DNA-binding sequence of PSF has not yet been determined. Because the identity of amino acid sequences between human and mouse PSFs is 93.51% and because we showed that both human DJ-1 and mouse DJ-1 bind to human PSF and that human and mouse PSF bind to each other (Fig. 4), human and mouse DJ-1s have a potential activity to bind to PSF of any mammalian species. Since we identified DJ-1 in 1997, we have been examining the DNA binding activity of DJ-1. No binding activity of DJ-1 was observed until now, and this study showed that DJ-1 directly binds to PSF, suggesting that DJ-1 binds to DNA via PSF. The results also show that mouse DJ-1 possessing binding activity to human PSF did not activate the human TH promoter in human SH-SY5Y cells. If sequestration of human PSF from the human TH gene promoter by DJ-1 is critical for TH gene expression, mouse DJ-1 seems to have some effect on TH gene expression. We do not have a clear answer to this point at present. Because the identity of amino acid sequences between human DJ-1 and mouse DJ-1 is 97%, there seem to be some structural/conformational differences between the two proteins. Because transcriptional activation or repression requires a proper complex comprised of multiple proteins, some structural/conformational differences may affect the regulation of gene expression. The identity of nucleotide sequences of the region corresponding to −2909 to −2707 between human and mouse TH genes is 44.29%. Furthermore, we found that DJ-1·PSF complex bound to the region spanning −2829 to −2790 in the human TH promoter (Fig. 8). Although the PSF-DNA binding sequence has not been determined, knockdown and knock-out of PSF and DJ-1 expression in mouse cells and in primary neuron culture, respectively, did not affect mouse TH gene expression, and no binding of DJ-1·PSF complex in this region was found in mouse cells (Fig. 6). Furthermore, competitive stimulation of human but not mouse TH promoter activity that had been inhibited by PSF was restored by DJ-1 (Fig. 5). DNA binding activity of PSF was attenuated by DJ-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). DJ-1-stimulated activity of human TH promoter with the region spanning −2829 to −2790 deleted was lower than that of human TH promoter without the deletion (Fig. 8). These results suggest that the regulation system of TH gene expression by DJ-1·PSF is present in human cells but not in mouse cells. Our study, therefore, shows one reason for no loss of dopamine in DJ-1-knock-out mice.Because DJ-1 has multiple functions to inhibit cell death (25Xu J. Zhong N. Wang H. Elias J.E. Kim C.Y.

Although genetically engineered mice are valuable tools for understanding neurodegenerative diseases, they often do not reproduce all of the symptoms and pathological hallmarks of human diseases, probably due to the sum of multiple factors, including compensatory response, short life span, and difference in biological systems. Although we showed one possibility, that regulation of TH gene expression by DJ-1 differs in humans and mice, a better animal model of DJ-1 deficiency is needed to fully understand the function of DJ-1. It has very recently been reported that mice with double knock-out of DJ-1 and Ret, a receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, displayed trophically impaired dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by DJ-1 requires an additional factor(s) (42Aron L.

Different strategies to inactivate DJ-1 have, however, led to distinct phenotypes (41Park J. Kim S.Y. Cha G.H. Lee S.B. Kim S. Chung J. Gene. 2005; 361: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only a study using siRNA to inactivate the Drosophila DJ-1 gene demonstrated an age-dependent decrease in the number of TH-positive neurons and total brain dopamine content that resembles the neuropathology in PD patients (43Yang Y.

Although DJ-1 siRNA-induced apoptosis certainly contributes to this observation, it would be of interest to examine whether DJ-1 inactivation leads to transcriptional down-regulation of TH gene expression in Drosophila as well.

The expression of Dachshund is lost in human breast cancer associated with poor prognosis. Breast tumor-initiating cells (TIC) may contribute to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Here, endogenous DACH1 was reduced in breast cancer cell lines with high expression of TIC markers and in patient samples of the basal breast cancer phenotype. Re-expression of DACH1 reduced new tumor formation in serial transplantations in vivo, reduced mammosphere formation, and reduced the proportion of CD44(high)/CD24(low) breast tumor cells. Conversely, lentiviral shRNA to DACH1 increased the breast (B)TIC population. Genome-wide expression studies of mammary tumors demonstrated DACH1 repressed a molecular signature associated with stem cells (SOX2, Nanog, and KLF4) and genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis identified DACH1 binding to the promoter of the Nanog, KLF4, and Lin28 genes.

ECs also express abundantly an adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), but its role in EC ROS production remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of A2AR in the regulation of Nox2 activity and signaling in ECs with or without acute AngII stimulation. In cultured ECs (SVEC4–10), AngII (100 nm, 30 min) significantly increased Nox2 membrane translocation and association with A2AR. These were accompanied by p47phox, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt phosphorylation and an increased ROS production (169 ± 0.04%). These AngII effects were inhibited back to the control levels by a specific A2AR antagonist (SCH58261), or adenosine deaminase, or by knockdown of A2AR or Nox2 using specific siRNAs. Knockdown of A2AR, as determined by Western blotting, decreased Nox2 and p47phox expression. In wild-type mouse aorta, SCH58261 significantly reduced acute AngII-induced ROS production and preserved endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation to acetylcholine. These results were further confirmed by using aortas from A2AR knock-out mice. In conclusion, A2AR is involved in the regulation of EC ROS production by Nox2.

Ijzerman A.P. Jacobson K.A. Klotz K.N. Linden J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 527-552PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Among these adenosine receptors, A2AR has been found to be extensively expressed in vascular ECs and had been widely reported to play a major role in mediating adenosine-induced endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation (3Tabrizchi R. Bedi S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Knock-out of A2AR reduced aortic relaxation and endothelial function in mice (4Ponnoth D.S. Sanjani M.S. Ledent C. Roush K. Krahn T. Mustafa S.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H1655-H1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this notion has been challenged by studies showing that A2AR was not involved in the relaxation of the isolated mouse aorta to adenosine and its analogues (5Prentice D. Boon K. Hourani S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 415: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was not involved in mediating adenosine-induced Ca2+ influx in ECs, which is crucial for endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation (6Cheng K.T. Leung Y.K. Shen B. Kwok Y.C. Wong C.O. Kwan H.Y. Man Y.B. Ma X. Huang Y. Yao X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).ECs also express constitutively an NADPH oxidase (Nox), which, by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as second messengers, contributes to the regulation of EC function (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The Nox enzyme comprises a cytochrome b, which can be further divided into one catalytic subunit (a member of the Nox family) and one p22phox. To date, five members of the Nox family have been identified (Nox1–5) (8Bengtsson S.H. Gulluyan L.M. Dusting G.J. Drummond G.R. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and Nox2 and Nox4 are the major Nox isoforms expressed in ECs and represent important enzymatic sources of EC ROS production (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 9Fan L.M. Teng L. Li J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Nox2 is a highly glycosylated protein and requires the presence of regulatory subunits, i.e. p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and rac1, for its activation (11Sumimoto H. Miyano K. Takeya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In response to pathophysiological stimulations such as shear stress, angiotensin II (AngII), or inflammatory cytokines (TNFα), the activity of Nox2 (but not Nox4) is up-regulated, and excessive ROS production from Nox2 outstrips endogenous antioxidant defense and causes EC dysfunction (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 12Li J.M. Wheatcroft S. Fan L.M. Kearney M.T. Shah A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Several studies have reported a role of A2AR in the regulation of ROS production by Nox2 enzyme, although the outcomes differed from one organ to another. For example, in neutrophils A2AR deficiency caused Nox2 activation, and increased O2̇̄ production exacerbated inflammatory responses and caused oxidative damage to tissues (13Ernens I. Rouy D. Velot E. Devaux Y. Wagner D.R. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the lung, knock-out of A2AR increased tracheal ROS production from Nox2, which compromised tracheal relaxation in allergic mice (14Nadeem A. Ponnoth D.S. Ansari H.R. Batchelor T.P. Dey R.D. Ledent C. Mustafa S.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 330: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, in the context of neurodegerative diseases, blockade of A2AR appeared to be beneficial in reducing oxidative damage (15Melani A. Gianfriddo M. Vannucchi M.G. Cipriani S. Baraldi P.G. Giovannini M.G. Pedata F. Brain Res. 2006; 1073–1074: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar results were found in the heart where genetic knock-out or pharmacological blockade of the A2AR decreases cardiac ROS production from Nox2 enzyme (16Ribé D. Sawbridge D. Thakur S. Hussey M. Ledent C. Kitchen I. Hourani S. Li J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Many patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases have endothelial dysfunction characterized by excessive ROS production from Nox2 enzyme (17Park L. Anrather J. Zhou P. Frys K. Pitstick R. Younkin S. Carlson G.A. Iadecola C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and it is possible that A2AR blockade might be beneficial in these endothelial dysfunction-related neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. This hypothesis has been supported by a recent study showing that knock-out of A2AR protects ApoE knock-out mice from atherosclerosis (18Wang H. Zhang W. Zhu C. Bucher C. Blazar B.R. Zhang C. Chen J.F. Linden J. Wu C. Huo Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).AngII has pleiotropic acute and chronic effects on many cell types and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure (19Landmesser U. Cai H. Dikalov S. McCann L. Hwang J. Jo H. Holland S.M. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). AngII is also a potent activator of Nox2, and increased ROS production contributes to AngII-induced EC dysfunction and vessel constriction (19Landmesser U. Cai H. Dikalov S. McCann L. Hwang J. Jo H. Holland S.M. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated in detail the effects of A2AR blockade or knockdown on basal and acute AngII-induced endothelial ROS production by Nox2 and on redox-signaling in cultured ECs and in mouse aortas isolated from wild-type (WT) and A2AR knock-out (KO) mice.DISCUSSIONEndothelial dysfunction characterized by excessive ROS production from Nox2 activation has been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Therapies that inhibit Nox2 activation are urgently required to protect the endothelium from ROS damage. The present study provides the first evidence that inactivation of A2AR through pharmacological blockade or in vitro knockdown or genetic knock-out of A2AR effectively inhibits endothelial ROS production from Nox2 and attenuates AngII-induced oxidative stress, MAPK activation, and endothelial dysfunction.A2AR are highly expressed on ECs (21Sands W.A. Palmer T.M. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 101: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Classically, A2AR activation in ECs was believed to mediate endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation, and genetic A2AR deficiency has been shown to result in loss of endothelium-mediated relaxation (3Tabrizchi R. Bedi S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Ponnoth D.S. Sanjani M.S. Ledent C. Roush K. Krahn T. Mustafa S.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H1655-H1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, A2AR inactivation has been shown to protect ApoE knock-out mice from atherosclerosis, which may provide the potential for treating atherosclerosis (18Wang H. Zhang W. Zhu C. Bucher C. Blazar B.R. Zhang C. Chen J.F. Linden J. Wu C. Huo Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the role of endothelial A2AR and the involvement of Nox2-derived ROS production were not examined in that particular study, a study from another group by cross-breeding p47phox knock-out mice and ApoE knock-out mice demonstrated a similar result of reduced atherosclerosis and clearly pointed out a crucial role of Nox2-derived ROS in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (22Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der Merwe M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T.H. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Our study extends and supports this suggestion and provides a novel possible mechanism for this effect. In the current study we carried out a detailed investigation on the effects of A2AR blockade on ROS production by ECs. We found that treatment of cells with a specific A2AR antagonist, SCH58261, significantly inhibited ROS production from Nox2 and thereafter abolished acute AngII-induced MAPK and Akt activation. We have also shown that A2AR blockade inhibited AngII-induced p47phox phosphorylation and complex formation with Nox2, which are prerequisites for AngII-induced Nox2 activation and ROS production (12Li J.M. Wheatcroft S. Fan L.M. Kearney M.T. Shah A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The removal of adenosine by adenosine deaminase also reduced ROS production, which added further evidence for the requirement of A2AR signaling for ROS production. The lack of effect of the selective A2AR agonist CGS21680 may be because (i) enough adenosine is already present in the culture medium to activate the A2AR at its maximum level, and this is supported by the experiment using adenosine deaminase such that eliminating adenosine mimics the effect of SCH58261 or (ii) an increase in A2AR activity alone cannot promote further ROS production under culture conditions.The inhibitory effects of A2AR blockade on Nox2 activity were further confirmed by showing that transient knockdown of A2AR using siRNA reduced significantly the ROS production and the protein expression of Nox2 and p47phox, but not Nox4. Moreover, knockdown of Nox2 using siRNA completely abolished AngII-induced ROS production by EC. Similar results were obtained in vessel sections where SCH58261 inhibited AngII-induced ROS production as detected by DHE fluorescence, and preincubation of vessels with SCH58261 attenuated AngII effects on impairing vessel relaxation and preserved endothelial function. In line with these studies, we found also that genetic knock-out of A2AR inhibited ROS production in the aortas and preserved endothelial function.AngII is the dominant effector of the renin-angiotensin system and is implicated in the pathogenesis of disorders such as hypertension, where one of the major mechanisms of its effects is through oxidative damage to the endothelium due to Nox2 activation (12Li J.M. Wheatcroft S. Fan L.M. Kearney M.T. Shah A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present study is the first report to demonstrate the potential of an A2AR antagonist to attenuate acute AngII-induced Nox2 activation. Thus, in cultured EC or in aortic vessels pretreated with SCH58261, AngII-induced ROS production and MAPK and Akt activation were abrogated in particular in the endothelium, and SCH58261 or knock-out of A2AR preserved endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation to acetylcholine. Although vascular smooth muscle cells are the predominant cellular component in the vessel wall, Nox2 expression is very low or undetectable in vascular smooth muscle cells.Both the MAPK family and Akt are the downstream signaling pathways of A2AR, via Gs/cAMP-dependent (1Fredholm B.B. Ijzerman A.P. Jacobson K.A. Klotz K.N. Linden J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 527-552PubMed Google Scholar) or -independent pathways (23Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and ERK1/2 and p38MAPK have been found to phosphorylate p47phox. Therefore, the potential mechanistic link from A2AR blockade to the reduction of both basal and AngII-induced Nox2 activation is that the A2AR blockade inhibited MAPK activation and thereafter reduced the levels of p47phox phosphorylation and binding to Nox2. Long term A2AR inactivation (in the case of A2AR knockdown) results in reduced Nox2 expression. Our data clearly demonstrated that A2AR signaling is necessary to promote AngII-induced MAPK and p47phox phosphorylation. Another interesting observation from the current study is that AngII induced Nox2 plasma membrane translocation and association with A2AR, and this was confirmed by the two-way co-immunoprecipitation of Nox2 or A2AR. A2AR has been found to bind to several signaling molecules, including ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (24Zezula J. Freissmuth M. Br. J. Pharmacology. 2008; 153: S184-S190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The significance of AngII-induced Nox2 association with A2AR requires further investigation.In summary, we have reported for the first time that blockade of A2AR with an antagonist, SCH58261, removal of adenosine by adenosine deaminase, knockdown of A2AR using siRNA, or genetical knock-out of A2AR effectively inhibited basal and acute AngII-induced ROS production by Nox2 in ECs. This in turn significantly protected endothelium function from AngII-induced oxidative damage. Antagonists to A2AR may therefore have therapeutic potential to inhibit Nox2 activation and to treat diseases related to endothelial oxidative stress.

Ijzerman A.P. Jacobson K.A. Klotz K.N. Linden J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 527-552PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Among these adenosine receptors, A2AR has been found to be extensively expressed in vascular ECs and had been widely reported to play a major role in mediating adenosine-induced endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation (3Tabrizchi R. Bedi S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Knock-out of A2AR reduced aortic relaxation and endothelial function in mice (4Ponnoth D.S. Sanjani M.S. Ledent C. Roush K. Krahn T. Mustafa S.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H1655-H1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this notion has been challenged by studies showing that A2AR was not involved in the relaxation of the isolated mouse aorta to adenosine and its analogues (5Prentice D. Boon K. Hourani S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 415: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was not involved in mediating adenosine-induced Ca2+ influx in ECs, which is crucial for endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation (6Cheng K.T. Leung Y.K. Shen B. Kwok Y.C. Wong C.O. Kwan H.Y. Man Y.B. Ma X. Huang Y. Yao X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).ECs also express constitutively an NADPH oxidase (Nox), which, by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as second messengers, contributes to the regulation of EC function (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The Nox enzyme comprises a cytochrome b, which can be further divided into one catalytic subunit (a member of the Nox family) and one p22phox. To date, five members of the Nox family have been identified (Nox1–5) (8Bengtsson S.H. Gulluyan L.M. Dusting G.J. Drummond G.R. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and Nox2 and Nox4 are the major Nox isoforms expressed in ECs and represent important enzymatic sources of EC ROS production (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 9Fan L.M. Teng L. Li J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Li J.M. Fan L.M. George V.T. Brooks G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nox2 is a highly glycosylated protein and requires the presence of regulatory subunits, i.e. p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and rac1, for its activation (11Sumimoto H. Miyano K. Takeya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In response to pathophysiological stimulations such as shear stress, angiotensin II (AngII), or inflammatory cytokines (TNFα), the activity of Nox2 (but not Nox4) is up-regulated, and excessive ROS production from Nox2 outstrips endogenous antioxidant defense and causes EC dysfunction (7Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 12Li J.M. Wheatcroft S. Fan L.M. Kearney M.T. Shah A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Several studies have reported a role of A2AR in the regulation of ROS production by Nox2 enzyme, although the outcomes differed from one organ to another. For example, in neutrophils A2AR deficiency caused Nox2 activation, and increased O2̇̄ production exacerbated inflammatory responses and caused oxidative damage to tissues (13Ernens I. Rouy D. Velot E. Devaux Y. Wagner D.R. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the lung, knock-out of A2AR increased tracheal ROS production from Nox2, which compromised tracheal relaxation in allergic mice (14Nadeem A. Ponnoth D.S. Ansari H.R. Batchelor T.P. Dey R.D. Ledent C. Mustafa S.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 330: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, in the context of neurodegerative diseases, blockade of A2AR appeared to be beneficial in reducing oxidative damage (15Melani A. Gianfriddo M. Vannucchi M.G. Cipriani S. Baraldi P.G. Giovannini M.G. Pedata F. Brain Res. 2006; 1073–1074: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar results were found in the heart where genetic knock-out or pharmacological blockade of the A2AR decreases cardiac ROS production from Nox2 enzyme (16Ribé D. Sawbridge D. Thakur S. Hussey M. Ledent C. Kitchen I. Hourani S. Li J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Many patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases have endothelial dysfunction characterized by excessive ROS production from Nox2 enzyme (17Park L. Anrather J. Zhou P. Frys K. Pitstick R. Younkin S. Carlson G.A. Iadecola C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and it is possible that A2AR blockade might be beneficial in these endothelial dysfunction-related neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. This hypothesis has been supported by a recent study showing that knock-out of A2AR protects ApoE knock-out mice from atherosclerosis (18Wang H. Zhang W. Zhu C. Bucher C. Blazar B.R. Zhang C. Chen J.F. Linden J. Wu C. Huo Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).AngII has pleiotropic acute and chronic effects on many cell types and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure (19Landmesser U. Cai H. Dikalov S. McCann L. Hwang J. Jo H. Holland S.M. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). AngII is also a potent activator of Nox2, and increased ROS production contributes to AngII-induced EC dysfunction and vessel constriction (19Landmesser U. Cai H. Dikalov S. McCann L. Hwang J. Jo H. Holland S.M. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated in detail the effects of A2AR blockade or knockdown on basal and acute AngII-induced endothelial ROS production by Nox2 and on redox-signaling in cultured ECs and in mouse aortas isolated from wild-type (WT) and A2AR knock-out (KO) mice."

We investigated the role of the chemokine receptor CCR5 in seizures. We used a rat model based on intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) administration. Four months before KA injection, adult rats were given femoral intramarrow inoculations of SV (RNAiR5-RevM10.AU1), which carries an interfering RNA (RNAi) against CCR5, plus a marker epitope (AU1), or its monofunctional RNAi-carrying homologue, SV(RNAiR5). This treatment lowered expression of CCR5 in circulating cells. In control rats, seizures induced elevated expression of CCR5 ligands MIP-1α and RANTES in the microvasculature, increased BBB leakage and CCR5+ cells, as well as neuronal loss, inflammation, and gliosis in the hippocampi. Animals given either the bifunctional or the monofunctional vector were largely protected from KA-induced seizures, neuroinflammation, BBB damage, and neuron loss. Brain CCR5 mRNA was reduced. Rats receiving RNAiR5-bearing vectors showed far greater repair responses: increased neuronal proliferation, and decreased production of MIP-1α and RANTES. Controls received unrelated SV(BUGT) vectors. Decrease in CCR5 in circulating cells strongly protected from excitotoxin-induced seizures, BBB leakage, CNS injury, and inflammation, and facilitated neurogenic repair.—Louboutin, J.-P., Chekmasova, A., Ma-rusich, E., Agrawal, L., Strayer, D.

https://openalex.org/W1985470849,"Terminal differentiation of mammalian erythroid progenitors involves 4-5 cell divisions and induction of many erythroid important genes followed by chromatin and nuclear condensation and enucleation. The protein levels of c-Myc (Myc) are reduced dramatically during late stage erythroid maturation, coinciding with cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase and enucleation, suggesting possible roles for c-Myc in either or both of these processes. Here we demonstrate that ectopic Myc expression affects terminal erythroid maturation in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of Myc at physiological levels did not affect erythroid differentiation or cell cycle shutdown but specifically blocked erythroid nuclear condensation and enucleation. Continued Myc expression prevented deacetylation of several lysine residues in histones H3 and H4 that are normally deacetylated during erythroid maturation. The histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 was up-regulated by Myc, and ectopic Gcn5 expression partially blocked enucleation and inhibited the late stage erythroid nuclear condensation and histone deacetylation. When overexpressed at levels higher than the physiological range, Myc blocked erythroid differentiation, and the cells continued to proliferate in cytokine-free, serum-containing culture medium with an early erythroblast morphology. Gene expression analysis demonstrated the dysregulation of erythropoietin signaling pathway and the up-regulation of several positive regulators of G(1)-S cell cycle checkpoint by supraphysiological levels of Myc. These results reveal an important dose-dependent function of Myc in regulating terminal maturation in mammalian erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035978552,"Epsilon toxin (ET) produced by C. perfringens types B and D is a highly potent pore-forming toxin. ET-intoxicated animals express severe neurological disorders that are thought to result from the formation of vasogenic brain edemas and indirect neuronal excitotoxicity. The cerebellum is a predilection site for ET damage. ET has been proposed to bind to glial cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the possibility that ET binds and attacks the neurons remains an open question. Using specific anti-ET mouse polyclonal antibodies and mouse brain slices preincubated with ET, we found that several brain structures were labeled, the cerebellum being a prominent one. In cerebellar slices, we analyzed the co-staining of ET with specific cell markers, and found that ET binds to the cell body of granule cells, oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes or nerve endings. Identification of granule cells as neuronal ET targets was confirmed by the observation that ET induced intracellular Ca(2+) rises and glutamate release in primary cultures of granule cells. In cultured cerebellar slices, whole cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic currents in Purkinje cells revealed that ET greatly stimulates both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory activities. However, pharmacological dissection of these effects indicated that they were only a result of an increased granule cell firing activity and did not involve a direct action of the toxin on glutamatergic nerve terminals or inhibitory interneurons. Patch-clamp recordings of granule cell somata showed that ET causes a decrease in neuronal membrane resistance associated with pore-opening and depolarization of the neuronal membrane, which subsequently lead to the firing of the neuronal network and stimulation of glutamate release. This work demonstrates that a subset of neurons can be directly targeted by ET, suggesting that part of ET-induced neuronal damage observed in neuronal tissue is due to a direct effect of ET on neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2064308123,"The PhoP-PhoQ two-component system is commonly used by bacteria to sense environmental factors. Here we show that the PhoP-PhoQ system of Edwardsiella tarda detects changes in environmental temperature and Mg(2+) concentration as well as regulates the type III and VI secretion systems through direct activation of esrB. Protein secretion is activated from 23 to 35 °C or at low Mg(2+) concentrations, but it is suppressed at or below 20 °C, at or above 37 °C, or at high Mg(2+) concentrations. The effects of temperature and Mg(2+) concentration are additive. The PhoQ sensor domain has a low T(m) of 37.9 °C, and it detects temperatures through a conformational change of its secondary structure. Mutation of specific Pro or Thr residues increased the stability of the PhoQ sensor drastically, altering its temperature-sensing ability. The PhoQ sensor detects Mg(2+) concentration through the direct binding of Mg(2+) to a cluster of acidic residues (DDDSAD) and through changes that likely affect its tertiary structure. Here, we describe for the first time the use of PhoP-PhoQ as a temperature sensor for bacterial virulence control."
https://openalex.org/W2040137994,"P335 lactococcal phages infect the gram(+) bacterium Lactococcus lactis using a large multiprotein complex located at the distal part of the tail and termed baseplate (BP). The BP harbors the receptor-binding proteins (RBPs), which allow the specific recognition of saccharidic receptors localized on the host cell surface. We report here the electron microscopic structure of the phage TP901-1 wild-type BP as well as those of two mutants bppL (-) and bppU(-), lacking BppL (the RBPs) or both peripheral BP components (BppL and BppU), respectively. We also achieved an electron microscopic reconstruction of a partial BP complex, formed by BppU and BppL. This complex exhibits a tripod shape and is composed of nine BppLs and three BppUs. These structures, combined with light-scattering measurements, led us to propose that the TP901-1 BP harbors six tripods at its periphery, located around the central tube formed by ORF46 (Dit) hexamers, at its proximal end, and a ORF47 (Tal) trimer at its distal extremity. A total of 54 BppLs (18 RBPs) are thus available to mediate host anchoring with a large apparent avidity. TP901-1 BP exhibits an infection-ready conformation and differs strikingly from the lactococcal phage p2 BP, bearing only 6 RBPs, and which needs a conformational change to reach its activated state. The comparison of several Siphoviridae structures uncovers a close organization of their central BP core whereas striking differences occur at the periphery, leading to diverse mechanisms of host recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2007914815,"By studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we have shown that PLK3 null MEFs contain a reduced level of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and increased Akt1 activation coupled with decreased GSK3β activation under normoxia and hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, but not a kinase-defective mutant, efficiently phosphorylates PTEN in vitro. Mass spectrometry identifies threonine 366 and serine 370 as two putative residues that are phosphorylated by Plk3. Immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody confirms these sites as Plk3 phosphorylation sites. Moreover, treatment of MEFs with LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β and CK2, only partially suppresses the phosphorylation, suggesting Plk3 as an additional kinase that phosphorylates these sites in vivo. Plk3-targeting mutants of PTEN are expressed at a reduced level in comparison with the wild-type counterpart, which is associated with an enhanced activity of PDK1, an upstream activator of Akt1. Furthermore, the reduced level of PTEN in PLK3 null MEFs is stabilized by treatment with MG132, a proteosome inhibitor. Combined, our study identifies Plk3 as a new player in the regulation of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis by phosphorylation and stabilization of PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2024362510,"The ability to sense time and anticipate events is a critical skill in nature. Most efforts to understand the neural and molecular mechanisms of anticipatory behavior in rodents rely on daily restricted food access, which induces a robust increase of locomotor activity in anticipation of daily meal time. Interestingly, rats also show increased activity in anticipation of a daily palatable meal even when they have an ample food supply, suggesting a role for brain reward systems in anticipatory behavior, and providing an alternate model by which to study the neurobiology of anticipation in species, such as mice, that are less well adapted to “stuff and starve” feeding schedules. To extend this model to mice, and exploit molecular genetic resources available for that species, we tested the ability of wild-type mice to anticipate a daily palatable meal. We observed that mice with free access to regular chow and limited access to highly palatable snacks of chocolate or “Fruit Crunchies” avidly consumed the snack but did not show anticipatory locomotor activity as measured by running wheels or video-based behavioral analysis. However, male mice receiving a snack of high fat chow did show increased food bin entry prior to access time and a modest increase in activity in the two hours preceding the scheduled meal. Interestingly, female mice did not show anticipation of a daily high fat meal but did show increased activity at scheduled mealtime when that meal was withdrawn. These results indicate that anticipation of a scheduled food reward in mice is behavior, diet, and gender specific."

Lack of functional matriptase-2, both in humans and in mice, causes inappropriately high hepatic hepcidin expression, which results in iron-deficiency anemia (18Folgueras A.R. de Lara F.M.

Matriptase-2 is therefore an important suppressor of hepcidin expression. Recent studies in transfected HeLa cells indicate that matriptase-2 binds and decreases cell surface HJV by cleaving it into a ladder of smaller products (20Silvestri L. Pagani A. Nai A. De Domenico I. Kaplan J. Camaschella C. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because HJV and matriptase-2 are both expressed in liver, matriptase-2 has been proposed to regulate iron homeostasis by modulating the levels of cell surface HJV. In this study we show that proprotein convertases and matriptase-2 cleave HJV in a site-specific manner and each protease generates one major cleavage product whose sizes are distinct from each other. In contrast to proprotein convertase cleavage, the sHJV product generated by matriptase-2 cleavage has reduced binding to BMP6 and does not alter BMP6-induced hepcidin expression. These data indicate that the major role of matriptase-2 is to inactivate HJV by down-regulating cell surface HJV, thereby decreasing hepcidin expression. Previously described pcDNA3-HJV (21Zhang A.S.

The generation of the matriptase-2 expression construct is described in the supplemental Methods. Both HepG2 and HEK293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Stably transfected cells were maintained by the addition of 800 μg/ml G418. FuGENE 6 HD (Roche Applied Science) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used to transfect HepG2 and HEK293 cells, respectively. Cells were treated with leupeptin (Sigma) and the furin convertase inhibitor (FCI), decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Alexis, San Diego, CA). The stock solution of leupeptin (10 mm) was solubilized in water. FCI (5 mm) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentrations of the inhibitors are denoted in the figure legends. sHJV/PC and sHJV/M2 were filter-concentrated from the serum-free conditioned medium, collected from HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged HJV (HEK293-fHJV), and HEK293-fHJV cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-TMPRSS6, respectively. sHJV concentrations were estimated by Western blotting using baculovirus-generated sHJV as a standard. BMP6 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). sHJV·BMP6 binding assays were performed as described previously (10Andriopoulos Jr., B. Corradini E. Xia Y. Faasse S.A. Chen S. Grgurevic L.

Immunoblot analyses on cell lysates, conditioned medium, and binding eluate were performed as described previously (22Maxson J.E. Enns C.A. Zhang A.S.

Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce supersignal; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The generation of the rabbit anti-matriptase-2 antibody is described in supplemental Methods. SMARTpool siRNA specific for human TMPRSS6 (Dharmacon) was used to knock down the matriptase-2 in HepG2 cells that stably express exogenous TMPRSS6, as described previously (13Zhang A.S.

RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) was used for the transfection. The negative control siRNA was described previously (13Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using the primers listed in the supplemental Methods. HepG2 cells were plated on number 1.5 glass cover slips (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and transfected with the indicated HJV plasmids using FuGENE 6 HD (Roche Applied Science). Cells were stained using rabbit anti-HJV (1.73 μg/ml), and mouse anti-KDEL 10C3 (5 μg/ml; Stressgen, Victoria, BC), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes), and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged using an 63 × oil objective on a LSM 710 microscope (Carl Zeiss). HEK293 cells stably expressing WT, R257A, or R288A HJV were grown in 100-mm dishes (a 100-mm dish is sufficient for six samples). Cells were detached by incubating in cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). For surface HJV detection, cells were incubated in affinity-purified rabbit anti-HJV 18745 antibody (4 μg/ml) in FACS-specific buffer (Hanks' without calcium or magnesium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% FBS) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (3.3 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 °C. For detection of total HJV, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated as described for nonpermeabilized cells. Three samples were analyzed for cell surface and total HJV expression along with no antibody and nonspecific IgG controls for each cell line. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) at the Oregon Stem Cell Center Flow Cytometry Core, Oregon Health and Science University. Recent studies showed that membrane HJV can be cleaved by both the furin family of proprotein convertase and matriptase-2 and that the cleaved forms are shed from cells (17Silvestri L. Pagani A. Camaschella C. Blood. 2008; 111: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Silvestri L. Pagani A. Nai A. De Domenico I. Kaplan J. Camaschella C.

Dis. 2008; 40: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to characterize the differences between matriptase-2 and proprotein convertase cleavage of HJV. The size of sHJV generated by matriptase-2 cleavage was compared with that produced by proprotein convertase cleavage. HEK293 cells stably expressing HJV (HEK293-HJV) were transiently transfected with either empty vector or a plasmid containing matriptase-2 cDNA (pcDNA3-TMPRSS6). Similar to a previous report (25Lin L. Nemeth E. Goodnough J.B. Thapa D.R. Gabayan V. Ganz T. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2008; 40: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the sHJV that was shed by the empty vector-transfected HEK293-HJV cells migrated at ∼40 kDa in SDS-PAGE, and its secretion was blocked in the presence of decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone, a FCI that inhibits proprotein convertases (Fig. 1). The inhibition of the 40-kDa sHJV by FCI suggests that it is the product of proprotein convertase cleavage. In matriptase-2-transfected HEK293-HJV cells (HEK293-HJV/M2), however, we detected the major form of sHJV in the conditioned medium migrating at ∼36 kDa (Fig. 1). The secretion of the 36-kDa sHJV was not inhibited by FCI, but it was blocked by leupeptin, a serine-cysteine protease inhibitor (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with generation of this cleavage product by matriptase-2, a serine protease (26Velasco G. Cal S. Quesada V. Sánchez L.M. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37637-37646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Notably, a faint band of lower molecular mass than the major matriptase-2 cleavage product was detected, which could be the result of heterogeneous cleavage. It is not the result of heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation of HJV (22Maxson J.E. Enns C.A. Zhang A.S. Blood. 2009; 113: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the blockage of matriptase-2-cleaved sHJV by leupeptin was correlated with the appearance of the proprotein convertase-cleaved sHJV in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1). These results suggest both that the cleavage site for matriptase-2 is different from the cleavage site for proprotein convertases and that in the presence of excess matriptase-2, cleavage by a proprotein convertase is overridden by the processing by matriptase-2. We wanted to test whether the cleavage products identified in the medium of HepG2 cells are produced by proprotein convertases and matriptase-2. HepG2 cells were used because they are human hepatoma cell line and the liver is the major site of matriptase-2 expression in the body. Two different species of sHJV were previously detected in the conditioned medium from HepG2 cells that stably express HJV (HepG2-HJV) (13Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furin is a proprotein convertase that has been implicated in HJV cleavage and is ubiquitously expressed in tissues, including the liver (27Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). We first examined the relative abundance of matriptase-2 mRNA versus furin mRNA in HepG2 cells and compared it with that in HEK293 cells, rat liver, rat muscle, rat hepatocytes, and human liver. The level of matriptase-2 mRNA was slightly higher than that of furin in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). Their ratio was similar to those detected in rat liver, rat hepatocytes, and human livers, but was much higher than in HEK293 cells and rat muscle. These results indicate that HepG2 cells endogenously express both furin and matriptase-2 and that HEK393 cells do not express appreciable amounts of matriptase-2 mRNA. The protease inhibitors, FCI and leupeptin, were also used to distinguish between the two protease activities. FCI blocked the release of the larger sHJV form, migrating at 40 kDa, whereas leupeptin blocked the 36-kDa form of sHJV (Fig. 2B). Cell surface biotinylation studies indicated that the cleavage of HJV was blocked by leupeptin after HJV had trafficked to the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 1). In the presence of both FCI and leupeptin, both forms of sHJV were no longer detectable in the medium, suggesting the lack of involvement of other classes of proteases. To verify further that the smaller form of sHJV is indeed derived from matriptase-2 cleavage, we generated a HepG2 cell line that was stably transfected with matriptase-2 to increase the processing of HJV (HepG2-M2) (Fig. 2C). Transient introduction of HJV into HepG2-M2 cells increased the relative amount of the 36 kDa band and decreased the 40 kDa band. Formation of the 36 kDa band was blocked by leupeptin, but not FCI (Fig. 2C; lower panel). Knockdown of matiptase-2 by siRNA also reduces the lower molecular mass cleavage product (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, when HJV is expressed, more matriptase-2 protein is detected; however, the underlying mechanism is not known (Fig. 2C). Together, these results support that endogenously and exogenously expressed matriptase-2 in HepG2 cells is able to cleave HJV that is released from cells and migrates as a 36 kDa band. Treatment of cells with FCI blocks shedding of the 40 kDa (upper band) of HJV from HepG2 cells (Fig. 2) and the single, 40 kDa band of HJV from HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). To confirm that the 40 kDa band is generated by cleavage at the canonical proprotein convertase cleavage site cluster, mutations were made in the critical Arg residues in this motif (Fig. 3A). The proprotein convertase cleavage cluster in HJV has three overlapping RXXR motifs. Mutation of Arg329 should disrupt the first two motifs whereas mutation of Arg332 should disrupt the second two motifs. The cleavage and secretion of these HJVs were assessed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Although all of the HJVs are detected in the cell lysates, there is reduced secretion of R329A HJV and no detectable secretion of R332A HJV. When these constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells, the R329A mutation reduced shedding of the 40-kDa form into the medium (Fig. 3C). The R332A mutation also selectively and substantially reduces shedding. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the second and third sites are both cleaved by proprotein convertases (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, the single endogenous HJV cleavage product in HEK293 cells is produced by cleavage in the canonical proprotein convertases cleavage site cluster. Immunofluorescence microscopy was employed to determine whether the R332A mutation in HJV blocks proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage of HJV by causing misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the protein (Fig. 3D). WT, R329A, and R332A HJV constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, which were subsequently detected with anti-HJV and anti-KDEL antibodies. The anti-KDEL antibody recognizes proteins with the KDEL ER-retrieval sequence and serves as a marker for the ER. Like WT HJV, the R329A and R332A HJVs have a punctate appearance (red) in contrast with the lacy morphology of the ER (green). Immunofluorescent microscopy indicates both cell surface and intracellular staining of all of these forms of HJV. In addition, little co-localization of HJV with the ER is detected. Therefore, the reduction in cleavage of R329A HJV and the block in cleavage of R332A HJV are not caused by the inability of these forms of HJV to fold and traffic past the ER. Previous studies indicated that matriptase-2 cleaves its substrates at the carboxyl side of Arg residues (26Velasco G. Cal S. Quesada V. Sánchez L.M. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37637-37646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that sHJV generated by matriptase-2 cleavage is smaller than that cleaved by proprotein convertases, we reasoned that the major cleavage site by matriptase-2 lies N-terminal to the proprotein convertase cleavage site. From the molecular mass of the cleaved product and the preference of matriptase-2 to cleave after Arg, we predicted that Arg257 or Arg288 could be the sites of matriptase-2 cleavage. HEK293 cells stably expressing HJV, R257A HJV (R257A), or R288A HJV (R288A) were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3 TMPRSS6 or control (C), pcDNA3 empty vector, to determine which mutation blocks matriptase-2 cleavage. When matriptase-2 (M2) was introduced into HEK293-R257A and R288A HJV cells, however, the 36-kDa form of the sHJV was only detected in R257A HJV, but not in R288A HJV (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, leupeptin did not block the secretion of R288A HJV. As expected, introduction of matriptase-2 into HEK293-HJV cells shifted the molecular mass of sHJV from 40 to 36 kDa (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Arg288 of HJV is likely the matriptase-2 cleavage site. Similar results were obtained when R288A HJV was introduced into HepG2-M2 cells (supplemental Fig. 3). Efforts to verify the cleavage site by mass spectrometry were unsuccessful (supplemental Fig. 2). Although we obtained 83% coverage of the peptides of sHJV isolated from the medium, peptides in the region of matriptase-2 cleavage were not detected by mass spectrometry using arginase-, aspartyl-, or trypsin-generated fragments (supplemental Fig. 2). The lack of coverage of this area could possibly be due to posttranslational modification, heterogeneous matriptase-2 cleavage, or exoprotease digestion, which precludes confirmation of the matriptase-2 cleavage sites by mass spectrometry. Notably, a faint second band lower than the major matriptase-2 cleavage product can be detected. It could be the result of heterogeneous cleavage by matriptase-2. Matriptase-2 is expressed at the cell surface (26Velasco G. Cal S. Quesada V. Sánchez L.M. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37637-37646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Misfolding of the R288A HJV and lack of trafficking to the cell surface could be a possible explanation for the lack of cleavage by matriptase-2. To test this possibility, flow cytometry was performed to determine the ratio of cell surface to total HJV in HEK293 cells that stably express WT, R257A, or R288A HJV. All three forms of HJV were detected on the cell surface (Fig. 4B). The average amount of HJV on the cell surface relative to total HJV was 49% for WT HJV, 48% for R257A HJV, and 38% for R288A HJV. The differences between the different forms of HJV are not statistically significant by ANOVA. These results show that the R288A HJV reaches the cell surface. Therefore, the lack of R288A HJV cleavage by matriptase-2 does not result from sequestration of this mutated protein in the ER. To confirm that Arg288 is the site of HJV cleavage by matriptase-2, we created truncations that could be compared with the size of shed HJV generated by matriptase-2 cleavage. These truncated forms of HJV were created by placing stop codons (X) after the candidate Arg residues at positions 258 and 289. When these truncated forms of HJV were expressed in HEK293 cells, they were detected in the cell lysate but did not appear to be secreted (Fig. 5A). In contrast, HJV truncated at the proprotein convertase cleavage motif cluster was secreted (supplemental Fig. 4). The glycosylation differences of the P258X HJV in the lysate and the shed HJV produced by matriptase-2 cleavage in the medium precluded comparison of the sizes of these two forms of HJV. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to compare the subcellular localization of the P258X and Q289X HJV to the anti-KDEL ER marker. Both forms of HJV extensively co-localized with the ER (Fig. 5B). Additionally, in contrast to WT HJV, very little punctate staining was evident. These results indicate that P258X and Q289X HJVs are not shed because they are retained in the ER, possibly due to misfolding. Furthermore, these data suggest that the region between the Arg288 and the proprotein convertase cleavage cluster is important for folding and secretion of HJV. Together, these results demonstrate that endogenous matriptase-2 cleaves HJV in a site-specific manner, which would result in a reduction in membrane HJV available for BMP signaling. sHJV generated by proprotein convertase cleavage (sHJV/PC) binds to BMP6 and inhibits BMP6-induced hepcidin expression (10Andriopoulos Jr., B. Corradini E. Xia Y. Faasse S.A. Chen S. Grgurevic L. Knutson M.D. Pietrangelo A. Vukicevic S. Lin H.Y. Babitt J.L. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To determine the potential role of sHJV generated by matriptase-2 cleavage (sHJV/M2) in the regulation of hepcidin expression, we tested its ability to bind BMP6. Concentrated sHJV/M2 with a FLAG tag at the N terminus was incubated with BMP6, followed by pulldown of HJV. sHJV/PC with a FLAG tag at the N terminus was included as a positive control. The anti-FLAG beads pulled down both sHJV/PC and BMP6 in the positive control. In contrast, less BMP6 was pulled down with sHJV/M2 (Fig. 6A). These observations indicate that sHJV/M2 has reduced binding to BMP6. We also compared the effects of concentrated sHJV/M2 and sHJV/PC (Fig. 6B) on BMP6-induced hepcidin expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6C). In agreement with the results of BMP6 binding assay, sHJV/PC, but not sHJV/M2, suppressed the induction of hepcidin expression by BMP6 (Fig. 6C). Although matriptase-2 has been shown previously to reduce hepcidin expression by decreasing the amount of cell surface HJV available for signaling (20Silvestri L. Pagani A. Nai A. De Domenico I. Kaplan J. Camaschella C. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), these results suggest that sHJV/M2 lacks the additional ability to reduce BMP signaling by competing with membrane-bound HJV for binding to BMPs. In the present study we show that matriptase-2 cleaves glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked HJV in a site-specific manner and generates one major HJV cleavage product. Site-directed mutagenesis of HJV Arg288 to Ala abolished cleavage by matriptase-2, indicating Arg288 as the likely cleavage site. These results are in contrast to a previous study by Silvestri et al. showing that expression of matriptase-2 produces a ladder of cleaved HJV products in the conditioned medium (20Silvestri L. Pagani A. Nai A. De Domenico I. Kaplan J. Camaschella C. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might be due to the different cell types used or to the levels of matriptase-2 expressed. We also show that expression of HJV increases the levels of matriptase-2. Matriptase-2 binds HJV (20Silvestri L. Pagani A. Nai A. De Domenico I. Kaplan J. Camaschella C. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Formation of a complex between HJV and matriptase-2 could stabilize matriptase-2 and reduce its degradation. The physiological implications of this observation are not known and need to be examined. The proprotein convertase cleavage site in HJV does not overlap with that of matriptase-2. In addition to the different sizes of the two cleaved products, we found that the R332A mutation in HJV blocks proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage but not matriptase-2 cleavage. HJV has an overlapping cluster of three RXXR motifs, all of which are consensus sequences for proprotein convertase cleavage (27Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The R329A mutation in HJV, which is predicted to disrupt the first and second cleavage motifs, reduces proprotein convertase-mediated HJV cleavage, but does not abolish it, indicating that the third site is likely utilized to some extent. This also indicates that at least one of the first two sites is utilized. The R332A HJV mutation, which is expected to abolish cleavage at the second and third site, diminishes proprotein convertase-mediated secretion. Therefore, the second and third sites are both capable of being cleaved by proprotein convertases. The third site was shown previously to contribute to proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage of HJV by mutational analysis (17Silvestri L. Pagani A. Camaschella C. Blood. 2008; 111: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and by N-terminal protein sequencing of the proprotein convertase products of a HJV-alkaline phosphatase fusion construct (25Lin L. Nemeth E. Goodnough J.B. Thapa D.R. Gabayan V. Ganz T. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2008; 40: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data extend our understanding of the ability of proprotein convertases to cleave HJV at multiple consensus motifs. Notably, the matriptase-2 HJV cleavage product decreases when proprotein convertase cleavage is inhibited by FCI or mutation of the R332A cleavage site. The degree to which blocking proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage of HJV reduces matriptase-2 cleavage is somewhat variable from experiment to experiment. Several possibilities could explain this effect. Proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage could promote subsequent matriptase-2 cleavage. Alternately, matriptase-2 cleavage could occur with or without prior proprotein convertase cleavage. In the absence of cleavage by proprotein convertases, matriptase-2 cleavage may occur at multiple sites and results in smaller cleavage products that are not detected by immunoblot analysis. Further experiments are needed to examine the order of HJV cleavage by both proprotein convertases and matriptase-2 with respect to HJV trafficking and regulation by iron. The liver is the major organ that expresses both HJV and matriptase-2, and we found that HepG2 cells endogenously express matriptase-2 mRNA. Importantly, the ratio of matriptase-2 mRNA to that of one proprotein convertase, furin, in HepG2 cells is similar to the ratios in the liver, and in isolated primary hepatocytes. HepG2 cells are therefore a good model cell line to study the cleavage of HJV by matriptase-2. Previous studies detected two major soluble HJV products in the conditioned medium of HepG2 cells that express HJV (13Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J.

Expression of the proprotein convertase, furin, is ubiquitously detected in all tissues as well as in HepG2 cells. Other proprotein convertases are also expressed in the liver (29Seidah N.G. Mayer G.

Our experiments do not differentiate among the different possible proprotein convertases that could be involved in HJV processing. The role of sHJV generated by matriptase-2 cleavage in the regulation of BMP6-induced hepcidin expression was analyzed. The sHJV generated by proprotein convertase cleavage binds to BMPs, which may sequester BMPs away from membrane-anchored HJV and BMP receptors to reduce signaling (9Babitt J.L. Huang F.W. Xia Y.

Here, we show that in contrast to the proprotein convertase cleavage product, the smaller matriptase-2-generated sHJV has reduced binding to BMP6 and was unable to antagonize BMP6-induced hepcidin transcript levels in HepG2 cells.

These results, in conjunction with our data, support a model in which matriptase-2 suppresses hepcidin expression by cleaving cellular HJV to produce a form of HJV with reduced affinity for BMPs.

https://openalex.org/W2052031900,"Background Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) inhibits matrix metalloproteinases and membrane-bound sheddases. TIMP-3 is associated with the extracellular matrix and is expressed in highly remodeling tissues. TIMP-3 function in the hematopoietic system is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We now report that TIMP-3 is highly expressed in the endosteal region of the bone marrow (BM), particularly by osteoblasts, endothelial and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells which are all important cellular components of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches, whereas its expression is very low in mature leukocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A possible role of TIMP-3 as an important niche component was further suggested by its down-regulation during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced mobilization. To further investigate TIMP-3 function, mouse HSC were retrovirally transduced with human TIMP-3 and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. TIMP-3 overexpression resulted in decreased frequency of B and T lymphocytes and increased frequency of myeloid cells in blood and BM, increased Lineage-negative Sca-1+KIT+ cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro and increased colony-forming cell trafficking to blood and spleen. Finally, over-expression of human TIMP-3 caused a late onset fatal osteosclerosis. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that TIMP-3 regulates HSC proliferation, differentiation and trafficking in vivo, as well as bone and bone turn-over, and that TIMP-3 is expressed by stromal cells forming HSC niches within the BM. Thus, TIMP-3 may be an important HSC niche component regulating both hematopoiesis and bone remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2046856170,"Voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels are tetramers of six transmembrane domain (S1–S6) proteins. Crystallographic data demonstrate that the tetrameric pore (S5–S6) is surrounded by four voltage sensor domains (S1–S4). One key question remains: how do voltage sensors (S4) regulate pore gating? Previous mutagenesis data obtained on the Kv channel KCNQ1 highlighted the critical role of specific residues in both the S4-S5 linker (S4S5L) and S6 C terminus (S6T). From these data, we hypothesized that S4S5L behaves like a ligand specifically interacting with S6T and stabilizing the closed state. To test this hypothesis, we designed plasmid-encoded peptides corresponding to portions of S4S5L and S6T of the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 and evaluated their effects on the channel activity in the presence and absence of the ancillary subunit KCNE1. We showed that S4S5L peptides inhibit KCNQ1, in a reversible and state-dependent manner. S4S5L peptides also inhibited a voltage-independent KCNQ1 mutant. This inhibition was competitively prevented by a peptide mimicking S6T, consistent with S4S5L binding to S6T. Val254 in S4S5L is known to contact Leu353 in S6T when the channel is closed, and mutations of these residues alter the coupling between the two regions. The same mutations introduced in peptides altered their effects, further confirming S4S5L binding to S6T. Our results suggest a mechanistic model in which S4S5L acts as a voltage-dependent ligand bound to its receptor on S6 at rest. This interaction locks the channel in a closed state.

Voltage-gated ion channels are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues where they play diverse physiological functions such as generation and modulation of the electrical activity in excitable tissues, myocyte contraction, modulation of neurotransmitter and hormone release, and electrolyte transport in epithelia. Crystallization and x-ray diffraction of both a prokaryote and a mammalian voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel provided a lot of information on the structure of Kv channels (1Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Even though these data initiated controversies on the dynamics of the voltage sensor, S4 (4Ahern C.A. Horn R. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 303-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), they provided a new template for investigations on Kv channel molecular characteristics. For example, the structure of the Kv pore domain (S5–S6) turned out to be similar to the pore domain of two-transmembrane domain potassium channels like KcsA (5Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar) and KirBac1.1 (6Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Besides structure, the crystallographic analyses of KvAP and Kv1.2 gave insights on the dynamics of channel voltage dependence. Notably, the crystal structure of Kv1.2 is believed to represent the channel in an open state (3Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), and in this conformation, the S4-S5 linker (S4S5L) 7The abbreviations used are: S4S5LS4-S5 linkerS6TS6 C terminushERGhuman ether-a-go-go-related geneHCNhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. is interacting with the S6 C terminus (S6T). The authors (3Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) used homology modeling to infer a closed state structure from the open state structure. In the closed state, the model shows that S4S5L and S6T are also in contact. Those results pointed to a mechanism by which S4S5L are permanently linked to S6, and this link is critical in translating the voltage sensor movement into gate opening or closure (3Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). S4-S5 linker S6 C terminus human ether-a-go-go-related gene hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. In a few other channels, the S4S5L/S6T interaction seems rather state-dependent. A second-site suppressor yeast screen in the hyperpolarization-activated channel KAT1 suggested that S4S5L and S6T are interacting only in the channel open state (7Grabe M. Lai H.C. Jain M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 2007; 445: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In another hyperpolarization-activated channel, cross-linking of S4S5L and S6T prevented the channel from deactivating (8Prole D.L. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that S4S5L and S6T are interacting only when the channel is open. In hERG too, a cross-linking study suggested a state-dependent S4S5L and S6T interaction but, this time, in the closed state (9Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12858-12864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the cited studies, the state-dependent interaction between S4S5L and S6T suggests that this interaction may stabilize the open state of hyperpolarization-activated channels (KAT1, HCN) and the closed state of depolarization-activated channels (hERG). Scanning mutagenesis studies were performed in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1 (10Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 11Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar) to study the role of S4S5L (see companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)) and S6T (12Boulet I.R. Labro A.J. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in the voltage modulation of this channel. These studies identified residues implicated in the S4S5L/S6T interaction. In particular, the V254A mutation in S4S5L and L353A mutation in S6T led to a similar phenotype, i.e. the appearance of a voltage-independent current component, suggesting that mutation of one of these residues decreases the interaction between S4S5L and S6T in the closed state. Thus, as in hERG, specific interaction between S4S5L and S6T residues may also stabilize KCNQ1 channel closed state. This would suggest that S4S5L acts as a ligand, stabilizing the channel closed state, such as ATP stabilizes the KATP channel closed state (13John S.A. Weiss J.N. Xie L.H. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test whether S4S5L by itself is a ligand and S6T is its receptor, we have designed plasmids coding for the potential ligand (S4S5L, 16 amino acids) and receptor (S6T, 13 amino acids) and tested their effects on KCNQ1 function. Our results suggest that S4S5L stabilizes the channel in a closed conformation by interacting with S6T. Upon depolarization of the plasma membrane, S4 pulls S4S5L away from S6T, allowing channel opening. Complementary DNAs encoding KCNQ1 peptides were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers corresponding to KCNQ1 S4S5L or S6T. The PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO, sequenced, and then cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech). The 5′-end of the forward primers contained a Kozak consensus sequence followed by an initiation codon (ATG) and a glycine (GGA) to protect the ribosome binding site (14Gilchrist A. Li A. Hamm H.E. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the pCB6-L353A hKCNQ1, a Not1-BamH1 fragment containing the mutation was cut out of the pIRES2-EGFP-L353A hKCNQ1 (12Boulet I.R. Labro A.J. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ligated into pCB6-hKCNQ1 to replace the WT sequence. Sequencing of the plasmid confirmed the presence of the mutation and the absence of unwanted mutations. The African green monkey kidney-derived cell line COS-7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1651) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Cells were transfected in 35-mm plates when the culture reached 60–80% confluence, with DNA (2–5 μg total DNA as described below) complexed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemical) according to the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer. In most of our experiments, the peptide effects were studied on a fusion protein of the human KCNE1 linked to the N terminus of the human KCNQ1 (a kind gift of Dr Robert S. Kass, Department of Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY). In the present study, this pCDNA3.1-KCNE1-KCNQ1 construct is named the KCNE1-KCNQ1 concatemer (E1-Q1). GFP allowed the detection of cells expressing the peptide. For experiments with WT E1-Q1 or S140G E1-Q1 (WT KCNE1 fused to S140G KCNQ1), pIRES-GFP plasmids encoding S4S5L, S6T, or pEGFP plasmids for control cells (1.8 μg per plate) were cotransfected with the human pCDNA3.1-KCNE1-KCNQ1 (0.2 μg per plate) concatemer. In pIRES-GFP plasmids, the second cassette (GFP) is less expressed than the first cassette, guaranteeing high levels of peptides expression in fluorescent cells. For experiments with WT or L353A KCNQ1, the pIRES-GFP plasmids (4 μg per plate) were cotransfected with the human pCB6-KCNQ1 (1 μg per plate). In experiments in which two peptides were simultaneously expressed (see Fig. 7), DNA composition was 0.2 μg of pCDNA3.1-S140G E1-Q1, 0.9 μg pIRES-GFP plasmids encoding S4S5L, and 0.9 μg of pIRES-GFP plasmids encoding S6T (or pCB6-CD4 (15Le Maout S. Welling P.A. Brejon M. Olsen O. Merot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10475-10480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for control cells). In hERG experiments, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of pSI hERG (16Bellocq C. Wilders R. Schott J.J. Louérat-Oriou B. Boisseau P. Le Marec H. Escande D. Baró I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and 1.6 μg of pEGFP (control) or pIRES-GFP plasmids encoding a peptide (S4S5L or S6T). 24 to 72 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope and constantly perfused at a rate of 2 ml/min. The bath temperature was maintained at 24.0 ± 1.0 °C. Stimulation, data recording and analysis were performed by Acquis1 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments) through an analog-to-digital converter (Tecmar TM100 Labmaster; Scientific Solution). Electrodes were connected to a patch-clamp amplifier (RK-400; Bio-Logic Science Instruments). Currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration. KCNQ1 and hERG activation curves were obtained from the tail currents and fitted by Boltzmann equations. KCNE1-KCNQ1 activation and deactivation kinetics were obtained by a monoexponential fit. If channels are spending more time in deeper closed states, they need to go through more states before reaching the open state. This is reflected by a prolonged delay in channel activation (17Cole K.S. Moore J.W. Biophys. J. 1960; 1: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This delay in channel activation was calculated from the shift in the monoexponential fit of the current measured at +80 mV. In ruptured patch experiments, pipettes (Kimble; Vineland, NJ) were filled with the following solution: 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, with KOH. In permeabilized patch experiments, the pipette solution contained the following: 120 mm K-gluconate, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.8 μg/ml amphotericin B, pH 7.2, with KOH. The standard Tyrode perfusion solution contained the following: 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The KCNE1-KCNQ1 kinetic model was derived from the model described by Silva and Rudy (18Silva J. Rudy Y. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This model has been optimized using Model Maker (version 4.0, AP Benson) to fit our experimental data, with an additional constraint: Po is <0.65 at potentials where the channel is fully activated. This constraint comes from the observation that S6 peptide Ile346–Lys358 can increase the maximal current by 50% (see Fig. 2). Consistent with the hypothetical mechanism, endogenous S4S5L linkers are pulled away from the binding site in the closed state preceding channel opening (Fig. 8, A, panel a). Two other models can be then designed (Fig. 8, A, panels b and c), with either S4S5L or S6T peptide binding to this closed state. The three models (control, S4S5L, S6T) were simultaneously optimized for current density, half-activation potential, activation, and deactivation kinetics using Mathematica (Wolfram Research). Optimized transition rates are presented in Table 1.FIGURE 8Kinetic model of KCNE1-KCNQ1 and its interactions with S4S5L or S6T peptide. A, kinetic model scheme. This model is based on Rudy's model for the KCNE1-KCNQ1 tetramer (18Silva J. Rudy Y. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the unbinding of the S4S5L and S6T domains unlocks the channel and corresponds to the last transition of the closed channel (closed locked 1 state to closed unlocked state). Peptides are likely to interact with each monomer in the unlocked states. The model covers three experimental conditions: absence of peptide (panel a), presence of S4S5L peptides (panel b) and presence of S6T peptides (panel c). Optimized transition rates are presented in Table 1. B, simulated currents during step protocols in the absence (Control) or the presence of S4S5L or S6T peptide. C, comparison between simulated and experimental half-activation potentials, activation kinetics, deactivation kinetics, and delay of activation versus current density. The changes of these parameters driven by the peptides are well described by the model. The continuum of simulated results in presence of peptides (solid lines) is obtained by varying the binding rates of the peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Optimized transition rates used in the model presented in Fig. 8 Open table in a new tab All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences between samples were determined using Student's t tests, rank sum tests (when data were not normally distributed), and two-way analysis of variance associated with a Tukey test when needed (SigmaStat, version 2.03, SPSS, Inc.). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. S4S5L and S6T plasmids were designed based on sequence alignment with Shaker (Fig. 1), in which interacting areas in the S4S5L and the S6T were suggested (19Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For each region, three different plasmids were designed, with the same length but different starting positions, to compensate for the inaccuracy of the alignment due to the poor similarity between KCNQ1 and Shaker sequences. Black arrows in Fig. 1 show the high impact residues studied in KCNQ1, and red arrows show the interacting residues Val-254 and Leu-353 (12Boulet I.R. Labro A.J. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and see accompanying article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)). At least one of these residues is lacking in Val254–Gly269 and Phe340–Ala352. For that reason, one can suppose that these peptides will be the least efficient. To study the effect of peptides on channel activity, cDNA coding for a peptide was cotransfected with the KCNE1-KCNQ1 fusion protein cDNA (21Wang W. Xia J. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34069-34074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This fusion protein limits variability in the current characteristics caused by variable KCNQ1/KCNE1 expression ratio (22Park K.H. Piron J. Dahimene S. Mérot J. Baró I. Escande D. Loussouarn G. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If the endogenous S4S5L peptide is acting like a ligand modulating channel gating, then the exogenous S4S5L peptide should also modulate the channel activity. We examined the peptide effects using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, right after patch rupture. We show that two of the three S4S5L peptides (Trp248–Ile263 and Leu251–Leu266) significantly reduced the WT KCNE1-KCNQ1 current (Fig. 2, A and C). Moreover, activation was slowed by both peptides (Fig. 2E), but deactivation was unaffected (Fig. 2F). The absence of effect of peptide Val254–Gly269 is consistent with the fact that this peptide is missing Leu251. This residue seems to play a major role in the channel voltage modulation, as its mutation to an alanine has a high impact on the channel voltage dependence (cf. Fig. 1 and see companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)). If the S6 C terminus is the receptor for S4S5L, then the S6T peptides should decoy the endogenous S4S5L linker, prevent its binding to S6T, and increase channel activity. Indeed, two of them (Pro343–Val355 and Ile346–Lys358) up-regulated the WT channel and shifted the half-activation potential toward negative values (Fig. 2, B–D). Activation was accelerated (Fig. 2E), but deactivation was unaffected (Fig. 2F). The absence of effect of peptide Phe340–Ala352 is consistent with the fact that this peptide is missing Leu353 and Val355. These residues seem to play a major role in the channel voltage modulation because their substitutions to an alanine have a high impact on channel voltage dependence (cf.

In the following experiments, we studied the most potent inhibiting peptide Leu251–Leu266 and the most potent activating peptide Ile346–Lys358 in greater details. We first analyzed the reversibility of the effects, as peptides were diffusing out of the cytosol and into the pipette after patch rupture (Fig. 3, A and D). In cells expressing KCNE1-KCNQ1 alone, the current was quite stable with a slight rundown (23Loussouarn G. Baró I. Escande D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 167-183PubMed Google Scholar). In cells coexpressing the channel and the Leu251–Leu266 peptide, the current density increased to reach control values measured in absence of peptide (Fig. 3A). Conversely, in cells coexpressing the channel and the Ile346–Lys358 peptide, the current density decreased to reach control values (Fig. 3D). This suggests that both peptides do not act on channel trafficking but strictly on gating. Because any bound peptide (S4S5L or S6T) is most probably intercalated between the endogenous S4S5L and S6T (cf. scheme in Fig. 8A), membrane depolarization, which pulls on the endogenous S4S5L, may free the peptide that is otherwise trapped in the core of the protein. In other words, long and frequent depolarization should favor reversion; shorter or less frequent depolarization should have less effect. To test this, a shorter depolarizing pulse was applied with maintained frequency. In this condition, no reversion was observed for both the inhibiting peptide Leu251–Leu266 (Fig. 3C) and the activating peptide Ile346–Lys358 (Fig. 3E). We also tested a depolarizing pulse with maintained duration but lower frequency. Again, no reversion was observed (Fig. 3, D and F). Altogether, these results suggest that peptide unbinding is favored by membrane depolarization, consistent with the state-dependent channel/peptide interaction. Several studies suggest that KCNE1 interacts with S4S5L (24Kang C. Tian C. Sönnichsen F.D. Smith J.A. Meiler J. George Jr., A.L. Vanoye C.G. Kim H.J. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7999-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and S6T (24Kang C. Tian C. Sönnichsen F.D. Smith J.A. Meiler J. George Jr., A.L. Vanoye C.G. Kim H.J. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7999-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Zheng R. Thompson K. Obeng-Gyimah E. Alessi D.M. Chen J. Cheng H. McDonald T.V. Biochem. J. 2010; 428: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of KCNE1 in the ligand/receptor mechanism, we coexpressed the most potent peptides (Leu251–Leu266 for S4S5L and Ile346–Lys358 for S6T) with KCNQ1 alone. Like in the presence of KCNE1, we observed a current inhibition with Leu251–Leu266 and an activating effect with Ile346–Lys358 (Fig. 4, A and C). These results suggest that the S4S5L/S6T state-dependent interaction is independent of the presence/absence of KCNE1. Altogether, the data presented above support the hypothesis that S4S5L peptides target the channel S6T and vice versa. To further address the specificity of the interaction between the peptides and the channel, we evaluated the effect of peptides bearing mutations known to decrease S4S5L and S6T interaction. In an accompanying paper, Snyders and co-workers (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar) show that the V254A mutation in S4S5L and the L353A mutation in S6T generate an instantaneous current component, suggesting that S4S5L/S6T interaction is weakened by the mutations (see companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)). Indeed, introduction of the V254A mutation into the S4S5L peptide Leu251–Leu266 abolished the peptide inhibition of the channel. Similarly, introduction of the L353A mutation into the S6T peptide Ile346–Lys358 abolished its activating effect. The suppression of both peptide effects (Fig. 4, B and C) supports that the S4S5L peptide is specifically targeting S6T, and vice versa. Looking now at the channel, introduction of the L353A mutation should also render the channel less sensitive to the WT S4S5L peptide. Indeed, the peak current measured in the mutant channel L353A was not decreased when the WT S4S5L peptide was coexpressed (Fig. 5, A and B), also suggesting that the S4S5L peptide is specifically targeting S6T. In the companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar), the partial open phenotype of the L353A mutant channel could be rescued by the V254L mutation in the channel S4S5L. In parallel, in the experiments with peptides, introduction of the V254L mutation in the S4S5L peptide restored its effect on the L353A mutant channel (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, the instantaneous current observed in L353A (cf. companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)) was also reduced by the V254L S4S5L peptide but not by the WT S4S5L peptide (Fig. 5C). This reduction of the instantaneous current could also be observed in the activation curve (Fig. 5D). These experiments strictly mimicked the rescue of the S4S5L/S6T interaction observed within the channel by Labro et al. (see companion article (31Labro A.J. Boulet I.R. Choveau F. Mayeur E. Bruyns T. Loussouarn G. Raes A.L. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 717-726Google Scholar)) and is a strong support for a specific interaction between the channel and the peptide. The S140G E1-Q1 mutant (WT KCNE1 fused to S140G KCNQ1) does not show any voltage dependence in the −80 to +80 mV range (26Chen Y.H. Xu S.J. Bendahhou S. Wang X.L. Wang Y. Xu W.Y. Jin H.W. Sun H. Su X.Y. Zhuang Q.N. Yang Y.Q. Li Y.B. Liu Y. Xu H.J. Li X.F. Ma N. Mou C.P. Chen Z. Barhanin J. Huang W. Science. 2003; 299: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). If S4S5L peptides bind to S6T to stabilize the closed state, they should inhibit the mutant channel as well. Fig. 6 shows that coexpression of the S140G E1-Q1 mutant channel with the S4S5L peptides (Trp248–Ile263 or Leu251–Leu266) led to an almost complete inhibition of the current (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas the activating peptides had no effect on the already fully activated S140G channel. In cells expressing the inhibitory S4S5L peptides, patch rupture led to a gradual increase in current density (Fig. 6, C–E), consistent with the peptide dilution into the patch pipette, as observed for the WT channel above. Current recovery did not occur when peptide dilution was prevented using the permeabilized patch configuration (Fig. 6, C and D). It is worth noting that the current increased toward values similar to those observed in the absence of peptide indicating that the peptides affect channel gating but not trafficking. Importantly, the reversion of the peptide effects indicates a loose peptide/channel association consistent with a loose S4S5L/S6T interaction in the channel. Our observations suggest an interaction between S4S5L and S6T in the channel protein. Accordingly, when the two peptides are coexpressed, they should bind to each other and annihilate their respective effect. To confirm this, we used the S140G E1-Q1 mutant, which is sensitive to the S4S5L but not the S6T peptides. When both a S4S5L (Trp248–Ile263 or Leu251–Leu266) and a S6T peptide (Ile346–Lys358) were coexpressed with the channel, the inhibition of S140G E1-Q1 by a S4S5L peptide was not observed (Fig. 7). This loss of inhibition is consistent with the idea that the S6T peptide Ile346–Lys358 associates with the S4S5L peptide and competitively prevents S4S5L peptide association with the channel S6T. Hence, S4S5L and S6T peptides that bind the WT channel can also bind to each other. Interestingly, the effects of S4S5L peptides are not prevented by the S6T peptide Phe340–Ala352 that does not up-regulate the WT KCNE1-KCNQ1 channel either. This suggests that the S6T peptide that does not bind the WT KCNE1-KCNQ1 channel cannot bind the S4S5L peptide either, further confirming the specificity of the S4S5L/S6T interaction. To establish the channel specificity of the S4S5L peptide Leu251–Leu266 and the S6T peptide Ile346–Lys358 for KCNE1-KCNQ1, we tested their potential effects on hERG, another voltage-gated potassium channel. As shown in the supplemental Fig. 1, KCNQ1 S4S5L and S6T peptides had no effect on hERG current amplitude and half-activation potential, confirming that peptides are channel-specific. To test the consistency between the hypothesis and the altered biophysical parameters in the presence of the peptide, we developed a kinetic model to describe the peptide-induced alterations in KCNE1-KCNQ1 channel properties (18Silva J. Rudy Y. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1384-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We deliberately made the peptides bind only the closed state immediately preceding the concerted opening (Fig. 8, A, panels b and c) because, in the other closed states, the proximity of the endogenous S4S5L and S6T is supposed to prevent peptides access. In the model, the S4S5L peptide mimics the endogenous S4S5L linker and locks the channel in a closed state. Conversely, the S6T peptide decoys the endogenous S4S5L peptide and limits this locking. This theoretical model fits the observed data; the peptides affect not only the current amplitude but also the half activation potential and the activation kinetics, and they do not affect the deactivation kinetics (Fig. 8, B and C). The kinetic model also illustrates that peptides binding prevents the channel from going to deep closed state (especially closed locked 2 in Fig. 8A). This should provoke a reduction in the delay of channel activation (17Cole K.S. Moore J.W. Biophys. J. 1960; 1: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Indeed, the delay measured in the current recordings was similar to the delay calculated in the model, further validating the model and the specificity of the peptides effects (Fig. 8C). Altogether, our results show that S4S5L acts as an inhibiting ligand that binds with low affinity to S6T only at negative potentials, locking the S5-S6 pore domain in a closed state. The state-dependent interaction between S4S5L and S6T has already been proposed by Ferrer et al. (9Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12858-12864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for hERG, another delayed rectifier potassium channel. This idea was suggested by the fact that a covalent link between S4S5L and S6T stabilizes the hERG closed state (9Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12858-12864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If S4S5L and S6T interact in both the closed and open states, a covalent interaction should not lead to channel closure. If, conversely, S4S5L interacts with S6 only in the closed state, one expects that forcing S4S5L interaction with S6 closes the channel. In the present study, we propose a similar state-dependent interaction between S4S5L and S6T in KCNQ1 channels and provide a mechanistic scheme in which a ligand attached to S4 (S4S5L) interacts with the pore and locks it closed in a voltage-dependent fashion. This mechanism supports the functional model in which the six-transmembrane domain KCNQ1 channels may be regarded as the fusion of a voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) and a ligand-gated channel (S5-S6) very similar to a two-transmembrane domain channel. In this model, the vicinity between S4S5L and S6T in the closed state suggests that the interaction between S4S5L and S6T is loose enough to allow S4S5L/S6T unbinding upon depolarization. We tried to confirm this by biochemical methods using synthetic MG Leu251–Leu266 and MG Ile346–Lys358 peptides, but we could not solubilize the peptides at concentrations >100 μm and did not observe any interaction using differential ultracentrifugation and native gels. One possibility is that the cytosol provides an environment to solubilize the peptide in the millimolar range and that this range must be reached to uncover the peptide-peptide or peptide-channel interaction. Importantly, proteins expressed under the control of a CMV promoter can reach expression levels in the millimolar range (27Lin P. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5987-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Rex T.S. Peet J.A. Surace E.M. Calvert P.D. Nikonov S.S. Lyubarsky A.L. Bendo E. Hughes T. Pugh Jr., E.N. Bennett J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 1236-1245PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast two hybrid technique was also used to probe the S4S5L and S6T peptides interaction in a “cytosolic” environment but no interaction between Leu251–Leu266 and Ile346–Lys358 could be detected. The later result is probably because of the weakness of the interaction and the poor sensitivity of the technique. Nevertheless, although chemical and biochemical approaches failed to demonstrate direct S4S5L/S6T interaction, our experiments analyzing the effects of Val254 and Leu353 point mutations (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), the S4S5L/S6T peptide interaction (Fig. 7), and channel specificity (supplemental Fig. 1) strongly support this interaction. Importantly, all of these results are consistent with a loose interaction between S4S5L and S6T. Interestingly, the ligand/receptor mechanism we propose in this study may explain the surprising observation that hyperpolarization-activated channels have a similar voltage sensor domain as depolarization-activated channels but an opposite response to depolarization. In the hyperpolarization-activated channel KAT1 (7Grabe M. Lai H.C. Jain M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 2007; 445: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and HCN (29Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), S4S5L has also been suggested to couple voltage sensing and pore opening by a labile binding (29Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Similar to our model where S4S5L binds S6T in the closed state, the S4S5L/S6 interaction seems present only in the open state of KAT1 and HCN (7Grabe M. Lai H.C. Jain M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 2007; 445: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Prole D.L. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This would explain why the latter channels are closed by membrane depolarization. The state-dependent interaction between S4S5L and S6T observed in hERG, KAT1, HCN, and now in KCNQ1 channels suggest that the mechanism described here may be applied to other voltage-gated potassium channels and probably sodium and calcium channels, which share the same overall structure with Kv tetramers. In summary, the activation mechanism suggested here describes the pore domain as being locked closed at rest by the binding of a ligand (S4S5L) to the gate (S6T). Upon plasma membrane depolarization, S4 pulls S4S5L away from S6T, allowing channel opening. Other molecular mechanisms will have to be taken into account to fully understand the complex voltage dependence, like the molecular events accompanying the concerted channel opening triggered by S4 movement (30Soler-Llavina G.J. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. Neuron. 2006; 52: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Generally, application of the ligand/receptor mechanism to voltage-gated ion channels may lead to the design of peptides specifically down- or up-regulating one specific type of ion channel. This may open new therapeutic avenues to treat channelopathies. We thank Béatrice Leray, Marie-Joseph Louérat, and Agnès Carcouët for expert technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2075014350,"We recently identified Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) as a novel transcription factor that binds to and regulates the activity of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene promoter. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of GRHL2 and the molecular mechanism underlying hTERT gene regulation by GRHL2. Retroviral transduction of GRHL2 in normal human keratinocytes (NHK) led to a significant extension of replicative life span, whereas GRHL2 knockdown notably repressed telomerase activity and cell proliferation. Using promoter magnetic precipitation coupled with Western blotting, we confirmed the binding of GRHL2 to the hTERT promoter and mapped the minimal binding region at -53 to -13 of the promoter. Furthermore, mutation analysis revealed the three nucleotides from -21 to -19 to be critical for GRHL2 binding. Because hTERT expression is regulated in part by DNA methylation, we determined the effects of GRHL2 on the methylation status of the hTERT promoter. Senescent NHK exhibited hypermethylation of the CpG island, which occurred with the loss of hTERT expression. On the contrary, the promoter remained hypomethylated in GRHL2-transduced NHK, irrespective of cell proliferation status. Also, knockdown of endogenous GRHL2 led to hypermethylation of the promoter. These results indicate that GRHL2 regulates the hTERT expression through an epigenetic mechanism and controls the cellular life span."

Microorganisms rely on iron for a wide range of metabolic and signaling functions. A significant amount of iron in the host is coordinately bound to heme (Fe2+PPIX) or hemin (Fe3+PPIX), a prosthetic group of many biologically active proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochromes. Although formal definitions distinguish “heme” and “hemin,” the first term is widely used to indicate iron protoporphyrin IX in any oxidation state. As a major biological iron source for microbes, heme is also an important porphyrin source for certain bacterial species such as Hemophilus influenzae and Porphyromonas gingivalis that are unable to synthesize the tetrapyrrole ring de novo (1Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 2Roper J.M. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Schubert H.L. Gharbia S.E. Shah H.N. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40316-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bacteria have developed two general systems to scavenge heme from their environs. The first involves synthesis of specific outer membrane receptors enabling direct contact between the organism and exogenous heme sources; for instance, HmuR, an outer membrane protein with relatively low heme binding affinity in P. gingivalis (3Simpson W. Olczak T. Genco C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5737-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The second strategy depends on secretion of heme-capturing molecules, hemophores, which scavenge free heme or heme from various carriers. There are currently only three characterized hemophores in the bacterial kingdom: two in Gram-negative bacteria including HasA in Serratia marcescens (4Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and HxuA in H. influenzae (5Hanson M.S. Pelzel S.E. Latimer J. Muller-Eberhard U. Hansen E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and one in a Gram-positive organism being the IsdX1 in Bacillus anthracis (6Maresso A.W. Garufi G. Schneewind O. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobe, is a leading pathogen in chronic periodontitis, a disease process involving progressive destruction of teeth-supporting tissues, including bone (7Holt S.C. Kesavalu L. Walker S. Genco C.A. Periodontol. 2000. 1999; 20: 168-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Convincing data also exist from experimental models and clinical investigations revealing that P. gingivalis contributes to atheromatous plaque formation that predisposes to heart disease and stroke (8Gibson 3rd, F.C. Ukai T. Genco C.A. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2041-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Within the periodontopathic microbiota involved in periodontal disease, P. gingivalis is reported as one of the early colonizers of dental plaque with other bacterial species in the development of dental plaque biofilms (9Periasamy S. Kolenbrander P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6804-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Fujise O. Miura M. Hamachi T. Maeda K. J. Periodontol. 2006; 77: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For successful colonization of the gingival crevice, P. gingivalis must acquire heme from limited quantities of host hemoproteins in the healthy gingival crevice, as well as compete with other heme/iron requiring microorganisms to scavenge essential heme (11Bramanti T.E. Holt S.C. Ebersole J.L. Van Dyke T. J. Periodontal. Res. 1993; 28: 464-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because of the absolute requirement of heme for growth of this organism, it has been speculated that P. gingivalis may utilize a hemophore as a heme scavenger, although no candidate has been detected. Here, we report the characterization of the product of PG2227 as a novel hemophore-like heme-binding protein HusA (heme uptake system protein A) detected in P. gingivalis growing under continuous culture in heme-limited conditions. HusA was found to be a high affinity heme-binding protein that preferably binds the ligand as μ-oxo dimeric heme. Further, our finding indicates that P. gingivalis responds to heme limitation by producing HusA as an outer membrane-associated protein as well as releasing it into the culture medium to act as a heme scavenger. P. gingivalis wild-type strain W83 and mutant derivatives were grown in enriched Tryptic Soy Broth (eTSB; per liter: 30 g of Trypticase soy broth, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 mg of hemin, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.5 g of l-cysteine and 2 mg of menadione) 3The abbreviations used are: eTSBenriched tryptic soy brothPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidTMBZtetramethylbenzidine. or blood eTSB agar (eTSB medium plus 15 g/liter agar and supplemented with 3% defibrinated sheep blood) at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber (Don Whitley Scientific Limited, UK) with an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% CO2, and 5% H2. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for all plasmid construction work and was grown in Luria-Bertani broth medium and agar. For antibiotic selection in E. coli, ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml and erythromycin used at 300 μg/ml. For P. gingivalis growth selection on solid medium, erythromycin was used at 5 μg/ml and doubled in liquid culture. The phenotype and genotype of all strains and plasmids are listed in supplemental Table S1. enriched tryptic soy broth 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid tetramethylbenzidine. For continuous culture, P. gingivalis W83 was grown in a custom-designed chemostat system with a 70-ml working volume. Overnight P. gingivalis start culture was inoculated at 1:25 into modified basal medium (per liter: 10 g of proteose peptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of tryptone, 2.5 g of KCl, 0.5 g of l-cysteine, and 2 mg of menadione, pH 7.5) supplemented with hemin at various concentrations. The dilution rate was 0.05 h−1, giving a mean generation time of 13.9 h; the pH was maintained at 7.5 ± 0.1. Once steady state growth was established, cultures were harvested at 4 °C. The biomass of the culture was monitored by optical density (Beckman DU640; Beckman Coulter), and culture purity was checked by Gram staining. The husA gene was amplified by PCR from P. gingivalis W83 genomic DNA using rPG2227NcoIF, rPG2227XhoIR primers (see supplemental Table S2), and Accuprime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and subsequently cloned into NcoI and XhoI sites of the T7 expression pET24d(+) plasmid (Novagen; Merck) to create the plasmid pETR7. The final gene construction encodes for HusA minus the first 23 amino acid residues of a putative signal peptide sequence as predicted by SignalP 3.0. The stop codon of husA was replaced by a thrombin cleavage site followed by a C-terminal His6 tag. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) carrying the plasmid pETR7 was grown in 50 ml of LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C overnight before being inoculated into 1 liter of prewarmed LB/kanamycin medium with vigorous shaking at 37 °C. At A600 of 0.6, 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the culture was allowed to grow for an additional 3 h before harvesting. The bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in cold native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) at ∼5 ml/g pellet followed immediately by a freeze-thaw process. The bacteria were lysed by pulse sonication on ice, and the supernatant was passed through a nickel-chelating resin to purify the His6-tagged protein (Qiagen). Purified protein was dialyzed into 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl before the addition of 10 mm CaCl2 for thrombin cleavage. The His6 tag was removed from the fusion HusA using the Thrombin CleanCleaveTM kit (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cleaved His6 fragments were removed through a nickel-chelating column, and the detagged rHusA was dialyzed and concentrated into 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl. All of the heme solutions were prepared immediately before use. Fresh 10 mm stock solution of hemin (>98% HPLC; Fluka) in 0.1 m NaOH was diluted into 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, for μ-oxo bisheme binding assays. To obtain heme solutions comprised predominantly of monomeric heme, the pH of the 10 mm stock solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 by slow dropwise addition of HCl followed by dilution into 50 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.5 (12Smalley J.W. Birss A.J. Szmigielski B. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Surface heme-containing pigments from P. gingivalis colonies on blood agar were extracted by incubation in 140 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.8, for 10 min at 20 °C (13Smalley J.W. Silver J. Marsh P.J. Birss A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Heme concentration in the extracted pigment solution was calculated using the heme molar extinction coefficient ϵ385 = 58,400 (14Czjzek M. Létoffé S. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Izadi-Pruneyre N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1176-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Heme staining of SDS-PAGE gels by TMBZ/H2O2 detects heme bound to proteins. Samples subjected to PAGE were pretreated with conventional reducing sample buffer, with or without boiling. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in the dark for 1 h in a prechilled solution of sodium acetate (250 mm, pH 5.0), methanol, and H2O at a ratio of 6:3:1 (v:v). The gels were stained with 7:2:1 (v:v) of sodium acetate (250 mm, pH 5.0), TMBZ (6.3 mm in methanol), and H2O for 30 min, followed by color development with 30 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Briefly, rHusA was mixed and incubated with prewashed hemin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mm NaCl, PBS buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 h at 37 °C. Nonspecifically adsorbed proteins were washed off with 1 m NaCl, PBS, and 0.5% Sarkosyl, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Maltose-binding protein (pMYB5; New England Biolabs) and unsubstituted agarose beads were used as negative controls. All of the absorbance spectra were recorded in a quartz cuvette (Starna Pty Ltd.) using a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). The absorption spectrum of monomeric heme on binding to HusA was recorded in 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5. To further evaluate the bisheme binding property, holo-HusA was prepared by incubation of apo-HusA with heme (ratio of 1:1) at 25 °C for 20 min in 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The HusA-heme complex was purified over a Sephadex G25 desalting column (1 cm × 10 cm) to remove free heme before the absorption spectrum of holo-HusA was recorded. Subsequently, sodium dithionite crystals (∼1 mg) were added, and the spectra under these reducing conditions were recorded. For kinetic absorption spectra, similar conditions as above were used with measurement carried out at predetermined time points. All of the spectra were collected at 25 °C. The observed rate constant was calculated using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.). The binding affinity of rHusA to heme was investigated using the perturbationd of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with a Luminescence spectrometer LS 50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a 10-mm-path length quartz cuvette (Starna Pty Ltd.). Fluorescence intensity at 338 nm with 295-nm excitation was recorded for 1000 μl of 400 nm rHusA in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and at 10 min after each subsequent titration of 0.5 μl of 80 μm fresh heme stock into the sample. The monomeric heme binding affinity assay was performed in 50 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.5. The binding titration data were fitted to the equation below, in which a single binding site is assumed (15Shepherd M. Heath M.D. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5030-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Fobs=F0+Fmax×[L]t+[E]t+Kd-([L]t+[E]t+Kd)2-4[L]t[E]t2[E]t(Eq. 1) where Fobs is the observed fluorescence, F0 is the initial fluorescence, Fmax is the maximum amplitude of fluorescence quenching, [L]t is the total ligand concentration, [E]t is the total concentration of protein, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant. The average Kd values from three independent assays were reported for each condition. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) coupled to an ÄKTATM purifier system with multiple wavelength sensor (GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated with 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min prior to sample loading of 12.5 μm rHusA with/without 12.5 μm heme in a total volume of 400 μl. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm, and heme absorption was monitored at 399 nm and 385 nm. The column was calibrated with Blue Dextran 200 (void volume), conalbumin (75 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) (GE Healthcare). Subcellular components were separated by Sarkosyl treatment and analytical centrifugation as previously described (16Nguyen K.A. Zylicz J. Szczesny P. Sroka A. Hunter N. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were adjusted to A600 of 0.5 with cold PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and treated with protease inhibitors: 4 mm Nα-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) for ≥2 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h to separate vesicles and vesicle-free medium. Proteins in the supernatant fraction were precipitated by a pyrogallol red-molybdate-methanol method (17Caldwell R.B. Lattemann C.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The purity of the outer membrane fraction was confirmed by the exclusive presence of LPS and the purity of the inner membrane fraction by the exclusive presence of a biotin-containing oxaloacetate decarboxylase as detected by Western blotting using anti-LPS 1B5 mAb and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin, respectively (16Nguyen K.A. Zylicz J. Szczesny P. Sroka A. Hunter N. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Known amounts of protein antigen or whole bacterial cell cultures were standardized, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer for ≥2 h. Anti-HusA polyclonal antibody was produced through a subcontractor (Genscript Inc.) by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide GGGKDKALPFAEKS present near the C terminus of HusA. Purified polyclonal antibody against HusA was used to probe the membranes at 1:5,000 dilution in TBST buffer for 3 h. Patient sera from a cohort that has been reported previously to be positive for P. gingivalis and has reactivity toward P. gingivalis proteins (18Nguyen K.A. DeCarlo A.A. Paramaesvaran M. Collyer C.A. Langley D.B. Hunter N. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were used at 1:40 dilution in the same conditions above. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-human IgG (Dako Corp.) antibodies were used at 1:10,000 dilution in TBST before final color development with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis was performed from scanned images in a linear range using ImageJ from the National Institutes of Health. Chemostat cultures were diluted to A600 of 0.6 with medium and stabilized with RNAprotect bacteria reagent (Qiagen) before RNA was extracted with the RNAqueous Micro kit (Ambion, Australia). Reverse transcription was carried out on 2 μl of total RNA using the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) in a volume of 10 μl as per the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was carried out in 25-μl singleplex reactions using 5 μl of 1:5 dilution of the cDNA along with TaqMan probe/primers against husA and 5 μl of 1:200 dilution of cDNA for the calibrator gene 16S (see primers and probes in supplemental Table S2) on a Mx3005P real time PCR system using the Brilliant® II QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). Normalization and calibration methods were the same as in our previous publication (16Nguyen K.A. Zylicz J. Szczesny P. Sroka A. Hunter N. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Creation of the deletional inactivation husA mutant was carried out as described previously (16Nguyen K.A. Zylicz J. Szczesny P. Sroka A. Hunter N. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1.2-kb upstream fragment (primers 2227frAEcoRF and 2227frASacR, with SacI and EcoRI sites) and a 1.3-kb downstream fragment (primers 2227frBPstIF and 2227frBSphIR, with PstI and SphI sites) to the husA gene (GenBankTM accession number PG2227) were amplified from chromosomal DNA of P. gingivalis W83 by PCR and inserted into pUC19. A 2.2-kb ermF/ermAM cassette (primers ermSacF and ermPstIR, with PstI and SacI sites) was amplified from the plasmid pVA2198 (19Fletcher H.M. Schenkein H.A. Morgan R.M. Bailey K.A. Berry C.R. Macrina F.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the modified plasmid above to create pWD7. All of the primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. The plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing prior to being electroporated into P. gingivalis W83 for homologous recombination into the genome to create a deletion of the gene. The husA-positive control mutant was created the same way except that the husA gene itself was amplified (primers 2227frCEcoRIF and 2227frCSacIR) and inserted into the plasmid rather than the upstream fragment to the husA gene to create pWDC7. Transformed cells were selected on erythromycin eTSB agar, and resistant clones were further confirmed by PCR and Southern blot using the ermF/ermAM DIG-labeled probe (Roche). Fresh colonies of P. gingivalis wild-type W83, deletion mutant WD7, and control mutant WDC7 were inoculated into eTSB medium without heme supplementation as the starter cultures for growth curve analysis. Heme stores were depleted by daily passage of the starter culture into medium without heme supplementation at 1:10 inoculum until the biomass of the following passage could no longer attain an A600 of 0.3 after 24 h of incubation. The penultimate culture was adjusted to A600 of 0.5, and a 1:10 inoculum was transferred anaerobically into 5 ml of prewarmed, prereduced eTSB medium supplemented with 50 nm or 5 μm heme in individual Teflon screw cap test tubes (13 × 100 mm). The tubes were capped tightly, removed from the chamber, and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath. At predetermined time points, the tubes were vortexed, and absorbance at 600 nm was recorded using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate. Prism v3.03 software (GraphPad Software Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses. Real time PCR data and protein expression integrated densities from Western blotting were tested for normal distribution, and differences were compared using one-way analysis of variance, with Bonferroni's correction and 95% confidence intervals. Growth curve data from three independent experiments were expressed as the means and standard deviations, and the differences were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. To determine functional characteristics, purified and untagged recombinant HusA (rHusA) (supplemental Fig. S1) was incubated with heme, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and initially stained with TMBZ to detect the presence of heme, followed by Coomassie Blue staining for protein detection. Heme was found to be associated with rHusA under reducing SDS-PAGE without boiling, but complete denaturation of the protein-heme complex by boiling of the sample resulted in the loss of staining for heme (Fig. 1A). This suggested that heme was strongly associated with rHusA but is not covalently bound to the polypeptide. The strength of heme binding by rHusA was confirmed by its binding to hemin-agarose despite a wash step with 1 m NaCl and 0.5% sarkosyl (supplemental Fig. S2). Heme binding by rHusA was also detected by changes in the Soret region of the UV-visible spectrum of heme. Heme in solution exists as a monomer-dimer equilibrium (20Asher C. de Villiers K.A. Egan T.J. Inorg. Chem. 2009; 48: 7994-8003Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At pH 6.5, monomeric heme predominates, giving an absorption peak at 365 nm (Fig. 1B). During incubation of HusA with monomeric heme, a shift in the Soret band peaking at 399 nm emerged that is accompanied by reduction in absorption at 365 nm. The emergence of μ-oxo heme was indicated by the shift of the charge transfer band (Q band) to 600 nm with reduction of the monomeric heme band at 630 nm (Fig. 1B, inset) (12Smalley J.W. Birss A.J. Szmigielski B. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This spectral pattern of heme absorption following ligation to HusA is also observed when heme monomer is incubated with gingipains that have been reported to mediate heme μ-oxo dimer formation in P. gingivalis (12Smalley J.W. Birss A.J. Szmigielski B. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the bisheme binding property of rHusA, the rHusA-heme complex at pH 8.0 was purified by chromatography over a desalting column. Under these conditions, free heme demonstrated a doublet Soret band at 365 and 385 nm, corresponding to monomeric and dimeric ferric heme, respectively (Fig. 1C). This is in agreement with evidence that alkaline solutions favor the formation of dimeric species such as μ-oxo- or π-π*-bisheme (20Asher C. de Villiers K.A. Egan T.J. Inorg. Chem. 2009; 48: 7994-8003Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21de Villiers K.A. Kaschula C.H. Egan T.J. Marques H.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Binding of heme to rHusA at pH 8.0 was associated with a shift in peak absorbance of dimeric heme from 385 to 399 nm with a slight shoulder at 375 nm. This was supported by an emergence of a charge transfer band at 600 nm (Fig. 1C), characteristic of a hemoprotein with ligated μ-oxo bisheme (12Smalley J.W. Birss A.J. Szmigielski B. Potempa J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Smalley J.W. Birss A.J. Withnall R. Silver J. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the spectrum indicated that the primary binding mode of rHusA is to bisheme and the slight shoulder of the spectrum at 375 nm may indicate minor binding to other heme species. Similar binding characteristics have been reported for the surface heme-binding protein IsdH of Staphylococcus aureus (23Watanabe M. Tanaka Y. Suenaga A. Kuroda M. Yao M. Watanabe N. Arisaka F. Ohta T. Tanaka I. Tsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28649-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of heme coordination by HusA, the rHusA-heme complex was reduced with excess dithionite. Following reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, the Soret band underwent a red shift with the appearance of two well resolved Q bands at 539 and 569 nm, indicating the rapid formation of a low spin ferrous heme (24Ghosh K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in the rHusA-heme complex (Fig. 1C). Binding of low spin ferrous heme suggested HusA coordinates only to the fifth axis of the heme iron, with the sixth coordination site being available for occupation by oxygen (27Block D.R.

Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8018-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is analogous to binding by oxymyoglobin (29Woodward J.J. Martin N.I. Marletta M.A. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Identical shifts in spectra were observed following incubation of rHusA with black pigment composed of μ-oxo dimers extracted from P. gingivalis (supplemental Fig. S3). Kinetic interaction of rHusA with heme in solution at pH 8.0 was monitored by measuring time-dependent changes in the Soret absorption spectrum (Fig. 1D). Within 30 s of mixing into rHusA solution, there was a pronounced shift of the heme Soret band from 385 to 399 nm, which progressively increased to reach equilibrium within 10 min. One-phase exponential association curve fitting was employed to describe the kinetic behavior of the absorbance signal. The observed rate constant Kob was calculated to be (4.3 ± 0.4) ×10−3 s−1 at 25 °C. This indicated a fast association rate constant (kon) for the kinetic interaction of heme with rHusA. The heme binding capacity of rHusA was determined by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (15Shepherd M. Heath M.D. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5030-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sequential titration of 40 nm heme into 400 nm rHusA solution resulted in progressive quenching of rHusA fluorescence as shown in Fig. 2. Control titrations were obtained using N-acetyltryptophanamide as the fluorophore. Heme quenching data from the N-acetyltryptophanamide solution were used to correct for inner filter effects of the titrant. The binding constant at equilibrium at pH 8.0 was calculated to be 7.0 ± 2.5 × 10−10 m, demonstrating high affinity binding of heme by rHusA. Moreover, binding saturation occurred at 400 nm heme titrated into 400 nm HusA, suggesting that HusA bound heme at a stoichiometry of 1:1. Binding affinity of rHusA for monomeric heme at pH 6.5 was calculated as 1.0 ± 2.2 × 10−8 m, which was lower than for the dimeric form. The binding affinity"
https://openalex.org/W2079278662,"CD151, a transmembrane protein of the tetraspanin family, is implicated in the regulation of cell-substrate adhesion and cell migration through physical and functional interactions with integrin receptors. In contrast, little is known about the potential role of CD151 in controlling cell proliferation and survival. We have previously shown that β4 integrin, a major CD151 partner, not only acts as an adhesive receptor for laminins but also as an intracellular signaling platform promoting cell proliferation and invasive growth upon interaction with Met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Here we show that RNAi-mediated silencing of CD151 expression in cancer cells impairs HGF-driven proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, protection from anoikis, and tumor progression in xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that CD151 is crucially implicated in the formation of signaling complexes between Met and β4 integrin, a known amplifier of HGF-induced tumor cell growth and survival. CD151 depletion hampered HGF-induced phosphorylation of β4 integrin and the ensuing Grb2-Gab1 association, a signaling pathway leading to MAPK stimulation and cell growth. Accordingly, CD151 knockdown reduced HGF-triggered activation of MAPK but not AKT signaling cascade. These results indicate that CD151 controls Met-dependent neoplastic growth by enhancing receptor signaling through β4 integrin-mediated pathways, independent of cell-substrate adhesion.

These results indicate that CD151 controls Met-dependent neoplastic growth by enhancing receptor signaling through β4 integrin-mediated pathways, independent of cell-substrate adhesion. IntroductionCD151 is a cell surface protein of the tetraspanin family. These proteins contain four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and two short cytoplasmic tails (1Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 2Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Tetraspanins are major partners of integrins that regulate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components as well as cell-cell contacts, thereby modulating cell migration. In particular, CD151 is typically associated with α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 integrin receptor complexes for laminins (3Sincock P.M. Fitter S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. van den Berg J.G. Claessen N. Weening J.J. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is increased during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (5Zavadil J. Bitzer M. Liang D. Yang Y.C. Massimi A. Kneitz S. Piek E. Bottinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6686-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the activity of tetraspanins as pro-migratory molecules has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis (6Lazo P.A. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Zöller M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). For example, elevated CD151 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis in colon, lung, and prostate cancers (8Ang J. Lijovic M. Ashman L.K. Kan K. Frauman A.G. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2004; 13: 1717-1721PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashida H. Takabayashi A. Tokuhara T. Hattori N. Taki T. Hasegawa H. Satoh S. Kobayashi N. Yamaoka Y. Miyake M. Br. J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4109-4114PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this, the association between integrin α6β4 and CD151 has been linked to tumor cell motility, increased metastasis, and poor prognosis in colon cancer (11Gesierich S. Paret C. Hildebrand D. Weitz J. Zgraggen K. Schmitz-Winnenthal F.H. Horejsi V. Yoshie O. Herlyn D. Ashman L.K. Zöller M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2840-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that a CD151-specific antibody can prevent tumor cell invasion and metastasis by modulating cell-substrate adhesion (12Zijlstra A. Lewis J. Degryse B. Stuhlmann H. Quigley J.P. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Notably, although the function of CD151 in the regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion and migration is well established, its role in cell growth and survival signaling is poorly understood.Tetraspanins can interact with several partners in addition to integrins and form intricate protein networks in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains at the cell surface, which may function as platforms regulating receptor signaling (13Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 397-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In this context, previous studies have demonstrated that CD151, CD9, and CD82 can modulate cancer cell motility and morphogenesis elicited by the activation of Met and EGF receptor tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) 4The abbreviations used are: RTKreceptor tyrosine kinase receptorHGFhepatocyte growth factorMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidepoly-HEMApolyhydroxyethylmethacrylatehhuman.

Because of its role in promoting integrin-dependent adhesion, CD151 has been envisaged so far mostly as a linking molecule in the functional cross-talk between integrin-mediated signals, RTK activation, and cancer cell migration. Intriguingly, activated RTKs are known to cross-talk with integrin receptors not only to regulate migration but also to promote cell growth and survival (22Guo W. Pylayeva Y. Pepe A. Yoshioka T.

Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). One paradigmatic example is integrin α6β4, a major CD151 partner (24Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. Oomen L.C. Calafat J. Janssen H. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which cooperates with RTKs to promote anchorage-independent growth, cell transformation, and tumor progression. Accordingly, we have shown previously that the long cytosolic tail of β4 integrin acts as an adhesion-independent signaling substrate that amplifies tumor cell growth, survival, and invasive phenotypes mediated by RTK Met (25Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10674-10679Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this scenario, our working hypothesis was that the tetraspanin CD151 might participate in the control of cell proliferation and tumor growth by acting as molecular bridge between oncogenic Met receptor and integrins. Therefore, in this work, we specifically focused on the growth and survival responses elicited by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signaling in tumor cells and demonstrated that CD151 positively controls Met-dependent signaling leading to cell proliferation, protection from anoikis, and in vivo tumorigenesis. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD151 is required for the phosphorylation of β4 integrin elicited by Met and for the ensuing adhesion-independent pathway promoting tumor cell growth.DISCUSSIONTetraspanin molecules, such as CD9, CD82, and CD151, are expressed in tumor cells and have been reported to regulate neoplastic progression via mechanisms that, although only partly understood, are thought to implicate cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (7Zöller M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In the case of CD151, its role in neoplastic progression is controversial. On the one side, several reports have documented increased expression of CD151 in tumor samples and, in some cases, have correlated such overexpression with increased metastatic propensity (8Ang J. Lijovic M. Ashman L.K. Kan K. Frauman A.G. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2004; 13: 1717-1721PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashida H. Takabayashi A. Tokuhara T. Hattori N. Taki T. Hasegawa H. Satoh S.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4109-4114PubMed Google Scholar). On the other side, an inhibitory function for this tetraspanin in invasion and metastasis has also been suggested, possibly as a consequence of sustained adhesion to extracellular matrix, which in turn reduces tumor cell locomotion (38Chometon G. Zhang Z.G. Rubinstein E. Boucheix C. Mauch C. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 983-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39García-López M.A. Barreiro O. García-Díez A.

Invest Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1126-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In line with this, a CD151 antibody capable of blocking tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis was shown to exert agonistic functions facilitating CD151-mediated stabilization of integrin complexes, with consequent production of firm cell-matrix adhesion and reduced tumor cell motility (12Zijlstra A. Lewis J. Degryse B. Stuhlmann H. Quigley J.P. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The functional role of CD151 in cell-substrate adhesion is further substantiated by the observation that this tetraspanin can physically interact with α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 integrin receptors (4Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. van den Berg J.G. Claessen N. Weening J.J. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Less is known about the function of CD151 in the regulation of tumorigenic properties, such as deregulated proliferation and evasion from apoptosis. It was reported that the growth of certain carcinoma cells and/or their ability to form tumors in mice may basally decrease upon CD151 knockdown (14Klosek S.K. Nakashiro K. Hara S. Goda H.

Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have not seen the same thing in A549 and A431 carcinoma cells, possibly indicating a distinctive requirement for CD151 expression in different cells. In this work, we specifically focused on the growth and survival responses elicited by HGF/Met signaling in tumor cells and demonstrated that CD151 expression is critically implicated, both in vitro and in vivo. Unexpectedly, this specific function of CD151 does not proceed from its regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion because the effects are observed independently of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. In fact, here we demonstrated for the first time that CD151 sustains adhesion-independent functions, such as tumor cell growth in soft agar and protection from anoikis induced by HGF-Met signaling. Moreover, we found that CD151 is necessary to direct Met activity toward tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 integrin, which triggers a signaling pathway leading to dedicated stimulation of MAPK-regulated proliferative signals (27Michieli P. Mazzone M. Basilico C. Cavassa S. Sottile A. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Tetraspanins are known for their ability to organize laterally into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and promote the formation of multimolecular complexes including plasma membrane receptors and associated molecules (2Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). In line with this assumption, independent studies have shown that CD151 can associate with Met (14Klosek S.K. Nakashiro K. Hara S. Goda H. Hasegawa H. Hamakawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 379: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as with β4 integrin (25Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10674-10679Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our data suggest the existence of triple Met-CD151-β4 complexes on the cell surface within cholesterol-enriched microdomains, and importantly, demonstrate that a valid Met-β4 association depends on the presence of CD151.The function of CD151 as a membrane-associated scaffold for optimization of RTK-integrin cross-talk may well extend beyond the HGF/Met case. For instance, β4 integrin has also been implicated as an intermediate effector of EGF-dependent signaling (42Mainiero F. Pepe A. Yeon M. Ren Y. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to that seen for Met, we could not reveal any physical association between CD151 and EGF receptor in cancer cells (not shown), suggesting a specificity of this tetraspanin in regulating complex formation between β4 integrin and Met.Of note, this dual role of CD151 as a modifier of adhesion-related responses (cross-talk with integrins, regulation of cell migration, and invasion) and as an adhesion-independent mediator of tumor growth and survival recalls a similar behavior of β4 integrin. In fact, on the one hand, β4 acts as a mechanical adhesive device by incorporating into hemidesmosomes and participating in the architecture of stable cell-matrix interactions (43Margadant C. Frijns E. Wilhelmsen K. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); on the other hand, it acts as a servo-signaling apparatus to amplify RTK-triggered transduction pathways, irrespective of integrin engagement by matrix ligands (23Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. Oomen L.C. Calafat J. Janssen H. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This dichotomy of CD151 is reflected in some apparent inconsistencies. For example, the impairment of cell-substrate adhesion caused by CD151 knockdown can be reverted by adding an activating anti-β1 integrin antibody; however, this treatment cannot rescue the loss of phosphorylation of multiple focal adhesion proteins (such as focal adhesion kinase, Src, p130Cas, and paxillin) normally modulated by cell adhesion and integrin activation (35Yamada M. Sumida Y. Fujibayashi A. Fukaguchi K. Sanzen N. Nishiuchi R. Sekiguchi K. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3335-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One could speculate that CD151 hijacks these signal transducers to convey adhesion-independent growth signals. Consistently, we observed that HGF-induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at the Src-specific phosphorylation sites Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 is reduced in CD151-deficient cells. 5M. Franco and L. Tamagnone, unpublished observations. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that CD151 is crucially implicated in the association and the signaling cross-talk between Met and β4 integrin, as well as for proper implementation of Met/β4-dependent MAPK activation and tumor growth. This unveils a novel player in RTK-regulated oncogenic networks and puts forward the notion that targeting CD151 might be beneficial to interfere with Met-driven malignancy. IntroductionCD151 is a cell surface protein of the tetraspanin family. These proteins contain four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and two short cytoplasmic tails (1Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 2Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Tetraspanins are major partners of integrins that regulate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components as well as cell-cell contacts, thereby modulating cell migration. In particular, CD151 is typically associated with α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 integrin receptor complexes for laminins (3Sincock P.M. Fitter S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. van den Berg J.G. Claessen N. Weening J.J. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is increased during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (5Zavadil J. Bitzer M. Liang D. Yang Y.C. Massimi A. Kneitz S. Piek E. Bottinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6686-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the activity of tetraspanins as pro-migratory molecules has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis (6Lazo P.A. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Zöller M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). For example, elevated CD151 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis in colon, lung, and prostate cancers (8Ang J. Lijovic M. Ashman L.K. Kan K. Frauman A.G. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2004; 13: 1717-1721PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashida H. Takabayashi A. Tokuhara T. Hattori N. Taki T. Hasegawa H. Satoh S. Kobayashi N. Yamaoka Y. Miyake M. Br. J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4109-4114PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this, the association between integrin α6β4 and CD151 has been linked to tumor cell motility, increased metastasis, and poor prognosis in colon cancer (11Gesierich S. Paret C. Hildebrand D. Weitz J. Zgraggen K. Schmitz-Winnenthal F.H. Horejsi V. Yoshie O. Herlyn D. Ashman L.K. Zöller M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2840-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that a CD151-specific antibody can prevent tumor cell invasion and metastasis by modulating cell-substrate adhesion (12Zijlstra A. Lewis J. Degryse B. Stuhlmann H. Quigley J.P. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Notably, although the function of CD151 in the regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion and migration is well established, its role in cell growth and survival signaling is poorly understood.Tetraspanins can interact with several partners in addition to integrins and form intricate protein networks in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains at the cell surface, which may function as platforms regulating receptor signaling (13Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 397-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In this context, previous studies have demonstrated that CD151, CD9, and CD82 can modulate cancer cell motility and morphogenesis elicited by the activation of Met and EGF receptor tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) 4The abbreviations used are: RTKreceptor tyrosine kinase receptorHGFhepatocyte growth factorMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidepoly-HEMApolyhydroxyethylmethacrylatehhuman.

https://openalex.org/W2004819781,"Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are enzymes that convert arginine to citrulline in proteins. In this study, we examined PAD-mediated citrullination and its effect on pro-inflammatory activity in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Citrullination of 45–65-kDa proteins was induced when cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml). Protein citrullination was suppressed by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (30 μm). LPS treatment up-regulated COX-2 levels in cells. Interestingly, overexpressing PAD2 reduced LPS-mediated COX-2 up-regulation by 50%. PAD2 overexpression also reduced NF-κB activity, determined by NF-κB-driven luciferase activity. The effect of PAD2 on NF-κB activity was further examined by using HEK 293 cells transfected with NF-κB luciferase, IκB β/γ kinase (IKKβ/γ) subunits, and PAD2. IKKβ increased NF-κB activity, but this increase was markedly suppressed when PAD2 was present in cells. IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation was further enhanced by IKKγ in the presence of calcium ionophore A23187. However, this stimulatory effect of IKKβ/γ was abolished by PAD2. Coimmunoprecipitation of cell lysates showed that IKKγ and PAD2 can coimmunoprecipitate in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore.

The synthesis of COX-2 is mediated by nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB that normally resides in the cytoplasm and forms a protein complex with inhibitory κB (IκB). The dissociation of NF-κB from IκB is mediated by IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome, which consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulator, IKKγ. IKKγ (also known as NF-κB essential modulator; NEMO) is an important regulatory component of the IKK complex. When cells are stimulated by LPS, IKK signalosome is activated to cause NF-κB dissociation from IκBα, and NF-κB is translocated to nucleus, where it activates target genes (24Kawai T. Akira S.

Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of EGFR on human mammary epithelial cells disrupts adherens junctions (AJs) through Vav2 and Rac1/Cdc42 activation. In EGF-stimulated cells, Cbl regulates the levels of phosphorylated Vav2 thereby attenuating Rac1/Cdc42 activity. Knockdown of Cbl and Cbl-b enhanced the EGF-induced disruption of AJs and cell motility. Overexpression of constitutively active Vav2 activated Rac1/Cdc42 and reorganized junctional actin cytoskeleton; these effects were suppressed by WT Cbl and enhanced by a ubiquitin ligase-deficient Cbl mutant. Cbl forms a complex with phospho-EGFR and phospho-Vav2 and facilitates phospho-Vav2 ubiquitinylation. Cbl can also interact with Vav2 directly in a Cbl Tyr-700-dependent manner. A ubiquitin ligase-deficient Cbl mutant enhanced the morphological transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by constitutively active Vav2; this effect requires an intact Cbl Tyr-700.

The Cbl-bound activated EGFR is ubiquitinylated and recognition of ubiquitin signal by the endosomal protein complex required for transport (ESCRT) protein complexes facilitates sorting of the receptor into inner vesicles of the multivesicular body for eventual lysosomal degradation (17Eden E.R.

In addition to their direct interaction with RTKs and regulation of RTK traffic, Cbl proteins also form complexes with signaling intermediates that play key roles in cellular activation. Evidence in lymphocyte activation systems, driven by non-RTK-coupled antigen receptors, suggests that Cbl proteins can orchestrate the ubiquitinylation-dependent negative regulation of nonreceptor signaling components such as PI3K (through interaction with p85 subunit), the Rap G-protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) C3G (via Cbl protein interaction with Crk adaptor proteins), and Rho GTPase GEF Vav (11Schmidt M.H.

Although negative regulation of EGFR by Cbl has been well established in model cell systems, the biological impact of such negative regulation and the EGFR effectors that are impacted in physiologically relevant cellular systems remains unexplored. Human MECs are uniquely EGF-dependent for proliferation (25Stampfer M.R. Pan C.H. Hosoda J. Bartholomew J. Mendelsohn J. Yaswen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar to other epithelial cell systems, apical-basolateral polarity in MECs is generated and maintained through specific cell-cell junctions and cell-substratum adhesions that are important for epithelial function and homeostasis (26Bissell M.J. Radisky D.C. Rizki A. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 27Debnath J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Rev.

The basolateral E-cadherin-containing AJs are critical in the organization of epithelial polarity and tissue morphogenesis and play important roles in epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration (29McNeill H. Ozawa M. Kemler R. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 30De Vries W.N. Evsikov A.V. Haac B.E. Fancher K.S. Holbrook A.E. Kemler R. Solter D.

Disruption of AJs is also linked to cancer development and metastasis (32Birchmeier W. Hulsken J. Behrens J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 189 (discussion 136–41, 174–176): 124-136PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wodarz A. Näthke I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 34Hirohashi S. Kanai Y. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Notably, ligand-activated EGFR can phosphorylate cadherin complexes, leading to the disassembly of AJs (35Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). EGFR can also down-regulate E-cadherin through stimulation of E-cadherin endocytosis (36Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). One key pathway downstream of RTKs that remodels AJs involves the activation of Rho GTPases. These small GTPases cycle between GTP-bound active forms and GDP-bound inactive forms under the influence of GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins, respectively (37Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 38Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Activation of RhoA and Rac1 is involved in cell scattering upon stimulation through c-MET, a well studied model of epithelial cell dissociation (40Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac1 alone is sufficient to disrupt AJs (42Braga V.M. Betson M. Li X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Stimulation through EGFR is also known to activate Rho GTPases (43Schiller M.R. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1834-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A key signaling pathway through which EGFR activates Rho GTPases involves Vav family Rho GEFs, Vav1–3 (43Schiller M.R. Cell.

Vav proteins interact directly with the phosphorylated EGFR through their C-terminal SH2 domains and are subsequently activated by EGFR-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in their N-terminal acidic regions (47Hornstein I. Alcover A. Katzav S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 48Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Among the Vav family proteins, Vav2 is ubiquitously expressed and has been characterized in model cell systems as a GEF for Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 downstream of EGFR (44Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 46Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol.

We have shown that Vav2 plays a critical role in the disruption of MEC polarity downstream of EGFR (49Duan L. Chen G. Virmani S. Ying G. Raja S.M. Chung B.M. Rainey M.A. Dimri M. Ortega-Cava C.F.

Previously, we have shown that Cbl can negatively regulate the hematopoietically restricted Vav1 protein through ubiquitinylation, resulting in attenuation of T-cell receptor signaling (22Miura-Shimura Y. Duan L. Rao N.L. Reddi A.L. Shimura H. Rottapel R. Druker B.J. Tsygankov A. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38495-38504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cbl directly interacts with Vav1 based on the Vav1 SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residue 700 in the C-terminal region of Cbl (50Marengère L.E. Mirtsos C. Kozieradzki I. Veillette A. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). Given the structural similarity of Vav1 and Vav2 and the involvement of Vav2 downstream of EGFR as a regulator of Rho GTPases, we explored the potential Cbl interaction with and regulation of Vav2 function as a paradigm to understanding the biological impact of Cbl-mediated negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathways in a physiologically relevant setting. Rabbit anti-Vav2 peptide antisera were generated against Vav2 peptide sequence 208–222 (QETEAKYYRTLEDIE) through a commercial vendor (Animal Pharma Inc., Yakima, WA). Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR (clone 528; ATCC) and E-cadherin (clone E4.6; gift of Drs. Michael Brenner and Jonathan Higgins, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) were purified from mouse hybridoma supernatants using Protein-G columns. Purified anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) antibody 4G10 was a gift from Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland). The following antibodies were commercially obtained: monoclonal anti-RhoA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Rac1 from Cytoskeleton; anti-β-actin from Sigma; polyclonal anti-Cdc42 from Cell Signaling; and anti-Cbl, anti-Cbl-b, and anti-phospho-Vav2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin was from Invitrogen. The shRNA target sequences in genes of interest were identified using the on-line S-fold software, blasted against the NCBI database to minimize off-target possibilities, and cloned (together with scrambled sequences as controls) into pSuper.retro retroviral vector (OligoEngine Inc.). The sequences of shRNAs are as follows: AAGAGCATCTCCACCTCTA (control), GAAAGCCTGCCACGATAAA (Vav2 #1), GAAGATGACAAGAGGAACT (Vav2 #2), GGTTGTGTCAGAACCCAAA (Cbl #2), GGCGAAACCTAACCAAACT (Cbl #4), and GACCATACCTCATAACAAG (Cbl-b). A murine cDNA encoding Vav2 was cloned into lentiviral vector pLenti6/V5-Dest (Invitrogen). The C-terminally YFP-tagged Vav2 (obtained from the Signaling Consortium) was subcloned into retroviral vector pRevTRE (Invitrogen) through an engineered SalI site. The wild type and mutant Cbl expression plasmids in pMSCV-pac retroviral vector (BD Biosciences) have been described previously (13Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A.

Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The MCF10A cell lines stably expressing pSuper.retro-driven shRNAs or lentivirus-driven murine Vav2 were generated using standard viral packaging and infection strategies. The transduced cells were selected and maintained in DFCI-1 medium supplemented with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml), G418 (500 μg/ml), or hygromycin (100 μg/ml) antibiotics and used as polyclonal cell lines. The 16A5-Tet-On-YFP-Vav2-Y172F cell line has been described previously (49Duan L. Chen G. Virmani S. Ying G. Raja S.M. Chung B.M. Rainey M.A. Dimri M. Ortega-Cava C.F. Zhao X. Clubb R.J. Tu C.

IPs from the indicated amounts of cell lysate protein were performed using protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as an immunosorbent. For immunodepletion studies, cell lysates were serially incubated (for 2–3 rounds) with aliquots of specific or control Abs together with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads, and the resulting immunodepleted or mock-depleted (control) supernatants were used for further IPs. For analyses of ubiquitinylation, cell lysates were prepared in the RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm sodium chloride) with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm PMSF. For co-IPs, the lysis buffer contained 1% Triton X-100 as a detergent, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors, as in the RIPA lysis buffer. GTP-bound forms of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 were pulled down using bacterially expressed, purified GST-RBD (Rho-binding domain of rhotekin; interacts with GTP-bound RhoA) or GST-PBD (p21-binding domain of PAK; interacts with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42) respectively, as described previously (49Duan L. Chen G. Virmani S. Ying G. Raja S.M. Chung B.M. Rainey M.A. Dimri M. Ortega-Cava C.F. Zhao X. Clubb R.J. Tu C. Reddi A.L. Naramura M. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1555-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in the RIPA buffer. The cell lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 10 min and clarified of insoluble material by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Equal aliquots of lysate proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with 20–30 μg of purified GST-RBD or GST-PBD fusion proteins at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with the wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm PMSF). Bound RhoA, Rac, or Cdc42 proteins were detected using Western blotting. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with anti-E-cadherin antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary Abs together with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin to stain actin. The stained cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Nikon C1 or Zeiss confocal LSM 510) under ×400 or ×600 magnifications. 3 × 103 cells were grown on 20 × 20-mm glass coverslips in DFCI-1 medium without EGF for 4 days to allow the formation of discrete cell colonies. The cells were stimulated with 3 ng/ml EGF for 12 h before fixation, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin. The cells were then scanned using confocal microscopy at the subapical plane to acquire cell junctional F-actin images. To quantify junctional F-actin distribution and reorganization, the segmented histogram (Metamorph software) was used to subgroup the F-actin staining according to fluorescence intensity. Using a typical EGF-starved colony and a typical EGF-stimulated cell colony in the control cell line as standards to configure the Bin fluorescence intensity range (see the example in Fig. 4C), the F-actin populations were subgrouped as circumferential, peri-junctional, and diffuse. The Bin area of each group was measured, and the percentage Bin area of the circumferential F-actin versus the total F-actin was calculated and graphed. Membrane and cytosolic fractions, used for the assessment of phosphorylated Vav2 recruitment to membranes, were prepared with commercial kits (Thermo Fisher Product 78840 or Q-proteome catalog no. 37502), using manufacturers' protocols. The kits were supplemented with sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) as a phosphatase inhibitor. Cells were plated in 96-well plates (2000 cells/well) at day 0 and cultured in DFCI-1 medium without or with EGF (12.5 ng/ml) from day 1. MTT dye incorporation was assessed from day 2 to day 5 using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). The MTT absorbance values were acquired with a microplate reader at 570 nm wavelength. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to determine the statistical significance of differences among experimental groups. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance between control and experimental groups. When immortal nontumorigenic human MEC lines 16A5 and MCF10A are grown as monolayer cultures in DFCI-1 medium without EGF, they form relatively tight colonies; two-color confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of polymerized actin and E-cadherin at the subapical plane revealed typical circumferential actin cables and continuous E-cadherin staining at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1, A and B, upper panels), indicating that these cells form AJs. However, upon EGF stimulation, the cells became flattened and less tightly attached to each other; the circumferential actin cables were disrupted and reorganized into more widely distributed shorter actin bundles flanking the cell-cell junctions, and E-cadherin staining showed an interrupted pattern (Fig. 1, A and B, lower panels); the latter results indicate that signaling via the EGFR induces junctional actin cytoskeleton reorganization and disruption of AJs. We therefore used this system to evaluate the impact of perturbing Cbl protein expression. Knockdown (KD) of Cbl expression in MCF10A MEC line using either of two distinct shRNAs (shRNAs 2 and 4) led to a nearly complete loss of Cbl expression (Fig. 2A); EGFR degradation in response to EGF stimulation was slightly delayed in both Cbl KD cell lines compared with a control shRNA-expressing cell line (Fig. 2A). Because Western blots for Cbl-b revealed that this protein is also expressed in MECs, and Cbl-b is also known to regulate EGFR degradation (14Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M. Lipkowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27677-27684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we further generated MCF10A cells with stable KD of both Cbl and Cbl-b. Analysis of these cells shows a nearly complete lack of Cbl expression and an over 80% Cbl-b knockdown (Fig. 2B). EGF-induced EGFR ubiquitinylation was markedly reduced (Fig. 2C), and EGFR degradation was substantially delayed in Cbl and Cbl-b double-KD MCF10A cells (Fig. 2D). Notably, EGF stimulation of MCF10A-Cbl/Cbl-b KD cells induced a markedly more robust reorganization of junctional actin cytoskeleton and cell scattering with a nearly complete loss of AJ staining (anti-E-cadherin) in a majority of cells compared with control KD cells (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, compared with control KD cells, the MCF10A-Cbl/Cbl-b KD cells exhibited markedly accelerated EGF-dependent cell migration in wound healing as well as Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 2, F and G). Similar results were observed in 16A5 MECs with stable knockdown of Cbl plus Cbl-b (data not shown). Notably, however, Cbl plus Cbl-b KD did not significantly affect the EGF-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 2H) suggesting that Cbl proteins may more selectively attenuate EGFR-mediated disruption of cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. Notably, E-cadherin protein level was not changed by EGF stimulation or by Cbl plus Cbl-b knockdown in MCF10A cells (data not shown), indicating that EGF-induced disruption of AJs in MECs is not through down-regulation of E-cadherin. Studies in model cell systems have shown that Vav2 functions as a Rho family GEF and an actin cytoskeleton organizer downstream of EGFR (44Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 46Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We found that Vav2 is the predominant or only detectable Vav family protein in a number of MECs and breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). EGF stimulation of both MEC lines MCF10A and 16A5 resulted in rapid Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation that waned over time (Fig. 3A). In addition, phosphorylated EGFR co-immunoprecipitated with Vav2 (Fig. 3A), and conversely, Vav2 was detected in anti-EGFR IPs (Fig. 3B). As stimulation of MECs with EGF induced the remodeling of junctional actin, we hypothesized a role for Vav2 in the activation of Rho GTPases and remodeling of actin structures at cell-cell junctions. To test whether Vav2 is recruited to cell-cell junctions, we stably expressed a YFP-tagged Vav2 protein in MCF10A cells and examined its co-localization with EGFR, E-cadherin, or F-actin, using confocal imaging. Without EGF stimulation, YFP-Vav2 nearly exclusively localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). Following EGF stimulation, YFP-Vav2 localized to cell-cell junctions where it co-localized with EGFR (Fig. 3C), E-cadherin (Fig. 3D), and junctional F-actin (Fig. 3D). EGFR was expectedly internalized into endosomal vesicles within a few minutes of EGF stimulation (Fig. 3C); some Vav2-YFP co-localized with internalized EGFR, whereas a significant fraction remained at cell-cell junctions after the EGFR internalization (Fig. 3C).

Signaling through the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor by locally produced IGF2 defines one such pathway that is critical for normal muscle growth and for regeneration after injury. IGF2 gene and protein expression are induced as early events in muscle differentiation, but the responsible molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we characterize a distal DNA element within the imprinted mouse Igf2-H19 locus with properties of a muscle transcriptional enhancer. We find that this region undergoes a transition to open chromatin during differentiation, whereas adjacent chromatin remains closed, and that it interacts in differentiating muscle nuclei but not in mesenchymal precursor cells with the Igf2 gene found more than 100 kb away, suggesting that chromatin looping or sliding to bring the enhancer in proximity to Igf2 promoters is also an early event in muscle differentiation. Because this element directly stimulates the transcriptional activity of an Igf2 promoter-reporter gene in differentiating myoblasts, our results indicate that we have identified a bona fide distal transcriptional enhancer that supports Igf2 gene activation in skeletal muscle cells. Because this DNA element is conserved in the human IGF2-H19 locus, our results further suggest that its muscle enhancer function also is conserved among different mammalian species.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and gene expression is regulated by three adjacent promoters, termed P1–P3, each with its own unique leader exon, whereas exons 4–6 encode the IGF2 precursor protein (14Rotwein P. Hall L.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The human IGF2 gene is more complicated, because it has an additional upstream promoter (15Rotwein P. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts Jr., C.T. The IGF System. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 19-35Crossref Google Scholar). In both species, IGF2 is transcribed from the paternally derived chromosome in most tissues, and H19 is expressed from the maternal chromosome by regulation through an imprinting control region (ICR) located between the two genes (13Edwards C.A.

C2 myoblasts (passages 4–10) were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 10% newborn calf serum. At confluent density, the cells were washed, and low serum differentiation medium was added (differentiation medium (DM) was DMEM with 2% horse serum). C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (catalogue number CCL226; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were incubated on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in growth medium (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. They were converted to myoblasts by infection at ∼50% of confluent density with a recombinant adenovirus for mouse MyoD (Ad-MyoD), as described (25Wilson E.M. Tureckova J. Rotwein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), followed by incubation in DM after reaching confluent density as above. Male and female C57Bl6 mice were housed at the Oregon Health & Science University Animal Care Facility on a 12-h light/dark schedule with free access to food and water and received care according to institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines. Pregnant mice were euthanized by exposure to CO2; the pups were isolated by Caesarean section and euthanized after exposure to CO2. Three-month-old male mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Freshly isolated tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized prior to RNA extraction. The Oregon Health & Science University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Recombinant adenoviruses for MyoD (Ad-MyoD) and β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) were purified on discontinuous cesium chloride gradients and titered by optical density, as described (25Wilson E.M.

Prior to infection, the viruses were diluted in DMEM plus 2% fetal calf serum, filtered through a Gelman syringe filter (0.45 μm), and then were added to cells at 37 °C for 120 min. After the addition of an equal volume of DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. The cells then were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DM. Whole cell and nuclear RNA were isolated as described (21Wilson E.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and quality assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl, with either oligo(dT) primers (for total RNA) or random hexamers (for nuclear RNA), and PCR was performed with 0.1 μl of cDNA and the primer pairs in Table 1. The linear range of product amplification was established in pilot studies for each primer pair, and the cycle number that reflected the approximate midpoint was used in final experiments. This varied from 20 to 27 cycles for total RNA and from 25 to 30 cycles for nuclear RNA.

Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, Igf2 P3 was inserted in plasmid pGL3 (Promega). DNA fragments pictured in Fig. 2 were isolated from mouse genomic DNA after PCR by standard methods, except for 4.3-kb element D, which was obtained from Dr. Jie Chen (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). Region 1, CS6, and CS9 were cloned via 5′ SalI and 3′ XbaI linkers into the corresponding sites in the Igf2 P3 pGL3 plasmid (see supplemental Table S1 for details). All of the subfragments were generated by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR and were purified after preparative agarose gel electrophoresis by ion exchange chromatography (Qiaex II gel extraction kit; Qiagen) and subcloned into Igf2 promoter-luciferase plasmids. All of the DNA manipulations were confirmed by sequencing at the Oregon Health & Science University DNA Services Core. C2 and C3H 10T1/2 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated 12-well plates and were transfected at 50 or 25% of confluent density, respectively, with individual Igf2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids or with mouse myogenin promoter-luciferase (0.4 μg of plasmid DNA/well for C2 cells and 0.2 μg for 10T1/2 cells). C2 cell extracts were harvested 1 day later (undifferentiated), or DM was added, and cellular proteins were isolated after an additional 48 h (differentiated). For 10T1/2 cells, 1 day after transfection the cells were infected with Ad-MyoD or adenoviruses for β-galactosidase, and after an additional day in growth medium, the extracts were harvested (undifferentiated), or DM was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before protein isolation (differentiated). Cell extracts from an individual experiment were stored at −80 °C until luciferase assay, and the results were normalized to cellular protein concentrations (21Wilson E.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29962-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed according to a protocol from LiCoR and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System using v3.0 analysis software (LiCoR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-myogenin (1:100), anti-troponin T (1:1000), and anti-Akt (1:2000). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with antibodies as described (21Wilson E.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

The primary antibodies were added in blocking buffer for 16 h at 4 °C (anti-troponin T, 1:1000 dilution; anti-myogenin, 1:50; and secondary antibodies at 1:1000). The images were captured with a Roper Scientific Cool Snap FX CCD camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse T300 fluorescent microscope using IP Labs 3.5 software. Hoechst staining was performed as described (21Wilson E.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29962-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei from 1 × 107 cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 100 μl of AluI buffer (New England Biolabs; 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.9) with 1 unit/μl of AluI.

In C3H110T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells, adenoviral-mediated expression of the myogenic transcription factor, MyoD, can potently convert these uncommitted progenitors to a myoblast fate (31Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), with rapid and robust up-regulation of muscle genes and proteins and myotube formation occurring once DM is added (19Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). Under these conditions we find that transcription of the endogenous Igf2 gene is also rapidly stimulated after the addition of DM, with kinetics of activation very similar to those of the early differentiation gene myogenin (Fig. 1D). The Igf2 gene on mouse chromosome 7 is composed of six exons and five introns, and its transcription is governed by three tandem promoters, P1–P3, each of which regulate a unique leader exon (14Rotwein P. Hall L.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In mouse fetal tissues all three promoters are active (14Rotwein P. Hall L.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To examine promoter usage in Ad-MyoD-converted muscle cells, we developed a selective RT-PCR assay in which transcripts containing individual leader exons are assessed. In mouse fetal liver all three promoters are active, as evidenced by positive RT-PCR products with primers derived from each leader exon coupled to a shared coding exon primer, whereas in Ad-MyoD-converted 10T1/2 cells, only transcripts directed by P3 accumulate during muscle differentiation (Fig. 2). In addition, in mouse gastrocnemius muscle, mRNAs directed by P3 were more abundant than transcripts controlled by P1 or P2 (Fig. 2). Although it has been established that IGF2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle in vivo (32DeVol D.L. Rotwein P. Sadow J.L. Novakofski J. Bechtel P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E89-E95PubMed Google Scholar) and that its gene expression is induced during myoblast differentiation in culture (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and Refs. 18Kou K. Rotwein P. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2019411624,"ADP-ribosylation of host cell proteins is a common mode of cell intoxication by pathogenic bacterial toxins. Antibodies induced by immunization with inactivated ADP-ribosylating toxins provide efficient protection in case of some secreted toxins, e.g., diphtheria and pertussis toxins. However, other ADP-ribosylating toxins, such as Salmonella SpvB toxin, are secreted directly from the Salmonella-containing vacuole into the cytosol of target cells via the SPI-2 encoded bacterial type III secretion system, and thus are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Small-molecule ADP-ribosylation inhibitors are fraught with potential side effects caused by inhibition of endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferases. Here, we report the development of a single-domain antibody from an immunized llama that blocks the capacity of SpvB to ADP-ribosylate actin at a molar ratio of 1:1. The single-domain antibody, when expressed as an intrabody, effectively protected cells from the cytotoxic activity of a translocation-competent chimeric C2IN-C/SpvB toxin. Transfected cells were also protected against cytoskeletal alterations induced by wild-type SpvB-expressing strains of Salmonella. This proof of principle paves the way for developing new antidotes against intracellular toxins.—Al-zogaray, V., Danquah, W., Aguirre, A., Urrutia, M., Berguer, P., García Vescovi, E., Haag, F., Koch-Nolte, F., Goldbaum, F.

The catalytic core of rod PDE6 is a unique heterodimer of PDE6A and PDE6B catalytic subunits. The functional significance of rod PDE6 heterodimerization and conserved differences between PDE6AB and cone PDE6C and the individual properties of PDE6A and PDE6B are unknown. To address these outstanding questions, we expressed chimeric homodimeric enzymes, enhanced GFP (EGFP)-PDE6C-A and EGFP-PDE6C-B, containing the PDE6A and PDE6B catalytic domains, respectively, in transgenic Xenopus laevis. Similar to EGFP-PDE6C, EGFP-PDE6C-A and EGFP-PDE6C-B were targeted to the rod outer segments and concentrated at the disc rims. PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B were isolated following selective immunoprecipitation of the EGFP fusion proteins.

Likewise, the K(i) values for PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B inhibition by the cone- and rod-specific PDE6 γ-subunits (Pγ) were comparable. Recombinant cone transducin-α (Gα(t2)) and native rod Gα(t1) fully and potently activated PDE6C, PDE6C-A, and PDE6C-B. In contrast, the half-maximal activation of bovine rod PDE6 required markedly higher concentrations of Gα(t2) or Gα(t1). Our results suggest that PDE6A and PDE6B are enzymatically equivalent. Furthermore, PDE6A and PDE6B are similar to PDE6C with respect to catalytic properties and the interaction with Pγ but differ in the interaction with transducin. This study significantly limits the range of mechanisms by which conserved differences between PDE6A, PDE6B, and PDE6C may contribute to remarkable differences in rod and cone physiology."

However, the correlation between the duration and magnitude of Hsp90 inhibition and the downstream effects on client protein degradation and cancer cell growth inhibition has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate the relationship between Hsp90 inhibition and cellular effects, we developed a method that measures drug occupancy on Hsp90 after treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 in living cells and in tumor xenografts. In cells, we find the level of Hsp90 occupancy to be directly correlated with cell growth inhibition. At the molecular level, the relationship between Hsp90 occupancy and Hsp90 client protein degradation was examined for different client proteins. For sensitive Hsp90 clients (e.g. HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), client protein levels directly mirror Hsp90 occupancy at all time points after IPI-504 administration. For insensitive client proteins, we find that protein abundance matches Hsp90 occupancy only after prolonged incubation with drug. Additionally, we investigate the correlation between plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), tumor PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) (client protein degradation), tumor growth inhibition, and Hsp90 occupancy in a xenograft model of human cancer. Our results indicate Hsp90 occupancy to be a better predictor of PD than either plasma PK or tumor PK. In the nonsmall cell lung cancer xenograft model studied, a linear correlation between Hsp90 occupancy and tumor growth inhibition was found. This novel binding assay was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo and could be used as a pharmacodynamic readout in the clinic.

The induction of Hsp70 in normal peripheral blood leukocytes is the typical measurement of pharmacological response to Hsp90 inhibition in patients treated with Hsp90 inhibitors. Although used routinely, there is no clear correlation between the extent of Hsp70 induction in normal cells and the pharmacological effect in tumor tissue (23Goetz M.P. Toft D. Reid J. Ames M.

It has been hypothesized that the Hsp90 complex in cancer cells binds more tightly to Hsp90 inhibitors than the Hsp90 complex in normal cells (26Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J. Zhang L. Boehm M.F. Fritz L.C. Burrows F.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). If correct, this would question the validity of measuring the induction of Hsp70 in normal cells (peripheral blood leukocytes) as a PD marker in the clinic. Herein, we report the development of a method that quantitatively measures drug binding to Hsp90 in cancer cells. At 4 °C, a stable Hsp90·ansamycin complex is trapped due to the slow dissociation of bound 17-AAG or IPI-504 (half-life ∼ 24 h). Due to a large differential between the slow off-rate and relatively fast on-rate of IPI-504, Hsp90 occupancy can be determined by titrating unoccupied binding sites with radioactive ligand in combination with measuring amounts of total Hsp90 (Fig. 1). This occupancy assay was tested using purified Hsp90 and then applied to cancer cell lines and to a tumor xenograft. HeLa-purified Hsp90 and recombinant human Hsp90α and Hsp90β were from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-Hsp90α antibody (clone 68) was from BD Biosciences; anti-Hsp90β antibody (clone H-114) and anti-HER2 (C-18) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-EGFR, Akt (protein kinase B), and cRaf antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). HRP-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. Zeba desalting size exclusion spin columns and plates were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). 17-AAG and IPI-504 were synthesized at Infinity Pharmaceuticals (7Ge J. Normant E. Porter J.R. Ali J.A. Dembski M.S. Gao Y. Georges A.T. Grenier L. Pak R.H. Patterson J. Sydor J.R. Tibbitts T.T. Tong J.K. Adams J. Palombella V.J. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). [3H]17-AAG (25 Ci/mmol, ≥98% pure by HPLC) was custom synthesized by Ambios Labs (Newington, CT). [3H]17-AAG working stock was 444 μm with a specific activity of 2.2 Ci/mmol. Microscint 40 scintillation fluid from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell lines NCI-H1650, NCI-H1975, SK-BR-3, SKOV-3, and RS4;11 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml penicillin. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For dissociation off-rate determinations, a [3H]17-AAG·Hsp90 complex was formed by incubating radiolabeled 17-AAG (200 nm) with purified Hsp90 (100 nm) or SK-BR-3 lysates (∼100 nm Hsp90 as determined by quantitative immunoblotting) at 4 °C overnight in Hsp90 binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.5 mg/ml bovine gamma globulin, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine Hydrochloride is added to Hsp90 binding buffer to maintain 17-AAG in its hydroquinone form. Unbound drug was removed by passing a 110-μl sample volume over two Hsp90 buffer-equilibrated Zeba size exclusion columns (bed volume, 500 μl) and spinning for 1 min at 1500 × g. Addition of 10 μm unlabeled 17-AAG to the pooled exclusion volume, either at 4 or 37 °C initiated the dissociation time course. Aliquots (110 μl) were removed at different time points and subsequently passed over a new set of spin columns to remove dissociated [3H]17-AAG. The column exclusion volume (80 μl) was mixed with 800 μl of scintillation fluid and measured on a Microbeta Plus liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The time-dependent loss of radioactive counts were fit to a monoexponential decay function yielding the dissociation rate of 17-AAG measured at both 4 and 37 °C. The net association rate of 10 μm 17-AAG at 4 °C was determined by incubating [3H]17-AAG with 100 nm purified Hsp90 protein or cancer cell lysate with an equivalent amount of Hsp90. Aliquots (110 μl) were removed over time, and the extent of [3H]17-AAG binding was measured by a time-dependent increase of radioactive counts (cpm) in an 80-μl size exclusion column flow-through. The specific binding data were fit to a single exponential equation: Y = Ymax (1 − e−kob·t), with t½ calculated by t½ = 0.693/kobs. Samples with various levels of Hsp90 occupancy were generated by incubating 100 nm Hsp90β with increasing concentrations of cold 17-AAG (0.4–400 nm) in Hsp90 binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. Binding reactions (110 μl) were passed over prechilled size exclusion columns to remove unbound 17-AAG followed by addition of 2.5 μl [3H]17-AAG (10 μm final) to the eluate. Samples were incubated for 2 h on ice. The samples again were passed over size exclusion columns and flow-through radioactive counts in 80 μl converted to mol of [3H]17-AAG and plotted against added unlabeled 17-AAG. Zeba column flow-through background counts from 10 μm [3H]17-AAG mixed with Hsp90 binding buffer were subtracted from Hsp90 bound counts. H1650, H1975, SKOV-3, and RS4;11 cells were seeded (1 × 105 − 5 × 105 cells per well) and grown to 95% confluency in six-well plates (Costar). Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of IPI-504 (0.01–10 μm) for 6 or 24 h at 37 °C, washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed in 250 μl Hsp90 binding buffer by three repetitions of freeze/thaw. Whole snap frozen tumors from IPI-504 dosed mice were pulverized to powder with 200 strokes/min for 2 min in a Geno/grinder 2000. Approximately 10 mg of powder were homogenized on ice for 1–2 min with 300 μl of chilled Hsp90 binding buffer and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Supernatants (110 μl) obtained from cell lysates or tumor homogenates were quickly passed over prechilled size exclusion columns to remove any unbound cold 17-AAG/IPI-504. [3H]17-AAG working stock in 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was added to the eluant (2.5 μl; final concentration, 10 μm) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to ensure complete binding to unoccupied Hsp90 sites, and the resulting mixture was subsequently passed over size exclusion columns to remove unbound radiolabeled 17-AAG. Flow-through counts (80 μl) were measured on a Microbeta Plus liquid scintillation counter. Radioactive counts were converted to mol of bound [3H]17-AAG. Total Hsp90 protein in each sample was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using human recombinant Hsp90α and Hsp90β as standards and validated by stoichiometric titration with [3H]17-AAG. Hsp90 (occupancy) was calculated using the following equation. %Hsp90 occupancy=(1-[bould[ 3H]-17-AAG[mol]total Hsp90[mol]])×100(Eq. 1) Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates incubated for 24 h and subsequently incubated with increasing concentrations of IPI-504 for 72 h. Viability studies were performed using Cell Titer Glow (Promega, Madison, WI). The data were normalized with respect to dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control to generate growth inhibition GI50 values. For Hsp90 client protein quantitation, cells were treated for 6 or 24 h with IPI-504 and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Total protein was determined by BCA method (Pierce) and resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris). Immunodetection of proteins transferred to PDVF membranes was performed with enhanced chemiluminescent Western blot reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were probed with antibodies to detect the protein of interest. Image analysis and band quantitation normalized to actin loading control were performed with the Bio-Rad Versa Doc system. 6-to-8-week-old male homozygous athymic nude (nu−/nu−) mice (Taconic Farms, Hudson, NY) were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Xenografts were generated by injecting 1 × 107 H1650 cells into the right flank of 40 mice. Varying doses of IPI-504 or vehicle were administered by intraperitoneal injection twice per week (n = 10 per arm), and tumor xenograft size was measured twice weekly with calipers. Results are presented as means and S.E. For PD studies, two separate groups of animals were treated with IPI-504. One group of mice (n = 2) were treated i.p. with vehicle, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg IPI-504 and sacrificed 2 h post dose. The other group (n = 3) was treated with a single i.v. dose of IPI-504 (100 mg/kg) and sacrificed at various time points post dose, blood plasma was collected, and tumors were removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Concentrations of IPI-504, 17-AAG, and its metabolite 17-(amino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AG) were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis that was developed and validated (27Sydor J.R. Normant E.

Tumor samples were homogenized in ice-cold nitrogen sparged 1:1 solution of acetonitrile: 150 mm citrate, 0.2% (w/v) EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) ascorbate, pH 3, filtered using a 0.45-μm low binding hydrophilic solvinert plate and diluted 1:1 with ice-cold nitrogen sparged 75 mm citrate, 0.1% (w/v) EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) ascorbate, pH 3, containing 25 ng/ml deuterated 17-AAG as internal standard. 17-AAG has been shown to rapidly dissociate from Hsp90 at 37 °C (7Ge J. Normant E. Porter J.R. Ali J.A. Dembski M.S. Gao Y. Georges A.T. Grenier L. Pak R.H. Patterson J. Sydor J.R. Tibbitts T.T. Tong J.K. Adams J. Palombella V.J. J. Med.

Here, we compare the off-rate of 17-AAG from Hsp90 at 4 and 37 °C. 17-AAG dissociates quickly from purified Hsp90 at 37 °C with a koff = 0.087 min−1, corresponding to a half-life of 8 min (Fig. 2A), consistent with values reported by Ge et al. (7Ge J. Normant E. Porter J.R. Ali J.A. Dembski M.S. Gao Y. Georges A.T. Grenier L. Pak R.H. Patterson J. Sydor J.R. Tibbitts T.T. Tong J.K. Adams J. Palombella V.J. J. Med.

Biochem. 2003; 317: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Importantly, at 4 °C the dissociation time was considerably longer with a koff = 0.024 h−1, corresponding to a t½ of 28 h (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the dissociation rate of 17-AAG from Hsp90 in SK-BR-3 lysates at 4 °C was slow, with a half-life of 36 h (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Gooljarsingh et al. (29Gooljarsingh L.T. Fernandes C. Yan K. Zhang H. Grooms M. Johanson K. Sinnamon R.H. Kirkpatrick R.B. Kerrigan J. Lewis T. Arnone M. King A.J. Lai Z. Copeland R.A. Tummino P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7625-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported a t½ dissociation rate of 4.5 h for geldanamycin at ambient temperature. Taken together, these results indicate that the rate of 17-AAG-Hsp90 dissociation is highly dependent on temperature and follows an Arrhenius type behavior. The association of 17-AAG is a second order process with the net rate dependent on 17-AAG concentration. The mechanism of binding to Hsp90 has been studied in some detail showing 17-AAG binds to Hsp90 via a two-step binding model with initial binding followed by a time-dependent conformational change in the protein that results in a tighter Hsp90·17-AAG complex (29Gooljarsingh L.T. Fernandes C. Yan K. Zhang H. Grooms M. Johanson K. Sinnamon R.H. Kirkpatrick R.B. Kerrigan J. Lewis T. Arnone M. King A.J. Lai Z. Copeland R.A. Tummino P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7625-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For our purposes, we determined the net rate of association of 10 μm 17-AAG utilizing Hsp90 from different sources. Association rates were determined for Hsp90 purified from Hela cells and Hsp90 in an extract from SK-BR-3 cells. Protein (100 nm Hsp90) or lysate (∼100 nm Hsp90) was incubated with a fixed concentration of [3H]17-AAG (10 μm) and binding measured by the time-dependent increase in protein bound [3H]17-AAG found in the column flow-through. A 100-fold excess of [3H]17-AAG was used to maximize the rate of association relative to the rate of dissociation. At 10 μm 17-AAG, association to Hsp90 followed a single exponential phase from which a kobs was calculated with a corresponding t½. At 4 °C, 17-AAG bound to purified Hsp90 with an association t½ of 6 min (Fig. 3A) and to SK-BR-3 lysate with an association t½ of 19 min (Fig. 3B). Drug binding to purified Hsp90 or to Hsp90 in cell lysates reached equilibrium by 40 and 130 min at 4 °C, respectively (Fig. 3). Because the rate of dissociation is ∼100-fold slower than the rate of association of 10 μm 17-AAG at 4 °C, the drug bound state of Hsp90 pretreated with 17-AAG can be trapped for an extended period of time. Therefore, it should be possible to use titration with radiolabeled 17-AAG to determine the number of unoccupied binding sites on Hsp90 and, in combination with quantitative immunoblotting to measure total Hsp90, derive a fractional drug occupancy for Hsp90. To obtain proof of principle that unoccupied binding sites on Hsp90 can be titrated using radioactively labeled 17-AAG, various levels of occupancy were created by preincubating purified Hsp90 with increasing concentrations of unlabeled 17-AAG to equilibrium. After unbound 17-AAG was removed, free Hsp90 sites were titrated with radiolabeled 17-AAG at 4 °C under reducing conditions to maintain 17-AAG in its tight binding dihydroquinone form (8Douglas M. Lim A.R. Porter J.R. West K. Pink M.M. Ge J. Wylie A.A. Tibbits T.T. Biggs K. Curtis M. Palombella V.J. Adams J. Fritz C.C. Normant E. Mol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10006-10015Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Preincubation with an excess of unlabeled 17-AAG resulted in an absence of labeled 17-AAG binding, whereas preincubation with little or no 17-AAG allowed virtually all of the Hsp90 present to be titrated with labeled 17-AAG (Fig. 4). 17-AAG titration curves were similar for both Hsp90 isoforms (α and β data not shown), yielding ∼50% Hsp90 occupancy with 42 nm 17-AAG when 100 nm Hsp90 protein was used as the input (Fig. 4). When assaying drug-free Hsp90, it is possible to titrate ∼80% of the total Hsp90 used in the experiment. This is presumably due to a loss of ∼20% Hsp90 after two passes through the size exclusion spin columns used to separate bound from free drug in the experiment. These results imply that a percent occupancy value for Hsp90 can be experimentally determined using open binding site titration at 4 °C combined with quantitative measurement of total Hsp90 protein. To determine whether Hsp90 occupancy can be measured in cancer cells lines, an increasing concentration of IPI-504 was added to the nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line (NSCLC) H1650 for 6 h in vitro. Titration of the unoccupied Hsp90 binding sites in lysates was done as described above, and total Hsp90 was determined by quantitative immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). As a single antibody that could reliably quantify both Hsp90 isoforms (α and β) could not be found, the levels of Hsp90α and β protein were measured separately and summed (Fig. 5B). A value for percent occupancy was derived by dividing the number of open binding sites by the number of Hsp90 molecules present. Occupancy values were produced for a range of concentrations of IPI-504 used to preincubate the cells (Fig. 5B). An occupancy curve was generated, yielding an EC50 of 30 nm (Fig. 5C). In the experimental setup, free 17-AAG was separated from bound using size exclusion spin columns, and tightly bound 17-AAG to protein was equated to 17-AAG bound to Hsp90. To confirm this assumption, cells were incubated with a large excess of radiolabeled 17-AAG, and protein bound counts were plotted versus concentration. A saturable binding curve was obtained with the maximum binding level approaching the total amount of Hsp90 present as measured by quantitative immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. S1). This indicates that the majority of protein bound by 17-AAG is indeed Hsp90. This is in agreement with our observation that other cellular proteins reported to bind to 17-AAG either display a lower affinity for the drug and/or are expressed at levels at least 10x lower than Hsp90α/β and thus do not significantly contribute to drug binding in our experiments. We next applied this method to compare compound occupancy on Hsp90 with the cytotoxic effects of IPI-504 in living cancer cells. H1650, H1975, SKOV-3, and RS4;11 cancer cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of IPI-504 for 6 h, and drug occupancy was determined. After 72 h, cell growth inhibition was measured at these concentrations. Drug occupancy (EC50 = 30, 44, 74, and 644 nm for H1650, SKOV-3, H1975, and RS4;11, respectively) correlated well with the cell growth inhibitory activity of IPI-504 (GI50 = 37, 52, 51, and 2000 nm, respectively (Table 1)), indicating that the sensitivity of cells to IPI-504 is linked to the ability of IPI-504 to occupy Hsp90 within cells. These results also indicate that the relative resistance of RS4;11 cells to IPI-504 is not due to an insensitivity of this cell line to Hsp90 inhibition, but rather, a higher drug concentration is required to fully occupy and thereby inhibit Hsp90.TABLE 1Hsp90 occupancy correlates with IPI-504 cell growth inhibition among four cancer cell linesCell lineHsp90 occupancy (EC50)Cell growth inhibition (GI50)nmnmH16503037SKOV-34452H19757451RS4;116442000 Open table in a new tab Because the initial downstream effect of Hsp90 inhibition is the degradation of client proteins, the correlation between Hsp90 occupancy and client protein degradation was studied. The NSCLC cell line H1650 expresses several well known Hsp90 client proteins. Some of them, like HER2 and mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (mEGFR), have been reported to be very sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, whereas others like cRaf and Akt are reported to be less sensitive (31Basso A.D.

The biodistribution of PS-oligos and their pharmacokinetics have been widely reported, but little is known about their subsequent decay inside the organism. We suggest that the enzyme responsible for nucleoside 5'-O-monophosphorothioate ((d)NMPS) metabolism could be histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint-1), a phosphoramidase belonging to the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily that is present in all forms of life. An additional, but usually ignored, activity of Hint-1 is its ability to catalyze the conversion of adenosine 5'-O-monophosphorothioate (AMPS) to 5'-O-monophosphate (AMP). By mutagenetic and biochemical studies, we defined the active site of Hint-1 and the kinetic parameters of the desulfuration reaction (P-S bond cleavage). Additionally, crystallographic analysis (resolution from 1.08 to 1.37 Å) of three engineered cysteine mutants showed the high similarity of their structures, which were not very different from the structure of WT Hint-1. Moreover, we found that not only AMPS but also other ribonucleoside and 2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphorothioates are desulfurated by Hint-1 at the following relative rates: GMPS > AMPS > dGMPS ≥ CMPS > UMPS > dAMPS ≫ dCMPS > TMPS, and during the reaction, hydrogen sulfide, which is thought to be the third gaseous mediator, was released."

We aimed to determine whether genes expressed in whole blood early following initiation of intravenous corticosteroid treatment can be associated with response.From a prospectively accrued cohort of 128 pediatric patients hospitalized for intravenous corticosteroid treatment of severe UC, we selected for analysis 20 corticosteroid responsive (hospital discharge or PUCAI ≤45 by day 5) and 20 corticosteroid resistant patients (need for second line medical therapy or colectomy, or PUCAI >45 by day 5). Total RNA was extracted from blood samples collected on day 3 of intravenous corticosteroid therapy. The eluted transcriptomes were quantified on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. The data was analysed by the local-pooled error method for discovery of differential gene expression and false discovery rate correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.A total of 41 genes differentially expressed between responders and non-responders were detected with statistical significance. Two of these genes, CEACAM1 and MMP8, possibly inhibited by methylprednisolone through IL8, were both found to be over-expressed in non-responsive patients. ABCC4 (MRP4) as a member of the multi-drug resistance superfamily was a novel candidate gene for corticosteroid resistance. The expression pattern of a cluster of 10 genes selected from the 41 significant hits were able to classify the patients with 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity.Elevated expression of several genes involved in inflammatory pathways was associated with resistance to intravenous corticosteroid therapy early in the course of treatment. Gene expression profiles may be useful to classify resistance to intravenous corticosteroids in children with severe UC and assist with clinical management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2044094412,"Type III secretion systems (TTSSs) utilized by enteropathogenic bacteria require the presence of small, acidic virulence-associated chaperones for effective host cell infection. We adopted a combination of biochemical and cellular techniques to define the chaperone binding domains (CBDs) in the translocators IpaB and IpaC associated with the chaperone IpgC from Shigella flexneri. We identified a novel CBD in IpaB and furthermore precisely mapped the boundaries of the CBDs in both translocator proteins. In IpaC a single binding domain associates with IpgC. In IpaB, we show that the binding of the newly characterized CBD is essential in maintaining the ternary arrangement of chaperone-translocator complex. This hitherto unknown function is reflected in the co-crystal structure as well, with an IpgC dimer bound to an IpaB fragment comprising both CBDs. Moreover, in the absence of this novel CBD the IpaB/IpgC complex aggregates. This dual-recognition of a domain in the protein by the chaperone in facilitating the correct chaperone-substrate organization describes a new function for the TTSS associated chaperone-substrate complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2081776498,"Integrin α1β1 is a collagen receptor that down-regulates collagen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mice lacking this receptor show increased ROS levels and exacerbated glomerular sclerosis following injury. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a multifunctional protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to injury and has been implicated in ROS-mediated injury. Cav-1 interacts with integrins, and integrin α1β1 binds/activates T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which is homologous to the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B known to dephosphorylate Cav-1. In this study, we analyzed whether phosphorylated Cav-1 (pCav-1) is a substrate of TCPTP and if integrin α1β1 is essential for promoting TCPTP-mediated Cav-1 dephosphorylation. We found that Cav-1 phosphorylation is significantly higher in cells lacking integrin α1β1 at base line and following oxidative stress. Overexpression of TCPTP leads to reduced pCav-1 levels only in cells expressing integrin α1β1. Using solid phase binding assays, we demonstrated that 1) purified Cav-1 directly interacts with TCPTP and the integrin α1 subunit, 2) pCav-1 is a substrate of TCPTP, and 3) TCPTP-mediated Cav-1 dephosphorylation is highly increased by the addition of purified integrin α1β1 or an integrin α1 cytoplasmic peptide to which TCPTP has been shown to bind. Thus, our results demonstrate that pCav-1 is a new substrate of TCPTP and that integrin α1β1 acts as a negative regulator of Cav-1 phosphorylation by activating TCPTP. This could explain the protective function of integrin α1β1 in oxidative stress-mediated damage and why integrin α1-null mice are more susceptible to fibrosis following injury."

Protein labeling with 125I was performed using IODO bead reagent (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, one IODO bead was mixed with 5 μl of Na125I (100 mCi/ml) and 95 μl of 100 mm NaPO4 and allowed to react for 5 min. Test protein (5 μg in 40 μl of 100 mm NaPO4) was then added and allowed to react with the charged bead for an additional 5 min. The labeled protein was then separated from free label using a G-25 Sepharose size exclusion column and collected as 250-μl fractions. The fractions were then counted on a gamma scintillation counter to identify the fractions containing labeled protein. The relative yield and specific activity were then calculated for the pooled fractions containing labeled protein. For cross-linking studies, capillary endothelial cells (EC) were plated on 10-cm dishes and allowed to reach 60% confluency. The cells were then placed on ice, washed with cold PBS, and then incubated in 2 ml binding buffer (DMEM supplemented with 0.1% gelatin and 20 mm HEPES) plus test 125I-labeled protein for 1.5 h on ice. Interacting proteins were cross-linked using 0.128 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 15 min on ice. The cells were rinsed with PBS three times to remove any unbound protein. The cells were scraped off the culture dishes using 500 μl of 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in PBS, collected, and pelleted at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The collected cell pellets were then resuspended in 25 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After 15 min, the lysates were again spun at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was collected in a clean tube. The cellular membrane fraction was boiled for 5 min and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography of the gels was used to determine the presence and molecular weight of putative receptor-Loop 6 complexes. To identify protein complexes, gels were stained with Sypro Ruby, and the bands were excised, subjected to tryptic digest, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perceptive STR, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The MS-Fit search program was used to search the peptide maps generated against a FASTA data base of public domain proteins. Peptide matches identified by MSFit were filtered according to their molecular weight search score, percentage of masses matched, molecular weight, and number of observations of peptides and proteins. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultured in endothelial basal medium-2 (Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD) containing the following supplements (Cambrex Bio Science); 5% FBS, 0.1% recombinant human EGF, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.04% hydrocortisone, 0.1% R insulin-like growth factor-1, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate amphotericin-B (GA-100), 0.4% human fibroblast growth factor-B, and 0.1% vascular endothelial growth factor. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Lonza) were maintained in EGM-2 medium (Lonza) containing 2% FBS. Bovine capillary endothelial cells were a kind gift from Dr. Judah Folkman and Catherine Butterfield (Children's Hospital Boston) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone) and 3 ng/ml basic FGF. Endothelial cell proliferation was measured as previously reported by us (1.Fernández C.A. Butterfield C. Jackson G. Moses M.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were plated on pregelatinized plates at a density of 2000 cells/well (96-well plates) in EGM-2 medium without serum and allowed to attach overnight. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing 2% serum with and without 50 ng/ml IGF-I and challenged with various concentrations of Loop 6. All of the samples were tested in duplicate. After 72 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 and the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, NaOH was added to each well to terminate the reaction, and cell density was determined by colorimetric analysis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and allowed to expand for 48 h until 50–60% confluency was reached. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h, after which one group was treated with an IC50 of Loop 6 (10 μg/ml). After 1 h, the cells with and without Loop 6 treatment were incubated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. The cell lysates were collected with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the MicroBCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, resolved by electrophoresis, and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose using a TransBlot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% low fat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and then probed for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies. The antibodies used in these studies included: anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-IGF-1 receptor β, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti-Akt1 (C-20; Santa Cruz), anti-MT1-MMP (Calbiochem), and anti-GAPDH (Chemicon). The blots were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of either mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Labeled proteins were detected using Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce). Cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 1:100 dilution of anti-IGF-1 receptor β antibody (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. The antibodies were then immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of cell lysis buffer before eluting with 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. RNA was collected with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) before the cDNA was synthesized using random primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen). All of the procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The primers used for PCR are: MT1-MMP, forward, 5′-CCATAGGCCAGTTCTGGCGGGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCTCGTCCACCTCTATGATGATC-3′; and GAPDH, forward, 5′-CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCTTCTGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′. Zymography was performed as previously described (16.Fernández C.A. Yan L. Louis G. Yang J. Kutok J.L. Moses M.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 5390-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 17.Roy R. Wewer U.M. Zurakowski D. Pories S.E. Moses M.A. J. Biol.

The samples were separated under nonreducing conditions on 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 60 min and then incubated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) overnight at 37 °C while shaking. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue for 1 h and then destained (10% acetic acid, 30% ethanol) for 30 min. Areas of enzymatic activity appear as clear bands, indicating substrate degradation by the enzyme, against a darkly stained background. Capillary endothelial cells were plated on chamber slides, allowed to attach overnight, and then incubated with an IC50 dose of biotin-labeled Loop 6 for another 16 h. The next day, the cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and nonspecific interactions were blocked with 5% sheep serum in PBS. The cells were then incubated with antibodies to IGF-IR, with or without anti-biotin antibodies, for 1 h. Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies, emitting at wavelengths of 495 nm for anti-mouse and 568 nm for anti-rabbit, were then used to detect IGF-IR and Loop 6, respectively. Direct co-localization was assessed by confocal microscopy. Magnetic material-coated AFM cantilevers (Type IV magnetic AC levers of nominal spring constant k = 0.083 n/m; Agilent Technologies) were cleaned via oxygen plasma for 10 min. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (300 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (900 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) were deposited via chemical vapor deposition for 2 h in a vacuum dessicator. Biotin-LC-BSA (Pierce) in sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.9, 0.5 mg/ml) was added to cleaned cantilevers, and the adsorption reaction proceeded overnight at 37 °C (18.Lee S. Mandic J. Van Vliet K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9609-9614Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19.Moy V.T. Florin E.L. Gaub H.E.

Cantilevers were rinsed with 150 mm NaCl PBS twice, followed by covalent attachment of biotin-LC-BSA to the cantilevers with 52 mm 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce) for 2 h. Biotin-BSA-functionalized cantilevers were rinsed five times with PBS. Biotin-LC-BSA cantilevers were incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin (Pierce) in PBS (1 mg/ml) for 20 min and then rinsed 10 times with PBS. Streptavidin-treated cantilevers were incubated with 150 μl of biotin-Loop 6 (30 μg/ml) for 20 min and finally cleaned 10 times with PBS. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, grown to 75% confluence on tissue culture polystyrene coverslips, were imaged in magnetic AC mode as described previously (18.Lee S. Mandic J. Van Vliet K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9609-9614Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Pico Plus AFM; Agilent Technologies/Molecular Imaging). Images were acquired for fixed cells (4% paraformaldehyde) immersed in HEPES buffer at room temperature, at line scan rates of 70 μm/s (see Fig. 4, C–E, H, and I) and 800 nm/s (see Fig. 4, B and G). Force displacement spectra were then acquired to analyze the unbinding or rupture force FR of the Loop 6-functionalized probes from the strong binding sites first observed in each functionalized force (or recognition) image; probability density functions of FR comprised ∼500 replicate spectra for experiments performed in duplicate. To demonstrate competitive inhibition of this interaction, soluble Loop 6 (100 nm) or anti-IGF-IR antibodies were added for blocking IGF-IR during imaging via a peristaltic pump, through tubing integrated into the fluid cell, and sequential functionalized force images were acquired over 60 min. Immobilization of IGF-IR to CM5 BIAsensor chip via amine coupling was conducted according to standard procedures with minor modifications (Pharmacia Biosensor AB BIAapplications Handbook; GE Healthcare). In brief, CM5 chips were activated by injecting 35 μl of N-ethyl-N′-[(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide at 5 μl/min. Recombinant human IGF-IR was coupled to the CM5 sensor chip by injecting 70 μl of IGF-IR (50 nm) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 10 μl/min. Unreacted groups were inactivated with 35 μl of ethanolamine/HCl (1 m). Typically the final level of IGF-IR immobilization was between 7,000 and 9,000 response units. All of the kinetic experiments were performed using 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% P-20 as the driving buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The binding assays were performed at 25 °C, using analyte concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 μm. TIMP-2 was injected for 180 s followed by dissociation in flow buffer for 300 s. All of the binding experiments were repeated in duplicate. For each binding curve, the response obtained using control (no ligand coupled) surfaces was subtracted. The kinetic parameters of the binding experiments were calculated using the kinetics evaluation software package, BIAvaluation 2 (Biacore Inc.). To establish tumors, SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 × 106 PC3 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS. Tumors were allowed to grow for 4 weeks until an average volume of 100 mm3. Loop 6 was delivered by constant infusion using a microstatic pump delivery system (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. PBS was used as control. The microstatic pumps containing Loop 6 or PBS alone were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice bearing PC3 tumors (n = 6/group). In all cases, tumor volumes were measured every 3 days from the start of dosing and continued for the duration of the experiments. At the end of the tenth week after tumor implantation, the tumors were excised and fixed for immunohistochemical analysis of microvessel density using anti-CD34 antibodies. To determine microvascular density, CD34-stained vessels were counted in at least six fields/section and in three or four sections of each of three tumors/group. Given that T2C inhibits capillary endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (1.Fernández C.A. Butterfield C. Jackson G. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40989-40995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we first examined whether T2C could bind the endothelial cell surface. 125I-Labeled T2C was cross-linked to the EC surface, and complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. 125I-T2C bound to the capillary endothelial cell surface and analysis of the cross-linked complexes by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of at least four distinct complexes (Fig. 1A). These associations are specific for T2C in that 100-fold excess cold T2C completely competed away the binding of 125I-T2C. Because the anti-angiogenic activity of T2C is housed within the Loop 6 domain (1.Fernández C.A. Butterfield C. Jackson G. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40989-40995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we were interested in identifying putative cell surface receptors of T2C that specifically bound via Loop 6. The amino acid composition of Loop 6 is shown in schematic format in Fig. 1B. Because Loop 6 consists of 24 amino acids, traditional binding experiments were not always possible in that either no label could be incorporated or only one label/molecule would be incorporated. For example, although we were successful in iodinating Loop 6, only one 125I label/molecule could be incorporated, resulting in only a very weak signal on autoradiography, making visualization of Loop 6 complexes very difficult. Therefore, to determine whether Loop 6 binds to the EC surface, Loop 6 was synthesized with an N-terminal biotin label, and streptavidin affinity was used to immunoprecipitate complexes for visualization and ultimately for identification of Loop 6 complexes. For these experiments, capillary endothelial cells were incubated with biotin-Loop 6, and interacting proteins were cross-linked as was done with 125I-T2C. Affinity-purified complexes of biotin-Loop 6 and interacting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Sypro Ruby staining (Fig. 1C). Lane 1 of Fig. 1C shows the Sypro Ruby staining of whole cell lysates as starting material. Lane 2 shows the streptavidin column wash, and lane 3 shows the streptavidin-purified Loop 6 complexes. Lane 4 represents the eluate from a parallel streptavidin purification where biotin-Loop 6 was omitted at the cross-linking step. Protein bands consistent with those observed using 125I-T2C were also detected when biotin-Loop 6 was cross-linked to the cell surface, suggesting that the observed T2C interactions are mediated by Loop 6 itself. To determine the identity of the putative cell surface receptors of Loop 6, protein bands (Fig. 1C, lane 3) were excised from the Sypro Ruby-stained gel, subjected to tryptic digest, and analyzed by tandem MS. Ten peptides matching the α subunit of IGF-IR and covering 10% of the protein were identified from the analysis of the protein band of ∼180 kDa (Fig. 1D). To confirm this interaction, a series of co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed using streptavidin affinity to capture the biotin-Loop 6-interacting proteins from endothelial cell lysates. Controls consisted of lysates containing Loop 6-cross-linked complexes that were incubated with streptavidin-free beads, and lysates were incubated with streptavidin-coated beads where biotin-Loop 6 was omitted. Streptavidin-immunoprecipitated complexes of Loop 6 and IGF-IR were identified using monospecific anti-IGF-IR antibodies (Fig. 1E, lane 2); no IGF-IR was detected in samples for which streptavidin functionalization of the beads was omitted or to which biotin-Loop 6 was not added (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In addition, bands of similar molecular weight to those co-immunoprecipitated in lane 2 were detected with anti-IGF-IR antibodies when anti-IGF-IR antibodies were instead used to immunoprecipitate IGF-IR-containing complexes (Fig. 1E, lane 1). Although other proteins such as vimentin and GRB10 were identified from excised bands of ∼50 and 140 kDa, respectively, immunoprecipitation studies did not confirm any direct interaction with Loop 6 (data not shown). To demonstrate direct binding of Loop 6 to IGF-IR, we labeled Loop 6 with 125I and allowed it to bind to purified recombinant IGF-IR and cross-linked them in vitro. Labeling of Loop 6 was accomplished using the Bolton-Hunter reaction to incorporate one label at the N terminus of the peptide. Cross-linking was achieved through the only available Lys residue. Despite only having one label per molecule and one residue available for cross-linking, in this experiment using purified proteins, the concentrations of both Loop 6 and IGF-IR could be kept high such that one label was enough to visualize complex formation between 125I-Loop 6 and IGF-IR. Complex formation with IGF-IR was assessed by the presence of radioactive activity at ∼180 kDa (Fig. 2A, second lane). The association of Loop 6 with the receptor was completely inhibited when 100-fold molar excess unlabeled Loop 6 was used to compete for binding (Fig. 2B, second lane). In contrast, a peptide representing Loop 6 of TIMP-4, used as a control, failed to block the binding of 125I-Loop 6 to IGF-IR, suggesting that the interaction is not common to all TIMPs (Fig. 2B). In addition, 125I-Loop 6 failed to bind α3β1, a cell surface protein previously shown to bind intact TIMP-2 (supplemental Fig. S1) and used here as a control. Given the limitation of one radiolabel/molecule, kinetic analyses could not be performed on Loop 6 by itself. Therefore, to characterize the biomolecular interaction of IGF-IR with Loop 6 and to determine whether Loop 6 binds IGF-IR within the context of TIMP-2, a series of surface plasmon resonance experiments were conducted using the Biacore™ biosensor system. IGF-IR was immobilized by amine coupling onto a CM5 chip, and affinity of TIMP-2 was determined. The data points for each concentration were derived from the average of at least two injections, and analyses were repeated at least twice for each analyte. The sensorgram for the interaction of TIMP-2 with IGF-IR is shown in Fig. 3. Affinity was determined using steady-state kinetics. The calculated affinity constant for IGF-IR/TIMP-2 binding (ligand concentration range, 0–50 μm) was 328 μm (χ2 = 0.02) (Fig. 3, inset). These experiments suggest that Loop 6 binds IGF-IR within the context of intact TIMP-2. To determine whether Loop 6 interacts with IGF-IR at the cell surface, the co-localization of IGF-IR and Loop 6 was investigated using endothelial cells treated with Loop 6. Because no TIMP-2 antibodies exist that are specific to the Loop 6 epitope, biotin-Loop 6 was used in these experiments. Capillary endothelial cells were incubated with biotin-Loop 6 overnight, then fixed, and probed with anti-IGF-IR antibodies. Anti-biotin antibodies were used to localize Loop 6. Direct co-localization was assessed via confocal microscopy. Although some Loop 6 appeared internalized, Loop 6 also co-localized with IGF-IR at the cell surface (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Loop 6 failed to co-localize with GRB10, which was used as a control, suggesting that GRB10 does not directly interact with Loop 6 (Fig. 4A). The EC surface interaction of Loop 6 and IGF-IR was further characterized using functionalized force imaging. This approach enables visualization of single protein molecules using AFM to detect binding events between a ligand-functionalized, cantilevered probe and the cell surface (18.Lee S. Mandic J.

It is vitally important to determine which variant best represents the type of fibril that accumulates in Alzheimer disease. In the present study, the nature of morphological variation was examined by dark-field and transmission electron microscopy in a preparation of seeded amyloid β protein fibrils that formed at relatively low protein concentrations and exhibited remarkably high thermodynamic stability. The number of filaments comprising these fibrils changed frequently from two to six along their length, and these changes only became apparent when mass-per-length (MPL) determinations are made with sufficient resolution. The MPL results could be reproduced by a simple stochastic model with a single adjustable parameter. The presence of more than two primary filaments could not be discerned by transmission electron microscopy, and they had no apparent relationship to the longitudinal twist of the fibrils. However, the pitch of the twist was strongly affected by the pH of the negative stain. We conclude that highly stable amyloid fibrils may form in which a surprising amount of intrinsic linear heterogeneity may be obscured by MPL measurements of insufficient resolution, and by the negative stains used for imaging fibrils by electron microscopy.

Two morphological features have particularly important implications with regard to the internal structure of amyloid fibrils. One feature is a periodic narrowing observed in many transmission EM studies suggesting that fibrils twist around their long axis. The other feature is the fibril MPL, measured by dark field or tilted-beam EM. From this measure, the number of filaments comprising the fibril may be determined. We follow the terminology conventions defined by Kodali et al. (12.Kodali R. Wetzel R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) with the exception that “protofilament” is shortened simply to “filament.” Fibrils with different morphologies can be created by varying fibril growth conditions such as temperature, buffer composition, agitation, and protein concentrations. Once formed, fibrils with a given morphology induce monomeric proteins to form “next generation” fibrils with the same morphology (10.Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Despite attempts to use identical conditions of formation, different laboratories often produce fibrils with distinctly different morphologies. These differences make it difficult to compare the physicochemical properties of fibrils from different laboratories. It is of interest, therefore, to understand how fibril morphology depends on the manner in which their morphologies are characterized. In the present study amyloid fibrils were formed in relatively dilute aqueous solutions of Aβ40 (2.3–30 μm). The resulting fibrils exhibited a remarkably high thermal stability. They were examined using EM and a variety of different negative stains, as well as dark-field EM to determine their MPL. Negative stains are invariably used when examining amyloid fibrils by EM to provide contrast. Nearly a dozen different stains are in common use, with diverse chemical properties and patterns of interaction with biological materials. The pH of most stain solutions can be adjusted over a wide range, and will influence the pattern of interaction with biological materials. Yet, the pH of the negative stain is rarely mentioned when methods are described. MPL determinations, on the other hand, are performed without any stain, but with an analytical approach developed for homogeneous materials (20.Zeitler E. Bahr G.F. J. Appl. Phys. 1962; 33: 847-853Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22.Feja B.

We have found that the morphology of these highly stable fibrils was strongly influenced by the pH of negative stains used for visualizing amyloid fibrils. More importantly, however, the number of filaments in these fibrils changed frequently along the length of the fibril. Therefore, it is likely that the internal structure of the fibrils examined in this work differs from fibrils generated in other labs that exhibit lower thermodynamic stabilities (25.Sengupta P.

The concentration of protein in this material was assayed using bicinchoninic acid, tyrosine absorbance at 280 nm, and mass spectrometric determination of Ala, Val, and Leu in acid hydrolysates. All three methods agreed in suggesting that the powder was 87% Aβ protein, with the remainder most likely representing water or salts. Samples of protein weighing 200–600 μg were weighed to the nearest microgram on a Cahn microbalance, dissolved at 1 μg/μl in HFIP, and lyophilized. Seeds were then prepared in two ways. Method 1: protein lyophilized from HFIP was redissolved at 100 μm in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% sodium azide, pH 7.4), briefly sonicated in a bath sonicator to solubilize the protein, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was injected onto a size exclusion chromatography column (TSKgel G3000SWXL, 7.8 mm ID × 30 cm, TOSOH Bioscience, King of Prussia, PA) with TBS buffer flowing at a rate of 400 μl/min. The size and elution time performance of the column was calibrated with albumin, cytochrome c, and aprotinin. Virtually all of the injected protein eluted at a time corresponding to a molecular weight range of 35–40 kDa (8–10 Aβ40 monomers). This fraction was collected and incubated for 7 days at 37 °C without agitation. The fibrils that formed were broken into short fragments by sonication in a Branson 1510 water bath type sonicator (Danbury, CT) for 3 min. As illustrated in Fig. 1, seeds ranged in size from 10–150 nm in length. Method 2: protein lyophilized from HFIP was redissolved in 0.1% NH4OH, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.1 m formic acid, and diluted to 100 μm with water. This solution was immediately centrifuged at 50,000 × g and 4 °C for 17 h. The supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks without agitation, then sonicated for 3 min to produce seeds. Aβ40 was obtained from rPeptide as trifluoroacetate salt (Bogart, GA), dissolved in HFIP, and lyophilized. This powder was dissolved in alkaline buffer (30 mm Na2HPO4, pH 11.9) at a concentration of 156 μm and briefly sonicated in a bath sonicator to solubilize the protein (29.Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M.

Thus, the protein concentration was ∼2.3 μm. First generation fibrils were obtained after a 4-day incubation at 37 °C without agitation. Second generation seeded fibrils were prepared by pelleting first generation seeded fibrils in a centrifuge at 20,000 × g, fragmenting them in a sonicator as described above, and using them as seeds in the same manner. Samples containing 30 μm Aβ40 and 4% fibril seeds prepared by method 2 in 30 mm phosphate-buffered saline were incubated at 37 °C for 0–264 h without agitation. 550 μl aliquots were removed, centrifuged at 50,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was injected onto a 4.6 × 250 mm reversed phase Vydac MS C4 column (Grace) and separated by the following gradient: Sol A: 1% ACN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; Sol B: 100% ACN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0–8 min; 0% B, 8–40 min linear increase to 60% B, with a constant flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Protein was detected in a 10-mm flow cell with a Beckman model 168 diode array detector at 215 nm. A standard curve was prepared that correlated the integrated absorbances of monomer peaks to protein quantity determined by mass spectrometric amino acid analysis, and established linearity down to a concentration of 100 nm. Three heavy-metal negative stains were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: uranyl acetate (UrAc), ammonium molybdate (AmMo), and sodium phosphotungstate (NaW). Prior to use, 2% w/v aqueous solution of UrAc at pH 4.2 was filtered through the cellulose acetate filter (0.2 μm) to remove small precipitates. The pH of 1% (w/v) AmMo in water was 5.4, and a second solution with pH 7.4 was made by adding concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. The pH of 1% (w/v) NaW in water was 5.4, and a second solution with pH 7.4 was made by adding concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. Methylamine vanadate (MeaV) was obtained from Nanoprobes (Yaphank, NY) and used as a 2% (w/v) solution in water without pH adjustment (pH 8.0). Approximately 20 ng of fibrillized Aβ40 in 1 μl of buffer was placed onto freshly glow-discharged carbon films on 300 mesh nickel grids for 2 min and then blotted with filter paper. A negative stain was then applied for 2 min, blotted, and air-dried. Images were recorded using a JEOL-1010 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan), operating at 80 kV, equipped with a side-mounted CCD digital camera. Approximately 10 ng of seeded Aβ40 fibrils in 1 μl aliquots of buffer, prepared as described above, were applied to carbon films on 300 mesh nickel grids, and mixed with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) at 5.0 ng/μl. After 2 min the grids were washed in distilled water, blotted, and air-dried. Dark-field images of unstained samples were obtained with a transmission electron microscope by shifting the objective aperture, but otherwise using the same electron optics as in bright-field TEM imaging. The MPL of amyloid fibrils was determined using the method of Chen et al. (28.Chen B. Thurber K.R. Shewmaker F. Wickner R.B. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14339-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with modification. The signal intensity in a rectangular area of a digital image containing either Aβ40 fibril or TMV was integrated, and the signal intensity of a nearby background area was subtracted. The MPL of the Aβ40 fibril was determined by scaling a value of 131.4 kDa/nm for the MPL of TMV (32.Namba K. Stubbs G. Science. 1986; 231: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) according to the ratio of background-subtracted signal intensities for Aβ40 fibril and for TMV. The modification made to the published method was a decrease in the length of the fibril/virus covered by the rectangular area from 80 nm to 40 nm. This modification enabled us to resolve linear heterogeneity in MPL along the length of a fibril. This approach was validated by comparing two TMV in the same image. Results for the second TMV took the form of a Gaussian distribution of MPL values with a mean of 130 kDa/nm and a half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of 4 kDa/nm. The effectiveness of amyloid fibrils at recruiting monomeric Aβ proteins into fibrils is likely to be greater with a greater number of fibril ends, so that many short segments would be more effective than many long segments for any given mass of Aβ protein. Therefore, seeds were prepared by subjecting fibrils in a capped polypropylene “bullet” tube to bath sonication for 3 min. As shown in Fig. 1, this treatment fragmented long fibrils into segments 10–150 nm in length bearing the same morphological appearance. Seeded solutions of Aβ40 were incubated for periods of 0 to 264 h without agitation, and centrifuged as described above to pellet fibrils. Monomer concentrations were determined in the supernatant by analytical HPLC. The detection system was able to determine protein monomer concentrations in the injected sample accurately down to 100 nm, with a limit of detection that was ∼1/5 of that value. At 37 °C, the monomer concentrations declined rapidly from 30 μm to undetectable levels after ∼15 h, and concentrations remained undetectable for 264 h (Fig. 2). The time course of the decline was somewhat slower in the presence of 10 μm Cu2+, and somewhat faster in the presence of a Cu2+ chelator, 10 μm DTPA. Nevertheless, at long times the concentrations were undetectable. At 4 °C monomer concentrations remained at nearly initial levels for up to 45 h. Seeded fibrils were examined with six different stain/pH combinations, and representative images for each stain/pH combination are provided in Fig. 3. The images show that the distances between narrowings or nodes (the “internodal” distances) vary not only between fibrils, but also within single fibrils. Also, there is a distinct and consistent “handedness” to the nodes, as previously noted by AFM (33.Rubin N. Perugia E. Goldschmidt M. Fridkin M. Addadi L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 4602-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). With each stain, some fibrils with relatively few nodes were observed, although close inspection revealed that at least one node could be identified in nearly all fibrils (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, in some cases, particularly with UrAc at pH 4.2, many fibrils had no discernable nodes. To quantify the distribution of internodal distances and determine whether there were subpopulations of fibrils with different morphologies, histograms of the observed internodal distances were generated for each stain/pH combination (Fig. 5). Results indicate that fibrils in each combination exhibited a near-continuous and smooth distribution of distances (Fig. 5). Cryo-EM studies have confirmed that these nodes arise from a longitudinal twist of the fibrils, and that the pitch of the twist is subject to near-continuous variation (18.Meinhardt J. Sachse C. Hortschansky P. Grigorieff N. Fändrich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, data in Fig. 5 also show that the pitch of the twist is sensitive to pH: only 1–3% of internodal distances were <50 nm with acidic stains, but 10–17% of internodal distances were <50 nm with alkaline stains. UrAc was distinctive in that most fibrils had 0 to 1 discernable nodes (Fig. 4E). Therefore, the counts in Fig. 5E are relatively small. Among fibrils with discernable nodes, the number of internodal distances >100 nm was greater for UrAc (78%) than any other stain (43–63%).FIGURE 5Histograms of internodal distances in Aβ40 fibrils. Bars indicate the number of times each distance was observed (left axis). The thin line is a percentage (right axis) indicating the fraction of overall fibril length composed of internodal distances that are equal to or smaller than the indicated distance (n.b. percentage is calculated as a fraction of fibril length, not the fraction of counted distances).

It should be noted that nc in panel E (UrAc at pH 4.2) is relatively small because most fibrils have no discernable twist with this stain (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The minimum internodal distances observed were 30–32 nm. Assuming that these distances correspond to a 180-degree twist of the fibril, and that there is a 0.475-nm spacing between polypeptide strands in a fibril (34.Eanes E.D. Glenner G.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1968; 16: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 35.Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), this minimum internodal distance implies a maximum pitch of 2.85°/chain. In comparison, the model illustrated in Fig. 8e of Petkova et al. (5.Petkova A.T. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 498-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) had a pitch of 4.0°/chain. A typical dark-field image of unstained fibrils and TMV in the same field is shown in Fig. 6. Fibrils and TMV are both clearly seen in shades of lighter gray on a dark gray background. They are easily distinguished from each other, although morphological details are difficult to discern due to lack of contrast. The white rectangles in Fig. 6 represent the image windows over which digital image density was integrated for MPL determination. The windows were 80 nm wide perpendicular to the fibril/virus axis), and either 40 or 80 nm long parallel to the fibril/virus axis. Histograms of the MPL results are shown in Fig. 7. For 873 measurements derived from 40 × 80 nm windows, there are 5 distinct peaks corresponding to the MPL values expected for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 filaments per fibril. The peaks were statistically robust: the peaks remained prominent when any randomly-selected half of the data were plotted. There were no measurements suggesting that only one filament was present in a fibril. For 613 measurements derived from the same images, but using 80 × 80 nm windows, results were distinctly different. The most common measurements corresponded to non-integral numbers such as 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 filaments per fibril. Average MPL values were calculated according to Equation 1,MPLave=∑niMi∑ni(Eq. 1) where ni is the number of results corresponding to mass Mi. For both the 40 and 80 nm windows, MPLave corresponds to ∼3.5 filaments per fibril. Because the same images were used for both analyses, we conclude that fibrils have an intrinsic heterogeneity with features that require windows <80 nm long to resolve. To interpret the preceding results about the number of filaments per fibril, a simple stochastic computational model of amyloid fibril structure was developed. The model assumes that two primary filaments are present at each point along the fibril, but it does not make any assumptions about the symmetry relationship between these filaments. A distance of 4.75 Å is assumed between monomers along each of the primary filaments. Additional filaments are added to the lateral aspects of the two primary filaments by nucleating a new lateral filament at each monomer with a transition probability of P. A lateral filament is terminated with the same probability applied to each monomer in the lateral filament. Denoting the original 2 filaments as aa, and each of the lateral filaments added through this procedure as b, the fibril at the end of this procedure will consist of two aa, three baa or aab, or four baab filaments at various points because lateral filaments are allowed on both sides of the original fibril. In the same manner, c filaments are added to b filaments using the same value for P, yielding two additional ways to obtain four filaments per fibril (aabc and cbaa). In the same manner, d filaments are added to c, and e are added to d. Lateral filaments cease to elongate when the filament to which they have been added terminates. No upper limit is placed on the number of lateral filaments, but the number of instances in which more than 6 filaments were generated along a 1,000,000-monomer fibril was negligible. Model fibrils generated in this manner in silico were randomly sampled with 40- and 80-nm windows, and the number of filaments for the fibril segment in each window was recorded. Values of P were adjusted so that histograms derived from the model matched the histograms derived from MPL measurements. Results for p = 0.005 are illustrated in Fig. 8, and an illustration of the texture of the model is shown in Fig. 9. Values of P ranging from 0.003 to 0.008 gave comparable profiles and agreement with the experimental data of Fig. 7. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory distribution from models in which additional filaments only formed alongside only one of the primary filaments. The model fibrils reproduce several key features of the experimental data. First, sampling with 40 nm windows yields prominent peaks of roughly equivalent size in the histogram for 2, 3, and 4 filaments per fibril, as well as non-integral values arising when filaments do not completely span the sampling window. Second, values corresponding to 5 and 6 filaments per fibril are found much less frequently, while >6 filaments per fibril are rare. Third, sampling with the longer 80-nm windows largely obscures the discrete peaks at integer values observed with 40-nm windows. Fourth, the mean MPL values for both window lengths correspond to 3.4 filaments per fibril, similar to the experimental values of 3.5. A statistical summary of filament lengths in the model is provided in Table 1 and Fig. 10. Sections with 3 and 4 filaments are each approximately twice as prevalent as sections with 2 or 5 filaments at shorter lengths (<60 nm). The average length of sections with the same number of filaments ranges from 24–48 nm, somewhat shorter than the internodal distances summarize in Fig. 5. However, Fig. 10 clearly indicates that sections with the same number of filaments are more common at shorter lengths in this model.TABLE 1Statistical summary of in silico fibril filamentsFilaments per fibril (number)23456Fraction of total length (%)253328113Average run length (nm)4832292425 Open table in a new tab The first question to consider about these results is whether the proteins within an individual amyloid fibril are structurally heterogeneous, or whether they are structurally homogeneous and the samples consist of a mixed population of fibril types. Either of the two set of MPL data in Fig. 7, if considered alone, could be interpreted as indicating that mixed populations were present. However, the two panels were derived from the same set of EM images, and only the window size with which these images were analyzed was changed. Results using 40 and 80 nm windows on the same set of images should be similar for a mixed population of internally homogeneous fibrils. Instead, the use of smaller windows revealed fewer instances in which a non-integral number of filaments per fibril were observed. Therefore, we must conclude that there is structural heterogeneity within these fibrils. The polymorphism of amyloid fibrils and their tolerance for different internal structures has been documented"
https://openalex.org/W2066280129,"Polycystin-1 (PC1) is a large membrane protein that is expressed along the renal tubule and exposed to a wide range of concentrations of urea. Urea is known as a common denaturing osmolyte that affects protein function by destabilizing their structure. However, it is known that the native conformation of proteins can be stabilized by protecting osmolytes that are found in the mammalian kidney. PC1 has an unusually long ectodomain with a multimodular structure including 16 Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains. Here, we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to study directly the effects of several naturally occurring osmolytes on the mechanical properties of PKD domains. This experimental approach more closely mimics the conditions found in vivo. We show that upon increasing the concentration of urea there is a remarkable decrease in the mechanical stability of human PKD domains. We found that protecting osmolytes such as sorbitol and trimethylamine N-oxide can counteract the denaturing effect of urea. Moreover, we found that the refolding rate of a structurally homologous archaeal PKD domain is significantly slowed down in urea, and this effect was counteracted by sorbitol. Our results demonstrate that naturally occurring osmolytes can have profound effects on the mechanical unfolding and refolding pathways of PKD domains. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that osmolytes such as urea or sorbitol may modulate PC1 mechanical properties and may lead to changes in the activation of the associated polycystin-2 channel or other intracellular events mediated by PC1."

IntroductionHeme is an iron-containing tetrapyrrole that functions as both a catalyst for reduction-oxidation reactions and an electron carrier (1Ajioka R.S. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 723-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Proteins that function in processes such as oxidative metabolism, signal transduction, cell differentiation, and gas sensing utilize heme as a prosthetic group (2Nakajima O. Takahashi S. Harigae H.

In mammals, two transcription factors have been characterized that are involved in heme-dependent gene regulation: Bach1 and Rev-erbα.

Bach1 binds to Maf recognition element sequences in conjunction with Maf class proteins to repress gene expression in heme-deficient conditions. Under heme-replete conditions, Bach1 binds heme and is exported from the nucleus for subsequent degradation, permitting derepression of Bach1 target genes (12Zenke-Kawasaki Y. Dohi Y. Katoh Y.

Rev-erbα, a nuclear hormone receptor, regulates several circadian clock-controlled genes. In the presence of heme, Rev-erbα recruits its co-repressor, NCoR-HDAC3. This complex represses circadian controlled gluconeogenic genes, likely through the transcription factor Bmal1 (13Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C. Qatanani M. Szwergold N.R. Reid R.A. Waitt G.M. Parks D.J.

In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, heme regulates the expression of at least 288 genes, termed hrg for heme-responsive genes (16Severance S. Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Cerqueira G.C. Mitreva M. El-Sayed N.M. Krause M. Hamza I. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Among free-living animals, C. elegans is unique because it lacks the enzymes for heme synthesis. Consequently, worms are natural heme auxotrophs and must acquire heme from the environment for incorporation into hemoproteins, many of which have homologs in eukaryotes (17Rao A.U. Carta L.K. Lesuisse E. Hamza I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because organismal heme levels can be externally manipulated in a controlled manner, C. elegans is an ideal genetic animal model to delineate the molecular basis of gene regulation by heme.Using C. elegans as a model system, we identified HRG-1, a transmembrane permease that is essential for heme homeostasis (18Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HRG-1 transports heme from the plasma membrane and the endolysosomal lumen into the cytoplasm. In C. elegans, hrg-1 is specifically expressed in the intestine and is highly up-regulated when heme concentrations are low (18Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular determinants of hrg-1 regulation by heme, we analyzed the hrg-1 promoter. Here, we report that a 23-bp heme-responsive element (HERE) 2The abbreviations used are: HEREheme-responsive elementDICdifferential interference contrastRACE5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. in the hrg-1 promoter directs the heme-dependent transcriptional regulation of hrg-1. We propose that the HERE works in concert with the GATA elements for enhanced expression of hrg-1 in response to heme in worm intestinal cells.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that heme transcriptionally regulates hrg-1 (18Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the cis-acting target sequences responsible for this regulation have not been identified. Our results show that the 23 nucleotides that compose the HERE and multiple GATA sites work in concert to regulate the heme-dependent expression of hrg-1 in the C. elegans intestine (Fig. 9). We propose a model in which a repressor(s) binds the HERE in the presence of high heme to down-regulate hrg-1 expression. When heme levels are low, hrg-1 is derepressed due to either dissociation of the repressor from the HERE or displacement of the repressor by an enhancer or activator protein.We speculate that the heme regulation of hrg-1 is synergistic with the binding of the intestine-specific transcription factor ELT-2 and/or ELT-4 to GATA sites. A regulatory pathway in which GATA sites work cooperatively with other factors appears to be a general form of regulation in C. elegans. In C. elegans, ELT-2, ELT-4, and ELT-7 are all intestine-specific. However, elt-4 and elt-7 deletion mutants in C. elegans show a wild-type phenotype, indicating that ELT-2 is the major GATA factor in the intestine (27McGhee J.D. Sleumer M.C. Bilenky M. Wong K. McKay S.J. Goszczynski B. Tian H. Krich N.D. Khattra J. Holt R.A. Baillie D.L. Kohara Y. Marra M.A. Jones S.J. Moerman D.G. Robertson A.G. Dev.

ELT-2 controls expression of numerous intestinal genes. However, specific control of intestinal gene expression under different developmental or environmental conditions could be achieved through the orchestrated recruitment and interaction with distinct enhancers, repressors, or modifiers (34McGhee, J. D. (2007) WormBook, 1–36.Google Scholar). For example, the C. elegans ferritin (ftn-1) promoter is up-regulated in the intestine under high iron conditions by ELT-2 and an unidentified enhancer (35Romney S.J. Thacker C. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 716-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Although there are five putative GATA-binding elements in the hrg-1 promoter, they may not all be functionally equivalent in hrg-1 regulation. Other genes, such as pho-1 and ges-1, also have multiple GATA sites, but only one particular GATA site, with the sequence ACTGATAA, is important for the expression of either gene (36Fukushige T. Goszczynski B. Yan J. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 446-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the hrg-1 promoter, the closest resemblance to the pho-1/ges-1 GATA site is GATA-C (AATGATAA). The lack of a perfect GATA site may explain why hrg-1 is not expressed at high levels when the 23-bp element is mutated. The imperfect GATA sites in the hrg-1 promoter may permit another tier of hrg-1 regulation by requiring additional trans-acting factors, possibly ELT-2/ELT-4-binding partners.The regulatory elements of the hrg-1 promoter are conserved in Caenorhabditis species (supplemental Fig. S2). These species are bacteriovorous heme auxotrophs that reside in the soil, where bioavailable heme may be limiting. Because heme is critical for larval survival and embryonic development, it is not surprising that the regulatory pathways necessary for heme utilization are also conserved. Many parasitic nematodes are also heme auxotrophs, raising the possibility that helminths may share similar heme regulatory mechanisms with free-living nematodes (17Rao A.U. Carta L.K. Lesuisse E. Hamza I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). If hrg homologs in parasitic helminths are regulated in a similar manner to hrg genes in C. elegans, our studies in C. elegans could be used to establish a conceptual framework for how nematodes forage and ingest dietary heme for growth and reproduction, aiding in the development of anthelminthics to combat worm infections.In this study, we have shown that the 23-bp HERE controls heme response in the hrg-1 promoter. Within these 23 bp is a canonical E-box (CATATG), an element to which basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors bind. In silico analysis of the C. elegans databases identified two additional heme-responsive genes, mrp-5 and C15C8.3, which share an identical conserved E-box to hrg-1 in the 5′-flanking region (supplemental Fig. S5). Additionally, in all three genes, the E-box is flanked by a GATA site, supporting our hypothesis that the HERE and GATA sites function cooperatively in the C. elegans intestine. Plausibly, variations in the HERE outside the E-box may permit the selective recruitment of gene-specific trans-acting complexes to control the magnitude of heme-dependent transcriptional response in these genes. Identification of the transcription factors that regulate heme-responsive genes may provide a more comprehensive analysis of how nutrients regulate gene expression, a well established model in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Philpott C.C. Protchenko O. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 37Rees E.M. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IntroductionHeme is an iron-containing tetrapyrrole that functions as both a catalyst for reduction-oxidation reactions and an electron carrier (1Ajioka R.S. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 723-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Proteins that function in processes such as oxidative metabolism, signal transduction, cell differentiation, and gas sensing utilize heme as a prosthetic group (2Nakajima O. Takahashi S. Harigae H.

In mammals, two transcription factors have been characterized that are involved in heme-dependent gene regulation: Bach1 and Rev-erbα. The transcriptional repressor Bach1 regulates the α- and β-subunits of hemoglobin, the iron storage protein ferritin, and the heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (6Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H.

Bach1 binds to Maf recognition element sequences in conjunction with Maf class proteins to repress gene expression in heme-deficient conditions. Under heme-replete conditions, Bach1 binds heme and is exported from the nucleus for subsequent degradation, permitting derepression of Bach1 target genes (12Zenke-Kawasaki Y. Dohi Y. Katoh Y.

Rev-erbα, a nuclear hormone receptor, regulates several circadian clock-controlled genes. In the presence of heme, Rev-erbα recruits its co-repressor, NCoR-HDAC3. This complex represses circadian controlled gluconeogenic genes, likely through the transcription factor Bmal1 (13Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C. Qatanani M. Szwergold N.R. Reid R.A. Waitt G.M. Parks D.J.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e377Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Thus, Rev-erbα coordinates circadian rhythm with heme synthesis, glucose production, and oxidative metabolism (13Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C. Qatanani M. Szwergold N.R. Reid R.A. Waitt G.M. Parks D.J. Pearce K.H. Wisely G.B. Lazar M.A. Science. 2007; 318: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).In non-mammalian metazoans, heme regulates the expression of several genes, although the molecular mechanism for this regulation is poorly understood. In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, heme regulates the expression of at least 288 genes, termed hrg for heme-responsive genes (16Severance S. Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Cerqueira G.C. Mitreva M. El-Sayed N.M. Krause M. Hamza I. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001044Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Among free-living animals, C. elegans is unique because it lacks the enzymes for heme synthesis. Consequently, worms are natural heme auxotrophs and must acquire heme from the environment for incorporation into hemoproteins, many of which have homologs in eukaryotes (17Rao A.U. Carta L.K. Lesuisse E. Hamza I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because organismal heme levels can be externally manipulated in a controlled manner, C. elegans is an ideal genetic animal model to delineate the molecular basis of gene regulation by heme.Using C. elegans as a model system, we identified HRG-1, a transmembrane permease that is essential for heme homeostasis (18Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HRG-1 transports heme from the plasma membrane and the endolysosomal lumen into the cytoplasm. In C. elegans, hrg-1 is specifically expressed in the intestine and is highly up-regulated when heme concentrations are low (18Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I. Nature. 2008; 453: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular determinants of hrg-1 regulation by heme, we analyzed the hrg-1 promoter. Here, we report that a 23-bp heme-responsive element (HERE) 2The abbreviations used are: HEREheme-responsive elementDICdifferential interference contrastRACE5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. in the hrg-1 promoter directs the heme-dependent transcriptional regulation of hrg-1. We propose that the HERE works in concert with the GATA elements for enhanced expression of hrg-1 in response to heme in worm intestinal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1963980491,"Signals between stem cells and stroma are important in establishing the stem cell niche. However, very little is known about the regulation of any mammalian stem cell niche as pure isolates of stem cells and their adjacent mesenchyme are not readily available. The prostate offers a unique model to study signals between stem cells and their adjacent stroma as in the embryonic prostate stem cell niche, the urogenital sinus mesenchyme is easily separated from the epithelial stem cells. Here we investigate the distinctive molecular signals of these two stem cell compartments in a mammalian system.We isolated fetal murine urogenital sinus epithelium and urogenital sinus mesenchyme and determined their differentially expressed genes. To distinguish transcripts that are shared by other developing epithelial/mesenchymal compartments from those that pertain to the prostate stem cell niche, we also determined the global gene expression of epidermis and dermis of the same embryos. Our analysis indicates that several of the key transcriptional components that are predicted to be active in the embryonic prostate stem cell niche regulate processes such as self-renewal (e.g., E2f and Ap2), lipid metabolism (e.g., Srebp1) and cell migration (e.g., Areb6 and Rreb1). Several of the enriched promoter binding motifs are shared between the prostate epithelial/mesenchymal compartments and their epidermis/dermis counterparts, indicating their likely relevance in epithelial/mesenchymal signaling in primitive cellular compartments. Based on differential gene expression we also defined ligand-receptor interactions that may be part of the molecular interplay of the embryonic prostate stem cell niche.We provide a comprehensive description of the transcriptional program of the major regulators that are likely to control the cellular interactions in the embryonic prostatic stem cell niche, many of which may be common to mammalian niches in general. This study provides a comprehensive source for further studies of mesenchymal/epithelial interactions in the prostate stem cell niche. The elucidation of pathways in the normal primitive niche may provide greater insight into mechanisms subverted during abnormal proliferative and oncogenic processes. Understanding these events may result in the development of specific targeted therapies for prostatic diseases such as benign prostatic hypertrophy and carcinomas."

The activity-dependent proteolysis of ARMS/Kidins220 was found to occur through calpain, a calcium-activated protease.

Activity-dependent changes in protein function and composition are known to accompany changes in synaptic efficacy. Such processes are frequently mediated by calcium signaling and have been well studied in the synaptic plasticity process of long-term potentiation (LTP). 4The abbreviations used are: LTPlong-term potentiationPSDpostsynaptic density. Activity-induced synaptic changes can occur through up-regulation of proteins via novel gene transcription (1Flavell S.W. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev.

The cysteine protease calpain is ideal for executing activity-dependent proteolysis of proteins because its enzymatic activity is induced by increases in intracellular calcium levels (5Goll D.E.

Calpain activation leads to cleavage of synaptic targets such as the postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold molecules glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) and PSD-95 (6Lu X. Rong Y. Baudry M.

One molecule that may play a role in synaptic plasticity is ARMS (ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning protein) or Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa). Initially identified as an interactor of Trk and p75 neurotrophin receptors (17Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a protein kinase D substrate (18Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), ARMS/Kidins220 is a transmembrane scaffold protein that is highly expressed in the nervous system. Strikingly, it is phosphorylated by Trk and Eph receptors, but not by other growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors such as EGF (17Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ARMS/Kidins220 represents a receptor tyrosine kinase substrate that lends signaling specificity to certain neuronal pathways (17Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J.

In the central nervous system, the TrkB receptor phosphorylates ARMS/Kidins220 after brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binding. Because BDNF and TrkB are highly responsive to neuronal activation, we hypothesized that downstream signal transducers such as ARMS/Kidins220 might also be involved in activity-dependent events as a mechanism for facilitating synaptic plasticity. Here we show that the calcium-activated protease calpain is responsible for degrading ARMS/Kidins220 after neuronal activation. In vivo, genetic reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 levels leads to enhanced LTP, and this effect of ARMS/Kidins220 on LTP is dependent on calpain. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 levels can be regulated by neuronal activity through calpain proteolysis, which has consequences for hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The following pharmacological reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: epoxomicin (1 μm), lactacystin (10 μm), chloroquine (50 μm), MDL28170 (20 μm), and EGTA (2.5 mm). N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met (25 μm) was obtained from Calbiochem. The calpain inhibitor BDA-410 (100 nm) was kindly provided by the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. The following antibodies were used: anti-ARMS/Kidins220 C-terminal rabbit polyclonal (1:4000) (17), anti-actin mouse monoclonal (1:1000; A4700, Sigma), anti-spectrin mouse monoclonal (1:5000; MAB1622, Chemicon), anti-GluA1 (formerly GluR1) C-terminal rabbit polyclonal (1:1000, AB1502, Chemicon), and anti-GluA2 (formerly GluR2) rabbit polyclonal (1:1000; Chemicon). The coding sequence of amino acids 1–402 of ARMS/Kidins220 was inserted into a M15 pQE31 vector (Qiagen) to generate a His6-tagged version. Following transformation and growth of Escherichia coli to log phase, protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were grown for an additional 3.5 h at 25 °C, pelleted, and then resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 300 mm KCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed using a French press. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 6 m urea, PBS, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and after removal of cell debris, the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) at 25 °C for 45 min. Subsequently, the beads were washed with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 6 m urea, and 20 mm imidazole, and the His-tagged protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 m urea, 5% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl and stored at −20 °C. The purified His-tagged N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–402) of ARMS/Kidins220 was used for immunization of two rabbits by BioGenes GmbH following standard procedures. Affinity-purified antibodies were isolated using antigen-specific CNBr-Sepharose columns and tested for immunoreactivity. The antibody was used in Western blots at a dilution of 1:200. Primary hippocampal neurons were dissected from day 18–19 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.37% glucose, digested with 0.05% trypsin, mechanically dissociated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes, and plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates at 250,000 neurons per well. Cells were grown in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.37% glucose, 0.5 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1.2 μg/ml 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine. Fresh medium was added to the cells every 3–4 days. Cells were stimulated at 14 to 21 days in vitro with 50 mm KCl or 200 μm glutamate. For KCl treatments, cells were collected at time points after the addition of 50 mm KCl to the cell medium. For glutamate treatments, 200 μm glutamate was added to the medium for 1 min, and then the medium was completely replaced with conditioned medium without glutamate. Cells were collected at time points after the removal of glutamate. When pharmacological inhibitors were used, they were applied to the cells 30 min prior to stimulation and were maintained throughout the stimulation. Cells were collected using 80 μl of 1× SDS buffer per well of each 12-well plate and boiled for 5 min. A 12-μl sample was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), and incubated with primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) and film autoradiography. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. All results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice have been described previously (20Wu S.H. Arévalo J.C. Sarti F. Tessarollo L. Gan W.B. Chao M.V. Dev. Neurobiol. 2009; 69: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissected from 3–6-month-old male ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice and wild-type littermates and cut into 400-mm transverse slices with a tissue chopper (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Slices were incubated in an interface chamber at 29 °C for 90 min before recording, where they were subfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid consisting of 124 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 or 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.0 or 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A bipolar tungsten-stimulating electrode and a glass micropipette (5–10 megohms, filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid) recording electrode were placed in the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region, and extracellular field potentials were recorded. Basal synaptic transmission was assayed by plotting the stimulus voltages (V) against the slopes of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials to generate input-output relations. For LTP experiments, baseline stimulation was delivered every minute for 15 min at an intensity that evoked a response of ∼35% of the maximum evoked response. LTP was induced using a θ-burst stimulation of four pulses at 100 Hz, with bursts repeated at 5 Hz, and each tetanus including three 10-burst trains separated by 15 s. In experiments using the calpain inhibitor BDA-410, slices were perfused with the inhibitor (100 nm) 20 min before LTP induction. We previously reported a line of mice heterozygous for the ARMS/Kidins220 gene that display a 30–40% reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 protein compared with wild-type animals (20Wu S.H. Arévalo J.C. Sarti F. Tessarollo L. Gan W.B. Chao M.V. Dev. Neurobiol. 2009; 69: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutants die at an embryonic age. To examine the effect of ARMS/Kidins220 reduction on synaptic plasticity, acute hippocampal slices were taken from 3–6-month-old ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice, and electrophysiology measurements were performed. LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse was induced using a θ-burst stimulus, and the slopes of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded. Strikingly, in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice, LTP was enhanced compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 1A; F(1,17) = 5.084, p < 0.05, two-way analysis of variance). ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice also exhibited increased synaptic transmission at lower stimulus intensities (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in vivo regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. It was previously shown that ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels respond to long-term changes in neuronal activity (21Cortés R.Y. Arévalo J.C. Magby J.P. Chao M.V. Plummer M.R. Dev.

When the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin was used to inhibit hippocampal cultures over a course of 48 h, ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels increased, and when the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor inhibitor bicuculline was used to increase activity in cultures, ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels decreased. Because such treatments have been shown to induce homeostatic changes in neurons (22Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), these data suggest that ARMS/Kidins220 acts as an activity sensor with a possible role in synaptic plasticity. To study the regulation of ARMS/Kidins220 due to acute neuronal activation, we depolarized rat hippocampal cultures with 50 mm KCl, a stimulus that is widely used to study activity-dependent neuronal changes (23Bartel D.P. Sheng M. Lau L.F. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 24Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E.

Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Cultures were treated with KCl, and lysates were collected at different times and probed by Western blot for ARMS/Kidins220 protein using antibodies directed against the C terminus (17Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the N terminus. Neuronal activation caused a reduction in ARMS/Kidins220 levels to ∼50% of basal levels within 3 h as a result of protein degradation (Fig. 2, A and B). The N-terminal antibody not only showed degradation of the full-length 220-kDa ARMS/Kidins220 protein, but also detected smaller sized degradation products at ∼140, 120, and 85 kDa. These were present at low levels in untreated cultures and accumulated with prolonged neuronal activation (Fig. 2A, arrows a, b, and c). Addition of the calcium chelator EGTA to the culture medium prevented KCl-induced degradation of ARMS/Kidins220, indicating that extracellular calcium influx after membrane depolarization is required (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, these data indicate that KCl-induced neuronal activation causes calcium-mediated degradation of full-length ARMS/Kidins220 to smaller sized fragments.FIGURE 3ARMS/Kidins220 degradation induced by KCl depolarization requires extracellular calcium. A, hippocampal cultures were depolarized with 50 mm KCl for 3 h in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA, and ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels were assessed by Western blot. EGTA fully rescued the degradation of full-length ARMS/Kidins220 and the appearance of N-terminal degradation fragments (arrows a, b, and c). Actin is shown as a loading control. 95- and 150-kDa nonspecific bands were detected by the N-terminal antibody.

Tsien R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that activity-induced ARMS/Kidins220 degradation is not restricted to KCl depolarization, we assayed ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels after glutamate treatment of hippocampal cultures. Similar to the effect of KCl, full-length ARMS/Kidins220 was degraded when neurons were activated by glutamate (Fig. 4A). Additionally, the same N-terminal degradation products also were detected (Fig. 4A, arrows a, b, and c). The degradation of ARMS/Kidins220 and the accumulation of the smaller fragments were prevented by the addition of EGTA (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 degradation can result from multiple forms of neuronal activation, including that induced by glutamate. Activity-dependent turnover of proteins at the PSD is a mechanism for protein composition regulation at the highly dynamic synapse (27Yi J.J. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2005; 47: 629-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Proteasomal activity is implicated in the turnover of PSD proteins (2Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and can be regulated by BDNF (28Jia J.M. Chen Q. Zhou Y. Miao S. Zheng J. Zhang C. Xiong Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21242-21250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We first hypothesized that the degradation of ARMS/Kidins220 after neuronal activity was due to the action of proteasomes. Inhibitors of proteasomes were used to determine whether they could prevent ARMS/Kidins220 degradation. Incubation of hippocampal cultures with the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin or lactacystin during KCl stimulation did not attenuate ARMS/Kidins220 degradation, indicating that proteasomal digestion was not the primary mechanism of degradation (Fig. 5, A and C). Another degradation pathway is through lysosomes, where hydrolases digest proteins in acidic compartments after internalization from the cell membrane. Because ARMS/Kidins220 is a transmembrane protein, we investigated whether blocking lysosomal action using chloroquine, which deacidifies lysosomes and inactivates lysosomal proteases, could block ARMS/Kidins220 degradation. Incubation of hippocampal cultures with chloroquine during KCl stimulation had no significant effect on ARMS/Kidins220 degradation, suggesting that the degradation did not occur through the lysosomal pathway (Fig. 5, B and C). Alternatively, activity-induced proteolysis of ARMS/Kidins220 could occur through the action of proteases that are activated by calcium. One potential candidate is calpain. The two major isoforms of calpain, μ- and m-calpain, are highly expressed in neurons and respond to micro- and millimolar concentrations of intracellular calcium, respectively, in part through the binding of calcium directly to domains in the molecule (5Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Calpain acts at neutral pH in the cytosol and at the cell membrane to cleave a wide range of targets. Furthermore, calpain activity has been implicated in synaptic functions and neurodegenerative diseases (3Liu J. Liu M.C. Wang K.K. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re1Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Wu H.Y. Lynch D.R. Mol. Neurobiol. 2006; 33: 215-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To investigate whether calpain degrades ARMS/Kidins220, hippocampal cultures were incubated with the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 or N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met during KCl stimulation. Calpain inhibitors rescued degradation of full-length ARMS/Kidins220, as well as the accumulation of degradation products (Fig. 6, A and B). Calpain inhibitors also rescued the ARMS/Kidins220 degradation induced by glutamate treatment (Fig. 6C). To demonstrate that the degradation of ARMS/Kidins220 is not due to nonspecific proteolysis of membrane proteins, we probed for the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, two synaptic membrane proteins. After KCl depolarization, GluA1 was degraded in a calpain-dependent manner, which is consistent with previous studies (Fig. 6D) (9Bi X. Chen J. Dang S. Wenthold R.J. Tocco G. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Yuen E.Y. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Physiol. 2007; 580: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, GluA2 remained intact, indicating that the activity of calpain was directed at specific targets. Taken together, these data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 is a specific target of calpain, which degrades the scaffold molecule in an activity-dependent manner. A possible explanation for the enhancement of LTP in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice is that a further reduction of the protein levels in these animals by calpain cleavage unmasks a role for ARMS/Kidins220 in regulating the amounts of synaptic potentiation. To demonstrate a link between the enhancement of LTP observed in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice and calpain-dependent ARMS/Kidins220 proteolysis, we studied the effect of calpain inhibition in the mice. Acute hippocampal slices were taken from 3–6-month-old ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice, and LTP was induced in the presence and absence of BDA-410, a compound that has been shown to be a potent and selective calpain inhibitor (30Battaglia F. Trinchese F. Liu S. Walter S. Nixon R.A. Arancio O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Li X. Chen H. Jeong J.J. Chishti A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 155: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a previous study, calpain inhibition by BDA-410 had no effect on the expression of LTP or on basal transmission in wild-type mice (32Trinchese F. Fa' M. Liu S. Zhang H. Hidalgo A. Schmidt S.D. Yamaguchi H. Yoshii N. Mathews P.M. Nixon R.A. Arancio O. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2796-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our experiments confirmed that this inhibitor also did not affect LTP in our wild-type animals (Fig. 7; wild-type mice treated with vehicle (black circles) versus BDA-410 (black triangles); F(1,13) = 0.14, p > 0.05, two-way analysis of variance). However, the inhibitor did rescue the enhancement of LTP in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice (Fig. 7; ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice treated with vehicle (white circles) versus BDA-410 (white triangles); F(1,12) = 4.907, p < 0.05, two-way analysis of variance). These data indicate that the effects of ARMS/Kidins220 expression on LTP can be mediated by calpain. Activity-dependent regulation of synaptic proteins is a critical process responsible for many observations of synaptic plasticity. Here we demonstrated that decreased levels of the ARMS/Kidins220 scaffold protein in vivo led to an enhancement of LTP. In cultured neurons, ARMS/Kidins220 was down-regulated in an activity-dependent manner, and the decrease in ARMS/Kidins220 levels was regulated by calpain. Inhibition of calpain activity in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice rescued the changes in LTP. Taken together, our data suggest that the activity-dependent regulation of ARMS/Kidins220 by calpain mediates its effects on synaptic plasticity. It has been proposed that regulated physiological activation of calpain is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, whereas the pathological hyperactivation of calpain leads to neurodegenerative processes (3Liu J. Liu M.C. Wang K.K. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re1Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Wu H.Y. Lynch D.R. Mol. Neurobiol. 2006; 33: 215-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Normal activation leads to key signaling processes, whereas abnormal activation leads to dysregulated degradation and neurotoxicity. López-Menéndez et al. (33López-Menéndez C. Gascón S. Sobrado M. Vidaurre O.G. Higuero A.M. Rodríguez-Peña A. Iglesias T. Díaz-Guerra M. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3554-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that ARMS/Kidins220 plays a key role during NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity that is mediated by calpain. Here we found that calpain cleavage of ARMS/Kidins220 is involved in its ability to influence LTP. We previously showed that alterations in ARMS/Kidins220 levels in culture led to changes in synaptic charge, suggesting that ARMS/Kidins220 regulates synaptic activity (21Cortés R.Y. Arévalo J.C. Magby J.P. Chao M.V. Plummer M.R. Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 1687-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent studies in hippocampal neurons indicate that the level of ARMS/Kidins220 protein expression can influence both excitatory (34Arévalo J.C. Wu S.H. Takahashi T. Zhang H. Yu T. Yano H. Milner T.A. Tessarollo L. Ninan I. Arancio O. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 45: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and inhibitory neurotransmission (35Sutachan J.J. Chao M.V. Ninan I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2010; 88: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, lowered ARMS/Kidins220 protein levels in vivo caused an enhancement of LTP. We used the highly selective BDA-410 calpain inhibitor to assess whether calpain activity is linked to the changes in LTP observed in heterozygous mice expressing reduced levels of ARMS/Kidins220. Consistent with previous findings, the BDA-410 inhibitor did not have any effect upon the generation of LTP or of basal synaptic transmission properties in wild-type mice (32Trinchese F. Fa' M. Liu S. Zhang H. Hidalgo A. Schmidt S.D. Yamaguchi H. Yoshii N. Mathews P.M. Nixon R.A. Arancio O. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2796-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, treatment of hippocampal slices from ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice resulted in a reversal of the enhancement of LTP. These results imply that calpain activity is related specifically to the generation of LTP in mice with a reduced level of ARMS/Kidins220. Steady-state levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in wild-type animals may place a constitutive restraint upon potentiation, perhaps through the inhibition of a rate-limiting step. Decreases in the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice would prime or facilitate the ability to generate LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. The specific action of the BDA-410 calpain inhibitor upon the ARMS/Kidins220+/− mice suggests that calpain cleavage of ARMS/Kidins220 or its many associated proteins may be responsible for changing hippocampal plasticity. Calpain has also been shown to regulate MAPK signaling involved in memory processes through cleavage of the suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillatory protein (SCOP), an inhibitor of MAPK (36Shimizu K. Phan T. Mansuy I.M. Storm D.R. Cell. 2007; 128: 1219-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BDNF was implicated in the induction of calpain to regulate SCOP. Notably, the calpain activation can also be regulated by BDNF through MAPK phosphorylation events (37Zadran S. Jourdi H. Rostamiani K. Qin Q. Bi X. Baudry M. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that calpain is directly involved in synaptic plasticity through the regulation of several different mechanisms. The calpain cleavage of glutamate receptor subunits is regulated by phosphorylation (29Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinases Fyn and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, among others, have been shown to regulate the sensitivity of targets to calpain cleavage (38Wu H.Y. Hsu F.C. Gleichman A.J. Baconguis I. Coulter D.A. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20075-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16434-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because ARMS/Kidins220 is a molecule with many potential phosphorylation sites, its cleavage may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the protein. It is likely that different physiological functions are carried out by ARMS/Kidins220 because it has multifunctional interactions with many different signaling proteins, such as Trio, septins, Trk receptors, CrkL, and AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits (33López-Menéndez C.

As a scaffold protein at postsynaptic sites, ARMS/Kidins220 can potentially participate in protein-protein interactions in dendritic spine compartments. Conspicuously, the C terminus of ARMS/Kidins220 contains a PDZ domain-binding motif, which has the potential to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins in the PSD to exert its scaffolding functions. As a substrate of neurotrophin and ephrin receptors, as well as calpain, regulation of ARMS/Kidins220 levels may serve as an important convergence point for transmitting signals to mediate synaptic plasticity.

Membrane fusion is the final step of vesicular traffic, delivering cargos within donor vesicles to the proper acceptor compartment at the right time.

Although PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 are minor chemical constituents of the membrane, they regulate the fusion of vacuoles (both in vivo and in vitro) and of proteoliposomes composed of purified vacuolar components. The deletion of nonessential genes of phosphoinositide metabolism blocks vacuole fusion in the cell (12Seeley E.S. Kato M. Margolis N. Wickner W. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In vitro fusion of the organelle is inhibited by a wide variety of phosphoinositide ligands or phosphoinositide phosphatases (11Mayer A. Scheglmann D. Dove S. Glatz A. Wickner W. Haas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), blocking specific stages of priming and tethering. PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 are enriched at the “vertex ring” microdomain, where docked vacuoles fuse, and this enrichment is interdependent with other fusion proteins and lipids (13Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The optimal fusion of reconstituted proteoliposomes needs both PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although some subreactions can proceed in their absence, and either phosphoinositide can support some level of fusion (15Mima J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16191-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The striking synergy between the HOPS complex, which directly or indirectly promotes trans-SNARE complex assembly, and the Sec17p and Sec18p chaperones, which mediate SNARE complex disassembly, is absolutely dependent on phosphoinositides (15Mima J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16191-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion, the mechanisms they use to regulate each stage of the fusion reaction have been elusive. This is due in part to the homotypic nature of vacuole fusion. With all SNAREs present on both fusion partners and in the presence of HOPS, Sec17p, and Sec18p, it is difficult to distinguish the individual functions of each phosphoinositide and whether each acts in cis or in trans to the 3Q-SNAREs and R-SNARE, which engage to form functional trans-SNARE complexes (23Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The power of the reconstitution approach, in which each relevant protein or lipid can be present or absent on each fusion partner, allows exploration of the roles and asymmetries of PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 functions. Are both phosphoinositides needed on each fusion partner, and is this requirement asymmetric with respect to R-SNARE and the 3Q-SNAREs that combine in trans to form SNARE complexes? What are the relationships between the HOPS and Sec17p/Sec18p chaperones and phosphoinositides? We now report studies that began with SNARE liposomes in the absence of HOPS, Sec17p, or Sec18p. Under these conditions, high concentrations of Vam7p are needed to drive 3Q-SNARE complex assembly, and tethering requires a trans-interaction between the PX domain of the Q-SNARE Vam7p on one membrane and PI(3)P on the apposed membrane bearing R-SNARE. At lower, more physiological concentrations of Vam7p, PI(3)P is needed on the same membrane as Q-SNAREs to promote Vam7p binding and assembly into the 3Q-SNARE complex; HOPS is then strictly required for tethering. HOPS also protects trans-SNARE complexes from the disassembly chaperones Sec17p and Sec18p (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, PI(4,5)P2 stimulates when it is on the same membrane as R-SNAREs, but only when PI(3)P is simultaneously on the apposed Q-SNARE membranes. Thus, phosphoinositides fulfill crucial but mechanistically distinct and asymmetric roles under different fusion conditions. Recombinant Vam3p, Vti1p, and Nyv1p were expressed in Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W.

Antibodies to Vam3p were purified using immobilized GST-Vam3p-ΔTM and cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Nyv1p and Vam7p were generated as described (28Ungermann C. Wickner W.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SNARE proteoliposomes were prepared with PI(3)P (1%), PI(4,5)P2 (1%), neither phosphoinositide, or both (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were performed to ensure that phosphoinositides did not affect protein incorporation into RPLs. Standard fusion reactions (20 μl) contained RB150 (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system (1 mg/ml creatine kinase and 29 mm creatine phosphate), donor proteoliposomes (200 μm lipids), and acceptor proteoliposomes (200 μm lipids). Vam7p (0.22–6 μm) or Vam7p-3Δ (0.22–6 μm), HOPS (35 nm), Sec17p (0.68 μm), and Sec18p (0.24 μm) were present where indicated. Reaction mixtures were prepared on ice and transferred to a 396-well plate (preincubated on ice), and the NBD fluorescence signal was measured (λex = 460 nm, λem = 538 nm, λcutoff = 515 nm) in a SpectraMax Gemini XPS plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 27 °C (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To monitor the fusion between R- and 3Q-SNARE RPLs, they were preincubated separately at 27 °C for 10 min (each in 10 μl of reaction buffer) before mixing together in a 396-well plate prewarmed to 27 °C. Fusion was calculated as the increase in the fluorescence due to lipid mixing at any time divided by the fluorescence at the first minute ((Ft − F1)/F1). An increase of 1 in this parameter is defined as one unit of fusion. The maximal rate of fusion was calculated to compare fusion reactions. Under certain conditions of rapid fusion (supplemental Figs. 2 and 4), the F1 value was obtained from a control reaction in which only the respective R-SNARE RPLs (but not the Q-SNARE RPLs) were present. Error bars are standard deviations from three or more experiments. Following incubation at 27 °C for 5 min, each reaction mixture was diluted 40-fold in RB150. Four microliters were placed on a microscope slide and covered with a 22-mm coverslip. Images were collected using a fluorescence microscope (19Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Particle sizes were measured in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) as described (21Hickey C.M. Wickner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The trans-SNARE complex was assayed as described (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine 3Q-SNARE complex formation, 2Q-SNARE RPLs (200 μm lipids) were incubated with untagged Vam7p at 27 °C for 30 min in a reaction mixture including RB150, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system. After 5 min on ice, GST-Vam7p (at 5-fold molar excess to Vam7p in the reaction) was added to the sample. Following 10 min of further incubation on ice, membranes were solubilized, Vam3p was immunoprecipitated with immobilized anti-Vam3p antibody (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Ungermann C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and coprecipitating untagged Vam7p and Vti1p were assayed by immunoblotting. Rapid homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles depends on both PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 (11Mayer A. Scheglmann D. Dove S. Glatz A. Wickner W. Haas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), a requirement that has been recapitulated in reconstitution assays (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Mima J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16191-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To address the specific functions of these phosphoinositides, we first asked if they act from one or both membranes during the fusion reaction. Proteoliposomes with four SNAREs (Vam3p, Vti1p, Vam7p, and Nyv1p) were prepared either with or without the two phosphoinositides. Proteoliposome fusion was monitored by a FRET-based lipid mixing assay that employs “donor” proteoliposomes labeled with lipid-anchored NBD and rhodamine (at concentrations at which the NBD fluorescence signal is effectively quenched by rhodamine), whereas acceptor proteoliposomes have neither fluorophore. Upon fusion, the mixture of the donor and acceptor membranes relieves this quenching effect via dilution, leading to increased NBD fluorescence (30Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Fusion of 4-SNARE proteoliposomes requires the synergistic actions of the tethering factor HOPS and the SNARE complex disassembly chaperones Sec17p and Sec18p (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides were essential for fusion but were needed only on one fusion partner, either donor or acceptor (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). SNAREs are required on both membranes for fusion (23Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). How do phosphoinositides fulfill their roles on just one membrane? To determine whether each phosphoinositide has specific functions that are asymmetric with respect to SNAREs, we prepared proteoliposomes with Nyv1p only (R-SNARE RPLs) or with Vam3p, Vti1p, and Vam7p (3Q-SNARE RPLs). Because R- and 3Q-SNARE RPLs can fuse without HOPS or Sec17p/Sec18p (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we are able to address the specific requirements for phosphoinositides that are in cis or in trans to the R- or Q-SNAREs. In contrast to HOPS- and Sec17p/Sec18p-dependent homotypic fusion of 4-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 1), heterotypic fusion between R- and 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes could occur without phosphoinositides (Fig. 2, bar 5 versus bar 1; and supplemental Fig. 2, A–C, open triangles). However, there was a significant stimulation of fusion by phosphoinositides on R-SNARE proteoliposomes (Fig. 2, bar 7 versus bar 5). To distinguish the roles of PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2, we performed SNARE-only fusion reactions using proteoliposomes bearing either PI(3)P or PI(4,5)P2. PI(3)P contributed to this stimulation much more than PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2, bar 13 versus 10; and supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). The stimulation by PI(3)P was ablated when wild-type Vam7p was replaced by Vam7p(Y42A) (Fig. 2, bars 15–18; and supplemental Fig. 2D), which has a defective PI(3)P-binding pocket in its PX domain (16Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Therefore, the trans-interaction between the PX domain of Vam7p and PI(3)P greatly enhances the rate of fusion. PI(3)P on the R-SNARE RPL might facilitate the tethering of proteoliposomes, leading to more trans-SNARE complexes and faster fusion, or it might stimulate fusion at a step after the formation of trans-SNARE complexes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the levels of the trans-SNARE complex at an early reaction time when the rate of fusion was still linear. A trans-SNARE complex assay was performed with R-SNARE RPLs plus Q-SNARE RPLs bearing Vam7p-3Δ, a C-terminal deletion mutant that supports trans-SNARE complex formation but not fusion (26Schwartz M.L. Merz A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 535-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The use of Vam7p-3Δ prevents the post-fusion formation of any cis-SNARE complexes (which had never been trans), allowing an authentic measurement of only the trans-SNARE complex. The level of the trans-SNARE complex was determined by the amount of Nyv1p (from R-SNARE RPLs) co-immunoprecipitated with Vam3p (from Q-SNARE RPLs) 5 min after the proteoliposomes were mixed together at reaction temperature. Under these conditions, PI(3)P dramatically increased the level of the trans-SNARE complex when it was on the R-SNARE RPL (Fig. 3A, lane 8), in accord with the fusion data in Fig. 2. Furthermore, tethering assays showed that PI(3)P in trans to Vam7p greatly facilitated the formation of large clusters and that the functional interaction between PI(3)P and the PX domain of Vam7p was important for the cluster size increase (Fig. 3B). Fusion was inhibited when PI(3)P was also in cis with Vam7p on Q-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 2, bar 13 versus bar 14), perhaps due to 3Q-SNARE RPLs clustering with each other instead of with R-SNARE RPLs. Thus, PI(3)P can promote fusion by facilitating tethering via a trans-interaction with Vam7p, although an additional post-trans-SNARE complex role remains possible. Because HOPS tethers vesicles (21Hickey C.M. Wickner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and has affinity for phosphoinositides (19Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we asked whether the HOPS-tethering activity, which should promote the fusion of R- and 3Q-SNARE RPLs, is in any way influenced by the topological distribution of phosphoinositides. HOPS stimulated fusion in the absence of phosphoinositides (Fig. 4, bars 5 and 6; and supplemental Fig. 3C), suggesting that HOPS does not need PI(3)P or PI(4,5)P2 to tether SNARE-bearing proteoliposomes. This was confirmed directly by clustering assays using protein-free liposomes (supplemental Fig. 4). When PI(3)P was present on the R-SNARE RPLs in trans to Vam7p, HOPS no longer stimulated fusion (Fig. 4, bars 1 and 2; and supplemental Fig. 3A), suggesting that the trans-interaction between PI(3)P and Vam7p is so efficient at tethering proteoliposomes that the need for HOPS-tethering activity is bypassed under these conditions. Our studies thus far examined the asymmetric requirement for phosphoinositides in the fusion of R- and 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes in the absence of Sec17p and Sec18p. During vacuole fusion, cis-SNARE complexes are disassembled by Sec17p and Sec18p, and the Qc-SNARE Vam7p is constantly released to the cytosol and recruited to the membrane (31Boeddinghaus C. Merz A.J. Laage R. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To reflect Vam7p recruitment in the fusion reaction, we employed an RPL fusion system in which the Q-SNARE proteoliposomes initially bore only Vam3p and Vti1p, and Vam7p was added to the reaction mixture at controlled concentrations. High levels of Vam7p (i.e. 6 μm) drove 3Q-SNARE complex formation by mass action, in a fashion that was insensitive to phosphoinositides. Under these conditions, fusion was greatly stimulated by PI(3)P on the R-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 5, bar 4 versus bar 12), in accord with findings using 3Q-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 2). This asymmetric stimulation by PI(3)P was also abolished by the Y42A single amino acid change in the PI(3)P-binding pocket of the Vam7p PX domain (supplemental Fig. 5, bar 4 versus bar 12). At low levels of Vam7p (i.e. 0.22 μm), very little fusion was detected regardless of the position of PI(3)P (Fig. 5, bars 1, 5, 9, and 13), suggesting that too little Vam7p was recruited to drive tethering or fusion. We therefore added HOPS, whose tethering activity does not require phosphoinositides (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 4). When HOPS was present to fulfill the tethering function, and Vam7p had to be recruited into SNARE complexes, PI(3)P was needed on the 2Q-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 6, compares bars 5–8 with bars 1–4; and supplemental Fig. 6), in accord with studies showing that PI(3)P is a primary receptor for Vam7p on vacuoles (31). PI(4,5)P2 on either R- or 2Q-SNARE RPLs had little effect by itself on fusion (Fig. 6, compare bars 3 and 9 with bar 1). However, with PI(3)P on 2Q-SNARE RPLs, PI(4,5)P2 on R-SNARE RPLs doubled the maximal rate of fusion (Fig. 6, bar 7 versus bar 5 and bar 15 versus bar 13).FIGURE 6Asymmetric requirement for phosphoinositides in SNARE- and HOPS-dependent fusion. R- and 2Q-SNARE RPLs bearing PI(3)P, PI(4,5)P2, both, or neither were incubated with 0.22 μm Vam7p and 35 nm HOPS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the roles of PI(3)P in 2Q-SNARE RPLs, we asked if it enhanced the formation of the 3Q-SNARE complex. 2Q-SNARE RPLs (with or without PI(3)P) were incubated with low levels of Vam7p before membranes were solubilized in detergent. To block Vam3p-Vam7p association in detergent after membrane solubilization, excess GST-Vam7p was added to compete with Vam7p. The 3Q-SNARE complex was assayed as the amount of untagged Vam7p that co-immunoprecipitated with Vam3p (Fig. 7). PI(3)P dramatically enhanced the 3Q-SNARE complex formation (Fig. 7, compare lanes 5 and 8), and HOPS had little effect on 3Q-SNARE assembly. PI(3)P fulfills distinct functions in different fusion subreactions, supporting tethering when it is on R-SNARE proteoliposomes and 3Q-SNARE complex formation when it is on Q-SNARE proteoliposomes. What happens when fusion is performed in the presence of Sec17p/Sec18p as well as HOPS, mimicking vacuole fusion in intact cells? Instead of basing these assays on 4-SNARE RPLs as in Fig. 1, which obscures the asymmetry of phosphoinositide requirements with respect to R- or Q-SNAREs, we used R- and 2Q-SNARE RPLs and a low level of soluble full-length Vam7p. As reported (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), this fusion was absolutely dependent on HOPS, Sec17p/Sec18p, and phosphoinositides (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8 and supplemental Figs. 1 and 7). PI(3)P on Q-SNARE RPLs was essential for robust fusion, and PI(4,5)P2 on R-SNARE proteoliposomes provided further stimulation (Fig. 8, bars 1, 5, and 7; and supplemental Fig. 7). Thus, in the presence of HOPS, which facilitates tethering, and Sec17p and Sec18p, which constantly disassemble SNARE complexes and release Vam7p, PI(3)P is required on Q-SNARE RPLs to facilitate 3Q-SNARE complex assembly. Vam7p(Y42A) did not support this fusion regardless of the position of phosphoinositides (Fig. 8, bars 17–20; and supplemental Fig. 7E), in contrast to the observation that Vam7p(Y42A) did support fusion when it was already assembled into the 3Q-SNARE complex during proteoliposome preparation (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2D). Thus, a functional PI(3)P-binding site appears to be essential for Vam7p membrane rebinding and ongoing 3Q-SNARE formation in the presence of SNARE disassembly chaperones, in accord with studies using yeast vacuoles (31Boeddinghaus C. Merz A.J. Laage R. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, Sec17p and Sec18p confer rigorous HOPS dependence and a requirement for PI(3)P on Q-SNARE RPLs. PI(3)P was also required on Q-SNARE proteoliposomes when both fusion partners bore Ypt7p (supplemental Fig. 8, compare bars 5–8 with bars 1–4, respectively), and PI(4,5)P2 stimulated more when on the R-SNARE RPLs (compare bars 5, 7, and 13), suggesting that Ypt7p, whose major function is to help recruit HOPS to the membrane (18Hickey C.M. Stroupe C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16118-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), does not alter the asymmetry of phosphoinositide function. Although mechanistic insights can be gleaned from experiments with phosphoinositides and R- and Q-SNAREs on distinct fusion partners, the physiological reaction is one of homotypic vacuole fusion where the same phosphoinositides are on both fusion partners. It is therefore of particular interest to note that little or no fusion was seen when both the R- or Q-SNARE RPLs bore no phosphoinositides (Fig. 8, bar 1) or bore PI(4,5)P2 alone (bar 11). Although some fusion was seen when both bore PI(3)P (Fig. 8, bar 6), fusion proceeded with a much faster initial rate when both fusion partners bore both PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 (bar 16) and to almost four times the extent (supplemental Fig. 7, B–D, compare filled symbols). This striking effect of PI(4,5)P2 was only observed in the presence of Sec17p/Sec18p (Fig. 8, compare bars 6, 11, and 16 in the presence of Sec17p/Sec18p with those in Fig. 6 in their absence). Yeast vacuole fusion is homotypic and complex, with each fusion partner bearing all four SNAREs, an array of important lipids (including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, 3- and 4-phosphoinositides, ergosterol, and diacylglycerol), HOPS, Sec17p/Sec18p, and the Rab GTPase Ypt7p. The multiplicity of these components and the homotypic nature of the fusion obscure the chemical definition of individual subreactions, requiring a reductionist biochemical approach. To explore the roles of PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P2 in vacuole fusion, we employed defined subreactions in which the membrane-anchored vacuolar R- and Q-SNAREs were artificially segregated onto separate proteoliposomes, allowing tethering, SNARE pairing, and fusion to be examined as we reintroduced peripheral membrane proteins such as the soluble SNARE Vam7p, the SNARE disassembly chaperones Sec17p and Sec18p, and the multifunctional HOPS complex. This approach revealed that the phosphoinositide functions are asymmetric with respect to the Q- and R-SNAREs and are exquisitely dependent on the presence or absence of HOPS and Sec17p/Sec18p. Our studies led to a working model of asymmetric phosphoinositide function (Fig. 9). Vam3p and Vti1p, which form a stable 2-SNARE complex (23Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), associate with Vam7p, which binds to the membrane through the affinity of its PX domain for PI(3)P (Fig. 9, A and B) to form a 3Q-SNARE complex (Fig. 9C). Tethering can be promoted by the interaction of the Vam7p PX domain with PI(3)P in trans (Fig. 3) or by HOPS (21Hickey C.M. Wickner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), bringing the membranes into close apposition to allow R- and 3Q-SNAREs (Fig. 9, C and D) to pair in trans and form 4-SNARE trans-complexes that lead to fusion (Fig. 9E). However, a significant proportion of the trans-SNARE complexes may assemble in inactive conformations of unknown structure (Fig. 9F, fig leaf). Such nonfunctional conformations were suggested by earlier structural studies of neuronal SNAREs (32Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14800-14805Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and are inferred for vacuole SNAREs from the need for Sec18p-mediated trans-SNARE complex recycling for fusion of intact vacuoles (33Jun Y. Xu H. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4935-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the requirement for Sec17p/Sec18p for optimal rates of fusion of proteoliposomes that bear separated Q- and R-SNAREs (14Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HOPS has been shown to proofread several aspects of SNARE structure (34Starai V.J. Hickey C.M. Wickner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to protect functional trans-SNARE complexes from disassembly (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our working model postulates that Sec17p and Sec18p disassemble and recycle nonfunctional trans-SNARE complexes that are not protected by HOPS, but as shown (22Xu H. Jun Y. Thompson J. Yates J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), they do not efficiently disassemble HOPS-protected functional trans-SNARE complexes. In contrast to the clear asymmetric functions of PI(3)P, PI(4,5)P2 (without PI(3)P) confers limited stimulation in simple reconstitution systems with SNAREs, with SNAREs and HOPS alone, or with SNAREs, HOPS, and Sec17p/Sec18p. However, in the presence of PI(3)P, it has an important and asymmetric role (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, compare bars 5 and 7). Earlier reconstitution studies have shown that phosphoinositides have no effect on the membrane association of HOPS, Sec17p, or Sec18p (Fig. 4E in Ref. 15Mima J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16191-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the fusion seen in the presence of HOPS and Sec17p/Sec18p with either PI(3)P or PI(4,5)P2 present on both Q- and R-SNARE RPLs (Fig. 8, bars 6 and 11) is far less than when both phosphoinositides are on both fusion partners (bar 16). Further studies will be needed to define the molecular role(s) of PI(4,5)P2 in this system. HOPS-tethering activity does not require phosphoinositides (supplemental Fig. 4), even though HOPS has affinity for these acidic lipids (19Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The importance of HOPS-lipid interaction is strongly supported by the finding that phosphorylated HOPS, which has diminished binding to lipids, no longer supports fusion unless the HOPS-Ypt7p interaction is present (18Hickey C.M. Stroupe C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16118-16125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We suggest that acidic lipids other than phosphoinositides may participate in binding HOPS (15Mima J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16191-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Asymmetric requirements for specific lipids in membrane fusion are not limited to vacuoles. PI(4,5)P2 on the plasma membrane is essential for vesicle exocytosis. Using an elegantly reconstituted proteoliposome fusion system, it was discovered that PI(4,5)P2 regulates dense core vesicle exocytosis from the Q-SNARE membranes via interaction with CAPS (a Munc13-like protein), which bears a pleckstrin homology domain (5James D.J. Khodthong C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, one reason for the asymmetric requirement for phosphoinositides in fusion is that their respective protein partners (with a specific lipid-binding motif in their cytosolic domain) regulate fusion from only Q- or R-SNARE membranes. Studying the asymmetric requirement for phosphoinositides will inevitably lead to insights into how these proteins regulate various fusion subreactions. Phosphoinositides and their derivatives might also regulate fusion in an asymmetric fashion because of their capacities to generate membrane curvature. For example, asymmetric but reciprocal distribution of phosphatidic acid and PI(4,5)P2 triggers the in vitro progression of GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis from the hemifused state to full fusion (35Vicogne J. Vollenweider D. Smith J.R. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14761-14766Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether phosphatidic acid and PI(4,5)P2 play similar roles in vacuole fusion.

https://openalex.org/W2080999041,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds to its target receptor tyrosine kinase, Met, as a single-chain form (pro-HGF) or as a cleaved two-chain disulfide-linked α/β-heterodimer. However, only two-chain HGF stimulates Met signaling. Proteolytic cleavage of the Arg(494)-Val(495) peptide bond in the zymogen-like pro-HGF results in allosteric activation of the serine protease-like β-chain (HGF β), which binds Met to initiate signaling. We use insights from the canonical trypsin-like serine protease activation mechanism to show that isolated peptides corresponding to the first 7-10 residues of the cleaved N terminus of the β-chain stimulate Met phosphorylation by pro-HGF to levels that are ∼25% of those stimulated by two-chain HGF. Biolayer interferometry data demonstrate that peptide VVNGIPTR (peptide V8) allosterically enhances pro-HGF β binding to Met, resulting in a K(D)(app) of 1.6 μm, only 8-fold weaker than the Met/HGF β-chain affinity. Most notably, in vitro cell stimulation with peptide V8 in the presence of pro-HGF leads to Akt phosphorylation, enhances cell survival, and facilitates cell migration between 75 and 100% of that found with two-chain HGF, thus revealing a novel approach for activation of Met signaling that bypasses proteolytic processing of pro-HGF. Peptide V8 is unable to enhance Met binding or signaling with HGF proteins having a mutated activation pocket (D672N). Furthermore, Gly substitution of the N-terminal Val residue in peptide V8 results in loss of all activity. Overall, these findings identify the activation pocket of the serine protease-like β-chain as a ""hot spot"" for allosteric regulation of pro-HGF and have broad implications for developing selective allosteric activators of serine proteases and pseudoproteases."

Although the establishment and development of biological populations are important themes in ecology, our understanding of the formation of such patterns on the rocks is still in its infancy. Here, we present a novel model of the concurrent growth, establishment and interaction of lichens. We introduce an inverse technique based on Monte Carlo simulations to test our model on field samples of lichen communities. We derive an expression for the time needed for a community to cover a surface and predict the historical spatial dynamics of field samples. Lichens are frequently used for dating the time of exposure of rocks in glacial deposits, lake retreats or rock falls. We suggest our method as a way to improve the dating."
https://openalex.org/W2002187542,"Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the spinal cord inhibits pain transmission. At least three mAChR subtypes (M(2), M(3), and M(4)) are present in the spinal dorsal horn. However, it is not clear how each mAChR subtype contributes to the regulation of glutamatergic input to dorsal horn neurons. We recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) from lamina II neurons in spinal cord slices from wild-type (WT) and mAChR subtype knock-out (KO) mice. The mAChR agonist oxotremorine-M increased the frequency of glutamatergic sEPSCs in 68.2% neurons from WT mice and decreased the sEPSC frequency in 21.2% neurons. Oxotremorine-M also increased the sEPSC frequency in ∼50% neurons from M(3)-single KO and M(1)/M(3) double-KO mice. In addition, the M(3) antagonist J104129 did not block the stimulatory effect of oxotremorine-M in the majority of neurons from WT mice. Strikingly, in M(5)-single KO mice, oxotremorine-M increased sEPSCs in only 26.3% neurons, and J104129 abolished this effect. In M(2)/M(4) double-KO mice, but not M(2)- or M(4)-single KO mice, oxotremorine-M inhibited sEPSCs in significantly fewer neurons compared with WT mice, and blocking group II/III metabotropic glutamate receptors abolished this effect. The M(2)/M(4) antagonist himbacine either attenuated the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine-M or potentiated the stimulatory effect of oxotremorine-M in WT mice. Our study demonstrates that activation of the M(2) and M(4) receptor subtypes inhibits synaptic glutamate release to dorsal horn neurons. M(5) is the predominant receptor subtype that potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2106899627,"Ecological gradients have long been recognized as important regions for diversification and speciation. However, little attention has been paid to the evolutionary consequences or conservation implications of human activities that fundamentally change the environmental features of such gradients. Here we show that recent deforestation in West Africa has homogenized the rainforest-savanna gradient, causing a loss of adaptive phenotypic diversity in a common rainforest bird, the little greenbul (Andropadus virens). Previously, this species was shown to exhibit morphological and song divergence along this gradient in Central Africa. Using satellite-based estimates of forest cover, recent morphological data, and historical data from museum specimens collected prior to widespread deforestation, we show that the gradient has become shallower in West Africa and that A. virens populations there have lost morphological variation in traits important to fitness. In contrast, we find no loss of morphological variation in Central Africa where there has been less deforestation and gradients have remained more intact. While rainforest deforestation is a leading cause of species extinction, the potential of deforestation to flatten gradients and inhibit rainforest diversification has not been previously recognized. More deforestation will likely lead to further flattening of the gradient and loss of diversity, and may limit the ability of species to persist under future environmental conditions."

As a model system, we selected mimetics of a conserved hydrophobic pocket within the N-heptad repeat region of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp41. The human monoclonal antibody, D5, binds to this target and exhibits broadly neutralizing activity against HIV-1. We exploited the antigen-binding property of D5 to select complementary small molecules using a high throughput screen of a diverse chemical collection. The resulting small molecule leads were rendered immunogenic by linking them to a carrier protein and were shown to elicit N-heptad repeat-binding antibodies in a fraction of immunized mice. Plasma from HIV-1-infected subjects shown previously to contain broadly neutralizing antibodies was found to contain antibodies capable of binding to haptens represented in the benzylpiperidine leads identified as a result of the high throughput screen, further validating these molecules as vaccine leads.

Immunologists have a long history of studying the diversity of antibodies and antibody-producing cells. First by empirical observation and subsequently through understanding at the molecular level, the basis for antibody diversity is now well understood (1Burnet F.M.

Polyreactive antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases have been identified, and, in certain cases, the molecular basis for autoreactivity has been linked to unusual antibody structures (e.g. the use of extended CDR3 regions (7Haynes B.F.

Patel H. Berry D. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1252-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)). However, the number and diversity of antigens and epitopes recognized by a given antibody have received very little attention. Previous biomolecule mimotope approaches have often focused on discovery of short peptides as mimetics of polysaccharide, protein, or toxin structures (10Kieber-Emmons T. Murali R. Greene M.I. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Harvey A.J. Gable R.W. Baell J.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Typically, screening approaches utilizing phage display libraries (12Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) have been employed for identification of peptide leads, with further optimization effected through synthetic manipulations of the sequence. Some instances of synthetic combinatorial libraries for di- and isopeptide mimetics have also been described (13Falciani C. Lozzi L. Pini A. Bracci L. Chem.

Although these approaches have generated some measure of success, peptide mimetics of HIV-1 neutralizing antibody targets have thus far not proven to be useful vaccine candidates (14Burton D.R.

We sought to overcome the problems inherent in peptide-based approaches to developing an HIV-1 mimotope vaccine by searching for small molecule haptens that, when conjugated to a heterologous carrier protein, could potentially elicit antibodies similar in specificity and function to the corresponding monoclonal antibody used to screen for the small molecule itself.

Here we exploited the antigen-binding property of D5 to select complementary small molecules using a high throughput screen (HTS) of a diverse chemical collection.

An in vitro binding assay was developed using D5 IgG conjugated to europium chelate (Eu-D5) and a biotinylated gp41 mimetic molecule, 5-helix, that presents the hydrophobic pocket in a stabilized structural context (19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The assay readout is based on a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer format. Biotin-5-helix binds to an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated streptavidin (SA) molecule to form a 5-helix·SA-APC complex. When Eu-D5 binds to the hydrophobic pocket of biotin-5-helix, it brings the europium into close proximity with the APC substrate, resulting in time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer from europium to APC (340-nm excitation, 620-nm (europium) and 665-nm (APC) emission). Agents that interfere with the formation of the complex will cause a decrease in the ratio value. For the HTS screening campaign, the binding reaction was reduced to a 2.5-μl volume with final concentrations of 2.5 nm 5-helix, 1.2 nm Eu-D5, 3 nm SA-APC, 40 μm test compounds and 20-min binding time. For the primary screen, an inhibition cut-off value of 31% was employed, along with the following filter criteria: 1) elimination of biotin-containing compounds, 2) elimination of compounds with undefined side chains (structures containing generic “R” or “X” groups), and 3) elimination of any compounds that scored in more than five unrelated screens. The number of positive compounds identified after application of the filters was 5,679. Two inhibition thresholds were used to score a compound as positive following F19 counter-screening: 1) >25% D5 inhibition and <20% F19 inhibition and 2) D5 inhibition > F19 inhibition + 20%. Using the more stringent filter (the first), 120 hits were identified, whereas 154 hits were found using filter 2. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out using a Biacore A100. Immobilization of all proteins (D5, 5-helix, 6-helix, and a nonspecific IgG1) was performed using amine coupling to a carboxymethylated dextran chip (CM5). Amine coupling on spots 1, 2, 4, and 5 (spot 3 used as reference) of each flow cell was accomplished by activating the chip surface with a 10-min injection of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydrosuccinimide, followed by a 10-min injection of each protein diluted to 10 μg/ml (20 μg/ml for 5-helix) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. Following amine coupling, each surface was quenched with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine. Compounds were tested at 20 and 2 μm in a running buffer of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% p20, and 1% DMSO for screening. Titrations were performed in the running buffer using a 10-point titration starting at 20 μm, including two zero control injections. Compound contact time was 120 s, with a dissociation time of 240 s and a flow rate of 30 μl/min, 25 °C. Following compound injection, the chip surface was regenerated with two 45-s pulses of 1 m NaCl diluted in running buffer. The single compound concentration (20 and 2 μm) data collected were reference-subtracted and DMSO-corrected using Biacore Evaluation software. A compound was defined as a binder if it reached ≥10% of the ligand's maximum binding capacity. Specificity of binding was examined by monitoring binding of compounds to 6-helix (negative control for 5-helix) and the nonspecific IgG1 (negative control for D5). Compounds that were specific binders were titrated to obtain a kinetic profile. Titrations were reference-subtracted and DMSO-corrected using Biacore Evaluation software. Each titration was globally analyzed using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model to obtain the kinetic rate constants (kon and koff). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated from the rate constants. Selected HTS hits were synthesized for confirmation of identity and for use in limited SAR studies. In order to facilitate bioconjugation of haptens to protein carriers, compounds were derivatized with an 6-aminohexanoic acid (Aha) linker coupled to a reactive thiol moiety. Details of the synthesis are provided in supplemental Schemes 1–3. Purified recombinant CRM197 (20Giannini G. Rappuoli R. Ratti G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was maleimidated on a portion of its surface-accessible primary amine groups by reaction with succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Pierce). Briefly, CRM197 was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA (HBS/EDTA) and mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate relative to free amine groups for 3 h at 22 °C. The maleimidated protein was purified from reaction components by desalting on a HiPrep 26/10 column (GE Biosciences) equilibrated in HBS/EDTA. Maleimide incorporation was quantified by measuring the free thiol consumption of N-acetylcysteine. The average derivatization was 139 nmol of maleimide/mg of CRM197. Thiolated haptens were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and subsequently mixed with maleimidated CRM197 (0.25 mg/ml) at a 3:1 molar ratio of thiol/maleimide in HBS/EDTA containing 10% ethanol. The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at 22 °C for 2 h, at which time any precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatant was dialyzed for 24 h at 22 °C against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.15 m sodium chloride and then concentrated ∼4-fold using a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane. Conjugation efficiency was determined by amino acid analysis for quantitation of 6-aminohexanoic acid, and S-dicarboxyethylcysteine, a unique residue generated by formation of a covalent bond between hapten and carrier (21Nahas D.D. Palladino J.S. Joyce J.G. Hepler R.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 4–5-week-old female Balb/c mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY) were maintained in the animal facilities of Merck Research Laboratories in accordance with institutional guidelines. All animal experiments were approved by the Merck Research Laboratories Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hapten-CRM197 conjugates were formulated with 450 μg of Merck aluminum adjuvant and 0.5 mg of IMO-2055 (Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) per ml in PBS. Mice (10 mice/group) were immunized intramuscularly with 100 μl of the vaccine containing 25 μg of total conjugate protein four times at 2-week intervals. Serum samples obtained from tail vein venipuncture were collected in Microtainer® serum separator tubes (BD Biosciences) preimmunization and at weeks 4, 6, and 8. Serum samples were stored at −20 °C until tested. Binding activity of mouse antisera were carried out by ELISA. 96-well streptavidin-coated Reacti-Bind plates (Pierce) were coated with 50 μl/well biotinylated test antigens, including individual haptens and 5-helix; alternatively, uncoated Maxisorp Immunoplate plates (Nunc) were coated with 50 μl/well non-biotinylated test antigens, including (CCIZN17)3. To quantitate antibodies that recognized the Aha linker, a non-relevant biotinylated influenza peptide, HA022B (Ac-Aha-EGPAKLLKERGFFGAIAGFLEE-CONH2), was used as coating antigen. In addition, mouse antisera were tested against CRM197 alone. Each substrate was coated at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (or 4 μg/ml for HA022B) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 3% skim milk in PBST (milk-PBST). Mouse test antiserum (100 μl/well) was prepared in milk-PBST starting at 1:100 dilution, followed by serial 5-fold dilutions, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After six washes with PBST, 50 μl of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:5000 dilution in milk-PBST was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were washed six times, followed by the addition of 100 μl/well SuperBlu™ 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Virolabs, Chantilly, VA). After a 3–5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop solution for TMB (Virolabs) per well. Plates were read at 450 nm in a microplate reader. Titers were determined by the reciprocal of the dilution that was above background plus two S.D. values. Plasma from a well characterized panel of HIV-1-infected subjects with documented broadly neutralizing antibody activity (22Binley J.M. Lybarger E.A. Crooks E.T. Seaman M.S. Gray E. Davis K.L.

Virol. 2008; 82: 11651-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and plasma from 10 control subjects were tested for binding to biotinylated haptens, 5-helix, and control antigens. For biotinylated antigens, Neutravidin-coated plates (Pierce) were used instead of Streptavidin-coated plates because the latter gave high background responses with the HIV-1 plasmas. Neutravidin plates were washed three times, and then 50 μl of test antigens at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (or 4 μg/ml for HA022B) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed six times with PBST and blocked with milk-PBST. Plasma samples were diluted 1:500 in milk-PBST and then added at 100 μl/well. The plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then washed six times with PBST. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (γ chain-specific) secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:2000 dilution in milk-PBST was added at 50 μl/well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were washed six times followed by the addition of 100 μl/well SuperBlu™ TMB solution. After a 3–5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl/well of stop solution for TMB. Results are presented as A450 nm, and samples with A value >3 times the mean A value of control plasma samples tested against the HA022B peptide are highlighted. The D5 competitive binding assay (DCBA) used as the basis for HTS is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Monoclonal antibody D5 specifically recognizes and binds to a well characterized hydrophobic pocket contained within the NHR domain of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41. This binding blocks the intramolecular folding of gp41 into a six-helix bundle structure that is essential for membrane fusion and viral entry. A protein mimetic of the NHR trimer, termed 5-helix (19Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), was used as the ligand for D5, and the assay was based on inhibition of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from europium-labeled D5 to APC-labeled 5-helix. The HTS conducted with a Merck screening library of >1.5 million small molecule compounds resulted in 5679 “hits” that disrupted the FRET signal. To eliminate compounds that caused nonspecific inhibition, a counterscreen was conducted using F19, a non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that binds to 5-helix outside of the hydrophobic pocket. As shown in Fig. 2A, the counterscreen was highly efficient and reduced the number of specific hits to 154, a manageable number for additional validation studies. The HTS could potentially identify two classes of compounds: NHR pocket binders, which might serve as novel fusion inhibitors (class I), and D5 binders, which mimic the NHR hydrophobic pocket presented by 5-helix and which might serve as the basis for a novel vaccine approach (class II). In order to discriminate between class I and class II binders, compounds were assessed for binding to D5 or 5-helix by SPR (supplemental Fig. S1). Unexpectedly, nearly all of the hits were class II compounds, with only four molecules showing specific binding to 5-helix. Approximately 120 molecules were confirmed by SPR to bind specifically to D5 and to have no binding to control antigens consisting of a human IgG1 isotype-matched to D5 and 6-helix, an analog of 5-helix lacking the NHR binding pocket. Three major structural classes could be distinguished, representing ∼60% of the specific hits, and examples of each class are shown in Fig. 2B.FIGURE 2HTS results and counter screen to identify specific leads. A, approximately 1.5 million compounds from the Merck screening library were run in DCBA at 40 mm to identify molecules that inhibit the binding of Eu-D5 to biotinylated 5-helix. The screen identified 5,679 compounds that disrupted the FRET signal with >31% inhibition (see “Experimental Procedures” for details on hit criteria). Presumptive hits were retested in the DCBA using both Eu-D5 and Eu-F19, a non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that binds to 5-helix outside of the hydrophobic pocket. The counterscreen efficiently reduced the number of D5-specific hits to 154. B, examples of the three most represented structural classes (percentage of compounds in confirmed hits), which represent ∼60% of the specific HTS hits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Selection of molecules for limited SAR was based on evaluation of kinetic binding parameters obtained by SPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, HTS hits exhibited a wide range of binding kinetics to D5. Although compounds with high binding affinity (low KD) were preferred, special emphasis was placed on choosing molecular cores with the fastest on-rates because a slower association rate could reflect considerable conformational change required for the ligand to bind to D5, thus diminishing the conformational space resembling the native HIV-1 protein. Based on a combination of these parameters, compounds from the benzylpiperidine series (23Yang L. Morriello G. Patchett A.A. Leung K. Jacks T. Cheng K. Schleim K.D. Feeney W. Chan W.W. Chiu S.H. Smith R.G. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2439-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were chosen for further optimization. Second round screening of a library of benzylpiperidines followed by a limited SAR optimization focused on the Western aromatic and urea motifs (data not shown) afforded compounds 4–8 (Fig. 3B). In order to render a small molecule hapten immunogenic, it must first be covalently coupled with a carrier protein to provide helper T cell epitopes required for generation of antibodies. The haptens must be derivatized in such a way as to preserve the ability to represent the native antigen and bind the antibody while providing a linker to the protein carrier. Computational chemistry studies were utilized to model binding of select haptens to D5 as a mimetic of 5-helix. Using so-called sphere points, which were chosen to serve as mimotopes of the critical residues in gp41, conformations of the haptens were docked in and ranked using the FLOG algorithm (24Miller M.D. Kearsley S.K. Underwood D.J. Sheridan R.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The published crystal structure of D5 bound to 5-helix (18Luftig M.A. Mattu M. Di Giovine P. Geleziunas R. Hrin R. Barbato G. Bianchi E. Miller M.D. Pessi A. Carfí A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was used in all modeling studies. An N-Boc aminohexanoic acid motif (Aha-Boc) attached to the hapten ligand was used to represent the linked carrier for modeling and binding studies. The epitope for D5 antibody binding lies in the hydrophobic pocket region located near the carboxyl-terminal half of the NHR trimer. Amino acids Leu568, Trp571, and Lys574 of gp41 (strain HXB2 numbering) are critical for antibody binding, whereas Val570 contributes to a lesser extent. In the pose shown in Fig. 3C, Aha-Boc-derivatized compound 6 (aqua) is shown overlaid on the three 5-helix residues (gold) that make critical contacts in the CDR pocket of D5. Importantly, the region of the hapten incorporating the Aha-Boc spacer arm is predicted to point away from the contact residues of the antibody-combining site. Accordingly, parental compounds 4–8 were prepared as their Aha and Aha-Boc derivatives, and their binding to D5 was confirmed by SPR, with no loss of affinity observed (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2). CRM197, a mutant diphtheria toxin (20Giannini G. Rappuoli R. Ratti G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), was used as the carrier protein for conjugation of compounds 4–8. Covalent coupling between hapten and protein was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) and identification of S-dicarboxyethylcysteine by quantitative amino acid analysis (data not shown). Typical hapten loading on carrier protein was ∼15% (w/w). Groups of 10 BALB/c mice were immunized with individual conjugates four times at biweekly intervals with 25 μg of total protein co-formulated with Merck aluminum adjuvant and a TLR-9 agonist (IMO-2055), and an additional group received a mixture of all five conjugates dosed at 5 μg of each component. A peptide mimetic, (CCIZN17)3, which presents the HIV-1 NHR hydrophobic pocket in the context of a structured and highly thermostable trimer (25Bianchi E. Finotto M. Ingallinella P. Hrin R. Carella A.V. Hou X.S. Schleif W.A. Miller M.D. Geleziunas R. Pessi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12903-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control for the mouse immunogenicity studies. The results shown in Table 1 indicate that the hapten-carrier conjugates elicited very high titered antibodies to individual self-haptens and that the antisera cross-reacted strongly to each heterologous hapten. We tested the sera for binding to 5-helix because the NHR pocket was the only common sequence element present in both (CCIZN17)3 and 5-helix. We found that ∼90% of individual serum samples were negative for binding to 5-helix, even after 4 doses; however, 7 of 60 individual serum samples from the conjugate-immunized mice did show detectable binding to 5-helix (Fig. 5). All mice immunized with (CCIZN17)3 produced detectable antibodies to 5-helix, although the geometric mean titer to 5-helix was >10-fold lower than that to the immunizing peptide (Table 1), similar to the observation with the hapten-carrier conjugates.TABLE 1Antibody response to hapten-CRM197 conjugates in miceImmunogenPost-dose 4 GMT to plates coated with4-Biotin5-Biotin6-Biotin7-Biotin8-Biotin5-Helix-biotin(CCIZN17)31/dilution4-CRM197569,832572,349390,902577,991660,79885615-CRM197351,550721,3661,141,213939,1581,003,87579506-CRM197240,282237,640670,769323,664989,40954507-CRM197259,769214,699305,457254,665191,63164608-CRM197147,705226,279270,264255,218328,0736550Mixture of 4–8-CRM197243,350232,811360,402276,403425,0117350CRM1972341501401601835050CC(IZN17)3507450505453,459782,845 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Antibody responses to hapten-CRM197 conjugates in mice. 5-fold serial dilutions of serum (starting at 1:100) were added to the wells of 96-well streptavidin plates coated with biotinylated 5-helix.

To do this, we tested a panel of plasma samples from HIV-1-infected individuals that were previously shown to contain broadly neutralizing antibody responses against clade B and C viruses (22Binley J.M. Lybarger E.A. Crooks E.T. Seaman M.S. Gray E. Davis K.L. Decker J.M. Wycuff D. Harris L. Hawkins N. Wood B. Nathe C. Richman D. Tomaras G.D. Bibollet-Ruche F. Robinson J.E. Morris L. Shaw G.M. Montefiori D.C. Mascola J.R. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 11651-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in the DCBA. As shown in Table 2, 18 of 19 plasmas had IC50 values (reciprocal dilution with 50% inhibition) of ≥20, suggesting the presence of D5-like antibodies. The HIV-1 plasmas were also screened for the ability to bind directly to 5-helix and to biotinylated haptens 4-8 as well as to HA022B, a non-relevant influenza virus peptide conjugated to biotin using the same chemistry as was employed for preparation of the hapten-carrier conjugates, which served as a control for nonspecific recognition of the Aha linker portion of the conjugate. When tested at a dilution of 1:500, plasma from 16 of 19 HIV-1-infected subjects was found to contain antibodies that bound to at least one of the benzylpiperidine haptens with an A450 nm value >3-fold above the average background response of 12 non-infected control plasma samples. The results suggest that the benzylpiperidine haptens may be relevant mimotopes for the induction of D5-like antibodies.TABLE 2Antibody binding to biotinylated haptens in plasma from HIV-1-infected subjects and controls as measured by ELISAHuman plasmaHIV-neutralizing activityDCBA IC50Antigen on ELISA plate4- Biotin5-Biotin6-Biotin7-Biotin8-Biotin5-Helix-biotinHA022B-biotin (control)1/dilutionZ 1648+260.710.810.411.280.102.580.10Z 1652+4100.610.830.641.690.152.620.17Z 1686+2070.930.670.521.490.202.540.17Z 1702+200.130.120.130.180.101.750.10BB8+<200.840.430.341.420.282.350.31BB12+300.690.250.200.680.122.540.12BB14+660.790.490.281.000.232.330.24BB21+4980.830.760.451.720.162.370.15BB24+750.450.320.180.930.152.510.10BB28+600.510.500.341.610.242.560.18BB34+570.590.630.491.330.342.130.29BB47+410.660.500.321.490.172.300.16B55+27320.830.580.541.170.302.620.21BB68+720.410.420.210.660.162.510.18B75+6850.790.650.741.190.282.470.17BB80+4170.310.400.350.920.192.380.18BB81+5920.350.260.311.220.202.340.15BB105+920.410.630.671.770.492.300.29B107+460.240.370.150.970.112.220.11Z 0210−<200.560.540.440.990.360.140.32Z 0211−<200.410.400.430.480.360.120.3352407NTNT0.150.480.170.200.130.100.1451749NTNT0.150.170.180.140.120.100.1152975NTNT0.120.200.140.190.120.110.1052898NTNT0.270.490.450.240.150.140.29M6397NTNT0.190.120.090.100.070.070.24M6429NTNT0.530.280.260.350.230.210.2253354NTNT0.210.220.230.250.210.210.2552407NTNT0.150.520.170.220.130.100.14M5360NTNT0.110.160.110.430.100.100.1252908NTNT0.460.440.570.420.410.430.54 Open table in a new tab Although potent broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 have been identified, construction of complementary immunogens has been problematic (14Burton D.R.

This is an inherent problem with peptide-based vaccines due to rotational flexibility of peptide bonds. Attempts have been made to constrain HIV-1 peptide mimetics into coiled coil trimers by adding non-HIV-1 sequences, such as the GCN4 sequence from yeast zinc finger proteins, but with limited success as a vaccine. A second problem is the immunodominance of non-neutralizing epitopes, which is an issue during natural infection as well as for vaccine constructs that may contain non-native features added to provide structure to the immunogen. Because of their size, small molecule haptens display a much more limited amount of molecular flexibility when compared with an extended polypeptide sequence (29Dias R.L. Fasan R. Moehle K. Renard A.

Furthermore, many small molecules comprising screening collections contain a variety of ring systems with a reduced number of rotatable bonds, further restricting the conformational space available to them. For small molecules acting as mimotopes of biomolecules, this restricted structural flexibility offers a potential advantage from an immunological viewpoint in terms of conformational display because a larger fraction of the response could be directed toward the biologically relevant epitope. Additionally, the small size of the mimotope may reduce misdirection of the immune response to non-neutralizing epitopes. Although only a small fraction of immunized mice responded to benzylpiperidine hapten-carrier conjugates to produce antibodies that cross-reacted with 5-helix, the results from this investigation provide proof of concept that small molecule haptens may be relevant building blocks for a vaccine. It is possible that other hits identified in the current screen would make better mimotopes than those originally selected or that the first set could be further optimized to more completely occupy the antibody combining site or to increase the affinity for D5. Alternatively, the low response rate may be due to the nature of the D5 binding “pocket,” which is hydrophobic and relatively flat. Epitopes that are more protruding, such as the CD4 binding site epitope on HIV-1 gp120 recognized by the neutralizing mAb 1b12 (33Zhou T. Xu L. Dey B. Hessell A.J. Van Ryk D. Xiang S.H. Yang X. Zhang M.Y. Zwick M.B. Arthos J. Burton D.R. Dimitrov D.S. Sodroski J. Wyatt R. Nabel G.J. Kwong P.D. Nature. 2007; 445: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), might serve as better candidates for selection of small molecule mimotopes. In addition, other HIV-1-neutralizing human mAbs, such as 2F5, 2G12, 4E10, or the newly described PG9 and PG16 broadly neutralizing antibodies (34Walker L.M. Phogat S.K. Chan-Hui P.Y. Wagner D.

Science. 2009; 326: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), might make better or complementary targets for additional HTS experiments. This investigation represents the first attempt to discover potential small molecule vaccine mimetics based on high throughput small molecule library screening. The results show that the combining site of a single monoclonal antibody can accommodate an array of small molecule ligands with different chemical structures and affinities. We further show the utility of using SPR as a tool to select and optimize vaccine leads (e.g. synthesis of molecules with fast on-rates to mimic short lived fusion intermediates). The resulting small molecules can be rendered immunogenic by linking them to a carrier protein as demonstrated here. An optimized set of benzylpiperidine molecules resulting from the screen were conjugated to a carrier protein and shown to elicit antisera capable of binding to the NHR of gp41. Of particular interest, infected human plasma IgG containing broadly neutralizing activity against HIV-1 was found to contain D5-like antibodies capable of binding to haptens generated as a result of the HTS, thus reinforcing their candidacy as vaccine leads.
