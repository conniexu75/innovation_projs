https://openalex.org/W4200191097,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4200287748,"B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a prominent tumor-associated target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we describe the case of a patient with MM who was enrolled in the CARTITUDE-1 trial ( NCT03548207 ) and who developed a progressive movement disorder with features of parkinsonism approximately 3 months after ciltacabtagene autoleucel BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell infusion, associated with CAR-T cell persistence in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and basal ganglia lymphocytic infiltration. We show BCMA expression on neurons and astrocytes in the patient's basal ganglia. Public transcriptomic datasets further confirm BCMA RNA expression in the caudate of normal human brains, suggesting that this might be an on-target effect of anti-BCMA therapy. Given reports of three patients with grade 3 or higher parkinsonism on the phase 2 ciltacabtagene autoleucel trial and of grade 3 parkinsonism in the idecabtagene vicleucel package insert, our findings support close neurological monitoring of patients on BCMA-targeted T cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4200128746,"In a recent phase 3 randomized trial of 700 patients with advanced urothelial cancer (JAVELIN Bladder 100; NCT02603432 ), avelumab/best supportive care (BSC) significantly prolonged overall survival relative to BSC alone as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy. Exploratory biomarker analyses were performed to identify biological pathways that might affect survival benefit. Tumor molecular profiling by immunohistochemistry, whole-exome sequencing and whole-transcriptome sequencing revealed that avelumab survival benefit was positively associated with PD-L1 expression by tumor cells, tumor mutational burden, APOBEC mutation signatures, expression of genes underlying innate and adaptive immune activity and the number of alleles encoding high-affinity variants of activating Fcγ receptors. Pathways connected to tissue growth and angiogenesis might have been associated with reduced survival benefit. Individual biomarkers did not comprehensively identify patients who could benefit from therapy; however, multi-parameter models incorporating genomic alteration, immune responses and tumor growth showed promising predictive utility. These results characterize the complex biologic pathways underlying survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced urothelial cancer and suggest that multiple biomarkers might be needed to identify patients who would benefit from treatment. Biomarker analysis of the phase 3 JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial leads to the development of a multi-parameter model comprising tumor and immune features that might identify patients with advanced urothelial cancer who will benefit from avelumab maintenance therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4200233998,"Primates interact with the world by exploring visual objects; they seek opportunities to view novel objects even when these have no extrinsic reward value. How the brain controls this novelty seeking is unknown. Here we show that novelty seeking in monkeys is regulated by the zona incerta (ZI). As monkeys made eye movements to familiar objects to trigger an opportunity to view novel objects, many ZI neurons were preferentially activated by predictions of novel objects before the gaze shift. Low-intensity ZI stimulation facilitated gaze shifts, whereas ZI inactivation reduced novelty seeking. ZI-dependent novelty seeking was not regulated by neurons in the lateral habenula or by many dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, traditionally associated with reward seeking. But the anterior ventral medial temporal cortex, an area important for object vision and memory, was a prominent source of novelty predictions. These data uncover a functional pathway in the primate brain that regulates novelty seeking."
https://openalex.org/W4200510880,"We report that intra-islet glucagon secreted from α-cells signals through β-cell glucagon and GLP-1 receptors (GcgR and GLP-1R), thereby conferring to rat islets their competence to exhibit first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Thus, in islets not treated with exogenous glucagon or GLP-1, first-phase GSIS is abolished by a GcgR antagonist (LY2786890) or a GLP-1R antagonist (Ex[9-39]). Mechanistically, glucose competence in response to intra-islet glucagon is conditional on β-cell cAMP signaling because it is blocked by the cAMP antagonist prodrug Rp-8-Br-cAMPS-pAB. In its role as a paracrine hormone, intra-islet glucagon binds with high affinity to the GcgR, while also exerting a ""spillover"" effect to bind with low affinity to the GLP-1R. This produces a right shift of the concentration-response relationship for the potentiation of GSIS by exogenous glucagon. Thus, 0.3 nM glucagon fails to potentiate GSIS, as expected if similar concentrations of intra-islet glucagon already occupy the GcgR. However, 10 to 30 nM glucagon effectively engages the β-cell GLP-1R to potentiate GSIS, an action blocked by Ex[9-39] but not LY2786890. Finally, we report that the action of intra-islet glucagon to support insulin secretion requires a step-wise increase of glucose concentration to trigger first-phase GSIS. It is not measurable when GSIS is stimulated by a gradient of increasing glucose concentrations, as occurs during an oral glucose tolerance test in vivo. Collectively, such findings are understandable if defective intra-islet glucagon action contributes to the characteristic loss of first-phase GSIS in an intravenous glucose tolerance test that is diagnostic of type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W4200493623,"The vertebrate left-right axis is specified during embryogenesis by a transient organ: the left-right organizer (LRO). Species including fish, amphibians, rodents and humans deploy motile cilia in the LRO to break bilateral symmetry, while reptiles, birds, even-toed mammals and cetaceans are believed to have LROs without motile cilia. We searched for genes whose loss during vertebrate evolution follows this pattern and identified five genes encoding extracellular proteins, including a putative protease with hitherto unknown functions that we named ciliated left-right organizer metallopeptide (CIROP). Here, we show that CIROP is specifically expressed in ciliated LROs. In zebrafish and Xenopus, CIROP is required solely on the left side, downstream of the leftward flow, but upstream of DAND5, the first asymmetrically expressed gene. We further ascertained 21 human patients with loss-of-function CIROP mutations presenting with recessive situs anomalies. Our findings posit the existence of an ancestral genetic module that has twice disappeared during vertebrate evolution but remains essential for distinguishing left from right in humans."

Currently, however, there are no published studies to assess the knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer in Kazakhstan. This study aimed to assess the awareness of HPV, the knowledge of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer, and the awareness of HPV vaccination among Kazakhstani women visiting gynecological clinics across the country. In addition, the study aimed to identify the factors associated with the awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine and knowledge of HPV as a major cause of cervical cancer. This was a cross-sectional survey-based study with 2,272 women aged between 18-70 years attending gynecological clinics, who were administered paper-based questionnaires. Data analysis included descriptive statistics consisting of mean values, standard deviations, and frequencies, where applicable. Differences in categorical variables between groups were analyzed using the Chi-square test with a significance value of <0.005. Crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% corresponding confidence intervals were calculated in regression analysis using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. The mean age of participants was 36.33±10.09 years. More than half (53%) of the participants had been screened for cervical cancer. Among those who were aware of HPV, 46% knew that HPV causes cervical cancer and 52% were aware of the HPV vaccine. The key factors related to outcome variables were age, ethnicity, education, family, number of deliveries, and menarche. From a subgroup analysis, results from the HPV test and Pap smear test were factors related to dependent variables such as awareness of HPV and awareness of HPV vaccination."

https://openalex.org/W4200314471,"Studies concerning the risk of metabolic syndrome associated with night work have shown inconsistent findings, due to imprecise working time data and cross-sectional design. We used register-based daily working time data to examine the risk of incident metabolic syndrome associated with night shift work.Working time data collected between 2010 and 2018 of 5775 Taiwanese hospital workers were used to identify night shift workers and to calculate the number of night shifts. Metabolic syndrome was identified by annual occupational health examination results, which were linked to the working time data. Logistic regression models and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between night shift work and metabolic syndrome and the 5 components of metabolic syndrome.Night shift work is associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome (adjusted OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78) and high waist circumference (adjusted OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.78) compared to day work. Among night shift workers, increased number of night shifts was associated with high blood pressure (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.31).Night shift work is associated with metabolic risk factors. Long-term effects of circadian rhythm disruption on metabolic disturbances needs to be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W4200460633,"Patients who recover from nosocomial pneumonia oftentimes exhibit long-lasting cognitive impairment comparable with what is observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. We previously hypothesized that the lung endothelium contributes to infection-related neurocognitive dysfunction, because bacteria-exposed endothelial cells release a form(s) of cytotoxic tau that is sufficient to impair long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. However, the full-length lung and endothelial tau isoform(s) have yet to be resolved and it remains unclear whether the infection-induced endothelial cytotoxic tau triggers neuronal tau aggregation. Here, we demonstrate that lung endothelial cells express a big tau isoform and three additional tau isoforms that are similar to neuronal tau, each containing four microtubule-binding repeat domains, and that tau is expressed in lung capillaries in vivo. To test whether infection elicits endothelial tau capable of causing transmissible tau aggregation, the cells were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infection-induced tau released from endothelium into the medium-induced neuronal tau aggregation in reporter cells, including reporter cells that express either the four microtubule-binding repeat domains or the full-length tau. Infection-induced release of pathological tau variant(s) from endothelium, and the ability of the endothelial-derived tau to cause neuronal tau aggregation, was abolished in tau knockout cells. After bacterial lung infection, brain homogenates from WT mice, but not from tau knockout mice, initiated tau aggregation. Thus, we conclude that bacterial pneumonia initiates the release of lung endothelial-derived cytotoxic tau, which is capable of propagating a neuronal tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W4200082990,"The long-standing hypothesis that emotions rely on bodily states is back in the spotlight. This has led some researchers to suggest that alexithymia, a personality construct characterized by altered emotional awareness, reflects a general deficit in interoception. However, tests of this hypothesis have relied on heterogeneous assessment methods, leading to inconsistent results. To shed some light on this issue, we administered a battery of self-report questionnaires of interoception and alexithymia to three samples from Italy, the U.S., and Singapore (N = 814). Correlation and machine learning analyses showed that alexithymia was associated with deficits in both subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention. Alexithymics’ interoceptive deficits were primarily related to difficulty identifying and describing feelings. Interoception showed a weaker association with externally-oriented thinking as operationalized by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and no association with the affective dimension of alexithymia later introduced by the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ). We discuss our results with reference to the theoretical and psychometric differences between these two measures of alexithymia and their shortcomings. Overall, our results support the view that interoceptive deficits are a core component of alexithymia, although the latter cannot be reduced to the former."
https://openalex.org/W4200167624,"We examined the changes in cognitive function due to restrictions in daily life during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive decline. This was a retrospective, case-control study. The participants include 88 older adults with mild cognitive decline (mean age = 81.0 [standard deviation = 6.5] years) who participated in a class designed to help prevent cognitive decline. This class was suspended from early-March to end of May 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and resumed in June 2020. We collected demographic and cognitive function test data (Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale [TDAS]) before and after class suspension and questionnaire data on their lifestyle and thoughts during the suspension. Change in TDAS scores from before and after the suspension was used to divide the participants into decline (2 or more points worsening) and non-decline (all other participants) groups, with 16 (18.2%) and 72 (81.8%) participants in each group, respectively. A logistic regression model showed that the odds ratio (OR) for cognitive decline was lower in participants whose responses were “engaged in hobbies” (OR = 0.07, p = 0.015), “worked on a worksheet about cognitive training provided by the town hall” (OR = 0.19, p = 0.026), and “had conversations over the phone” (OR = 0.28, p = 0.0495). There was a significant improvement in TDAS scores after class was resumed ( p &lt; 0.01). A proactive approach to intellectual activities and social ties may be important for the prevention of cognitive decline during periods of restrictions due to COVID-19. We found that cognitive function test scores before class suspension significantly improved after resuming classes. We speculate that continued participation in this class led to positive behavioral changes in daily life during periods of restriction due to COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W4200422539,"Apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, are unusual in that each cell contains a single apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle that compartmentalizes enzymes involved in the essential 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The last two enzymatic steps in this organellar pathway require electrons from a redox carrier. However, the small iron-sulfur cluster-containing protein ferredoxin, a likely candidate for this function, has not been investigated in this context. We show here that inducible knockdown of T. gondii ferredoxin results in progressive inhibition of growth and eventual parasite death. Surprisingly, this phenotype is not accompanied by ultrastructural changes in the apicoplast or overall cell morphology. The knockdown of ferredoxin was instead associated with a dramatic decrease in cellular levels of the last two metabolites in isoprenoid biosynthesis, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)- butenyl-4-pyrophosphate, and isomeric dimethylallyl pyrophosphate/isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Ferredoxin depletion was also observed to impair gliding motility, consistent with isoprenoid metabolites being important for dolichol biosynthesis, protein prenylation, and modification of other proteins involved in motility. Significantly, pharmacological inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis of the host cell exacerbated the impact of ferredoxin depletion on parasite replication, suggesting that the slow onset of parasite death after ferredoxin depletion is because of isoprenoid scavenging from the host cell and leading to partial compensation of the depleted parasite metabolites upon ferredoxin knockdown. Overall, these findings show that ferredoxin has an essential physiological function as an electron donor for the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and is a potential drug target for apicomplexan parasites."
https://openalex.org/W4200048612,"There is a lack of research prospectively estimating the age of e-cigarette initiation in U.S. young adults.Secondary analysis of PATH young adults across 2013-2017 (waves 1-4) were conducted. We prospectively estimated age of initiation of: ever, past 30-day, and fairly regular e-cigarette use using weighted interval-censoring survival analyses. Interval-censoring Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, and previous use of six other tobacco products (cigarettes, traditional cigars, filtered cigars, cigarillos, hookah, and smokeless tobacco) were fitted for each of the three e-cigarette initiation outcomes.Among never e-cigarette users, by age 21, 16.8% reported ever use, 7.2% reported past 30-day use, and 2.3% reported fairly regular e-cigarette use. Males had increased risk of initiating ever, past 30-day, and fairly regular e-cigarette use at earlier ages compared to females. Hispanic young adults had increased risk of initiating ever and past 30-day e-cigarette use at earlier ages compared to Non-Hispanic White young adults. Previous use of other tobacco products before e-cigarette initiation increased the risk of an earlier age of e-cigarette initiation.Prevention and education campaigns should focus on young adults in order to alleviate the public health burden of initiating e-cigarette use at earlier ages."
https://openalex.org/W4200567888,"Background HIV outbreaks in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries were characterized by repeated transmission of the HIV variant AFSU, which is now classified as a distinct subtype A sub-subtype called A6. The current study used phylogenetic/phylodynamic and signature mutation analyses to determine likely evolutionary relationship between subtype A6 and other subtype A sub-subtypes. Methods For this study, an initial Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using a total of 553 full-length, publicly available, reverse transcriptase sequences, from A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 sub-subtypes of subtype A. For phylogenetic clustering and signature mutation analysis, a total of 5961 and 3959 pol and env sequences, respectively, were used. Results Phylogenetic and signature mutation analysis showed that HIV-1 sub-subtype A6 likely originated from sub-subtype A1 of African origin. A6 and A1 pol and env genes shared several signature mutations that indicate genetic similarity between the two subtypes. For A6, tMRCA dated to 1975, 15 years later than that of A1. Conclusion The current study provides insights into the evolution and diversification of A6 in the backdrop of FSU countries and indicates that A6 in FSU countries evolved from A1 of African origin and is getting bridged outside the FSU region."
https://openalex.org/W4200180897,"Open appendectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, and non-surgical treatment are three options to treat acute appendicitis during pregnancy. Previous studies on the association of different treatment methods for acute appendicitis with pregnancy outcomes have been limited by small sample sizes and residual confounding, especially with respect to hospital-level factors. This study aimed to investigate the association of treatment method for acute appendicitis with pregnancy outcomes using a multi-level analysis.A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on a large electronic health records database in the United States during the period 2000 to 2016. All pregnancies diagnosed with acute appendicitis and treated in participating hospitals during the study period were included. We conducted multi-level hierarchical logistic regression to analyze both individual- and hospital-level factors for abortion, preterm labor, and cesarean section.A total of 10,271 acute appendicitis during pregnancy were identified during the study period. Of them, 5,872 (57.2%) were treated by laparoscopic appendectomy, 1,403 (13.7%) by open appendectomy, and 2,996 (29.2%) by non-surgical treatment. Compared with open appendectomy, both laparoscopic appendectomy (adjusted OR, 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4, 0.9) and non-surgical treatment (adjusted OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7) showed a decreased risk of preterm labor. Other important individual-level determinants of adverse pregnancy outcomes included maternal age, gestational hypertension, and anemia during pregnancy, the hospital-level determinant included the number of beds.Compared with open appendectomy, both laparoscopic appendectomy and non-surgical treatment may be associated with a lower risk of preterm labor, without increased risks of abortion and cesarean section."
https://openalex.org/W4200512370,"To determine whether dual-energy CT (DECT) has incremental diagnostic value when combined with ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes (LNs) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with PTC between October 2019 and August 2020. US features of LNs to include hyperechogenicity, round shape, microcalcification, cystic component, and homogeneous/peripheral vascularity were considered suggestive of metastasis. The HU of arterial phase (HUarterial) and DECT-derived CT images [contrast media (CM) and areas under the 100 keV monoenergetic curve (AUC100keV)] were measured. Effective atomic numbers (Zeff), iodine concentration (mg/mL), and slope of the HU curve (λHU) were also obtained. The values for metastatic and benign LNs were compared using Student's t-test with false-discovery correction. Logistic regression with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were performed for predicting metastatic LNs.A total of 102 patients were included (49 metastatic and 53 benign LNs; mean age, 46±15 years). Metastatic LNs showed significantly higher values for HUarterial, CM, Zeff, λHU, AUC100keV, and iodine concentration (all, P = 0.001). In logistic regression, the HUarterial demonstrated the highest AUC (0.824; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.751-0.897), followed by CM HU (0.762; 95% CI, 0.679-0.846). Combination of DECT parameters with US features improved the AUC from 0.890 to 0.941.Compared to US features alone, combination with DECT-derived quantitative parameters improved diagnostic performance in predicting metastatic cervical LNs in patients with PTC."
https://openalex.org/W4200593209,"Systematic reviews (SRs) are cornerstones of evidence-based medicine and have contributed significantly to breakthroughs since the 1980's. However, preclinical SRs remain relatively rare despite their many advantages. Since 2011 the Dutch health funding organisation (ZonMw) has run a grant scheme dedicated to promoting the training, coaching and conduct of preclinical SRs. Our study focuses on this funding scheme to investigate the relevance, effects and benefits of conducting preclinical SRs on researchers and their research.We recruited researchers who attended funded preclinical SR workshops and who conducted, are still conducting, or prematurely stopped a SR with funded coaching. We gathered data using online questionnaires followed by semi-structured interviews. Both aimed to explore the impact of conducting a SR on researchers' subsequent work, attitudes, and views about their research field. Data-analysis was performed using Excel and ATLAS.ti.Conducting preclinical SRs had two distinct types of impact. First, the researchers acquired new skills and insights, leading to a change in mindset regarding the quality of animal research. This was mainly seen in the way participants planned, conducted and reported their subsequent animal studies, which were more transparent and of a higher quality than their previous work. Second, participants were eager to share their newly acquired knowledge within their laboratories and to advocate for change within their research teams and fields of interest. In particular, they emphasised the need for preclinical SRs and improved experimental design within preclinical research, promoting these through education and published opinion papers.Being trained and coached in the conduct of preclinical SRs appears to be a contributing factor to many beneficial changes which will impact the quality of preclinical research in the long-term. Our findings suggest that this ZonMw funding scheme is helpful in improving the quality and transparency of preclinical research. Similar funding schemes should be encouraged, preferably by a broader group of funders or financers, in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4200052497,"Females are more affected by psychiatric illnesses including eating disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder than males. However, the neural mechanisms mediating these sex differences are poorly understood. Animal models can be useful in exploring such neural mechanisms. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a behavioral task that assesses how animals process the competition between associated reinforcing and aversive stimuli in subsequent task performance, a process critical to healthy behavior in many domains. The purpose of the present study was to identify sex differences in this behavior and associated neural responses. We hypothesized that females would value the rewarding stimulus (Boost®) relative to the aversive stimulus (LiCl) more than males in performing CTA. We evaluated behavior (Boost® intake, LiCl-induced behaviors, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), CTA performance) and Fos activation in relevant brain regions after the acute stimuli [acute Boost® (AB), acute LiCl (AL)] and the context-only task control (COT), Boost® only task (BOT) and Boost®-LiCl task (BLT). Acutely, females drank more Boost® than males but showed similar aversive behaviors after LiCl. Females and males performed CTA similarly. Both sexes produced 55 kHz USVs anticipating BOT and inhibited these calls in the BLT. However, more females emitted both 22 kHz and 55 kHz USVs in the BLT than males: the latter correlated with less CTA. Estrous cycle stage also influenced 55 kHz USVs. Fos responses were similar in males and females after AB or AL. Females engaged the gustatory cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA) more than males during the BOT and males engaged the amygdala more than females in both the BOT and BLT. Network analysis of correlated Fos responses across brain regions identified two unique networks characterizing the BOT and BLT, in both of which the VTA played a central role. In situ hybridization with RNAscope identified a population of D1-receptor expressing cells in the CeA that responded to Boost® and D2 receptor-expressing cells that responded to LiCl. The present study suggests that males and females differentially process the affective valence of a stimulus to produce the same goal-directed behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4200245161,"Carbon Storage Regulator A (CsrA) is a well-characterized post-transcriptional global regulator that plays a critical role in response to environmental changes in many bacteria. CsrA has been reported to regulate several metabolic pathways, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence-associated genes. The role of csrA in Leptospira spp., which are able to survive in different environmental niches and infect a wide variety of reservoir hosts, has not been characterized. To investigate the role of csrA as a gene regulator in Leptospira, we generated a L. biflexa csrA deletion mutant (ΔcsrA) and csrA overexpressing Leptospira strains. The ΔcsrA L. biflexa displayed poor growth under starvation conditions. RNA sequencing revealed that in rich medium only a few genes, including the gene encoding the flagellar filament protein FlaB3, were differentially expressed in the ΔcsrA mutant. In contrast, 575 transcripts were differentially expressed when csrA was overexpressed in L. biflexa. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed the RNA-seq data in the ΔcsrA mutant, showing direct binding of recombinant CsrA to flaB3 mRNA. In the pathogen L. interrogans, we were not able to generate a csrA mutant. We therefore decided to overexpress csrA in L. interrogans. In contrast to the overexpressing strain of L. biflexa, the overexpressing L. interrogans strain had poor motility on soft agar. The overexpressing strain of L. interrogans also showed significant upregulation of the flagellin flaB1, flaB2, and flaB4. The interaction of L. interrogans rCsrA and flaB4 was confirmed by EMSA. Our results demonstrated that CsrA may function as a global regulator in Leptospira spp. under certain conditions that cause csrA overexpression. Interestingly, the mechanisms of action and gene targets of CsrA may be different between non-pathogenic and pathogenic Leptospira strains."
https://openalex.org/W4200284911,"Apathy is defined as reduction of goal-directed behaviors and a common nuisance syndrome of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disease. The underlying mechanism of apathy implicates changes of the front-striatal circuit, but its precise alteration is unclear for apathy in healthy aged people. The aim of our study is to investigate how the frontal-striatal circuit is changed in elderly with apathy using resting-state functional MRI. Eighteen subjects with apathy (7 female, 63.7 ± 3.0 years) and eighteen subjects without apathy (10 female, 64.8 ± 3.0 years) who underwent neuropsychological assessment and MRI measurement were recruited. We compared functional connectivity with/within the striatum between the apathy and non-apathy groups. The seed-to-voxel group analysis for functional connectivity between the striatum and other brain regions showed that the connectivity was decreased between the ventral rostral putamen and the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area in the apathy group compared to the non-apathy group while the connectivity was increased between the dorsal caudate and the left sensorimotor area. Moreover, the ROI-to-ROI analysis within the striatum indicated reduction of functional connectivity between the ventral regions and dorsal regions of the striatum in the apathy group. Our findings suggest that the changes in functional connectivity balance among different frontal-striatum circuits contribute to apathy in elderly."

In this study, we investigated regional, occupational, age and sex-related differences in hepatitis B epidemiology in Lao blood donors.5017 voluntary blood donors from 8 different provinces were tested for hepatitis B markers by ELISA. Predictors for the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against the core antigen (anti-HBc) were assessed by bivariate and multivariable analyses.In total, 41% of the participants were positive for anti-HBc; the HBsAg prevalence was estimated at 6.9% among all participants (9.2% among first-time donors and 3.9% among repeat donors). Among first-time donors, HBsAg positivity was associated independently with being male (p<0.001), being from the North (p<0.001) and being soldier (p<0.001). Participants were more likely to be anti-HBc positive when they were male (p<0.001), from the Northern provinces (p<0.001) and older than 20 years (p<0.01).In conclusion, our study confirmed an overall high HBsAg and anti-HBc prevalence in Lao PDR, albeit with considerable regional variation. The identification of a sizeable number of HBsAg positives among repeat donors warrants a thorough investigation of current blood screening, record keeping, donor identification and counselling practises."
https://openalex.org/W4200357501,"Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most common mental disorders, it takes up to 17 years for patients with OCD to receive adequate therapy. According to existing outdated literature, this study aimed to investigate the current duration between symptom onset and diagnosis and between diagnosis and the beginning of therapy separately.In a cross-sectional study, N = 100 patients diagnosed with OCD undergoing treatment in a psychiatric outpatient department were assessed, using self-report questionnaires on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Based on self-reported information, the durations between age at symptom onset and age at diagnosis, and between age at diagnosis and beginning of therapy were calculated. To investigate associated factors, two subgroups of patients, one with a short duration between symptom onset and diagnosis < 7 years, and another with a long duration between symptom onset and diagnosis ≥ 7 years, respectively, were compared.Patients reported first symptoms of OCD at a mean age of 18.72 years. The mean duration between age at symptom onset and age at diagnosis was 12.78 years and the mean duration between age at diagnosis and the beginning of therapy was 1.45 years. Subgroup comparison indicated that patients with a short duration between symptom onset and diagnosis were significantly younger than patients with a long duration. However, patients with a short duration between symptom onset and diagnosis were at an older age when they reported first symptoms of OCD. Further, they showed less severe symptoms of OCD, higher functioning levels, and less self-stigmatization than patients with a long duration. It can be concluded that the duration until patients with OCD are diagnosed correctly and receive adequate treatment is still very long. Therefore, the duration between symptom onset and diagnosis should be shortened. Further, the duration between diagnosis and the beginning of therapy could be a good additional approach to reduce the overall duration of untreated disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4200478128,"Disturbance of the dynamic balance between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, controlled by protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), is known to lead to the development of cancer. While most approved targeted cancer therapies are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PTPs have long been stigmatized as undruggable and have only recently gained renewed attention in drug discovery. One PTP target is the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 is implicated in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance, primarily because of its role as a signaling nexus of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, acting upstream of the small GTPase Ras. Efforts to develop small molecules that target SHP2 are ongoing, and several SHP2 allosteric inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors. However, while the reported allosteric inhibitors are highly effective against cells expressing WT SHP2, none have significant activity against the most frequent oncogenic SHP2 variants that drive leukemogenesis in several juvenile and acute leukemias. Here, we report the discovery of novel furanylbenzamide molecules as inhibitors of both WT and oncogenic SHP2. Importantly, these inhibitors readily cross cell membranes, bind and inhibit SHP2 under physiological conditions, and effectively decrease the growth of cancer cells, including triple-negative breast cancer cells, acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing either WT or oncogenic SHP2, and patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells. These novel compounds are effective chemical probes of active SHP2 and may serve as starting points for therapeutics targeting WT or mutant SHP2 in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4200504503,"The present study aims to analyze the effectiveness of ovitraps in the capture of Hg leucocelaenus eggs and evaluate the influence of the dry and rainy seasons on their abundance and hatching rates. The eggs were collected in the Atlantic Forest of State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, an area in which the yellow fever virus is known to circulate. We distributed 15 ovitraps in three sampling points, with five ovitraps per point. We distributed 15 ovitraps in three sampling points on trees within a forested area, which were sequentially numbered, monitored, and replaced every two weeks from October 2016 to April 2018. There was a high dominance of Hg. leucocelaenus eggs (98.4%) and a variation in egg hatching rates between the wet and dry seasons. These rates were 1.5 times higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The rainy season also showed a greater abundance of eggs and higher values of ovitrap positivity and egg density indexes in the installed ovitraps. The abundances of Hg. leucocelaenus eggs were positively correlated with mean monthly temperature and air humidity but not significantly correlated with accumulated precipitation. These results, as well as their implications for the possible use of ovitraps to monitor vector mosquitoes of yellow fever in the study region, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4200279871,"Sub-threshold autistic traits are common in the general population. Children with sub-threshold autistic traits have difficulties with social adaptation. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is associated with the development of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2710102 (G/A) of CNTNAP2 is suggested to contribute to sub-threshold social impairments and intellectual disabilities. We recruited 67 children with Autistic disorder (AD) (49 boys, 18 girls, aged 38-98 months) and 57 typically developing (TD) children (34 boys, 23 girls, aged 53-90 months). We assessed the participants' intelligence and social reciprocity using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from the buccal mucosa and genotyped for rs2710102. A chi-square test revealed a significant association between genotype and group [χ2(2) = 6.56, p = 0.038]. When a co-dominant model was assumed, the results from linear regression models demonstrated that TD children with A-carriers (AA + AG) presented higher SRS T-scores [t(55) = 2.11, p = 0.039] and lower simultaneous processing scale scores of K-ABC [t(55) = -2.19, p = 0.032] than those with GG homozygotes. These associations were not significant in children with ASD. TD children with the rs2710102 A-allele may have more sub-threshold autistic traits than those with GG homozygotes, reflected in higher SRS scores and lower simultaneous processing scale scores. These results support the use of genetic evidence to detect sub-threshold autistic traits."
https://openalex.org/W4200383298,"Reading is a complex cognitive process that involves primary oculomotor function and high-level activities like attention focus and language processing. When we read, our eyes move by primary physiological functions while responding to language-processing demands. In fact, the eyes perform discontinuous twofold movements, namely, successive long jumps (saccades) interposed by small steps (fixations) in which the gaze ""scans"" confined locations. It is only through the fixations that information is effectively captured for brain processing. Since individuals can express similar as well as entirely different opinions about a given text, it is therefore expected that the form, content and style of a text could induce different eye-movement patterns among people. A question that naturally arises is whether these individuals' behaviours are correlated, so that eye-tracking while reading can be used as a proxy for text subjective properties. Here we perform a set of eye-tracking experiments with a group of individuals reading different types of texts, including children stories, random word generated texts and excerpts from literature work. In parallel, an extensive Internet survey was conducted for categorizing these texts in terms of their complexity and coherence, considering a large number of individuals selected according to different ages, gender and levels of education. The computational analysis of the fixation maps obtained from the gaze trajectories of the subjects for a given text reveals that the average ""magnetization"" of the fixation configurations correlates strongly with their complexity observed in the survey. Moreover, we perform a thermodynamic analysis using the Maximum-Entropy Model and find that coherent texts were closer to their corresponding ""critical points"" than non-coherent ones, as computed from the Pairwise Maximum-Entropy method, suggesting that different texts may induce distinct cohesive reading activities."
https://openalex.org/W4200521790,"The relationship between electrode-nerve interface (ENI) estimates and inter-subject differences in speech performance with sequential and simultaneous channel stimulation in adult cochlear implant listeners were explored. We investigated the hypothesis that individuals with good ENIs would perform better with simultaneous compared to sequential channel stimulation speech processing strategies than those estimated to have poor ENIs.Fourteen postlingually deaf implanted cochlear implant users participated in the study. Speech understanding was assessed with a sentence test at signal-to-noise ratios that resulted in 50% performance for each user with the baseline strategy F120 Sequential. Two simultaneous stimulation strategies with either two (Paired) or three sets of virtual channels (Triplet) were tested at the same signal-to-noise ratio. ENI measures were estimated through: (I) voltage spread with electrical field imaging, (II) behavioral detection thresholds with focused stimulation, and (III) slope (IPG slope effect) and 50%-point differences (dB offset effect) of amplitude growth functions from electrically evoked compound action potentials with two interphase gaps.A significant effect of strategy on speech understanding performance was found, with Triplets showing a trend towards worse speech understanding performance than sequential stimulation. Focused thresholds correlated positively with the difference required to reach most comfortable level (MCL) between Sequential and Triplet strategies, an indirect measure of channel interaction. A significant offset effect (difference in dB between 50%-point for higher eCAP growth function slopes with two IPGs) was observed. No significant correlation was observed between the slopes for the two IPGs tested. None of the measures used in this study correlated with the differences in speech understanding scores between strategies.The ENI measure based on behavioral focused thresholds could explain some of the difference in MCLs, but none of the ENI measures could explain the decrease in speech understanding with increasing pairs of simultaneously stimulated electrodes in processing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4226079731,"Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been critical to establishing genetic resources for biomedical science. They have been used extensively to study human genetic diversity, genome function, and inform the development of tools and methodologies for augmenting disease genetics research. While the validity of variant callsets from LCLs has been demonstrated for most of the genome, previous work has shown that DNA extracted from LCLs is modified by V(D)J recombination within the immunoglobulin (IG) loci, regions that harbor antibody genes critical to immune system function. However, the impacts of V(D)J on short read sequencing data generated from LCLs has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we used LCL-derived short read sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project (n = 2,504) to identify signatures of V(D)J recombination. Our analyses revealed sample-level impacts of V(D)J recombination that varied depending on the degree of inferred monoclonality. We showed that V(D)J associated somatic deletions impacted genotyping accuracy, leading to adulterated population-level estimates of allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium. These findings illuminate limitations of using LCLs and short read data for building genetic resources in the IG loci, with implications for interpreting previous disease association studies in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W4226080460,"Saprolegniasis is an important disease in freshwater aquaculture, and is associated with oomycete pathogens in the genus Saprolegnia. Early detection of significant levels of Saprolegnia spp. pathogens would allow informed decisions for treatment which could significantly reduce losses. This study is the first to report the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of Saprolegnia spp. and compares it with quantitative PCR (qPCR). The developed protocols targeted the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA and the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CoxI) gene and was shown to be specific only to Saprolegnia genus. This LAMP method can detect as low as 10 fg of S. salmonis DNA while the qPCR method has a detection limit of 2 pg of S. salmonis DNA, indicating the superior sensitivity of LAMP compared to qPCR. When applied to detect the pathogen in water samples, both methods could detect the pathogen when only one zoospore of Saprolegnia was present. We propose LAMP as a quick (about 20-60 minutes) and sensitive molecular diagnostic tool for the detection of Saprolegnia spp. suitable for on-site applications."
https://openalex.org/W4200006703,"In the present study, we aimed to identify the normal hindlimb lymphatic systems in rats and compare them with the detours after lymphatic flow blockage. The lymphatic systems of the hindlimbs of normal rats were investigated via lymphography using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system. The lymphatic vessels were stained using Evans Blue. The lymphatic flow was blocked through lymphatic vessel ligation combined with inguinal and popliteal lymph node dissection. Detours that appeared after 30 days were visualized using lymphography and immunostaining with anti-podoplanin antibodies. Three main results were obtained in the present study. First, the deep medial system, the superficial medial system, a connection between the superficial and deep medial lymphatic systems, and the superficial lateral system, were elucidated. Second, three types of detours, namely the detour of the lateral abdomen, the detour to the lymphatic vessel near the midline of the abdomen, and the detour to the contralateral inguinal lymph node, were identified after lymphatic flow blockage. Lastly, detours were located in the fatty layer above the panniculus carnosus muscle and their lumina were wide. The histology suggested that the detour was a pre-collecting lymphatic vessel. Lymphatic routes in the rat hindlimbs after lymphatic flow blockage were different from those of the normal rat lymphatic system. It was suggested that the detour is a pre-collecting lymphatic vessel and that encouraging its development may be a new method of simple lymphatic drainage."
https://openalex.org/W4200075958,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atrial fibrillation are both major burdens on the health care system worldwide. Several observational studies have reported clinical associations between CKD and atrial fibrillation; however, causal relationships between these conditions remain to be elucidated due to possible bias by confounders and reverse causations. Here, we conducted bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses using publicly available summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (the CKDGen consortium and the UK Biobank) to investigate causal associations between CKD and atrial fibrillation/flutter in the European population. Our study suggested a causal effect of the risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter on the decrease in serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and revealed a causal effect of the risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter on the risk of CKD (odds ratio, 9.39 per doubling odds ratio of atrial fibrillation/flutter; 95% coefficient interval, 2.39-37.0; P = 0.001), while the causal effect of the decrease in eGFR on the risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter was unlikely. However, careful interpretation and further studies are warranted, as the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Further, our sample size was relatively small and selection bias was possible."

The production of the hog industry has been restricted by environmental regulations, which needs to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Based on the data of 29 provinces from 2008 to 2019, this paper aims to use the stochastic frontier analysis method to calculate the cost efficiency of fattening pigs, sows, and piglets in three stages of pig production and focuses on the impact of environmental regulation policies on cost efficiency. The study found that the cost efficiency of fattening pigs, sows, and piglets in China were 0.77, 0.79, and 0.53, respectively, and the efficiency losses were 23%, 21%, and 47%, respectively. The impact of environmental regulation policies on the cost efficiency of fattening pigs showed an ' N ' trend, and the impact on the cost efficiency of sows and piglets showed an inverted ' N ' trend. For fattening pigs, increasing the intensity of environmental regulation, and exceeding the second inflection point of the ' N ' curve can achieve the dual goals of environmental governance and cost reduction and efficiency increase. For sows, reducing the intensity of environmental regulation appropriately can avoid cost-efficiency loss. For piglets, environmental regulation policies have not effectively incentives the cost efficiency of piglets. In addition, raising the level of technology investment in fattening pigs and sows can achieve cost efficiency gains, and can farmers use emerging financial product tools such as ' insurance + futures ' to avoid market risks and efficiency losses."

Especially in sub-Saharan African countries, this coexists with high burden of other infectious diseases, creating a complex public health situation which is difficult to address. Tackling this will require targeted public health intervention based on evidence that well defines the at risk population. In this study, using retrospective data from two referral hospitals in Burundi, we model the risk factors of hypertension in Burundi.Retrospective data of a sample of 353 randomly selected from a population of 4,380 patients admitted in 2019 in two referral hospitals in Burundi: Military and University teaching hospital of Kamenge. The predictive risk factors were carried out by fixed effect logistic regression. Model performance was assessed with Area under Curve (AUC) method. Model was internally validated using bootstrapping method with 2000 replications. Both data processing and data analysis were done using R software.Overall, 16.7% of the patients were found to be hypertensive. This study didn't showed any significant difference of hypertension's prevalences among women (16%) and men (17.7%). After adjustment of the model for cofounding covariates, associated risk factors found were advanced age (40-59 years) and above 60 years, high education level, chronic kidney failure, high body mass index, familial history of hypertension. In absence of these highlighted risk factors, the risk of hypertension occurrence was about 2 per 1000 persons. This probability is more than 90% in patients with more than three risk factors.The relatively high prevalence and associated risk factors of hypertension in Burundi raises a call for concern especially in this context where there exist an equally high burden of infectious diseases, other chronic diseases including chronic malnutrition. Targeting interventions based on these identified risk factors will allow judicious channel of resources and effective public health planning."
https://openalex.org/W4200351552,"In Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), information on school sanitation and menstrual health among secondary school girls is limited. This study aimed to explore knowledge and practices surrounding menstrual health and to identify factors associated with school absence due to menstruation among secondary school girls in Lao PDR. The study involved 1,366 girls from grade 9 to grade 12 in six secondary schools in Luang Prabang Province. Data on socio-demographics and menstrual health of the girls and data on school toilets was collected. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with school absence due to menstruation. The mean age was 15.8 years old. The average age of menarche was 12.9 years old. Of 1,366 girls, 64.6% were shocked or ashamed when they reached menarche and 31.8% had been absent from school due to menstruation in the six months before this study was conducted. Factors associated with school absence due to menstruation were age ≥ 16 years old (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.37-2.34), higher income (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.16-4.87), menstrual anxiety (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.09-2.20), using painkillers (AOR = 4.79, 95% CI 2.96-7.76) and other methods (AOR = 2.82, 95% CI 1.86-4.28) for dysmenorrhea, and disposing used pads in places other than the school's waste bins (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.75). Living with relatives (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95) and schools outside the city (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.90) were significantly less associated with school absence. Although the association between school toilets and school absence was not examined, the results of this study suggest that school toilets should be gender-separated and equipped with waste bins in the toilet. Furthermore, menstrual education should start at elementary schools and teacher training on menstrual health should be promoted."
https://openalex.org/W4200473600,"Thickness of cotton fiber, referred to as fiber maturity, is a key determinant of fiber quality, lint yield, and textile performance. The cotton immature fiber (im) mutant has been used to study fiber maturity since its fiber is thinner than the wild type near isogeneic line (NIL), Texas Marker-1 (TM-1). The im phenotype is caused by a single recessive mutation of a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene that reduces the activity of mitochondrial complex I and up-regulates stress responsive genes. However, the mechanisms altering the stress responses in im mutant are not well understood. Thus, we characterized growth and gas exchange in im and TM-1 under no stress and also investigated their stress responses by comparing gas exchange and transcriptomic profiles under high temperature. Phenotypic differences were detected between the NILs in non-fiber tissues although less pronounced than the variation in fibers. At near optimum temperature (28±3°C), im maintained the same photosynthetic performance as TM-1 by means of greater stomatal conductance. In contrast, under high temperature stress (>34°C), im leaves reduced photosynthesis by decreasing the stomatal conductance disproportionately more than TM-1. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the genes involved in heat stress responses were differentially expressed between the NIL leaves. These results indicate that the im mutant previously reported to have low activity of mitochondrial complex I displays increased thermosensitivity by impacting stomatal conductance. They also support a notion that mitochondrial complex I activity is required for maintenance of optimal photosynthetic performance and acclimation of plants to high temperature stress. These findings may be useful in the future efforts to understand how physiological mechanisms play a role in determining cotton fiber maturity and may influence stress responses in other crops."

Injury risk and severity depends on forces being transmitted through the palmar surface to the upper extremity. Although the magnitude and distribution of forces depend on the soft tissue response of the palm, the in vivo properties of palmar tissue have not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to characterize the large deformation palmar soft tissue properties.In vivo dynamic indentations were conducted on 15 young adults (21-29 years) to quantify the soft tissue characteristics of over the trapezium. The effects of loading rate, joint position, tissue thickness and sex on soft tissue responses were assessed.Energy absorbed by the soft tissue and peak force were affected by loading rate and joint angle. Energy absorbed was 1.7-2.8 times higher and the peak force was 2-2.75 times higher at high rate loading than quasistatic rates. Males had greater energy absorbed than females but not at all wrist positions. Damping characteristics were the highest in the group with the thickest soft tissue while damping characteristics were the lowest in group with the thinnest soft tissues.Palmar tissue response changes with joint position, loading rate, sex, and tissue thickness. Accurately capturing these tissue responses is important for developing effective simulations of fall and injury biomechanics and assessing the effectiveness of injury prevention strategies."

While it is known that plant development is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of light exposure, the specific impact of the different light properties is yet to be fully understood. In this study, using the model plant Arabidopsis, we systematically investigate how six different light properties (i.e., photoperiod, light offset, intensity, phase of dawn, duration of twilight and period) would affect plant development i.e., flowering time and hypocotyl (seedling stem) elongation using an established mathematical model of the plant circadian system relating light input to flowering time and hypocotyl elongation outputs for smart greenhouse application. We vary each of the light properties individually and then collectively to understand their effect on plant development. Our analyses show in comparison to the nominal value, the photoperiod of 18 hours, period of 24 hours, no light offset, phase of dawn of 0 hour, duration of twilight of 0.05 hour and a reduced light intensity of 1% are able to improve by at least 30% in days to flower (from 32.52 days to 20.61 days) and hypocotyl length (from 1.90 mm to 1.19mm) with the added benefit of reducing energy consumption by at least 15% (from 4.27 MWh/year to 3.62 MWh/year). These findings could provide beneficial solutions to the smart greenhouse farming industries in terms of achieving enhanced productivity while consuming less energy."
https://openalex.org/W4225893085,"Metabolic labeling is a widely used tool to investigate different aspects of pre-mRNA splicing and RNA turnover. The labeling technology takes advantage of native cellular machineries where a nucleotide analog is readily taken up and incorporated into nascent RNA. One such analog is 4-thiouridine (4sU). Previous studies demonstrated that the uptake of 4sU at elevated concentrations (&gt;50μM) and extended exposure led to inhibition of rRNA synthesis and processing, presumably induced by changes in RNA secondary structure. Thus, it is possible that 4sU incorporation may also interfere with splicing efficiency. To test this hypothesis, we carried out splicing analyses of pre-mRNA substrates with varying levels of 4sU incorporation (0–100%). We demonstrate that increased incorporation of 4sU into pre-mRNAs decreased splicing efficiency. The overall impact of 4sU labeling on pre-mRNA splicing efficiency negatively correlates with the strength of splice site signals such as the 3’ and the 5’ splice sites. Introns with weaker splice sites are more affected by the presence of 4sU. We also show that transcription by T7 polymerase and pre-mRNA degradation kinetics were impacted at the highest levels of 4sU incorporation. Increased incorporation of 4sU caused elevated levels of abortive transcripts, and fully labeled pre-mRNA is more stable than its uridine-only counterpart. Cell culture experiments show that a small number of alternative splicing events were modestly, but statistically significantly influenced by metabolic labeling with 4sU at concentrations considered to be tolerable (40 μM). We conclude that at high 4sU incorporation rates small, but noticeable changes in pre-mRNA splicing can be detected when splice sites deviate from consensus. Given these potential 4sU artifacts, we suggest that appropriate controls for metabolic labeling experiments need to be included in future labeling experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4200092191,"Mycofactocin (MFT) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally-modified redox cofactor found in pathogenic mycobacteria. While MFT biosynthetic proteins have been extensively characterized, the physiological conditions under which MFT biosynthesis is required are not well understood. To gain insights into the mechanisms of regulation of MFT expression in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, we investigated the DNA-binding and ligand-binding activities of the putative TetR-like transcription regulator, MftR. In this study, we demonstrated that MftR binds to the mft promoter region. We used DNase I footprinting to identify the 27 bp palindromic operator located 5' to mftA and found it to be highly conserved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Mycobacterium marinum. To determine under which conditions the mft biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is induced, we screened for effectors of MftR. As a result, we found that MftR binds to long-chain acyl-CoAs with low micromolar affinities. To demonstrate that oleoyl-CoA induces the mft BGC in vivo, we re-engineered a fluorescent protein reporter system to express an MftA-mCherry fusion protein. Using this mCherry fluorescent readout, we show that the mft BGC is upregulated in M. smegmatis mc2155 when oleic acid is supplemented to the media. These results suggest that MftR controls expression of the mft BGC and that MFT production is induced by long-chain acyl-CoAs. Since MFT-dependent dehydrogenases are known to colocalize with acyl carrier protein/CoA-modifying enzymes, these results suggest that MFT might be critical for fatty acid metabolism or cell wall reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W4200170684,"We have previously developed a unique 8-amino acid Aβ42 oligomer-Interacting Peptide (AIP) as a novel anti-amyloid strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our lead candidate has successfully progressed from test tubes (i.e., in vitro characterization of protease-resistant D-AIP) to transgenic flies (i.e., in vivo rescue of human Aβ42-mediated toxicity via D-AIP-supplemented food). In the present study, we examined D-AIP in terms of its stability in multiple biological matrices (i.e., ex-vivo mouse plasma, whole blood, and liver S9 fractions) using MALDI mass spectrometry, pharmacokinetics using a rapid and sensitive LC-MS method, and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrance in WT C57LB/6 mice. D-AIP was found to be relatively stable over 3 h at 37 °C in all matrices tested. Finally, label-free MALDI imaging showed that orally administered D-AIP can readily penetrate the intact BBB in both male and female WT mice. Based upon the favorable stability, pharmacokinetics, and BBB penetration outcomes for orally administered D-AIP in WT mice, we then examined the effect of D-AIP on amyloid ""seeding"" in vitro (i.e., freshly monomerized versus preaggregated Aβ42). Complementary biophysical assays (ThT, TEM, and MALDI-TOF MS) showed that D-AIP can directly interact with synthetic Aβ42 aggregates to disrupt primary and/or secondary seeding events. Taken together, the unique mechanistic and desired therapeutic potential of our lead D-AIP candidate warrants further investigation, that is, testing of D-AIP efficacy on the altered amyloid/tau pathology in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease."

Although many previous studies worldwide have sought to identify the risk factors for osteoporosis, studies that simultaneously examine a variety of factors, such as biochemical, anthropometric and nutritional components, are very rare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to simultaneously examine the association of osteoporosis with biochemical profiles, anthropometric factors, and nutritional components in a large-scale cross-sectional study.This cross-sectional study was based on data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VI-VII) from 2015 to 2018. Based on data from 16,454 participants, logistic regression was used to examine the association between various parameters in a crude analysis and in models adjusted for confounders.In men, osteoporosis was significantly associated with the anthropometric variables height and weight; the biochemical components hemoglobin, hematocrit, urea nitrogen and urine pH and creatinine; and the nutritional components total food intake, energy, water, protein, phosphorus, and kalium. However, these associations disappeared in adjusted model 2. In women, osteoporosis was significantly related to the anthropometric measures height, weight, and systolic blood pressure; the biochemical components hemoglobin, hematocrit and urine pH; and the nutritional components total food intake, water, calcium, phosphorus, and kalium. Most of these associations were maintained in the adjusted models.Osteoporosis was linked to various anthropometric, biochemical and urine and nutritional components in Korean women, but the association between osteoporosis and risk factors differed according to sex."
https://openalex.org/W4200253599,"Large-scale registries have demonstrated that in-hospital mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) varies widely across institutions. However, whether this variation is related to major procedural complications (e.g., bleeding) is unclear. In this study, institutional variation in in-hospital mortality and its association with PCI-related bleeding complications were investigated. We analyzed 388,866 procedures at 718 hospitals performed from 2017 to 2018, using data from a nationwide PCI registry in Japan. Hospitals were stratified into quintiles according to risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (very low, low, medium, high, and very high). Incidence of bleeding complications, defined as procedure-related bleeding events that required a blood transfusion, and in-hospital mortality in patients who developed bleeding complications were calculated for each quintile. Overall, 4,048 (1.04%) in-hospital deaths and 1,535 (0.39%) bleeding complications occurred. Among patients with bleeding complications, 270 (17.6%) died during hospitalization. In-hospital mortality ranged from 0.22% to 2.46% in very low to very high mortality hospitals. The rate of bleeding complications varied modestly from 0.27% to 0.57% (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–2.39). However, mortality after bleeding complications markedly increased by quintile and was 6-fold higher in very high mortality hospitals than very low mortality hospitals (29.0% vs. 4.8%; odds ratio, 12.2; 95% confidence interval, 6.90–21.7). In conclusion, institutional variation in in-hospital mortality after PCI was associated with procedure-related bleeding complications, and this variation was largely driven by differences in mortality after bleeding complications rather than difference in their incidence. These findings underscore the importance of efforts toward reducing not only bleeding complications but also, even more importantly, subsequent mortality once they have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W4200413085,"The coffee berry borer (CBB) Hypothenemus hampei Ferrari is the most serious pest of coffee worldwide. Management of the CBB is extremely difficult because its entire life cycle occurs inside the fruit, where it is well protected. Knowing which life stages contribute most to population growth, would shed light on the population dynamics of this pest and help to improve CBB management programs. Two staged-classified matrices were constructed for CBB populations reared in the lab on artificial diets and CBB populations from artificial infestations in the field. Matrices were used to determine demographic parameters, to conduct elasticity analyses, and to perform prospective perturbation analysis. Higher values of the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) and population growth rate (λ): were observed for CBB populations growing in the lab than in the field (rm: 0.058, λ: 1.74 lab; rm: 0.053, λ: 1.32 field). Sensitivity values for both CBB populations were highest for the transitions from larva to pupa (G2: 0.316 lab, 0.352 field), transition from pupa to juvenile (G3: 0.345 lab, 0.515 field) and survival of adult females (P5: 0.324 lab, 0.389 field); these three vital rates can be important targets for CBB management. Prospective perturbation analyses indicated that an effective management for the CBB should consider multiple developmental stages; perturbations of >90% for each transition are necessary to reduce λ to <1. However, when the three vital rates with highest sensitivity are impacted at the same time, the percentage of perturbation is reduced to 25% for each transition; with these reductions in survival of larvae, pupae and adult females the value of λ was reduced from 1.32 to 0.96. Management programs for CBB should be focused on the use of biological and cultural measures that are known to affect these three important targets."
https://openalex.org/W4200567939,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi causes typhoid fever. It possesses a Vi antigen capsular polysaccharide coat that is important for virulence and is the basis of a current glycoconjugate vaccine. Vi antigen is also produced by environmental Bordetella isolates, while mammal-adapted Bordetella species (such as Bordetella bronchiseptica) produce a capsule of undetermined structure that cross-reacts with antibodies recognizing Vi antigen. The Vi antigen backbone is composed of poly-α-(1→4)-linked N-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid, modified with O-acetyl residues that are necessary for vaccine efficacy. Despite its biological and biotechnological importance, some central aspects of Vi antigen production are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that TviE and TviD, two proteins encoded in the viaB (Vi antigen production) locus, interact and are the Vi antigen polymerase and O-acetyltransferase, respectively. Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis reveal that TviE is a GT4-family glycosyltransferase. While TviD has no identifiable homologs beyond Vi antigen systems in other bacteria, structural modeling suggests that it belongs to the large SGNH hydrolase family, which contains other O-acetyltransferases. Although TviD possesses an atypical catalytic triad, its O-acetyltransferase function was verified by antibody reactivity and 13C NMR data for tviD-mutant polysaccharide. The B. bronchiseptica genetic locus predicts a mode of synthesis distinct from classical S. enterica Vi antigen production, but which still involves TviD and TviE homologs that are both active in a reconstituted S. Typhi system. These findings provide new insight into Vi antigen production and foundational information for the glycoengineering of Vi antigen production in heterologous bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4226264487,"To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms used by daycares and schools to screen children and adolescents for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed data from a primary care setting.This cohort study included all patients ≤17 years old who were evaluated at Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC; Providence, U.S.), for COVID-19 symptoms and/or exposure, and received SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between March-June 2020. Participants were identified from PCHC electronic medical records. For three age groups- 0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years-we estimated the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of individual symptoms and three symptom combinations: a case definition published by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), and two novel combinations generated by different statistical approaches to maximize sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. We evaluated symptom combinations both with and without consideration of COVID-19 exposure. Myalgia, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, anosmia, and ageusia were not assessed in 0-4 year-olds due to the lower reliability of these symptoms in this group.Of 555 participants, 217 (39.1%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. Fever was more common among 0-4 years-olds (p = 0.002); older children more frequently reported fatigue (p = 0.02). In children ≥5 years old, anosmia or ageusia had 94-98% specificity. In all ages, exposure history most accurately predicted infection. With respect to individual symptoms, cough most accurately predicted infection in <5 year-olds (AUC 0.69) and 12-17 year-olds (AUC 0.62), while headache was most accurate in 5-11 year-olds (AUC 0.62). In combination with exposure history, the novel symptom combinations generated statistically to maximize test characteristics had sensitivity >95% but specificity <30%. No symptom or symptom combination had AUC ≥0.70.Anosmia or ageusia in children ≥5 years old should raise providers' index of suspicion for COVID-19. However, our overall findings underscore the limited diagnostic value of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4200159361,"Podiatrists regularly use scalpels in the management of foot pathologies, yet the teaching and learning of these skills can be challenging. The use of 3D printed foot models presents an opportunity for podiatry students to practice their scalpel skills in a relatively safe, controlled risk setting, potentially increasing confidence and reducing associated anxiety. This study evaluated the use of 3D printed foot models on podiatry students' anxiety and confidence levels and explored the fidelity of using 3D foot models as a teaching methodology.Multiple study designs were used. A repeated measure trial evaluated the effects of a 3D printed foot model on anxiety and confidence in two student groups: novice users in their second year of podiatry studies (n = 24), and more experienced fourth year students completing a workshop on ulcer management (n = 15). A randomised controlled trial compared the use of the 3D printed foot models (n = 12) to standard teaching methods (n = 15) on students' anxiety and confidence in second year students. Finally, a focus group was conducted (n = 5) to explore final year student's perceptions of the fidelity of the foot ulcer models in their studies.The use of 3D printed foot models increased both novice and more experienced users' self-confidence and task self-efficacy; however, cognitive and somatic anxiety was only reduced in the experienced users. All changes were considered large effects. In comparison to standard teaching methods, the use of 3D printed foot models had similar decreases in anxiety and increases in confidence measures. Students also identified the use of 3D foot models for the learning of scalpel skills as 'authentic' and 'lifelike' and led to enhanced confidence prior to assessment of skills in more high-risk situations.Podiatry undergraduate programs should consider using 3D printed foot models as a teaching method to improve students' confidence and reduce their anxiety when using scalpels, especially in instances where face-to-face teaching is not possible (e.g., pandemic related restrictions on face-to-face teaching)."
https://openalex.org/W4200261029,"Panel count data frequently occurs in follow-up studies, such as medical research, social sciences, reliability studies, and tumorigenicity experiences. This type data has been extensively studied by various statistical models with time-invariant regression coefficients. However, the assumption of invariant coefficients may be violated in some reality, and the temporal covariate effects would be of great interest in research studies. This motivates us to consider a more flexible time-varying coefficient model. For statistical inference of the unknown functions, the quantile regression approach based on the B-spline approximation is developed. Asymptotic results on the convergence of the estimators are provided. Some simulation studies are presented to assess the finite-sample performance of the estimators. Finally, two applications of bladder cancer data and US flight delay data are analyzed by the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W4200322358,"Pacemakers are widely utilised to treat bradycardia, but right ventricular (RV) pacing is associated with heightened risk of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and heart failure. We aimed to compare personalised pacemaker reprogramming to avoid RV pacing with usual care on echocardiographic and patient-orientated outcomes.A prospective phase II randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 100 patients with a pacemaker implanted for indications other than third degree heart block for ≥2 years. Personalised pacemaker reprogramming was guided by a published protocol. Primary outcome was change in LV ejection fraction on echocardiography after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included LV remodeling, quality of life, and battery longevity.Clinical and pacemaker variables were similar between groups. The mean age (SD) of participants was 76 (+/-9) years and 71% were male. Nine patients withdrew due to concurrent illness, leaving 91 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 6 months, personalised programming compared to usual care, reduced RV pacing (-6.5±1.8% versus -0.21±1.7%; p<0.01), improved LV function (LV ejection fraction +3.09% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 5.70%; p = 0.02]) and LV dimensions (LV end systolic volume indexed to body surface area -2.99mL/m2 [95% CI -5.69 to -0.29; p = 0.03]). Intervention also preserved battery longevity by approximately 5 months (+0.38 years [95% CI 0.14 to 0.62; p<0.01)) with no evidence of an effect on quality of life (+0.19, [95% CI -0.25 to 0.62; p = 0.402]).Personalised programming in patients with pacemakers for bradycardia can improve LV function and size, extend battery longevity, and is safe and acceptable to patients.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03627585."
