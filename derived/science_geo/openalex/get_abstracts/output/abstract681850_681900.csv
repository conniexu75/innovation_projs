https://openalex.org/W3202931255,"Prime editing enables the installation of virtually any combination of point mutations, small insertions or small deletions in the DNA of living cells. A prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) directs the prime editor protein to the targeted locus and also encodes the desired edit. Here we show that degradation of the 3′ region of the pegRNA that contains the reverse transcriptase template and the primer binding site can poison the activity of prime editing systems, impeding editing efficiency. We incorporated structured RNA motifs to the 3′ terminus of pegRNAs that enhance their stability and prevent degradation of the 3′ extension. The resulting engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs) improve prime editing efficiency 3–4-fold in HeLa, U2OS and K562 cells and in primary human fibroblasts without increasing off-target editing activity. We optimized the choice of 3′ structural motif and developed pegLIT, a computational tool to identify non-interfering nucleotide linkers between pegRNAs and 3′ motifs. Finally, we showed that epegRNAs enhance the efficiency of the installation or correction of disease-relevant mutations. Stabilizing pegRNAs with 3′ RNA structures increases prime editing efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W3204522926,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 1.9% of the world population by May 2, 2021. Since most previous studies that examined risk factors for mortality and severity were based on hospitalized individuals, population-based cohort studies are called for to provide evidence that can be extrapolated to the general population. Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations of comorbidities with mortality and disease severity in individuals with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Ontario, Canada.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada diagnosed between January 15 and December 31, 2020. Cases were linked to health administrative databases maintained in the ICES which covers all residents in Ontario. The primary outcome is all-cause 30-day mortality after the first COVID-19 diagnosis, and the secondary outcome is a composite severity index containing death and hospitalization. To examine the risk factors for the outcomes, we employed Cox proportional hazards regression models and logistic regression models to adjust for demographic, socio-economic variables and comorbidities. Results were also stratified by age groups. A total of 167,500 individuals were diagnosed of COVID-19 in 2020 and included in the study. About half (43.8%, n = 73,378) had at least one comorbidity. The median follow-up period were 30 days. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (24%, n = 40,154), asthma (16%, n = 26,814), and diabetes (14.7%, n = 24,662). Individuals with comorbidity had higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR = 2.80, 95%CI 2.35-3.34; p<0.001), and the risk substantially was elevated from 2.14 (95%CI 1.76-2.60) to 4.81 (95%CI 3.95-5.85) times as the number of comorbidities increased from one to five or more. Significant predictors for mortality included comorbidities such as solid organ transplant (HR = 3.06, 95%CI 2.03-4.63; p<0.001), dementia (HR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.35-1.58; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (HR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.34-1.57; p<0.001), severe mental illness (HR = 1.42, 95%CI%, 1.12-1.80; p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR = 1.22, 95%CI, 1.15-1.30), diabetes (HR = 1.19, 95%, 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), cancer (HR = 1.17, 95%CI, 1.09-1.27; p<0.001), hypertension (HR = 1.16, 95%CI, 1.07-1.26; p<0.001). Compared to their effect in older age groups, comorbidities were associated with higher risk of mortality and severity in individuals under 50 years old. Individuals with five or more comorbidities in the below 50 years age group had 395.44 (95%CI, 57.93-2699.44, p<0.001) times higher risk of mortality compared to those without. Limitations include that data were collected during 2020 when the new variants of concern were not predominant, and that the ICES databases do not contain detailed individual-level socioeconomic and racial variables.We found that solid organ transplant, dementia, chronic kidney disease, severe mental illness, CVD, hypertension, COPD, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, and asthma were associated with mortality or severity. Our study highlights that the number of comorbidities was a strong risk factor for deaths and severe outcomes among younger individuals with COVID-19. Our findings suggest that in addition of prioritizing by age, vaccination priority groups should also include younger population with multiple comorbidities."

https://openalex.org/W3204217818,"Disinhibitory neurons throughout the mammalian cortex are powerful enhancers of circuit excitability and plasticity. The differential expression of neuropeptide receptors in disinhibitory, inhibitory, and excitatory neurons suggests that each circuit motif may be controlled by distinct neuropeptidergic systems. Here, we reveal that a bombesin-like neuropeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), recruits disinhibitory cortical microcircuits through selective targeting and activation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. Using a genetically encoded GRP sensor, optogenetic anterograde stimulation, and trans-synaptic tracing, we reveal that GRP regulates VIP cells most likely via extrasynaptic diffusion from several local and long-range sources. In vivo photometry and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the GRP receptor (GRPR) in auditory cortex indicate that VIP cells are strongly recruited by novel sounds and aversive shocks, and GRP-GRPR signaling enhances auditory fear memories. Our data establish peptidergic recruitment of selective disinhibitory cortical microcircuits as a mechanism to regulate fear memories."
https://openalex.org/W3204962923,"Mapping the localization of multiple proteins in their native three-dimensional (3D) context would be useful across many areas of biomedicine, but multiplexed fluorescence imaging has limited intrinsic multiplexing capability, and most methods for increasing multiplexity can only be applied to thin samples (<100 µm). Here, we harness the narrow spectrum of Raman spectroscopy and introduce Raman dye imaging and tissue clearing (RADIANT), an optical method that is capable of imaging multiple targets in thick samples in one shot. We expanded the range of suitable bioorthogonal Raman dyes and developed a tissue-clearing strategy for them (Raman 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (rDISCO)). We applied RADIANT to image up to 11 targets in millimeter-thick brain slices, extending the imaging depth 10- to 100-fold compared to prior multiplexed protein imaging methods. We showcased the utility of RADIANT in extracting systems information, including region-specific correlation networks and their topology in cerebellum development. RADIANT will facilitate the exploration of the intricate 3D protein interactions in complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W3203108148,"Genotype by environment (G×E) interaction is a major factor limiting the success of germplasm selection and identification of superior genotypes for use in plant breeding programs. Similar to the case in other crops, G×E complicates the improvement of sorghum, and hence it should be determined and used in decision-making programs. The present study aimed at assessing the G×E interaction, and the correlation between traits for superior sorghum genotypes. Three hundred twenty sorghum landraces and four improved varieties were used in alpha lattice experimental design-based field trial across three environments (Melkassa, Mieso and Mehoni) in Ethiopia. Phenotypic data were collected for days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PH), panicle length (PALH), panicle width (PAWD), panicle weight (PAWT) and grain yield (GY). The results revealed that the variance due to genotype, environment and G×E interaction were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) for all traits. GY and PAWT were highly affected by environments and G×E whereas DTF, PALH, PAWD and PH were mainly affected by genotypic variation. Therefore, multi-environment testing is needed for taking care of G × E interaction to identify high yielding and stable sorghum landraces. GY and PAWT revealed highly significant positive correlations indicating the possibility of effective selection of the two traits simultaneously. Among the studied populations, South Wello, West Hararghe and Shewa zones had highly diverse genotypes that were distributed across all clusters. Hence, these areas can be considered as hotspots for identifying divergent sorghum landraces that could be used in breeding programs. Melkassa was the most representative environment whereas Mieso was the most discriminating. Five genotypes (G148, G123, G110, G203 and G73) were identified as superior across the test environments for grain yield with farmer-preferred trait, such as plant height. The identified stable and high yielding genotypes are valuable genetic resources that should be used in sorghum breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3202989975,"How effective have lockdowns been at reducing the covid-19 infection and mortality rates? Lockdowns influence contact among persons within or between populations including restricting travel, closing schools, prohibiting public gatherings, requiring workplace closures, all designed to slow the contagion of the virus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of lockdown measures on the spread of covid-19 and test a theoretical model of the covid-19 pandemic employing structural equation modelling.Lockdown variables, population demographics, mortality rates, infection rates, and health were obtained for eight countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The dataset, owid-covid-data.csv, was downloaded on 06/01/2020 from: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. Infection spread and mortality data were depicted as logistic growth and analyzed with stepwise multiple regression. The overall structure of the covid-19 data was explored through factor analyses leading to a theoretical model that was tested using latent variable path analysis.Multiple regression indicated that the time from lockdown had a small but significant effect (β = 0.112, p< 0.01) on reducing the number of cases per million. The stringency index produced the most important effect for mortality and infection rates (β = 0.588,β = 0.702, β = 0.518, β = 0.681; p< 0.01). Exploratory and confirmatory analyses resulted in meaningful and cohesive latent variables: 1) Mortality, 2) Infection Spread, 3) Pop Health Risk, and 4) Health Vulnerability (Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.08).The stringency index had a large impact on the growth of covid-19 infection and mortality rates as did percentage of population aged over 65, median age, per capita GDP, diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular death rates, and ICU hospital beds per 100K. The overall Latent Variable Path Analysis is theoretically meaningful and coherent with acceptable fit indices as a model of the covid-19 pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W3204201590,"Background/Aims We measured the association between underlying chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and antiviral use with infection rates among patients who underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. Methods In total, 204,418 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January and June 2020 were included. For each case patient (n = 7,723) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, random controls (n = 46,231) were selected from the target population who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. We merged claim-based data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database collected. Primary endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Results The proportion of underlying CHB was lower in COVID-19 positive patients (n = 267, 3.5%) than in COVID-19 negative controls (n = 2482, 5.4%). Underlying CHB was associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate, after adjusting for comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57–0.74). Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, underlying CHB tended to confer a 66% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, although this value was statistically insignificant. Antiviral treatment including tenofovir and entecavir was associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate (aOR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37–0.66), while treatment was not associated with severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Conclusions Underlying CHB and antiviral agents including tenofovir decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. HBV coinfection did not increase the risk of disease severity or lead to a worse prognosis in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3202962804,"Brain oscillations have been hypothesized to support cognitive function by coordinating spike timing within and across brain regions, yet it is often not known when timing is either critical for neural computations or an epiphenomenon. The entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are necessary for learning and memory and exhibit prominent theta oscillations (6–9 Hz), which are controlled by pacemaker cells in the medial septal area. Here we show that entorhinal and hippocampal neuronal activity patterns were strongly entrained by rhythmic optical stimulation of parvalbumin-positive medial septal area neurons in mice. Despite strong entrainment, memory impairments in a spatial working memory task were not observed with pacing frequencies at or below the endogenous theta frequency and only emerged at frequencies ≥10 Hz, and specifically when pacing was targeted to maze segments where encoding occurs. Neural computations during the encoding phase were therefore selectively disrupted by perturbations of the timing of neuronal firing patterns. By manipulating the rhythmicity of neural activity in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, Quirk et al. show that memory is impaired by aberrant oscillatory activity during the encoding phase, but not during retention or retrieval phases."

https://openalex.org/W3202565144,"Dialysis patients are both the most likely to benefit from vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 and at the highest risk of not developing an immune response. Data from the medical field are thus mandatory. We report our experience with a BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine in a retrospective analysis of 241 dialysis patients including 193 who underwent anti-Spike-Protein-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) IgG analysis. We show that a pro-active vaccine campaign is effective in convincing most patients to be vaccinated (95%) and frequently elicits a specific antibody response (94.3% after two doses and 98.4% after three doses). Only immunocompromised Status is associated with lack of seroconversion (OR 7.6 [1.5–38.2], p = 0.02). We also identify factors associated with low response (last quartile; IgG&lt;500AU/mL): immunocompromised status, age, absence of RAAS inhibitors, low lymphocytes count, high C Reactive Protein; and with high response (high quartile; IgG&gt;7000AU/mL): age; previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and active Cancer. From this experience, we propose a strategy integrating anti-spike IgG monitoring to guide revaccination and dialysis center management in pandemic times."
https://openalex.org/W3202238350,"Objective Data on the course of severe COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients remains limited. We aimed to determine the incidence rate and clinical course of severe COVID-19 in the heavily affected South-Limburg region in the Netherlands. Methods All COVID-19 patients admitted to the only two hospitals covering the whole South-Limburg region between February 27, 2020 and January 4, 2021 were included. Incidence rates for hospitalization due to COVID-19 were determined for the IBD (n = 4980) and general population (n = 597,184) in South-Limburg. Results During a follow-up of 4254 and 510,120 person-years, 20 IBD patients (0.40%; 11 ulcerative colitis (UC), 9 Crohn’s disease (CD)) and 1425 (0.24%) patients from the general population were hospitalized due to proven COVID-19 corresponding to an incidence rate of 4.7 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 3.0–7.1) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.6–2.9) per 1000 patient years, respectively (Incidence rate ratio: 1.68, 95% CI 1.08–2.62, p = 0.019). Median age (IBD: 63.0 (IQR 58.0–75.8) years vs. general population: 72.0 (IQR 62.0–80.0) years, p = 0.10) and mean BMI (IBD: 24.4 (SD 3.3) kg/m 2 vs. general population 24.1 (SD 4.9) kg/m 2 , p = 0.79) at admission were comparable in both populations. As for course of severe COVID-19, similar rates of ICU admission (IBD: 12.5% vs. general population: 15.7%, p = 1.00), mechanical ventilation (6.3% vs. 11.2%, p = 1.00) and death were observed (6.3% vs. 21.8%, p = 0.22). Conclusion We found a statistically significant higher rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 in IBD patients in a population-based setting in a heavily impacted Dutch region. This finding reflects previous research that showed IBD patients using systemic medication were at an increased risk of serious infection. However, although at an increased risk of hospitalization, clinical course of severe COVID-19 was comparable to hospitalized patients without IBD."

The disease is now quickly spreading around the world, resulting in ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Healthcare workers are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population due to frequent contact with infected individuals.This study was aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among health care workers.Facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among health care workers in Silte Zone. A total of 379 health professionals were selected using multistage stratified sampling technique. Self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Binary logistic regression model was used to see association between outcome and independent variables.This study found 74.9%, 84.2% and 68.9% prevalence of adequate knowledge, positive attitude and good practice respectively.

On the other hand, older age (AOR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.07-10.50), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.82-7.63), Work experience (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.46-9.80) and Knowledge (AOR = 5.45, 95% CI = 2.60-11.43) were significantly associated with attitude, whereas source of information from friends or colleagues (AOR = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.28-7.66), working in primary hospital (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.21-0.620) and having good knowledge (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.03-3.14) were strongly associated with good practice of health care workers.This study found majority of health care workers had good level of knowledge and positive attitude toward COVID-19, but lower proportion of health care workers practices sufficiently in the study area. Type of health facilities, level of education, training on COVID-19, work experience, type of source of information were significantly associated with knowledge, attitude and practice of health care workers.

https://openalex.org/W3202282029,"Objective This study aimed to identify the distinct barriers and knowledge level of cervical cancer screening among female university students and establish intervention strategies to overcome these barriers. Methods This study used a mixed-methods design with 26 female university students aged 20–29 years. We first conducted a quantitative online survey for the same study participants, divided them into three groups, and conducted focus group interviews (FGIs). Group A: participants who had sexual experience and had undergone cervical cancer screening; Group B: participants who had sexual experience and had not undergone cervical cancer screening; Group C: participants who did not have sexual experience and had not undergone cervical cancer screening. Results The participants’ ages were 21.92 ± 1.26 years. The knowledge levels for cervical cancer and screening were low to moderate. The four main themes that emerged as barriers to cervical cancer screening through the FGIs were: 1) socio-cultural barrier: conservative social perception of unmarried women’s sexual life, 2) knowledge barrier: lack of knowledge and information, 3) psychological barrier: discomfort, and 4) practical barrier: time-consuming. The three themes identified for strategies were: 1) socio-cultural intervention: changing social perceptions and ensuring confidentiality, 2) educational intervention: improvement of knowledge and accessibility, and 3) alternative screening intervention: comfortable screening methods. Conclusions While university students’ sexual experience rapidly increased, the socio-cultural perceptions of sexual health remained closed, and they had a reasonably low level of knowledge about cervical cancer screening. Therefore, various strategies sensitive to female university students’ culture should be implemented to increase the knowledge level, and social efforts should be made to change the socio-cultural perception of unmarried young women’s sexual health."
https://openalex.org/W3203853710,"The Apicomplexa protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a mandatory intracellular parasite and the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. This illness is of medical importance due to its high prevalence worldwide and may cause neurological alterations in immunocompromised persons. In chronically infected immunocompetent individuals, this parasite forms tissue cysts mainly in the brain. In addition, T . gondii infection has been related to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as mood, personality, and other behavioral changes. In the present study, we evaluated the kinetics of behavioral alterations in a model of chronic infection, assessing anxiety, depression and exploratory behavior, and their relationship with neuroinflammation and parasite cysts in brain tissue areas, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, and cytokine status in the brain and serum. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were infected by gavage with 5 cysts of the ME-49 type II T . gondii strain, and analyzed as independent groups at 30, 60 and 90 days postinfection (dpi). Anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and hyperactivity were detected in the early (30 dpi) and long-term (60 and 90 dpi) chronic T . gondii infection, in a direct association with the presence of parasite cysts and neuroinflammation, independently of the brain tissue areas, and linked to BBB disruption. These behavioral alterations paralleled the upregulation of expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and CC-chemokines (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β and CCL5/RANTES) in the brain tissue. In addition, increased levels of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), TNF and CCL2/MCP-1 were detected in the peripheral blood, at 30 and 60 dpi. Our data suggest that the persistence of parasite cysts induces sustained neuroinflammation, and BBB disruption, thus allowing leakage of cytokines of circulating plasma into the brain tissue. Therefore, all these factors may contribute to behavioral changes (anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and hyperactivity) in chronic T . gondii infection."
https://openalex.org/W3204029651,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as a driving force for tumor progression in breast cancer. Recently, our group identified the RNA Binding Motif Single Stranded Interacting Protein 3 (RBMS3) to be significantly associated with an EMT transcriptional program in breast cancer. Additional expression profiling demonstrated that RBMS3 was consistently upregulated by multiple EMT transcription factors and correlated with mesenchymal gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, RBMS3 was sufficient to induce EMT in two immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, RBMS3 was necessary for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype and invasion and migration in vitro. Loss of RBMS3 significantly impaired both tumor progression and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. Using a genome-wide approach to interrogate mRNA stability, we found that ectopic expression of RBMS3 upregulates many genes that are resistant to degradation following transcriptional blockade by actinomycin D (ACTD). Specifically, RBMS3 was shown to interact with the mRNA of EMT transcription factor PRRX1 and promote PRRX1 mRNA stability. PRRX1 is required for RBMS3-mediated EMT and is partially sufficient to rescue the effect of RBMS3 knockdown in TNBC cell lines. Together, this study identifies RBMS3 as a novel and common effector of EMT, which could be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3201916882,"Abstract Expression of the immediate-early response gene IER2 has been associated with the progression of several types of cancer, but its functional role is poorly understood. We found that increased IER2 expression in human melanoma is associated with shorter overall survival, and subsequently investigated the mechanisms through which IER2 exerts this effect. In experimental melanoma models, sustained expression of IER2 induced senescence in a subset of melanoma cells in a p53/MAPK/AKT-dependent manner. The senescent cells produced a characteristic secretome that included high levels of the extracellular phosphoglycoprotein osteopontin. Nuclear localization of the IER2 protein was critical for both the induction of senescence and osteopontin secretion. Osteopontin secreted by IER2-expressing senescent cells strongly stimulated the migration and invasion of non-senescent melanoma cells. Consistently, we observed coordinate expression of IER2, p53/p21, and osteopontin in primary human melanomas and metastases, highlighting the pathophysiological relevance of IER2-mediated senescence in melanoma progression. Together, our study reveals that sustained IER2 expression drives melanoma invasion and progression through stimulating osteopontin secretion via the stochastic induction of senescence."
https://openalex.org/W3203442461,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, often without symptoms, and is an independent risk factor for mortality, stroke and heart failure. It is unknown if screening asymptomatic individuals for AF can improve clinical outcomes. Methods mSToPS was a pragmatic, direct-to-participant trial that randomized individuals from a single US-wide health plan to either immediate or delayed screening using a continuous-recording ECG patch to be worn for two weeks and 2 occasions, ~3 months apart, to potentially detect undiagnosed AF. The 3-year outcomes component of the trial was designed to compare clinical outcomes in the combined cohort of 1718 individuals who underwent monitoring and 3371 matched observational controls. The prespecified primary outcome was the time to first event of the combined endpoint of death, stroke, systemic embolism, or myocardial infarction among individuals with a new AF diagnosis, which was hypothesized to be the same in the two cohorts but was not realized. Results Over the 3 years following the initiation of screening (mean follow-up 29 months), AF was newly diagnosed in 11.4% (n = 196) of screened participants versus 7.7% (n = 261) of observational controls (p&lt;0.01). Among the screened cohort with incident AF, one-third were diagnosed through screening. For all individuals whose AF was first diagnosed clinically, a clinical event was common in the 4 weeks surrounding that diagnosis: 6.6% experienced a stroke,10.2% were newly diagnosed with heart failure, 9.2% had a myocardial infarction, and 1.5% systemic emboli. Cumulatively, 42.9% were hospitalized. For those diagnosed via screening, none experienced a stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic emboli in the period surrounding their AF diagnosis, and only 1 person (2.3%) had a new diagnosis of heart failure. Incidence rate of the prespecified combined primary endpoint was 3.6 per 100 person-years among the actively monitored cohort and 4.5 per 100 person-years in the observational controls. Conclusions At 3 years, screening for AF was associated with a lower rate of clinical events and improved outcomes relative to a matched cohort, although the influence of earlier diagnosis of AF via screening on this finding is unclear. These observational data, including the high event rate surrounding a new clinical diagnosis of AF, support the need for randomized trials to determine whether screening for AF will yield a meaningful protection from strokes and other clinical events.

https://openalex.org/W3203664698,"Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that is able to generate distant proposals via the use of Hamiltonian dynamics, which are able to incorporate first-order gradient information about the target posterior. This has driven its rise in popularity in the machine learning community in recent times. It has been shown that making use of the energy-time uncertainty relation from quantum mechanics, one can devise an extension to HMC by allowing the mass matrix to be random with a probability distribution instead of a fixed mass. Furthermore, Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MHMC) has been recently proposed as an extension to HMC and adds a magnetic field to HMC which results in non-canonical dynamics associated with the movement of a particle under a magnetic field. In this work, we utilise the non-canonical dynamics of MHMC while allowing the mass matrix to be random to create the Quantum-Inspired Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QIMHMC) algorithm, which is shown to converge to the correct steady state distribution. Empirical results on a broad class of target posterior distributions show that the proposed method produces better sampling performance than HMC, MHMC and HMC with a random mass matrix."
https://openalex.org/W3204310891,"Longitudinal imaging studies are crucial for advancing the understanding of brain development over the lifespan. Thus, more and more studies acquire imaging data at multiple time points or with long follow-up intervals. In these studies changes to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners often become inevitable which may decrease the reliability of the MRI assessments and introduce biases. We therefore investigated the difference between MRI scanners with subsequent versions (3 Tesla Siemens Verio vs. Skyra) on the cortical and subcortical measures of grey matter in 116 healthy, young adults using the well-established longitudinal FreeSurfer stream for T1-weighted brain images. We found excellent between-scanner reliability for cortical and subcortical measures of grey matter structure (intra-class correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8). Yet, paired t-tests revealed statistically significant differences in at least 67% of the regions, with percent differences around 2 to 4%, depending on the outcome measure. Offline correction for gradient distortions only slightly reduced these biases. Further, T1-imaging based quality measures reflecting gray-white matter contrast systematically differed between scanners. We conclude that scanner upgrades during a longitudinal study introduce bias in measures of cortical and subcortical grey matter structure. Therefore, before upgrading a MRI scanner during an ongoing study, researchers should prepare to implement an appropriate correction method for these effects."

However, there are limited data on the association between the presence of neurological manifestations on hospital admission, disease severity, and outcomes. We sought to investigate this correlation to help understand the disease burden.We delivered a multi-center retrospective study of positive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Clinical presentation, laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were reported. Our findings of interest were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality.A total of 502 patients with a mean age of 60.83 ± 15.5 years, of them 71 patients (14.14%) presented with altered mental status, these patients showed higher odds of ICU admission (OR = 2.06, 95%CI = 1.18 to 3.59, p = 0.01), mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.28, 95%CI = 1.86 to 5.78, p < 0.001), prolonged (>4 days) mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.35, 95%CI = 1.89 to 10, p = 0.001), acute kidney injury (OR = 2.18, 95%CI = 1.28 to 3.74, p = 0.004), and mortality (HR = 2.82, 95%CI = 1.49 to 5.29, p = 0.01).This cohort study found that neurological presentations are associated with higher odds of adverse events. When examining patients with neurological manifestations, clinicians should suspect COVID-19 to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3204564687,"When people interact, they fall into synchrony. This synchrony has been demonstrated in a range of contexts, from walking or playing music together to holding a conversation, and has been linked to prosocial outcomes such as development of rapport and efficiency of cooperation. While the basis of synchrony remains unclear, several studies have found synchrony to increase when an interaction is made challenging, potentially providing a means of facilitating interaction. Here we focus on head movement during free conversation. As verbal information is obscured when conversing over background noise, we investigate whether synchrony is greater in high vs low levels of noise, as well as addressing the effect of background noise complexity. Participants held a series of conversations with unfamiliar interlocutors while seated in a lab, and the background noise level changed every 15-30s between 54, 60, 66, 72, and 78 dB. We report measures of head movement synchrony recorded via high-resolution motion tracking at the extreme noise levels (i.e., 54 vs 78 dB) in dyads (n = 15) and triads (n = 11). In both the dyads and the triads, we report increased movement coherence in high compared to low level speech-shaped noise. Furthermore, in triads we compare behaviour in speech-shaped noise vs multi-talker babble, and find greater movement coherence in the more complex babble condition. Key synchrony differences fall in the 0.2–0.5 Hz frequency bands, and are discussed in terms of their correspondence to talkers’ average utterance durations. Additional synchrony differences occur at higher frequencies in the triads only (i.e., &gt;5 Hz), which may relate to synchrony of backchannel cues (as multiple individuals were listening and responding to the same talker). Not only do these studies replicate prior work indicating interlocutors’ increased reliance on behavioural synchrony as task difficulty increases, but they demonstrate these effects using multiple difficulty manipulations and across different sized interaction groups."
https://openalex.org/W3204880097,"In commercial snow crab ( Chionoecetes opilio ) fishery, the catch efficiency of the conical pots is important for increasing the profitability of the industry. This study evaluated the effect of adding green and white light emitting diodes (LED) on the catch efficiency of commercially used conical pots. The results from the field experiments showed that inserting artificial lights significantly increases the catch efficiency for snow crab over the minimum landing size of 95 mm carapace width of up to 76% when using green LED, and by 52–53% on average when using white LED. This study shows that it is possible to improve the catch efficiency of the snow crab fishery by applying artificial LED lights to the conical snow crab pots, potentially resulting in an important economic benefit to the snow crab fishery."
https://openalex.org/W3201722972,"Carceral settings in the United States have been the source of many single site COVID-19 outbreaks. Quarantine is a strategy used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in correctional settings, and specific quarantine practices differ state to state. To better understand how states are using quarantine in prisons, we reviewed each state’s definition of quarantine and compared each state’s definition to the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) definition and recommendations for quarantine in jails and prisons. Most prison systems, 45 of 53, define quarantine, but definitions vary widely. No state published definitions of quarantine that align with all CDC recommendations, and only 9 states provide quarantine data. In these states, the highest recorded quarantine rate occurred in Ohio in May 2020 at 843 per 1,000. It is necessary for prison systems to standardize their definitions of quarantine and to utilize quarantine practices in accordance with CDC recommendations. In addition, data transparency is needed to better understand the use of quarantine and its effectiveness at mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks in carceral settings."
https://openalex.org/W3204039348,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys add to the active case detection in the community level burden of TB both national and regional levels. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in the community. Methods Household community-based tuberculosis disease survey was conducted targeting 69054 population from 43 villages of 5 blocks in Tiruvallure district adopting cluster sampling methodology of ≥15 years old adult rural population of South India during 2015–2018. All eligible individuals with suspected symptoms of PTB were screened with chest X-ray. Two sputum specimens (one spot and the other early morning sample) were collected for M.tb smear and culture examination. Conversely demographical, smoking and alcohol drinking habits information were also collected to explore the risk factor. Stepwise logistic regression was employed to associate risk factors for PTB. Results A total of 62494 were screened among 69054 eligible population, of whom 6340 were eligible for sputum specimen collection. Sputum for M.tb smear and culture examination were collected in 93% of participants. The derived prevalence of PTB was 307/100000 population (smear-positive 130; culture positive 277). As expected that PTB has decreased substantially compared to preceding surveys and it showed that older age, male, low BMI, diabetes, earlier history of TB and alcohol users were significantly associated (p &lt; .0001) with an increased risk of developing PTB. Conclusion Upshot of the active survey has established a reduction in the prevalence of PTB in the rural area which can be accredited to better programmatic implementation and success of the National TB Control Programme in this district. It also has highlighted the need for risk reduction interventions accelerate faster elimination of TB."
https://openalex.org/W3201676552,"Calmodulin, a ubiquitous eukaryotic calcium sensor responsible for the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes, is a highly flexible protein and exhibits an unusually wide range of conformations. Furthermore, CaM is known to interact with more than 300 cellular targets. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories suggest that EF-hand loops show different magnitudes of flexibility. Therefore, the four EF-hand motifs have different affinities for Ca 2+ ions, which enables CaM to function on wide range of Ca 2+ ion concentrations. EF-hand loops are 2–3 times more flexible in apo CaM whereas least flexible in Ca 2+ /CaM-IQ motif complexes. We report a unique intermediate conformation of Ca 2+ /CaM while transitioning from extended to compact form. We also report the complex formation process between Ca 2+ /CaM and IQ CaM-binding motifs. Our results showed how IQ motif recognise its binding site on the CaM and how CaM transforms from extended to compact form upon binding to IQ motif."
https://openalex.org/W3203520696,"Most patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection perceive some degree of disease-related stigma. Misunderstandings about diseases may contribute to disease-related stigma. The objective of this study was to evaluate patient-level knowledge about HCV infection transmission and natural history and its association with HCV-related stigma among HCV-infected patients. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among 265 patients with HCV in Philadelphia using the HCV Stigma Scale and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Hepatitis C Follow-up Survey (2001–2008). The association between HCV knowledge and HCV-related stigma was evaluated via linear regression. Overall knowledge about HCV transmission and natural history was high, with &gt;80% of participants answering ≥9 of 11 items correctly (median number of correct responses, 9 [82%]), HCV-related knowledge was similar between HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected participants (p = 0.30). A higher level of HCV-related knowledge was associated with greater perceived HCV-related stigma (β, 2.34 ([95% CI, 0.51–4.17]; p = 0.013). Results were similar after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, HIV status, education level, stage of HCV management, time since diagnosis, and history of injection drug use. In this study, increased HCV-related knowledge was associated with greater perceptions of HCV stigma. Clinicians may consider allotting time to address common misconceptions about HCV when educating patients about HCV infection, which may counterbalance the stigmatizing impact of greater HCV-related knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3204383177,"Background Investment Case is a participatory approach that has been used over the years for better strategic actions and planning in the health sector. Based on this approach, a District Investment Case (DIC) program was launched to improve maternal, neonatal and child health services in partnership with government, non-government sectors and UNICEF Nepal. In the meantime, this study aimed to explore perceptions and experiences of local stakeholders regarding health planning and budgeting and explore the role of the DIC program in ensuring equity in access to maternal and child health services. Methods This study adopted an exploratory phenomenography design with a purposive sampling technique for data collection. Three DIC implemented districts and three comparison districts were selected and total 30 key informant interviews with district level stakeholders and six focus groups with community stakeholders were carried out. A deductive approach was used to explore the perception of local stakeholders of health planning and budgeting of the health care expenses on the local level. Results Investment Case approach helped stakeholders in planning systematically based on evidence through collaborative and participatory approach while in comparison areas previous year plan was mainly primarily considered as reference. Resource constraints and geographical difficulty were key barriers in executing the desired plan in both intervention and comparison districts. Positive changes were observed in coverage of maternal and child health services in both groups. A few participants reported no difference due to the DIC program. The participants specified the improvement in access to information, access and utilization of health services by women. This has influenced the positive health care seeking behavior. Conclusions The decentralized planning and management approach at the district level helps to ensure equity in access to maternal, newborn and child health care. However, quality evidence, inclusiveness, functional feedback and support system and local resource utilization should be the key consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3204568598,"Recent studies conclude that a new technique for tendon transfers, the side-to-side tenorrhaphy by Fridén (FR) provides higher biomechanical stability than the established standard first described by Pulvertaft (PT). The aim of this study was to optimize side-to-side tenorrhaphies. We compared PT and FR tenorrhaphies as well as a potential improvement, termed Woven-Fridén tenorrhaphy (WF), with regard to biomechanical stability. Our results demonstrate superior biomechanical stability and lower bulk of FR and, in particular, WF over PT tenorrhaphies. The WF and FR technnique therefore seem to be a notable alternative to the established standard tenorrhaphy as they display lower bulk and higher stability, permitting successful immediate active mobilization after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3202368740,"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and osteoporosis are strikingly overlapping. This study presents matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), as a simple molecular link more consistently associated with the pathophysiology of both osteoporosis and CVD risk factors. 40 adult female rats were randomly distributed into 4 groups [control sham-operated, untreated osteoporosis, carvedilol-treated osteoporosis and alendronate-treated osteoporosis]. After 8 weeks, blood samples were collected to estimate Lipid profile (Total cholesterol, HDL, Triglycerides), inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF alpha, CRP and NO), and Bone turnover markers (BTM) (Alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and pyridinoline). The tibias were dissected to estimate MMP-9 and NF-kB gene expression, OPG, RANKL levels and for histological examination. Induction of osteoporosis resulted in a significant elevation in BTM, inflammatory markers and dyslipidemia. MMP-9 was significantly elevated and positively correlated with BTM, inflammation and dyslipidemia markers. Carvedilol and alendronate exerted a bone preservative role and attenuated dyslipidaemia and inflammation in accordance with their respective effect on MMP-9."
https://openalex.org/W3203064675,"Introduction Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly morbid condition in which impaired blood flow to the limbs leads to pain and tissue loss. Previously we identified 670 nm electromagnetic energy (R/NIR) to increase nitric oxide levels in cells and tissue. NO elicits relaxation of smooth muscle (SMC) by stimulating potassium efflux and membrane hyperpolarization. The actions of energy on ion channel activity have yet to be explored. Here we hypothesized R/NIR stimulates vasodilation through activation of potassium channels in SMC. Methods Femoral arteries or facial arteries from C57Bl/6 and Slo1 -/- mice were isolated, pressurized to 60 mmHg, pre-constricted with U46619, and irradiated twice with energy R/NIR (10 mW/cm 2 for 5 min) with a 10 min dark period between irradiations. Single-channel K + currents were recorded at room temperature from cell-attached and excised inside-out membrane patches of freshly isolated mouse femoral arterial muscle cells using the patch-clamp technique. Results R/NIR stimulated vasodilation requires functional activation of the large conductance potassium channels. There is a voltage dependent outward current in SMC with light stimulation, which is due to increases in the open state probability of channel opening. R/NIR modulation of channel opening is eliminated pharmacologically (paxilline) and genetically (BK ca α subunit knockout). There is no direct action of light to modulate channel activity as excised patches did not increase the open state probability of channel opening. Conclusion R/NIR vasodilation requires indirect activation of the BK ca channel."
https://openalex.org/W3203380826,"In this study, 20 blood, heart, and brain samples were collected from euthanized cats at the Zoonosis Control Centers and Veterinary Clinics in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The sera were examined for anti- T . gondii antibodies using the indirect hemagglutination test. The brains and hearts of seven seropositive cats were ground, and peptide digestion was performed for bioassay in mice. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated in 5/7 (71.42%) of seropositive cats. In these isolates, the parasite was genotyped using the Polymerase chain reaction, associated with the DNA fragment polymorphism obtained by restriction enzyme PCR-RFLP technique with 11 markers (SAG1, 5’-SAG2, 3’-SAG2, alt. SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, Apico, and CS3) and 15 microsatellite markers (TUB-2, W35, TgM-A, B18, B17, M33, IV.1, XI.1, M48, M102, N60, N82, AA, N61, N83). The analysis of the isolates by PCR-RFLP revealed five distinct genotypes. Three of these genotypes have never been reported before; one corresponded to the TgDgCo13 genotype, and one incomplete genotype. In genotyping analysis using microsatellite markers, it was observed that the isolates showed atypical alleles in the typing and fingerprint markers. This revealed five atypical genotypes. The typing marker B17 showed the highest degree of atypia. This study is the first to report the genotyping of T . gondii obtained from naturally infected cats in Bahia, Northeast Brazil. The genotypes found in this study were different from those found in other studies conducted in Bahia, which included different species of animals. None of the clonal lineages I, II, or III were found. This study demonstrates the diversity of T . gondii in the study region, with the presence of unusual genotypes, reaffirming the genetic variability of the parasite in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3203710364,"The humans of modern society are enjoying the luxuries and comforts today but future generations will be facing a more polluted environment and scarcity of natural resources. So the effects of global warming and climatic changes are a major policy concern nowadays around the world. The majority of the literature treats the Carbon Dioxide emissions as an indicator of environmental deterioration but this paper considers the environmental performance index as an indicator of environment. This paper addresses the role of institutional reforms for environmental performance that is hardly discussed in the earlier literature. It is argued that a novel approach of institutional reforms can provide some useful insights for environmental performance in developing countries. There is wide agreement that institutional quality is crucial for economic sustainability but rarely focused to explore the impacts of institutional reforms on environmental performance. The institutional reforms are generally divided into two categories; economic and political reforms. This paper investigated the impact of each category of institutional reforms for environmental performance by using panel data of 122 developing economies for a period of 1996–2020. Difference in differences technique is applied to determine the impact of each category of reforms on the environment. It is found that economic and political reforms significantly contribute to protecting the environment in developing countries, and it will be a good policy option to reform the economic and political institutions to preserve the environment in these countries along with sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W3204507548,"C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) family comprises fifteen highly conserved secretory proteins with diverse central and peripheral functions. In zebrafish, mouse, and human, CTRP4 is most highly expressed in the brain. We previously showed that CTRP4 is a metabolically responsive regulator of food intake and energy balance, and mice lacking CTRP4 exhibit sexually dimorphic changes in ingestive behaviors and systemic metabolism. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing also revealed Ctrp4/C1qtnf4 expression in diverse neuronal cell types across distinct anatomical brain regions, hinting at additional roles in the central nervous system not previously characterized. To uncover additional central functions of CTRP4, we subjected Ctrp4 knockout (KO) mice to a battery of behavioral tests. Relative to wild-type (WT) littermates, loss of CTRP4 does not alter exploratory, anxiety-, or depressive-like behaviors, motor function and balance, sensorimotor gating, novel object recognition, and spatial memory. While pain-sensing mechanisms in response to thermal stress and mild shock are intact, both male and female Ctrp4 KO mice have increased sensitivity to pain induced by higher-level shock, suggesting altered nociceptive function. Importantly, CTRP4 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent associative learning and memory as assessed by trace fear conditioning paradigm. This deficit is sex-dependent, affects only female mice, and is associated with altered expression of learning and memory genes (Arc, c-fos, and Pde4d) in the hippocampus and cortex. Altogether, our behavioral and gene expression analyses have uncovered novel aspects of the CTRP4 function and provided a physiological context to further investigate its mechanism of action in the central and peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3201963607,"Getting admission into a university is highly competitive globally and can be regarded as a mental stressor for some individuals. In Bangladesh, most of the universities allow students to repeat the test, whereas repeat test-taking students are supposed to suffer from psychological issues like burnout because of academic non-achievement in their first attempt. But there is no prior study assessing burnout to the population, which was investigated herein. A cross-sectional study was carried out among a total of 911 Bangladeshi university entrance test-taking students (i.e., 49.5% first-time test-takers). The survey measures included socio-demographics, admission-related issues, and mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and burnout). Of the mental health problems, depression, anxiety, and burnout were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), and Maslach Burnout Inventory—Student Survey (MBI–SS), respectively. In light of two-dimensional and three-dimensional cutoff schemes of the MBI—SS, about 43.7% and 17.3% of the test-taking students, respectively, were classified to be burnout in the total sample. Additionally, 48.1%, 71.4%, and 49.1% of the students in the total sample reported higher emotional exhaustion, higher cynicism, and lower academic efficacy, respectively. In respect to the student status, two-dimensional burnout (48.0% vs. 39.2%; χ 2 = 7.164, p = 0.007), and emotional exhaustion (52.2% vs. 43.9%, χ 2 = 6.789, p = 0.034) were significantly higher among the repeat test-taking students. Satisfaction with previous mock tests, depression, and anxiety were the associated factors of burnout in all three samples. Based on the present study, it can be concluded that the university entrance test appearing students are highly prevalent to burnout, and the rate increases with academic non-achievement. As the first study assessing burnout to the population, the findings are anticipated to be helpful for policymaking and further studies both inside and outside Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3201968034,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Early detection is critical to reduce CRC morbidity and mortality. In order to meet this need, we developed a molecular clamping assay called the ColoScape TM assay for early colorectal cancer diagnostics. Methods Nineteen mutations in four genes (APC, KRAS, BRAF and CTNNB1) associated with early events in CRC pathogenesis are targeted in the ColoScape TM assay. Xenonucleic Acid (XNA)-mediated qPCR clamping technology was applied to minimize the wild-type background amplification in order to improve assay sensitivity of CRC mutation detection. The assay analytical performance was verified and validated, cfDNA and FFPE CRC patient samples were evaluated, and an ROC curve was applied to evaluate its performance. Results The data showed that the assay analytical sensitivity was 0.5% Variant Allele Frequency, corresponding to ~7–8 copies of mutant DNA with 5 ng total DNA input per test. This assay is highly reproducible with intra-assay CV of &lt;3% and inter-assay CV of &lt;5%. We have investigated 380 clinical samples including plasma cfDNA and FFPE samples from patients with precancerous and different stages of CRC. The preliminary assay clinical specificity and sensitivity for CRC cfDNA were: 100% (95% CI, 80.3–97.5%) and 92.2% (95% CI, 94.7–100%), respectively, with AUC of 0.96; 96% specificity (95% CI, 77.6–99.7%) and 92% sensitivity (95% CI, 86.1–95.6%) with AUC of 0.94 for CRC FFPE; 95% specificity (95% CI, 82.5%–99.1%) and 62.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 35.8%–83.7%) with AUC of 0.79 for precancerous lesions cfDNA. Conclusions The XNA-mediated molecular clamping assay is a rapid, precise, and sensitive assay for the detection of precancerous lesions cfDNA and CRC cfDNA or FFPE samples."

For patients whose test positive, receiving follow-ups is paramount. This study investigated factors affecting the follow-up time of these patients. This retrospective study used data from the colorectal cancer screening archives. The study period was from 2010 to 2013, and the subjects were 50–75-year-old persons who tested positive for FOBT. The t test, one-way ANOVA, and multiple regression were performed to address the differences in the mean tracking period between variables such as the population’s demographic characteristics. The mean follow-up time for the 98,482 participants whose screening results were positive exhibited significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) according to medical unit region and classification, age, screening location, family history, examination method, and diagnosis. The model predicting the mean follow-up time predicted a period of 10.079 days longer for those whose hospital was on an offshore island than that of those whose hospital was in the eastern regions. The follow-up time was 1.257 days shorter for people who were inpatients than those who were outpatients and was 8.902 days longer for people who underwent double contrast barium enema plus flexible sigmoidoscopy than those who underwent other examination methods. Patients with a family history of colorectal cancer and those whose examination results indicated cancer had a follow-up time of 2.562 and 2.476 days shorter than those who did not know their family history and those with other results, respectively. Factors affecting the follow-up time of people whose FOBT results were positive consisted of the location and classification of the follow-up institution, age, screening location, family history, examination method, and diagnosis. This provides valuable references for improving the cancer screening program."
https://openalex.org/W3203447578,"Hunter harvest is a potential factor contributing to population declines of sage-grouse ( Centrocercus spp .). As a result, wildlife agencies throughout western North America have set increasingly more conservative harvest regulations over the past 25 years to reduce or eliminate hunter success and concomitant numbers of harvested greater ( C . urophasianus ) and Gunnison ( C . minimus ) sage-grouse. Sage-grouse hunting has varied widely over time and space, which has made a comprehensive summary of hunting management challenging. We compiled data on harvest regulations among 11 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces from 1870–2019 to create a timeline representative of hunting regulations. We compared annual harvest boundaries and area-weighted average hunting regulations, 1995–2018, relative to administrative boundaries and areas of high probability of sage-grouse occupation. We also summarized estimated numbers of birds harvested and hunters afield, 1995–2018, across both species’ ranges. From 1995–2018, there was a 30% reduction in administrative harvest boundaries across the greater sage-grouse range compared to a 16.6% reduction in area open to harvest within 8 km from active leks. Temporary closures occurred in response to wildfires, disease outbreaks, low population numbers, and two research projects; whereas, permanent closures primarily occurred in small populations and areas on the periphery of the species distribution. Similarly, area-weighted possession limits and season length for greater sage-grouse decreased 52.6% and 61.0%, respectively, while season start date stayed relatively stable (mean start date ~259 [mid-September]). In contrast, hunting of the now federally-threatened Gunnison sage-grouse ended after 1999. While restrictions in harvest regulations were large in area, closures near areas of high greater sage-grouse occupancy were relatively smaller with the same trend for Gunnison sage-grouse until hunting ceased. For greater sage-grouse, most states reduced bag and possession limits and appeared to adhere to recommendations for later and shorter hunting seasons, reducing potential for additive mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3204359636,"Magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy (MACE) is a noninvasive procedure and can overcome passive capsule movement that limits gastric examination. MACE has been studied in many trials as an alternative to upper endoscopy. However, to increase diagnostic accuracy of various gastric lesions, MACE should be able to provide stereoscopic, clear images and to measure the size of a lesion. So, we conducted the animal experiment using a novel three-dimensional (3D) MACE and a new hand-held magnetic controller for gastric examination. The purpose of this study is to assess the performance and safety of 3D MACE and hand-held magnetic controller through the animal experiment. Subsequently, via the dedicated viewer, we evaluate whether 3D reconstruction images and clear images can be obtained and accurate lesion size can be measured. During real-time gastric examination, the maneuverability and visualization of 3D MACE were adequate. A polypoid mass lesion was incidentally observed at the lesser curvature side of the prepyloric antrum. The mass lesion was estimated to be 10.9 x 11.5 mm in the dedicated viewer, nearly the same size and shape as confirmed by upper endoscopy and postmortem examination. Also, 3D and clear images of the lesion were successfully reconstructed. This animal experiment demonstrates the accuracy and safety of 3D MACE. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm the feasibility of 3D MACE for human gastric examination."
https://openalex.org/W3204458280,"Sharks have declined worldwide and remote sanctuaries are becoming crucial for shark conservation. The southwest Indian Ocean is a hotspot of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity mostly impacted by anthropogenic damage. Sharks were observed during surveys performed from April to June 2013 in the virtually pristine coral reefs around Europa Island, a remote Marine Protected Area located in the southern Mozambique Channel. Observation events comprised 67 1-hour scientific dives between 5 – 35m depth and 7 snorkeling inspections, as well as 4 dinghy-based observations in the shallow lagoon. In a period of 24 days, 475 sharks were tallied. Carcharhinus galapagensis was most encountered and contributed 20% of the abundance during diving, followed by C . albimarginatus (10%). Both species were more abundant between 11-14h, and on the exposed sides of the island. Numbers of Sphyrna lewini were highest with 370 individuals windward and leeward, mostly schooling. S . lewini aggregations in the area are hypothesized to be attracted to the seamount archipelago offering favorable conditions for deep incursions and of which Europa Island forms part. C . amblyrhynchos , Galeocerdo cuvier and S . mokarran were uncommon, while there was an additional observation of Rhincodon typus . The lagoon of Europa was a nursery ground for C . melanopterus where it was the only species present. A total of 8 species was recorded, contributing to the shark diversity of 15 species reported from Europa since 1952 in the scientific and gray literature. Overall, with the occurrence of several species of apex predators in addition to that of R . typus , large schools of S . lewini , fair numbers of reef sharks and a nursery of C . melanopterus , Europa’s sharks constitute a significant reservoir of biodiversity, which contributes to preserve the functioning of the ecosystem. Our observations highlight the relevance of Europa Island for shark conservation and the need for shark-targeted management in the EEZ of both Europa and Bassas da India."

These stable individual differences can be assessed using the Importance of Rationality Scale (IRS), and Moralized Rationality Scale (MRS). Furthermore, these individual differences are conceptually distinct, and associated with different cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. However, little is known about what signifies and differentiates people who score high (vs. low) on the IRS and MRS respectively, and where these individual differences stem from. In the present research we begin to address these questions by examining how these epistemic values relate to the Big Five personality traits. Two studies consistently show that both the IRS and MRS are positively related to Openness to experience. However, only the MRS is negatively associated with Agreeableness, and only the IRS is positively associated with Conscientiousness."
