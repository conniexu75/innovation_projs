https://openalex.org/W3164915915,"Though SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been documented in occupational settings and in-person essential work has been suspected as a risk factor for COVID-19, occupational differences in excess mortality have, to date, not been examined. Such information could point to opportunities for intervention, such as vaccine prioritization or regulations to enforce safer work environments.Using autoregressive integrated moving average models and California Department of Public Health data representing 356,188 decedents 18-65 years of age who died between January 1, 2016 and November 30, 2020, we estimated pandemic-related excess mortality by occupational sector and occupation, with additional stratification of the sector analysis by race/ethnicity. During these first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, working-age adults experienced 11,628 more deaths than expected, corresponding to 22% relative excess and 46 excess deaths per 100,000 living individuals. Sectors with the highest relative and per-capita excess mortality were food/agriculture (39% relative excess; 75 excess deaths per 100,000), transportation/logistics (31%; 91 per 100,000), manufacturing (24%; 61 per 100,000), and facilities (23%; 83 per 100,000). Across racial and ethnic groups, Latino working-age Californians experienced the highest relative excess mortality (37%) with the highest excess mortality among Latino workers in food and agriculture (59%; 97 per 100,000). Black working-age Californians had the highest per-capita excess mortality (110 per 100,000), with relative excess mortality highest among transportation/logistics workers (36%). Asian working-age Californians had lower excess mortality overall, but notable relative excess mortality among health/emergency workers (37%), while White Californians had high per-capita excess deaths among facilities workers (70 per 100,000).Certain occupational sectors are associated with high excess mortality during the pandemic, particularly among racial and ethnic groups also disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In-person essential work is a likely venue of transmission of coronavirus infection and must be addressed through vaccination and strict enforcement of health orders in workplace settings."
https://openalex.org/W3165451016,"Systemic inflammation has been documented in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However studies on childhood OSA and systemic inflammation are limited. This study aimed to determine the relation between OSA in overweight/obese children and various inflammatory markers.In this cross sectional study, we enrolled 247 overweight/ obese children from pediatric outpatient services. We evaluated demographic and clinical details, anthropometric parameters, body composition and estimation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), high sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and leptin levels. Overnight polysomnography was performed.A total of 247 children (190 with OSA and 57 without OSA) were enrolled. OSA was documented on polysomnography in 40% of patients. We observed significantly high values body mass index, waist circumference (WC), % body fat, fasting blood glucose (FBG), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphate, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in children with OSA. Inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, MIF, Hs CRP, TNF- α, PAI-1, and leptin levels were significantly higher in OSA patients (p<0.05). There was strong positive correlation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-23, MIF, Hs CRP, TNF-A, PAI-1 and leptin with BMI, % body fat, AHI, fasting Insulin, triglyceride, FBG, WC, HOMA-IR, AST and ALT.Children with OSA have increased obesity, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. Further studies are require to confirm our findings and evaluate their utility in diagnosis of OSAs, assessing severity and possible interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3165373567,"In the vein of recent empirical literature, we reassessed the impact of weather factors on Covid-19 daily cases and fatalities in a panel of 37 OECD countries between 1st January and 27th July 2020. We considered five different meteorological factors. For the first time, we used a dynamic panel model and considered two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: direct/physical factors related to the survival and durability dynamics of the virus on surfaces and outdoors and indirect/social factors through human behaviour and individual mobility, such as walking or driving outdoors, to capture the impact of weather on social distancing and, thus, on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Our work revealed that temperature, humidity and solar radiation, which has been clearly under considered in previous studies, significantly reduce the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Indirect effects through human behaviour, i.e., correlations between temperature (or solar radiation) and human mobility, were significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Increasing temperature, humidity or solar radiation effects were positively correlated with increasing mobility effects on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. The net effect from weather on the Covid-19 outbreak will, thus, be the result of the physical/direct negative effect of temperature or solar radiation and the mobility/indirect positive effect due to the interaction between human mobility and those meterological variables. Reducing direct effects of temperature and solar radiation on Covid-19 cases and fatalities, when they were significant, were partly and slightly compensated for positive indirect effects through human mobility. Suitable control policies should be implemented to control mobility and social distancing even when the weather is favourable to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus."
https://openalex.org/W3164234768,"We compare the health and economic costs of early and delayed mandated suppression and the unmitigated spread of ‘first-wave’ COVID-19 infections in Australia in 2020. Using a fit-for-purpose SIQRM-compartment model for susceptible, infected, quarantined, recovered and mortalities on active cases, that we fitted from recorded data, a value of a statistical life year (VSLY) and an age-adjusted value of statistical life (A-VSL), we find that the economic costs of unmitigated suppression are multiples more than for early mandated suppression. We also find that using an equivalent VSLY welfare loss from fatalities to estimated GDP losses, drawn from survey data and our own estimates of the impact of suppression measures on the economy, means that for early suppression not to be the preferred strategy requires that Australia would have to incur more than 12,500–30,000 deaths, depending on the fatality rate with unmitigated spread, to the economy costs of early mandated suppression. We also find that early rather than delayed mandated suppression imposes much lower economy and health costs and conclude that in high-income countries, like Australia, a ‘go early, go hard’ strategy to suppress COVID-19 results in the lowest estimated public health and economy costs."
https://openalex.org/W3165675643,"Industrial mining projects can play an important role in global sustainable development if associated health risks are minimised and opportunities maximised. While a broad body of evidence from quantitative studies exists that establishes the interlinkages between mining operations and effects on public health, little research has been conducted investigating health impacts from the perspective of affected communities. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, where about a third of the remaining global mineral resources are endowed and health-related indicators for sustainable development are lagging behind. In this multi-country qualitative study, we explore community perceptions regarding impacts of industrial mining on their health and well-being. In nine study sites in Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Tanzania, we conducted 83 participatory focus group discussions with a total of 791 participants (385 men, 406 women). Our findings reveal a broad range of perceived impacts on environmental, economic and social determinants of health, with secondary health implications related to morbidity, mortality and well-being. Overall, perceived negative impacts prevailed, mainly related to environmental pollution, change in livelihoods or social disruption. Perceived positive impacts on health and well-being were related to interventions implemented by the mines such as new or improved water sources, health care facilities, roads and schools. The consistency of these findings across countries and study sites suggests a structural problem and indicates a pressing need to address health by acting on the wider determinants of health in mining regions. Participatory health impact assessment should be strengthened in host countries to foster strategic interventions, include marginalised population groups, and protect and promote the health of local communities. By including community perspectives on health before and during project implementation, policymakers can take advantage of economic opportunities while avoiding the pitfalls, bringing their communities closer to achieving good health and well-being goals by 2030 and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3164626037,"Calcium imaging has led to discoveries about neural correlates of behavior in subcortical neurons, including dopamine (DA) neurons. However, spike inference methods have not been tested in most populations of subcortical neurons. To address this gap, we simultaneously performed calcium imaging and electrophysiology in DA neurons in brain slices and applied a recently developed spike inference algorithm to the GCaMP fluorescence. This revealed that individual spikes can be inferred accurately in this population. Next, we inferred spikes in vivo from calcium imaging from these neurons during Pavlovian conditioning, as well as during navigation in virtual reality. In both cases, we quantitatively recapitulated previous in vivo electrophysiological observations. Our work provides a validated approach to infer spikes from calcium imaging in DA neurons and implies that aspects of both tonic and phasic spike patterns can be recovered."
https://openalex.org/W3165142602,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on every aspect of society. All countries launched preventive measures such as quarantine, lockdown, and physical distancing to control the disease spread. These restrictions might effect on daily life and mental health. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at the Treatment Center. Methods A cross-sectional telephone survey was carried out at Hmawbi COVID-19 Treatment Center, Myanmar from December 2020 to January 2021. A total of 142 patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria were invited to participate in the study. A pre-tested Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as a tool for depressive symptoms assessment. Data were analyzed by using binary logistic regression to identify associated factors of depressive symptoms. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the level of significance with a p &lt; 0.05. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 was 38.7%, with the means (± standard deviation, SD) subscale of somatic symptom, negative effect, and anhedonia were 4.64 (±2.53), 2.51 (± 2.12), and 5.01 (± 3.26), respectively. The patients with 40 years and older (AOR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.36–6.59), &lt; 4 of household size (AOR: 3.45, 95% CI: 1.46–8.15), ≤ 400,000 kyats of monthly family income (AOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.02–5.54) and infection to family members (AOR: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.74–10.07) were significant associated factors of depressive symptoms. Conclusion The high prevalence of depressive symptoms, approximately 40%, was found in patients with COVID-19 in the Treatment Center. Establishments of psychosocial supports, providing psychoeducation, enhancing the social contact with family and friends, and using credible source of information related COVID-19 would be integral parts of mental health services in COVID-19 pandemic situation."
https://openalex.org/W3163951174,"The purposes are to improve the server deployment capability under Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), reduce the time delay and energy consumption of terminals during task execution, and improve user service quality. After the server deployment problems under traditional edge computing are analyzed and researched, a task resource allocation model based on multi-stage is proposed to solve the communication problem between different supporting devices. This model establishes a combined task resource allocation and task offloading method and optimizes server execution by utilizing the time delay and energy consumption required for task execution and comprehensively considering the restriction processes of task offloading, partition, and transmission. For the MEC process that supports dense networks, a multi-hybrid intelligent algorithm based on energy consumption optimization is proposed. The algorithm converts the original problem into a power allocation problem via a heuristic model. Simultaneously, it determines the appropriate allocation strategy through distributed planning, duality, and upper bound replacement. Results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage combination-based service deployment optimization model can solve the problem of minimizing the maximum task execution energy consumption combined with task offloading and resource allocation effectively. The algorithm has good performance in handling user fairness and the worst-case task execution energy consumption. The proposed hybrid intelligent algorithm can partition tasks into task offloading sub-problems and resource allocation sub-problems, meeting the user's task execution needs. A comparison with the latest algorithm also verifies the model's performance and effectiveness. The above results can provide a theoretical basis and some practical ideas for server deployment and applications under MEC."
https://openalex.org/W3164863612,"The 3rd national tuberculosis (TB) survey in the Philippines in 2007 reported a significant decline in the prevalence of TB. Since then, more significant investments for TB control have been made, yet TB burden estimates from routine surveillance data remain relatively stable.To estimate the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB in the Philippines amongst individuals aged ≥15 years in 2016.In March-December 2016, we conducted a population-based survey with stratified, multi-stage cluster sampling of residents in 106 clusters aged ≥15 years. Survey participants were screened for TB by symptom-based interview and digital chest X-ray. Those with cough ≥2 weeks and/or haemoptysis and/or chest X-ray suggestive of TB were requested to submit 2 sputum specimens for Xpert MTB/RIF, direct sputum smear microscopy using LED fluorescent microscopy, and mycobacterial solid culture (Ogawa method). Bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB was defined as MTB culture positive and/or Xpert positive.There were 46,689 individuals interviewed, and 41,444 (88.8%) consented to a chest X-ray. There were 18,597 (39.8%) eligible for sputum examination and 16,242 (87.3%) submitted at least one specimen. Out of 16,058 sputum-eligible participants, 183 (1.1%) were smear-positive. There were 466 bacteriologically confirmed TB cases: 238 (51.1%) Xpert positive, 69 (14.8%) culture positive, and 159 (34.1%) positive by both Xpert and culture. The estimated TB prevalence per 100,000 population aged ≥15 years was 434 (95% CI: 350-518) for smear-positive TB, and 1,159 (95% CI: 1,016-1,301) for bacteriologically confirmed TB.This nationally representative survey found that the TB burden in the Philippines in 2016 was higher than estimated from routine TB surveillance data. There was no evidence of a decline in smear and culture positive TB from the 2007 survey despite significant investments in TB control. New strategies for case-finding and patient-centered care must be intensified and expanded."
https://openalex.org/W3164574158,"Exposure to heat stress can alter the development and immune system function in dairy calves. Serotonin is an immunomodulatory biogenic amine that functions as a neurotransmitter and as a stress-response mediator. Our objectives were to characterize the patterns of serum serotonin concentrations and the pattern of serotonin-related genes expressed by immune cells of calves exposed to chronic heat stress or heat stress abatement during early life, and to explore whether these might relate to immune system development. Dairy calves were exposed to chronic heat stress (HS; n = 6) or heat stress abatement (cooling, CL; n = 6) across the prenatal (late gestation, last 46 d) and postnatal (from birth to weaning, 56 d) developmental windows. Blood samples were collected to harvest serum (weekly, from d 1 to 49), to isolate of circulating leukocyte mRNA (at 1, 21 and 42 d of age) and characterize immune cell populations by flow cytometry (at 21 and 47 d of age). Calves exposed to chronic heat stress pre- and postnatally had lower red blood cell counts and lower circulating serotonin, immunoglobulin G, and B-lymphocytes compared to CL calves. Circulating blood leukocyte mRNA expression of serotonin receptors -1A, -1F, -4 and -5 was greater, while heat shock protein 70 and immune-related genes (i.e., TBX21, TLR4, and TGFβ) were lower in HS relative to CL calves. Peripheral blood leukocytes from all calves secreted serotonin and interleukin-6 after in-vitro lipopolysaccharide stimulation. However, the HS calves produced more serotonin and less interleukin-6 than CL calves when activated in-vitro. Together, our data suggest that providing heat stress abatement to dairy calves across prenatal and postnatal developmental windows might modulate the serotonin synthesis pathway in ways that may benefit humoral immunity against microbial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3164254756,"Background COVID-19 has exerted a variety of impacts on people, particularly people with limited education living in poor economic settings. This study investigates the impacts of and adaptations to COVID-19 among the hill tribe people of northern Thailand. Methods A qualitative method was used to elicit information from key informants who lived in a hill tribe village in Mae Fah Laung district, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Fourteen questions on two issues were used to gather information, and an NVivo program was used to extract the findings. Results A total of 57 hill tribe villagers participated, including 36 females and 21 males (mean age of 50.1 years, min = 20 and max = 90). Twenty-seven individuals were Thai Yai, 14 were Yunan Chinese, eight were Akha, and eight were members of other minor tribes. Regarding education and occupation, 30 individuals were illiterate, while 27 had attended different levels of primary school; 40 individuals were unemployed, 13 were employed as daily wage workers and farmers, and the other 4 were attending school. Three age categories were used to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: impact of access to the educational system among the young, loss of jobs and family financial problems among the working, and access to medical care for the elderly. Six adaptation stages in response to the COVID-19 crisis were observed among the hill tribe people: shock stage with no prior experience, looking for help from health and other agencies, considering the national lockdown policy, complying with prevention and control measures, reducing stressful situations and following the new normal approach, and addressing suffering points at home and elsewhere. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted different impacts on different age categories among the hill tribe population living in remote and border areas. Effective adaptations have been implemented to address the new normal life under the disease, and six adaptation stages have been identified that have helped them survive the greatest threat to humankind today."
https://openalex.org/W3164431485,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) consist of a core protein with side chains of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). We have previously identified (i) the HSPGs syndecan-1 (SDC1), and collagen type XVIII (COL18) inside mouse and human islet beta cells, and (ii) a critical role for HS in beta cell survival and protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS). The objective of this study was to investigate whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to oxidative stress and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by depleting beta cell HSPGs/HS. A rapid loss of intra-islet/beta cell HSPGs, HS and heparanase (HPSE, an HS-degrading enzyme) accompanied upregulation of islet ER stress gene expression in both young T2D-prone db/db and Akita Ins2WT/C96Y mice. In MIN6 beta cells, HSPGs, HS and HPSE were reduced following treatment with pharmacological inducers of ER stress (thapsigargin or tunicamycin). Treatment of young db/db mice with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a chemical protein folding chaperone that relieves ER stress, improved glycemic control and increased intra-islet HSPG/HS. In vitro, HS replacement with heparin (a highly sulfated HS analogue) significantly increased the survival of wild-type and db/db beta cells and restored their resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced death. We conclude that ER stress inhibits the synthesis/maturation of HSPG core proteins which are essential for HS assembly, thereby exacerbating oxidative stress and promoting beta cell failure. Diminished intracellular HSPGs/HS represent a previously unrecognized critical link bridging ER stress, oxidative stress and beta cell failure in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W3164633803,"The survival impact of geographic access to specialized care remains unknown in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). This study aimed to clarify the association between the patient travel distance and survival outcome and investigate the factors lying behind it.A total of 34 528 patients with STS registered in the National Cancer Data Base, diagnosed from 2004-2016, were investigated.Tumor stage correlated with travel distance: patients with metastatic disease stayed closer to home. However, the type of facility showed greatest variation: 37.0%, 51.0%, 73.5%, and 75.9% of patients with ≤10 miles, 10.1-50 miles, 50.1-100 miles, and >100 miles, respectively (P<0.001), had a sarcoma care at academic/research centers. On a multivariable analysis, reduced mortality risk was associated with longer (versus short) travel distance (>100 miles: HR = 0.877; P = 0.001) and management at academic/research (versus non-academic/research) centers (HR = 0.857; P<0.001). The greatest divergence was seen in patients traveling very long distance (>100 miles) to an academic/research center, with a 26.9% survival benefit (HR = 0.731; P<0.001), compared with those traveling short distance (≤10 miles; 95.4% living in metropolitan area) to a non-academic/research center. There was no significant correlation between travel distance and survival in patients who had care at academic/research centers, whereas a survival benefit of management at academic/research centers was observed in every group of travel distance, regardless of tumor stage.This national study demonstrated that increased travel distance was associated with superior survival, attributable to a higher proportion of patients receiving sarcoma care at distant academic/research centers. These data support centralized care for STS. Overcoming referral and travel barriers may enable more patients to be treated at specialized centers and may further improve survival rates for patients with STS, even when it imposes an increased travel burden."
https://openalex.org/W3164717673,"Background In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare providers who are engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients face a high risk of infection yet receive inadequate protection from contamination and minimal support to cope with overwork, frustration, and exhaustion. These problems have created significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent t -test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26. Results A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support. Conclusion The level of vicarious traumatization was higher among non-frontline compared to frontline healthcare providers. However, the level of severity may differ from person to person, depending on how they handle their physical, psychological, and mental health. Hence, support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental health of healthcare providers."
https://openalex.org/W3164349794,"Attentional bias for substance-relevant cues has been found to contribute to the persistence of addiction. Attentional bias modification (ABM) interventions might, therefore, increase positive treatment outcome and reduce relapse rates. The current study investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed home-delivered, multi-session, internet-based ABM intervention, the Bouncing Image Training Task (BITT), as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU).Participants (N = 169), diagnosed with alcohol or cannabis use disorder, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental ABM group (50%; TAU+ABM); or the control group (50%; split in two subgroups the TAU+placebo group and TAU-only group, 25% each). Participants completed baseline, post-test, and 6 and 12 months follow-up measures of substance use and craving allowing to assess long-term treatment success and relapse rates. In addition, attentional bias (both engagement and disengagement), as well as secondary physical and psychological complaints (depression, anxiety, and stress) were assessed.No significant differences were found between conditions with regard to substance use, craving, relapse rates, attentional bias, or physical and psychological complaints.The findings may reflect unsuccessful modification of attentional bias, the BITT not targeting the relevant process (engagement vs. disengagement bias), or may relate to the diverse treatment goals of the current sample (i.e., moderation or abstinence). The current findings provide no support for the efficacy of this ABM approach as an add-on to TAU in alcohol or cannabis use disorder. Future studies need to delineate the role of engagement and disengagement bias in the persistence of addiction, and the role of treatment goal in the effectiveness of ABM interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3164506173,"This study proposes a reliable computer-aided framework to identify gait fluctuations associated with a wide range of degenerative neuromuscular disease (DNDs) and health conditions. Investigated DNDs included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). We further performed a statistical and classification comparison elucidating the discriminative capability of different gait signals, including vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), stride duration, stance duration, and swing duration. Feature representation of these gait signals was based on statistical amplitude quantification using the root mean square (RMS), variance, kurtosis, and skewness metrics. We investigated various decision tree (DT) based ensemble methods such as bagging, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost), and random subspace to tackle the challenge of multi-class classification. Experimental results showed that AdaBoost ensembling provided a 6.49%, 0.78%, 2.31%, and 2.72% prediction rate improvement for the VGRF, stride, stance, and swing signals, respectively. The proposed approach achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.17%, sensitivity of 98.23%, and specificity of 99.43%, using the VGRF-based features and the adaptive boosting classification model. This work demonstrates the effective capability of using simple gait fluctuation analysis and machine learning approaches to detect DNDs. Computer-aided analysis of gait fluctuations provides a promising advent to enhance clinical diagnosis of DNDs."

The main objectives of this study were to investigate the expression level of substance P in different breast cancer molecular subtypes and identify its association with clinicopathological parameters of patients and with Ki-67 index.A retrospective analysis was performed for a total of 164 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue samples [42 Her2/neu-enriched, 40 luminal A, 42 luminal B (triple-positive) and 40 triple negative subtypes]. The tissue microarray slides containing specimens were used to determine the expression of substance p and Ki-67 by immunohistochemical staining.The mean age of the cohort was 51.35 years. Twenty two percent of cases had low substance P expression levels (TS ≤ 5), while 78% had high expression levels (TS > 5). A significant association was found between SP expression level and breast cancer molecular subtype (p = 0.002), TNM stage (p = 0.034), pN stage (p = 0.013), axillary lymph node metastasis (p = 0.004), ER and PR statuses (p<0.001) and history of DCIS (p = 0.009). The average percentage of Ki-67 expression was 27.05%. When analyzed as a continuous variable, significant differences were observed between the mean Ki-67 scores and molecular subtype (p = 0.001), grade (p = 0.003), pN stage (p = 0.007), axillary lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001), and ER and PR statuses (p <0.001).SP is overexpressed in most of the analyzed tissues and has a negative prognostic value in the breast cancer patients.

https://openalex.org/W3164414501,"Diagnosis of microbial disease etiology in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains challenging. We undertook a large-scale metabolomics study of serum samples in hospitalized CAP patients to determine if host-response associated metabolites can enable diagnosis of microbial etiology, with a specific focus on discrimination between the major CAP pathogen groups S. pneumoniae, atypical bacteria, and respiratory viruses. Targeted metabolomic profiling of serum samples was performed for three groups of hospitalized CAP patients with confirmed microbial etiologies: S. pneumoniae (n = 48), atypical bacteria (n = 47), or viral infections (n = 30). A wide range of 347 metabolites was targeted, including amines, acylcarnitines, organic acids, and lipids. Single discriminating metabolites were selected using Student's T-test and their predictive performance was analyzed using logistic regression. Elastic net regression models were employed to discover metabolite signatures with predictive value for discrimination between pathogen groups. Metabolites to discriminate S. pneumoniae or viral pathogens from the other groups showed poor predictive capability, whereas discrimination of atypical pathogens from the other groups was found to be possible. Classification of atypical pathogens using elastic net regression models was associated with a predictive performance of 61% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and an AUC of 0.81. Targeted profiling of the host metabolic response revealed metabolites that can support diagnosis of microbial etiology in CAP patients with atypical bacterial pathogens compared to patients with S. pneumoniae or viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W3165566515,"Background Gynaecological morbidities are more common than reproductive and contraceptive morbidities and constitute a substantial proportion of disease burden in women. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and factors associated with gynaecological morbidities and the treatment-seeking behaviour among adolescent girls residing in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India. Methodology The study utilized data from the Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) survey with a sample size of 14,625 adolescents girls aged 10–19 years. We defined gynaecological morbidity in dichotomous form, created from five questions on different morbidities. Further, the treatment-seeking behaviour was assessed for reported gynaecological morbidities three months prior to the survey. Univariate and bivariate analysis was used to perform analysis to carve out the preliminary results. Additionally, the study employed the heckprobit selection model, a two-equation model, to identify the determinants of outcome variables. Results Overall, about one-fourth (23.6%) of the adolescent girls reported suffering from gynaecological morbidities, and only one-third of them went for treatment. Non-Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Non-SC/ST) adolescents were significantly less likely to have gynaecological morbidities (β: -0.12; CI: -0.18, -0.06) compared to SC/ST counterparts; however, they were more likely to go for the treatment (β: 0.09; CI: 0.00, 0.19). The adolescents who had 8–9 (β: 0.17; CI: 0.05, 0.29) or ten and above years of education (β: 0.21; CI: 0.09, 0.34) had a higher likelihood of going for the treatment than adolescents with no education. Moreover, adolescents who belonged to rural areas were less likely to go for the treatment of gynaecological morbidities (β: -0.09; CI: -0.17, -0.01) than urban counterparts. Conclusion Multi-pronged interventions are the need of the hour to raise awareness about the healthcare-seeking behaviour for gynaecological morbidities, especially in rural areas. Adolescent girls shall be prioritized as they may lack the knowledge for gynaecological morbidities, and such morbidities may go unnoticed for years. Mobile clinics may be used to disseminate appropriate knowledge among adolescents and screen asymptomatic adolescents for any possible gynaecological morbidity."

One means of improving neonatal care and reducing potential mortality associated with neonatal jaundice in resource-limited settings is to create awareness among caregivers. Caregivers who tend to have higher knowledge and awareness, also have positive attitudes, and are not guided by outmoded socio-cultural beliefs and practices are more likely to seek early care and treatment for neonatal jaundice.This study investigated caregivers' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding neonatal jaundice in a tertiary health facility in the Volta region of Ghana.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that employed a quantitative approach for data collection. A total of 202 caregivers from the Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta region of Ghana were sampled using a systematic random sampling strategy where quantitative data was collected using a questionnaire and analyzed with STATA version 14.0. Ordered logistic regression was used to determine the factors that were associated with caregivers' knowledge regarding neonatal jaundice and attitude after controlling for relevant covariates.Less than half of the caregivers demonstrated good knowledge (45.5%) and attitude (47.5%) but 58.9% had good practices regarding neonatal jaundice. Caregivers who had prior awareness and education on neonatal jaundice were three times more likely to have good knowledge about jaundice than those without previous education [AOR = 3.02, (95%CI: 1.59-5.74), p = 0.001]. A caregiver employed in the public sector was two times more likely to have a good attitude about jaundice than those employed in the private sector [AOR = 2.08, (95%CI: 1.03-4.21), p = 0.042].Less than two thirds of the caregivers demonstrated good practice with limited knowledge and poor attitude. Efforts to promote well informed and improved caregivers' attitude will advance positive maternal health-seeking behavior and reduce disabilities and death through early detection and intervention of infants with neonatal jaundice. Public awareness and education about neonatal jaundice especially among caregivers in the private sector should also be intensified."
https://openalex.org/W3164523422,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia that presents with various clinical courses and progression ranging from rapid to slow. To identify novel biomarkers that can support the diagnosis and/or prognostic prediction of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we performed gene expression analysis, and the mRNA of interleukin-18 binding protein was increasingly expressed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared with healthy controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that the interleukin-18 binding protein can serve as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated the expression of interleukin-18 binding protein in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum. Additionally, the correlation between interleukin-18 binding protein expression levels and the extent of fibrosis was investigated using mouse models of lung fibrosis induced by subcutaneous bleomycin injections. Serum interleukin-18 binding protein levels were significantly higher in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients (5.06 ng/mL, interquartile range [IQR]: 4.20-6.35) than in healthy volunteers (3.31 ng/mL, IQR: 2.84-3.99) (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that the correlation between serum interleukin-18 binding protein levels and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was statistically independent after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking status. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models revealed that serum interleukin-18 binding protein levels were predictive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disease prognosis independent of other covariate factors (hazard ratio: 1.655, 95% confidence interval: 1.224-2.237, p = 0.001). We also demonstrated a significant positive correlation between lung hydroxyproline expression levels and interleukin-18 binding protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from bleomycin-treated mice (Spearman r = 0.509, p = 0.004). These results indicate the utility of interleukin-18 binding protein as a novel prognostic biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3164540898,"China became the country with the largest global carbon emissions in 2007. Cities are regional population and economic centers and are the main sources of carbon emissions. However, factors influencing carbon emissions from cities can vary with geographic location and the development history of the cities, rendering it difficult to explicitly quantify the influence of individual factors on carbon emissions. In this study, random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms were applied to analyze the relationships between factors and carbon emissions in cities using real-world data from Chinese cities. Seventy-three cities in three urban agglomerations within the Yangtze River Economic Belt were evaluated with respect to urban carbon emissions using data from regional energy balance tables for the years 2000, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The RF algorithm was then used to select 16 prototypical cities based on 10 influencing factors that affect urban carbon emissions while considering five primary factors: population, industry, technology levels, consumption, and openness to the outside world. Subsequently, 18 consecutive years of data from 2000 to 2017 were used to construct RFs to investigate the temporal predictability of carbon emission variation in the 16 cities based on regional differences. Results indicated that the RF approach is a practical tool to study the connection between various influencing factors and carbon emissions in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from different perspectives. Furthermore, regional differences among the primary carbon emission influencing factors for each city were clearly observed and were related to urban population characteristics, urbanization level, industrial structures, and degree of openness to the outside world. These factors variably affected different cities, but the results indicate that regional emission reductions have achieved positive results, with overall simulation trends shifting from underestimation to overestimation of emissions."

Such a potentially stressful event may trigger multiple psychological and physiological effects. In a repeated-measures longitudinal survey (N = 6 time-points) of first year cohort of residential undergraduate students in India, this study evaluates multiple psychological parameters: PSS14 (Perceived Stress Scale), K10 (distress scale) and positive mood measures, along with salivary cortisol levels. We find that compared to women, men showed significantly lower levels of salivary cortisol and also a decrease in perceived stress (PSS14) and distress (K10) with time. By contrast, women reported similar perceived stress and distress levels over time but had higher cortisol levels at the end of the academic year. Academic stress was reported by the students to be the most important stressor. This study highlights notable gender-/sex-differences in psychological and physiological stress responses and adds a valuable longitudinal dataset from the Indian undergraduate student cohort which is lacking in literature."
https://openalex.org/W3165125981,"Individuals may delay dispersing from their natal habitat, even after maturation to adulthood. Such delays can have broad consequences from determining population structure to allowing an individual to gain indirect fitness by helping parents rear future offspring. Dispersal in species that use delayed dispersal is largely thought to be opportunistic; however, how individuals, particularly inexperienced juveniles, assess their environments to determine the appropriate time to disperse is unknown. One relatively unexplored possibility is that dispersal decisions are the result of epigenetic mechanisms interacting between a genome and environment during development to generate variable dispersive phenotypes. Here, we tested this using epiRADseq to compare genome-wide levels of DNA methylation of blood in cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babblers (Pomatostomus ruficeps). We measured dispersive and philopatric individuals at hatching, before fledging, and at 1 year (following when first year dispersal decisions would be made). We found that individuals that dispersed in their first year had a reduced proportion of methylated loci than philopatric individuals before fledging, but not at hatching or as adults. Further, individuals that dispersed in the first year had a greater number of loci change methylation state (i.e. gain or lose) between hatching and fledging. The existence and timing of these changes indicate some influence of development on epigenetic changes that may influence dispersal behavior. However, further work needs to be done to address exactly how developmental environments may be associated with dispersal decisions and which loci in particular are manipulated to generate such changes."
https://openalex.org/W3165202626,"This study presents the application of a simultaneous method for the determination of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in marine sediments and soils, using a data set of 206 samples collected from coastal lagoonal/marine sedimentary environments and certified reference materials (CRMs). TOC and TN were determined using the high temperature (720°C) catalytic (Pt/Al2O3) oxidation method and the detection of TOC and TN was performed using an infrared or a chemiluminescence detector, respectively. Results from the abovementioned TOC method were compared with the results from the widely used Wakley-Black titration method, while TN results with these from elemental analysis. Analytical quality control experiments were performed using CRM samples. Method characteristics such as range of measurement, calibration, method detection limit (MDL), limit of quantification (LOQ), repeatability and reproducibility, were calculated. The precision and the accuracy of the methods are also discussed. Comparison of the two TOC methods of 206 data set yields a regression line of correlation coefficient with R2 = 0.985. Additional different levels of TOC concentrations of low <1%, moderate 1-5% and high 5-40% level were examined indicating very good correlations. The lowest correlation coefficient was observed in low concentrations TOC<1% (R2 0.825), mainly as a result of the limitation of titration method. The evaluation of TN results indicated that the catalytic oxidation method and the elemental analysishave a significant good correlation with R2 = 0.977. The results of precision and accuracy, as well as the calculated MDL and LOQ show that this is a reliable method. Moreover, it requires a small amount of the analyzed sample and the total analysis time is 10 min. Therefore, it can be easily applied for the fast and precise simultaneous determination of TOC and TN in sediment and soil samples."
https://openalex.org/W3165702969,"Peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) are a highly immunosuppressive fraction of CD4+ T cells. We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of pTregs in patients with gastric cancer and to determine the correlation between pTregs and immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment. pTregs status was determined by assessing the pTreg/total T-cell ratio (ratio of Foxp3 Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) to CD3G/CD3D demethylation, so-called Cellular Ratio of Immune Tolerance ""ImmunoCRIT"") using methylation analyses in 433 patients with gastric cancer who received curative surgery. Among 422 evaluable patients, 230 (54.5%) had high ImmunoCRIT (> 21.0). Patients with high ImmunoCRIT had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with high ImmunoCRIT (p = 0.030, p = 0.008, respectively). In multivariate analysis, high ImmunoCRIT kept a prognostic role for shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.9; p = 0.005). CD3+ cell density and CD4+ cell density was significantly higher within the tumor in high ImmunoCRIT group than those in low ImmunoCRIT group (CD3+ cell, 202.12/mm2 vs. 172.2/mm2, p = 0.029; CD4+ cell, 56.5/mm2 vs. 43.5/mm2, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the peripheral ImmunoCRIT determined by epigenetic methylation analysis provides prognostic information in resected gastric tumors."

Patients enrolled in the Pelvic Mass study between 2004 and 2010, diagnosed and surgically treated for epithelial ovarian cancer, were used for investigation. MicroRNA was profiled from tumour tissue with global microRNA microarray analysis. Differences in miRNA expression profiles were analysed according to histologic subtype, FIGO stage, tumour grade, type I or II tumours and result of primary cytoreductive surgery. One microRNA, miR-130a, which was found to be associated with serous histology and advanced FIGO stage, was also validated using data from external cohorts. Another seven microRNAs (miR-34a, miR-455-3p, miR-595, miR-1301, miR-146-5p, 193a-5p, miR-939) were found to be significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics ( p ≤ 0.001), in our data, but mere not similarly significant when tested against external cohorts. Further validation in comparable cohorts, with microRNA profiled using newest and similar methods are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3164450073,"The occurrence of adverse events frequently accompanies tumor treatments. Side effects should be detected and treated as soon as possible to maintain the best possible treatment outcome. Besides the standard reporting system Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), physicians have recognized the potential of patient-reporting systems. These are based on a more subjective description of current patient reporting symptoms. Patient-reported symptoms are essential to define the impact of a given treatment on the quality of life and the patient's wellbeing. They also act against an underreporting of side effects which are paramount to define the actual value of a treatment for the individual patient. Here, we present a study protocol for a clinical trial that assesses the potential of a smartphone application for CTCAE conform symptom reporting and tracking that is adjusted to the standard clinical reporting system rather than symptom oriented descriptive trial tools. The presented study will be implemented in two parts, both lasting over six months. The first part will assess the feasibility of the application with 30 patients non-randomly divided into three equally-sized age groups (<55years, 55-75years, >75years). In the second part 36 other patients will be randomly assigned to two groups, one reporting using the smartphone and one not. This prospective second part will compare the impact of smartphone reported adverse events regarding applied therapy doses and quality of life to those of patients receiving standard care. We aim for early detection and treatment of adverse events in oncological treatment to improve patients' safety and outcomes. For this purpose, we will capture frequent adverse events of chemotherapies, immunotherapies, or other targeted therapies with our smartphone application. The presented trial is registered at the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04493450) on July 30, 2020."

Generating knowledge maps based on research papers enables identification of specific areas of scientific and technical research as well as understanding of the flow of knowledge between those areas. Recently, as the number of electronic publishing and informatics archives along with the amount of accumulated knowledge related to science and technology has proliferated, the need to utilize the meta-knowledge obtainable from research papers has increased. Therefore, this study devised a model based on meta-knowledge (i.e., text information including citations, abstracts, area codes) for prediction of future growth potential using deep learning algorithms and investigated the applicability of the various forms of meta-knowledge to the prediction of future growth potential. It also proposes how to select the promising technology clusters based on the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W3165053077,"Vaccination is the most efficient means of preventing influenza infection and its complications. While previous studies have considered the externalities of vaccination that arise from indirect protection against influenza infection, they have often neglected another key factor-the spread of vaccination behavior among social contacts. We modeled influenza vaccination as a socially contagious process. Our model uses a contact network that we developed based on aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cellphone devices of ~1.8 million users in Israel. We calibrated the model to high-quality longitudinal data of weekly influenza vaccination uptake and influenza diagnoses over seven years. We demonstrate how a simple coupled-transmission model accurately captures the spatiotemporal patterns of both influenza vaccination uptake and influenza incidence. Taking the identified complex underlying dynamics of these two processes into account, our model determined the optimal timing of influenza vaccination programs. Our simulation shows that in regions where high vaccination coverage is anticipated, vaccination uptake would be more rapid. Thus, our model suggests that vaccination programs should be initiated later in the season, to mitigate the effect of waning immunity from the vaccine. Our simulations further show that optimally timed vaccination programs can substantially reduce disease transmission without increasing vaccination uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3165192233,"In multistability, a constant stimulus induces alternating perceptual interpretations. For many forms of visual multistability, the transition from one interpretation to another (“perceptual switch”) is accompanied by a dilation of the pupil. Here we ask whether the same holds for auditory multistability, specifically auditory streaming. Two tones were played in alternation, yielding four distinct interpretations: the tones can be perceived as one integrated percept (single sound source), or as segregated with either tone or both tones in the foreground. We found that the pupil dilates significantly around the time a perceptual switch is reported (“multistable condition”). When participants instead responded to actual stimulus changes that closely mimicked the multistable perceptual experience (“replay condition”), the pupil dilated more around such responses than in multistability. This still held when data were corrected for the pupil response to the stimulus change as such. Hence, active responses to an exogeneous stimulus change trigger a stronger or temporally more confined pupil dilation than responses to an endogenous perceptual switch. In another condition, participants randomly pressed the buttons used for reporting multistability. In Study 1, this “random condition” failed to sufficiently mimic the temporal pattern of multistability. By adapting the instructions, in Study 2 we obtained a response pattern more similar to the multistable condition. In this case, the pupil dilated significantly around the random button presses. Albeit numerically smaller, this pupil response was not significantly different from the multistable condition. While there are several possible explanations–related, e.g., to the decision to respond–this underlines the difficulty to isolate a purely perceptual effect in multistability. Our data extend previous findings from visual to auditory multistability. They highlight methodological challenges in interpreting such data and suggest possible approaches to meet them, including a novel stimulus to simulate the experience of perceptual switches in auditory streaming."
https://openalex.org/W3165390457,"Science fairs offer potential opportunities for students to learn first-hand about the practices of science. Over the past six years we have been carrying out voluntary and anonymous surveys with regional and national groups of high school and post high school students to learn about their high school science fair experiences regarding help received, obstacles encountered, and opinions about the value and impact of science fair. Understanding what students think about science fairs will help educators make science fairs more effective learning opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the findings with two national groups of post high school students-undergraduate research fellows (SURF students) who did research at UT Southwestern Medical Center during 2014-2019 and undergraduates biology students attending the 2019 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science Education Alliance (SEA) summer symposium. About 25% of the students who completed surveys indicated that they had participated in high school science fair, but more than half attended high schools where science fairs were unavailable. Effectively, 6 out of every 10 students participated in science fair if available. Students who could have participated in high school science fair but chose not to do so identified not enough time and coming up with their project idea as major reasons why not. About half the SURF students favored requiring non-competitive science fair regardless whether they themselves had participated in science fair. On the other hand, less than 1 in 5 thought that competitive science fair should be required. Introduction to the scientific process and general learning were mentioned most frequently as the reasons to require non-competitive science fair; these reasons were mentioned rarely in connection with competitive science fair. Unlike the national cohort of high school students we surveyed previously, who mostly did science fair in 9th and 10th grades, SURF students participated in science fair throughout high school and were twice as likely as high school students to have carried out science fair more than once. In conclusion, our findings suggest that participation of the undergraduate bioscience majors in high school science fairs occurs far more frequently than recognized previously and provide insights into how these successful college students (gauged by the fact that they are doing summer science research) view science fairs. The findings emphasize further the importance of incentivizing rather than requiring science fair participation, especially in 9th and 10th grades, and the potential value of developing non-competitive science fairs."
https://openalex.org/W3165429642,"To clarify the association of anosmia or constipation with cognitive dysfunction and disease severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Newly diagnosed patients with PD (less than 5 years) without a clinical diagnosis of dementia were included from February 2017 to August 2018. The subjects were further divided into subgroups based on whether anosmia occurred and the grade of constipation. The severity of PD motor symptoms was rated using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and cognitive functions were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analyses including t-tests, chi-square tests, multiple linear regression, and binary logistic regression were used to determine statistical significance.A total of 107 newly diagnosed PD patients were included in this study. The MoCA score was significantly lower in the anosmia group (p < 0.001). Constipation was associated with impaired olfaction in a post-hoc test. The correlation coefficient between MoCA and UPSIT score was 0.41 (p < 0.001). Total anosmia and age were associated with cognitive dysfunction (MoCA < 26) (odds ratio, 2.63, p = 0.003; 1.10, p < 0.001, respectively). The anosmia group had a higher MDS-UPDRS part 3 score with β coefficient of 7.30 (p = 0.02). Furthermore, grade 3 constipation was associated with a higher MDS-UPDRS total score with β coefficient of 14.88 (p = 0.02).Anosmia but not constipation was associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients. Nevertheless, severe constipation was associated with impaired olfaction and PD disease severity. We suggest that the propagation of α-synuclein from the olfactory route is distinct from the enteric nervous system, but the intercommunication between these two routes is complex."
https://openalex.org/W3164130000,"Natural languages with their speech communities tend to compete for speakers, very much like firms compete for market shares. As a result, some languages suffer a shifting pressure which might lead them to their extinction. This work studies the dynamics of language shift in the context of modern bilingual societies like the Basque Country, Ireland and Wales. They all have two official languages, linguistically distant: A, spoken by all, and B, spoken by a bilingual minority. They also have a bilingual education system that ensures a steady flow of new bilinguals. However, a decay in the use of B is observed, signalling that shift processes are at work. To investigate this apparent paradox, we use a novel approach in the literature of language competition. We build a behavioural game model with which bilinguals choose either language A or B for each interaction. Thus, they play repeatedly the game. We present a theorem predicting that under reasonable assumptions, any given population of bilinguals will converge into a linguistic convention, namely into an evolutionary stable equilibrium of the game, that always embeds a proportion of bilinguals shifting to A. We validate this result by means of an empirical version of the model, showing that the predictions fit well the observed data of street use of Basque and daily use of Irish and Welsh."
https://openalex.org/W3165017445,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a hereditary, rare disease with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death. The disease-causing mutations are located within the desmosomal complex and the highest incidence is found in plakophilin2. However, there are other factors playing a role for the disease progression unrelated to the genotype such as inflammation or exercise. Competitive sports have been identified as risk factor, but the type and extend of physical activity as cofactor for arrhythmogenesis remains under debate. We thus studied the effect of light voluntary exercise on cardiac health in a mouse model. Mice with a heterozygous PKP2 loss-of-function mutation were given the option to exercise in a running wheel which was monitored 24 h/d. We analyzed structural and functional development in vivo by echocardiography which revealed that neither the genotype nor the exercise caused any significant structural changes. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were not influenced by the genotype itself, but exercise did cause a drop in both parameters after 8 weeks, which returned to normal after 16 weeks of training. The electrophysiological analysis revealed that the arrhythmogenic potential was slightly higher in heterozygous animals (50% vs 18% in wt littermates) and that an additional stressor (isoprenaline) did not lead to an increase of arrhythmogenic events pre run or after 8 weeks of running but the vulnerability was increased after 16 weeks. Exercise-induced alterations in Ca handling and contractility of isolated myocytes were mostly abolished in heterozygous animals. No fibrofatty replacements or rearrangement of gap junctions could be observed. Taken together we could show that light voluntary exercise can cause a transient aggravation of the mutation-induced phenotype which is abolished after long term exercise indicating a beneficial effect of long term light exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3165077649,"We aimed to identify the perception of physicians on the limitations and delays for diagnosing, staging and treatment of lung cancer in Portugal.Portuguese physicians were invited to participate an electronic survey (Feb-Apr-2020). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed, with categorical variables reported as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables with non-normal distribution as median and interquartile range (IQR). The association between categorical variables was assessed through Pearson's chi-square test. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare categorical and continuous variables (Stata v.15.0).Sixty-one physicians participated in the study (45 pulmonologists, 16 oncologists), with n = 26 exclusively assisting lung cancer patients. Most experts work in public hospitals (90.16%) in Lisbon (36.07%). During the last semester of 2019, responders performed a median of 85 (IQR 55-140) diagnoses of lung cancer. Factors preventing faster referral to the specialty included poor articulation between services (60.0%) and patients low economic/cultural level (44.26%). Obtaining National Drugs Authority authorization was one of the main reasons (75.41%) for delaying the begin of treatment. The cumulative lag-time from patients' admission until treatment ranged from 42-61 days. Experts believe that the time to diagnosis could be optimized in around 11.05 days [IQR 9.61-12.50]. Most physicians (88.52%) started treatment before biomarkers results motivated by performance status deterioration (65.57%) or high tumor burden (52.46%). Clinicians exclusively assisting lung cancer cases reported fewer delays for obtaining authorization for biomarkers analysis (p = 0.023). Higher waiting times for surgery (p = 0.001), radiotherapy (p = 0.004), immunotherapy (p = 0.003) were reported by professionals from public hospitals.Physicians believe that is possible to reduce delays in all stages of lung cancer diagnosis with further efforts from multidisciplinary teams and hospital administration."
https://openalex.org/W3165340195,"The ability to target therapeutic agents to specific tissues is an important element in the development of new disease treatments. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is one potential target for drug delivery, as it expressed on many dividing cells and on brain endothelium, the key cellular component of the blood-brain barrier. The aim of this study was to compare a set of new and previously-described polypeptides for their ability to bind to brain endothelium, and investigate their potential for targeting therapeutic agents to the CNS. Six polypeptides were ranked for their rate of endocytosis by the human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and the murine line bEnd.3. One linear polypeptide and two cyclic polypeptides showed high rates of uptake. These peptides were investigated to determine whether serum components, including transferrin itself affected uptake by the endothelium. One of the cyclic peptides was strongly inhibited by transferrin and the other cyclic peptide weakly inhibited. As proof of principle the linear peptide was attached to 2nm glucose coated gold-nanoparticles, and the rate of uptake of the nanoparticles measured in a hydrogel model of the blood-brain barrier. Attachment of the TfR-targeting polypeptide significantly increased the rates of endocytosis by brain endothelium and increased movement of nanoparticles across the cells."
https://openalex.org/W3164252388,"Whereas it is evident that a well aligned and regular sarcomeric structure in cardiomyocytes is vital for heart function, considerably less is known about the contribution of individual elements to the mechanics of the entire cell. For instance, it is unclear whether altered Z-disc elements are the reason or the outcome of related cardiomyopathies. Therefore, it is crucial to gain more insight into this cellular organization. This study utilizes femtosecond laser-based nanosurgery to better understand sarcomeres and their repair upon damage. We investigated the influence of the extent and the location of the Z-disc damage. A single, three, five or ten Z-disc ablations were performed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We employed image-based analysis using a self-written software together with different already published algorithms. We observed that cardiomyocyte survival associated with the damage extent, but not with the cell area or the total number of Z-discs per cell. The cell survival is independent of the damage position and can be compensated. However, the sarcomere alignment/orientation is changing over time after ablation. The contraction time is also independent of the extent of damage for the tested parameters. Additionally, we observed shortening rates between 6–7% of the initial sarcomere length in laser treated cardiomyocytes. This rate is an important indicator for force generation in myocytes. In conclusion, femtosecond laser-based nanosurgery together with image-based sarcomere tracking is a powerful tool to better understand the Z-disc complex and its force propagation function and role in cellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3164335502,"Pathological hyperpermeability is a morbidity involved in various systemic diseases, including sepsis. The endothelial glycocalyx layer (GCX) plays a key role in controlling vascular permeability and could be a useful therapeutic target. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the functional role of the GCX in vascular permeability and to elucidate its role in pathological conditions. First, male C57BL/6J wild-type mice were used as in vivo models to study the effects of sepsis and the pharmacological digestion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the GCX. Vascular permeability was evaluated using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran. Second, the changes in gene expression in vascular endothelial cells after GAGs digestion were compared between a control and a septic model using RNA sequencing. In the in vivo study, the glycocalyx was depleted in both the septic model and the group with pharmacological GAGs digestion. FITC-labeled dextran had leaked into the interstitium in the septic group, but not in the other groups. In the in vitro study, histamine decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating an increase in permeability. GAGs digestion alone did not change the TEER, and the effect of histamine on the TEER was not enhanced by GAGs digestion. The gene expression profiles after GAGs digestion differed from the control condition, indicating the initiation of signal transduction. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the structural barrier of the GCX does not solely determine the fluid permeability of the endothelial layer, since enzymatic depletion of the GCX did not increase the permeability. The gene expression findings suggest that the digestion of GAGs alone did not induce hyperpermeability either in vitro or in vivo, although sepsis did induce hyperpermeability. While GAGs degradation by itself does not appear to induce hyperpermeability, it may play an important role in initiating signal transductions."
https://openalex.org/W3164622190,"GPS collars are frequently used to study the (behavioural) ecology of species. However, such collars can cause behavioural changes and can have negative physiological effects on the individuals wearing them. A pilot study to obtain data on behavioural and physiological effects of GPS collars on the target species would therefore be recommended, especially when it concerns rare or endangered species. The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a small carnivore endemic to the mountains of Central Asia that is currently classified as endangered. There is a lack in knowledge on the species ecology which could be enhanced by a study using GPS-technology. As a pilot study, the two adult red pandas in Rotterdam Zoo were observed before and after fitting a GPS-collar, to determine possible behavioural effects of wearing a collar. Although the study did not take place under ideal circumstances, indications of both behavioural, e.g. increased shaking behaviour, and physical, e.g. abrasions, effects of the collar were found. Even though our results were only based on two individuals, our findings stress the need for pilot studies in controlled environments before GPS collars to ensure safety of the study species and validity of the collected data."

In the skin, keratinocytes are the main producers of these signals. Objective To compare dose- and time-effects of cobalt on the viability of and cytokine release from HaCaT cells cultured at low or high calcium. Method To model two separate states of differentiation of keratinocytes, HaCaT cells were cultured under low or high calcium conditions. HaCaT were exposed to different concentrations of cobalt chloride (10 μm to 5 mM) over time (30 minutes– 48 hours). Cell viability was measured with the Cell-Titer Blue Viability assay. Cytokine production was measured using a bead-based immunoassay and flow cytometry. Gene expression was quantified using qPCR. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and linear mixed model. Results Viability of the cells was dose- and time-dependent. A linear mixed statistical model showed that cobalt exposure induces increase in IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL2 production over time and whereas increase of IL-6 and a decrease of CCL2 was associated with increasing cobalt chloride concentrations. When comparing the cells incubated under high and low calcium conditions, the more differentiated cells in the high concentration were found to exert a stronger response in terms of IL-6 release. Conclusions Our data suggest that cobalt chloride triggered an alarm system in HaCaT cells, and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were secreted in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When high and low calcium incubations were compared, the difference was seen only for IL-6. These findings indicate that the effect of cobalt chloride on cell toxicity occurs throughout the living epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W3164007372,"Considering the high and increasing prevalence of stress, approaches to mitigate stress-related biological processes become a matter of public health. Since supportive social interactions contribute substantially to mental and physical health, we set out to develop a social support stress management intervention and examined its effects on psychophysiological stress responses as well as self-reported stress in healthy women. In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial, registered in the DSRK (DRKS00017427), 53 healthy women were randomly assigned to a social support stress management or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent a standardized psychosocial stress test where physiological and emotional stress responses were assessed by repeated measurements of cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability and state anxiety. Also, all participants completed self-report questionnaires of perceived stress and social support at pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up four weeks later. Participants in the social support stress management showed a significantly attenuated integrated state anxiety response in comparison to those in the control condition, but conditions did not differ in any of the assessed physiological stress responses. The intervention significantly reduced perceived stress in comparison to the control condition, but perceived stress levels returned to baseline at follow-up. Our results indicated that the intervention had no effect on physiological responses to acute psychosocial stress, even though anxiety responses to stress were attenuated. However, the social support stress management intervention had a significant, albeit transient impact on perceived stress."
https://openalex.org/W3164365218,"There is substantial increment in nutraceutical consumption in Nepal, although the data on its efficacy and safety is scarce. The practices of nutraceutical supplements users in Nepal remain undocumented. Therefore, this study was conducted to study the prescription pattern, cost, knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the patient towards nutraceutical.Descriptive cross-sectional study with stratified purposive sampling (n = 400) (patients from the out-patient departments of Scheer Memorial Adventist Hospital, Kavre, Nepal) was performed using a validated structured questionnaire assessing the socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, practice of nutraceutical and total cost patients spent on nutraceutical alone. Pearson Chi-square test (x2) was used to investigate the association between socio-demographic variables and patients' KAP (knowledge, attitude and practice) towards nutraceutical. One way ANOVA was performed to compare the cost of nutraceutical among the different outpatient departments.More than 80% of patients were found to be consuming nutraceutical on their own. The mostly prescribed nutraceutical were vitamins (40.7%), minerals (23.7%), enzymes (21.1%), proteins (8.8%), probiotics (4.2%) and herbals (2.0%). With the most common reasons for consuming nutraceutical were to maintain good health (70.0%) and healthcare professionals (57.85%) were the most approached source of information for nutraceutical. Nearly half of the patients (46.5%) had an inadequate level of knowledge whereas more than two-third (71.5%) showed a moderate positive attitude towards nutraceutical use. The average amount patients spent was NRs.575.78 [equivalent to USD 4.85] per prescription on nutraceutical alone. The maximum cost amounted to NRs 757.18 [equivalent to USD 6.43] in Orthopedics, and the minimum cost was NRs 399.03 [equivalent to USD 3.36] in Obstetrics and gynecology, respectively. There was a significant difference (p <0.001) in cost of nutraceutical prescribed between the OPD clinics.The higher prevalence of inadequate knowledge despite moderate positive attitude towards nutraceutical among patients regarding some significant issues such as safety and interactions of nutraceutical consumption and its' substitution for meals reflects the need to develop an educational strategy to increase general public awareness on the rational use of nutraceutical."
https://openalex.org/W3165344723,"The genetic influence in epilepsy, characterized by unprovoked and recurrent seizures, is through variants in genes critical to brain development and function. We have carried out variant calling in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) patients by mapping the RNA-Seq data available at SRA, NCBI, USA onto human genome assembly hg-19. We have identified 1,75,641 SNVs in patient samples. These SNVs are distributed over 14700 genes of which 655 are already known to be associated with epilepsy. Large number of variants occur in the 3'-UTR, which is one of the regions involved in the regulation of protein translation through binding of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBP). We have focused on studying the structure-function relationship of the 3'-UTR SNVs that are common to at-least 10 of the 35 patient samples. For the first time we find SNVs exclusively in the 3'-UTR of FGF12, FAR1, NAPB, SLC1A3, SLC12A6, GRIN2A, CACNB4 and FBXO28 genes. Structural modelling reveals that the variant 3'-UTR segments possess altered secondary and tertiary structures which could affect mRNA stability and binding of RBPs to form proper ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Secondly, these SNVs have either created or destroyed miRNA-binding sites, and molecular modeling reveals that, where binding sites are created, the additional miRNAs bind strongly to 3'-UTR of only variant mRNAs. These two factors affect protein production thereby creating an imbalance in the amounts of select proteins in the cell. We suggest that in the absence of missense and nonsense variants, protein-activity imbalances associated with MTLE patients can be caused through 3'-UTR variants in relevant genes by the mechanisms mentioned above. 3'-UTR SNV has already been identified as causative variant in the neurological disorder, Tourette syndrome. Inhibition of these miRNA-mRNA bindings could be a novel way of treating drug-resistant MTLE patients. We also suggest that joint occurrence of these SNVs could serve as markers for MTLE. We find, in the present study, SNV-mediated destruction of miRNA binding site in the 3'-UTR of the gene encoding glutamate receptor subunit, and, interestingly, overexpression of one of this receptor subunit is also associated with Febrile Seizures."
https://openalex.org/W3165408023,"Identification of behavioral mechanisms underlying psychopathology is essential for the development of novel targeted therapeutics. However, this work relies on rigorous, time-intensive, clinic-based laboratory research, making it difficult to translate research paradigms into tools that can be used by clinicians in the community. The broad adoption of smartphone technology provides a promising opportunity to bridge the gap between the mechanisms identified in the laboratory and the clinical interventions targeting them in the community. The goal of the current study is to develop a developmentally appropriate, engaging, novel mobile application called CALM-IT that probes a narrow biologically informed process, inhibitory control. We aim to leverage the rigorous and robust methods traditionally used in laboratory settings to validate this novel mechanism-driven but easily disseminatable tool that can be used by clinicians to probe inhibitory control in the community. The development of CALM-IT has significant implications for the ability to screen for inhibitory control deficits in the community by both clinicians and researchers. By facilitating assessment of inhibitory control outside of the laboratory setting, researchers could have access to larger and more diverse samples. Additionally, in the clinical setting, CALM-IT represents a novel clinical screening measure that could be used to determine personalized courses of treatment based on the presence of inhibitory control deficits."
https://openalex.org/W3165641291,"Conditions that resemble osteoarthritis (OA) were produced by injection of sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) into the knee joints of mice. Bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) injected into the OA knee joints enhanced spontaneous pain. Since no spontaneous pain was observed when BMMCs were injected into the knee joints of control mice that had not been treated with MIA, BMMCs should be activated within the OA knee joints and release some pain-inducible factors. Protease activated receptor-2 (PAR2) antagonist (FSLLRY-NH 2 ) almost abolished the pain-enhancing effects of BMMCs injected into the OA knee joints, suggesting that tryptase, a mast cell protease that is capable of activating PAR2, should be released from the injected BMMCs and enhance pain through activation of PAR2. When PAR2 agonist (SLIGKV-NH 2 ) instead of BMMCs was injected into the OA knee joints, it was also enhanced pain. Apyrase, an ATP degrading enzyme, injected into the OA knee joints before BMMCs suppressed the pain enhanced by BMMCs. We showed that purinoceptors (P2X4 and P2X7) were expressed in BMMCs and that extracellular ATP stimulated the release of tryptase from BMMCs. These observations suggest that ATP may stimulate degranulation of BMMCs and thereby enhanced pain. BMMCs injected into the OA knee joints stimulated expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2, and MMP9 genes in the infrapatellar fat pads, and PAR2 antagonist suppressed the stimulatory effects of BMMCs. Our study suggests that intermittent pain frequently observed in OA knee joints may be due, at least partly, to mast cells through activation of PAR2 and action of ATP, and that intraarticular injection of BMMCs into the OA knee joints may provide a useful experimental system for investigating molecular mechanisms by which pain is induced in OA knee joints."
https://openalex.org/W3165702540,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) are cancer-causing viruses that establish lifelong infections in humans. Gene editing using the Cas9-guideRNA (gRNA) CRISPR system has been applied to decrease the latent load of EBV in human Burkitt lymphoma cells. Validating the efficacy of Cas9-gRNA system in eradicating infection in vivo without off-target effects to the host genome will require animal model systems. To this end, we evaluated a series of gRNAs against individual genes and functional genomic elements of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) that are both conserved with KSHV and important for the establishment of latency or reactivation from latency in the host. gRNA sequences against ORF50, ORF72 and ORF73 led to insertion, deletion and substitution mutations in these target regions of the genome in cell culture. Murine NIH3T3 fibroblast cells that stably express Cas9 and gRNAs to ORF50 were most resistant to replication upon de novo infection. Latent murine A20 B cell lines that stably express Cas9 and gRNAs against MHV68 were reduced in their reactivation by approximately 50%, regardless of the viral gene target. Lastly, co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the vector expressing the Cas9-MHV68 gRNA components along with the viral genome provided a rapid read-out of gene editing and biological impact. Combinatorial, multiplex MHV68 gRNA transfections in HEK293T cells led to near complete ablation of infectious particle production. Our findings indicate that Cas9-gRNA editing of the murine gammaherpesvirus genome has a deleterious impact on productive replication in three independent infection systems."
https://openalex.org/W3164378657,"Lameness assessment in horses is still predominantly performed using subjective methods. Visual assessment is known to have moderate to good intra-rater agreement but relatively poor inter-rater agreement. Little is known about inter- and intra-rater agreement on the evaluation of back motion, for which no objective measurement technique in a clinical setting is available thus far.To describe inter- and intra-rater agreement of visual evaluation of equine back mobility.Rater reliability study using a fully crossed design in which all horses are rated by all observers. This data is compared with objective gait analysis.Seventy equine professionals (veterinarians and physiotherapists) and veterinary students evaluated videos of 12 healthy horses at walk and trot on a hard, straight line. Nine parameters related to back mobility were scored: general mobility, thoracic, lumbar, lumbosacral flexion and extension and left and right thoracolumbar latero-flexion. All parameters were compared with simultaneously measured quantitative motion parameters. After 1 month, six randomly chosen horses were re-evaluated by 57 observers.For each parameter inter- and intra-rater agreements were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients. For all parameters, inter-rater agreement was very poor (<0.2). The mean intra-rater agreement of all observers and for all parameters was poor (~0.4) but varied between 0.0 and 0.96 for individual observers. There was no correlation between the visual subjective scoring and objective gait analysis measurements.Horses were scored from videos and by lack of any existing (semi-) quantitative system, a custom-made system had to be used.The poor inter- and intra-rater agreements of visual scoring of mobility of the equine back and the disagreement between subjective and objective gait analysis data, demonstrate the need for the development and introduction of objective, quantitative and repeatable techniques to assess equine back motion."
https://openalex.org/W3165182558,"In areas of social exclusion, there are greater risks of facing discrimination at school. The teaching-learning processes may contribute toward the perpetuation of this inequality. This research analyzes a literacy event that takes place in a low-income school in Southern Spain. The new literacy studies have come to examine how power relationships and affective bonds work in such literacy practices. An ethnographic method was followed to facilitate a deeper understanding of multimodal literacy. Further, a social semiotics multimodal approach was adopted to analyze the meaning-making social process that takes place in the classroom. The participants comprised two teachers and 17 children, whose ages range from 5 to 7 years. Data were collected in the form of reports, audio recordings, video recordings, and photographs over a two-years period. The results obtained have revealed that the children have been taught writing and reading through a dominant orthodox model that fails to consider the community's and families' cultural capitals. They also show that the literacy process does not grant any affective quality. Neither is there an authentic dialogic space created between the school and the community. This lack of dialogue generates an inequality in the actual acquisition of comprehensive reading and writing skills at school, with instances of groups exclusion, owing to the anti-hegemonic practices of knowledge acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3165698511,"To evaluate dependence of abnormalities in peripheral nerves and retina in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).50 adolescents with T1D without any signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy (mean age 16.92±1.6 years, diabetes duration 6.88 ±4.34years) were included. In OCTA capillary plexuses superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) vessel density: whole, foveal and parafoveal, ganglion cell complex (GCC), loss volume focal (FLV) and global loss volume (GLV) were analyzed in relation to NCS parameters (motor nerves median and tibial potential amplitude (CMAP), velocity (CV), distal latency (DML) and F wave and sensory nerves median and sural potential amplitude (SNAP), CV and distal latency (DSL).We detected the correlations between median sensory SNAP and GCC (r = -0.3, p <0.04), motor nerves tibial DML and CV and FLV (respectively r = -0.53, p<0.001, and r = -0.34, p<0.05), and median DML and GLV (r = 0.47, p<0.001). Vessel densities were related to changes in motor nerves tibial velocity (whole SCP r = 0.43, p <0.01, parafoveal SCP r = 0.41, p <0.01), CMAP (parafoveal SCP r = -0.35, p<0.03), median DML (whole DC r = 0.36, p<0.03, foveal DCP r = 0.37, p<0.02) and in sensory median SNAP (whole SCP r = -0.31, p<0.05).In adolescents with T1D without diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy we detected associations between NCS and OCT and OCTA parameters, regarding decreased GCC and density of superficial and deep vessel plexuses in relation to DML and CV and amplitudes of sensory and motor potential."
