https://openalex.org/W1577144646,"Lipomodulin, purified to near homogeneity from rabbit peritoneal neutrophils, was phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart with concomitant loss of its ability to inhibit phospholipase A2 from porcine pancreas. Phosphorylation of lipomodulin was confirmed by the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP. To demonstrate that lipomodulin undergoes phosphorylation in vivo, rabbit peritoneal neutrophils were incubated with 32P and lipomoculin was isolated by immunoprecipitation with serum from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus which has anti-lipomodulin antibody. Analysis of 32P-labeled immunoprecipitates by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis revealed a single peak of radioactivity that comigrated with [35S]methionine-labeled lipomodulin. The administration of a chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine to intact rabbit neutrophils, resulted in a marked increase in arachidonate release from the cells and an increase in 32P incorporation into lipomodulin. A close correlation was found between the extent of phosphorylation of lipomodulin and the rate of arachidonate release. Phosphorylation of lipomodulin in neutrophils gradually returned to the control level with corresponding cessation of arachidonate release. In contrast to the in vitro system, phosphorylation of lipomodulin and release of arachidonic acid from peptide-stimulated neutrophils required Ca2+ entry into the cells. These results suggest that the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of lipomodulin, phospholipase inhibitory protein, is an important mechanism for chemotactic receptor-mediated regulation of arachidonic acid release in rabbit neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1525570188,"A purified preparation of the Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) displays two polypeptides of apparent molecular weight 11,000 and 9,500 when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Under nondenaturing conditions, IHF appears to exist as a 1:1 complex of these two polypeptides. Integrative recombination takes place in vitro when purified IHF and purified Int, a product of a bacteriophage lambda gene, are the only proteins added to reaction mixtures. No recombination is detected in the absence of either protein. The characteristics of the recombination reaction carried out by these two purified proteins are described. Purified IHF binds to DNA; in the presence of Int, a ternary complex is formed at one of the specific recombination sites. IHF hs no detectable endonuclease or topoisomerase activity. Several possibilities for the role of IHF in recombination are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1554604124,"The asialoglycoprotein receptor has been identified on a continuous human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. This receptor requires Ca2+ for ligand binding and is specific for asialoglycoprotein. There are approximately 150,000 ligand molecules bound/cell at 4 degrees C. These receptors represent a homogeneous population of high affinity binding sites with Kd = 7 X 10(-9) M. From the rate of 125I-ASOR binding at 4 degrees C, kon was 0.95 X 10(6) M-1 min-1. Uptake of 125I-ASOR at 37 degrees C was approximately 0.02 pmol/min/10(6) cells."
https://openalex.org/W1485302087,"Eukaryotic mRNA cap binding proteins were purified from ribosomal salt wash in the presence of protease inhibitors by sucrose gradient sedimentation and m7GDP-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Rabbit reticulocyte and erythrocyte proteins with sedimentation constants of less than 6 S yielded a approximately 24,000-dalton cap binding protein. It stimulated capped mRNA translation in extracts of uninfected HeLa cells but did not restore capped mRNA function in extracts prepared from poliovirus-infected cells. Restoring and stimulatory activities both were associated with a larger, approximately 8-10 S complex that included the approximately 24,000-dalton polypeptide and several higher molecular mass components. The same two translational activities were also obtained in a slightly smaller approximately 5-7 S complex from uninfected HeLa cells but were absent from poliovirus-infected cell preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1502675762,"It was previously shown that ubiquitin is very similar to the polypeptide cofactor of the ATP-dependent protein degradation system from rabbit reticulocytes (Wilkinson, K. D., Urban, M. K., and Haas, A. L. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7529-7532). We have extended this work to show that the peptic peptide maps are identical for bovine ubiquitin and the polypeptide cofactor isolated from human erythrocytes. It was noted however that ubiquitin preparations were less active in stimulating proteolysis than preparations of the polypeptide cofactor. This decreased activity has been shown to be due to the presence of an inactive form of ubiquitin in some preparations. The two forms of ubiquitin are separable by high performance liquid chromatography. The active form of ubiquitin has the COOH-terminal sequence -Arg-Gly-Gly at residues number 74 to 76. The inactive form terminates in -Arg74 as previously reported in the sequence studies of ubiquitin. Limited tryptic digestion of active ubiquitin yields the inactive, later eluting form and the dipeptide glycylglycine. This preteolytic cleavage apparently occurs during purification from most tissues. We thus propose reserving the term ubiquitin for the intact 76-amino acid sequence and designating the 74-amino acid sequence as ubiquitin-t to indicate its derivation by a tryptic-like protease cleavage. This 76-residue sequence is consistent with the covalent structure of protein A-24, a conjugate where carboxyl group of the COOH-terminal glycylglycine of ubiquitin is linked by an amide bond to the epsilon-amino group of Lys-119 of histone H2A. Thus, the structural requirements of the protein and ubiquitin molecules are identical for formation of protein A-24 and for forming the covalent conjugates thought to be intermediates in ATP-dependent protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1502235378,"Myosin light chain kinase and a fraction of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase have been partially purified from bovine brain by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose. The myosin kinase was purified approximately 3700-fold and has an estimated molecular weight of 130,000 +/- 10,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. A fraction of soluble cAMP-dependent protein kinase also bound to calmodulin-Sepharose and was purified 2300-fold. A fraction of this cAMP-dependent protein kinase after purification by glycerol gradient centrifugation was shown to contain the two subunits of calcineurin, a major calmodulin-binding protein in brain, and the two subunits of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a ratio of 1:1:2:2. Its sedimentation coefficient was 8.1 S and 9.0 S when centrifuged in the absence or presence of calmodulin, suggesting the formation of a complex between calmodulin and protein kinase. Our results suggest the possibility that calcineurin may be involved in the interaction between the protein kinase and calmodulin. Furthermore, our studies imply that the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but not the catalytic subunit, is the site of interaction with calmodulin since the catalytic subunit of protein kinase was partially resolved from the complex by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1539447918,"Product formation during the oxidation of xanthine oxidase has been examined directly by using cytochrome c peroxidase as a trapping agent for hydrogen peroxide and the reduction of cytochrome c as a measure of superoxide formation. When fully reduced enzyme is mixed with high concentrations of oxygen, 2 molecules of H2O2/flavin are produced rapidly, while 1 molecule of O2-/flavin is produced rapidly and another produced much more slowly. Time courses for superoxide formation and those for the absorbance changes due to enzyme oxidation were fitted successfully to the mechanism proposed earlier (Olson, J. S., Ballou, D. P., Palmer, G., and Massey, V. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4363-4382). In this scheme, each oxidative step is initiated by the very rapid and reversible formation of an oxygen.FADH2 complex (the apparent KD = 2.2 X 10(-4) M at 20 degrees C, pH 8.3). In the cases of 6- and 4-electron-reduced enzyme, 2 electrons are transferred rapidly (ke = 60 s-1) to generate hydrogen peroxide and partially oxidized xanthine oxidase. In the case of the 2-electron-reduced enzyme, only 1 electron is transferred rapidly and superoxide is produced. The remaining electron remains in the iron-sulfur centers and is removed slowly by a second order process (ks = 1 X 10(4) M-1 s-1). When the pH is decreased from 9.9 to 6.2, both the apparent KD for oxygen binding and the rapid rate of electron transfer are decreased about 20-fold. This result is suggestive of uncompetitive inhibition and implies that proton binding to the enzyme-flavin active site affects primarily the rate of electron transfer, not the formation of the initial oxygen complex."
https://openalex.org/W1523445848,"Diphtheria toxin inactivates protein synthesis elongation factor 2 by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of a novel derivative of histidine, diphthamide, in the protein (Van Ness, B. G., Howard, J. B., and Bodley, J. W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10710-10716). In this report, we describe experiments involving nuclear Overhauser enhancement NMR spectroscopy which were undertaken to elucidate the site of ADP-ribosylation of diphthamide and the configuration of the glycosidic bond formed by the toxin. The essential result of these experiments is that, in ribosyl-diphthamide obtained by enzymatic digestion of ADP-ribosyl-elongation factor-2, the H-5 imidazole proton is near the R-4 proton of ribose. This result and others are consistent with the interpretation that diphtheria toxin covalently attaches ADP-ribose to the imidazole N-1 of diphthamide via an alpha-glycosidic linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1580025538,"The reaction of the copper of (Cu,Zn)-superoxide dismutase with diethyldithiocarbamate was studied at pH = 7.4 and the results obtained led to a reaction scheme basically different from the conclusion of a previous study (Misra, H. P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11623-11628). The analysis of optical and ESR spectra at 9 and 35 GHz, at different ligand/protein ratios and reaction times, showed that a ternary diethyldithiocarbamate. Cu(II).protein complex never formed in spectroscopically detectable amounts. The system is described in any condition as the mixture, in variable proportions, of only two components, that is the diethyldithiocarbamate-free (Cu(II) chelate and the copper-depleted protein. The formation of a catalytically active copper-diethyldithiocarbamate intermediate with distinct optical and ESR spectra was also ruled out by kinetic studies, which demonstrated that enzyme inactivation strictly parallels the binding of diethyldithiocarbamate as monitored by optical absorption and ESR. Separation of the copper complex from the protein was obtained for the first time, and the procedure was suitable for rapid preparation of reconstitutable copper-free superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1538124961,"The distribution of lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediates in cultured mammalian cells has been studied under conditions of glucose deprivation. It was found that at low to moderate cell densities within 20 min of glucose starvation, the major species of lipid-linked oligosaccharide shifted from mainly a single species containing three glucose, nine mannose, and two N-acetylglucosamine residues to a pattern dominated by two species containing either five mannose and two N-acetylglucosamine residues or two mannose and two N-acetylglucosamine residues. At high cell densities, this effect was not evident. Continued glucose starvation at low density resulted in a second shift in distribution in which the proportions of these two species decreased and that of the original major species (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) increased. Addition of glucose or mannose, but not pyruvate, glutamine, galactose, inositol, or glycine, prevented the shift to the Man5GlcNAc2 and Man2GlcNAc2 species. The intermediates that accumulate during glucose starvation were identified by their elution position on gel filtration columns, sensitivity to digestion with alpha-mannosidase, resistance to digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and by the products of Smith degradation. These data suggest that a regulatory point in the lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthetic pathway exists at the reaction in which Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol is converted to Man6GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol."
https://openalex.org/W1497651357,"Single crystals of myoglobin nitroxide (MbNO) are examined by the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at ambient and cryogenic temperatures for both the 14NO and 15NO derivatives. The principal values and the eigenvectors of the g tensor and the hyperfine coupling tensor are determined: g xx = 2.050, g yy = 2.022, and g zz = 1.993; A xi xi = 15.6, A zeta zeta = 21.4, and A eta eta = 26.7 G for the nitrogen in 15NO at ambient temperature. The Fe--N--O bond angle is calculated to be 153 degrees. This result is in good agreement with the x-ray structural result on the six-liganded model compound with the bent Fe--N--O configuration. The principal values and the eigenvectors of the g tensor and the hyperfine coupling tensor are also determined at 77 K for Mb15NO; gxx = 2.076, gyy = 1.979, and gzz = 2.002; A xi xi = 21, A zeta zeta = 24, and A eta eta = 27 G. The Fe--N--O bond angle is calculated to be 109 degrees. The hyperfine splittings attributed to N epsilon atom of proximal histidine are observed in the direction of the gzz at both temperatures. The drastic shift of the EPR spectrum of MbNO single crystal is observed below the freezing point of this crystal. It clearly demonstrates that the conformation of the bonding NO is drastically altered upon freezing. The temperature dependence of the EPR spectra of MbNO below the freezing point cannot be explained only by appropriate combinations of the higher temperature type and the lower temperature type and suggests the contribution from an unpaired electron with the iron dz2 and dyz (or dxz) orbitals. The present EPR results demonstrated that the changes in the molecular orientations are induced by freezing of the biological molecules without disorder of the crystal lattice."
https://openalex.org/W1602773970,"The state of assembly of the (H+ + K+)-ATPase in purified hog gastric mucosa membranes was studied by target size analysis applied to radiation-induced enzyme inactivation and polypeptide degradation data. Radiation inactivated the Mg2+-ATPase, K+-stimulated ATPase, and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities of the membrane preparation with a dose dependence characteristic of a target size of 270,000-daltons. Radiation also bleached the major 100,000-dalton sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis band of this preparation, indicating a radiation-induced degradation. This apparent polypeptide degradation exhibited a dose dependency corresponding to a target size of 250,000 daltons in situ. It is suggested that the gastric ATPase is a trimeric assembly of the 100,000-dalton polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1592736409,"A partially purified protein preparation from rat liver catalyzed the ADP-ribosylation of low molecular weight guanidino compounds and proteins. Agmatine and arginine, previously shown to be effective acceptors for the guanidine-dependent erythrocyte ADP-ribosyltransferase, were used as acceptors by the rat liver enzyme; lysine, histidine, and serine were inactive. The product of the reaction between [adenine-U-14C]NAD and agmatine catalyzed by the rat liver enzyme co-chromatographed with [adenine-U-14C]ADP-ribose-agmatine which was synthesized by the erythrocyte transferase; in parallel assays, formation of this product was associated with stoichiometric release of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide from [carbonyl-14C]NAD. In the presence of histones or other proteins and [adenine-U-14C]NAD or [32P]NAD, the rat liver enzyme catalyzed the formation of a radioactive product which was precipitable by trichloroacetic acid. Digestion of the [adenine-U-14C]-labeled precipitate with snake venom phosphodiesterase released a labeled compound identified as 5'-AMP. These data are consistent with the conclusion that a mono-(ADP-ribosyltransferase) is present in rat liver which utilizes guanidino compounds such as arginine as ADP-ribose acceptors. The ADP-ribose-glutamate bond has been shown to exist in rat liver. Since the catalytic sites of each transferase can accommodate and thus ADP-ribosylate only one specific amino acid, a family of site-specific transferases must be present. The availability of multiple site-specific transferases permits the cell to exert further control over ADP-ribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1599385877,"A high Km cytoplasmic cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.4.1.17) has been obtained from bovine brain. The unproteolyzed enzyme contains (63 +/- 1) X 10(3) molecular weight polypeptide chains which exhibit little if any basal catalytic activity. Complexation with calmodulin stimulates the catalytic activity nearly 2 orders of magnitude, presumably, by causing a conformational change in the enzyme which either creates or exposes the catalytic sites. Removal of about 120 amino acids from the terminal portion(s) of each polypeptide chain either by an endogenous protease or by exogenous trypsin prevents calmodulin complexation and generates a basal catalytic activity equivalent to that of the unproteolyzed enzyme-calmodulin complex. In contrast to affinity chromatography using immobilized calmodulin, blue dextran-Sepharose chromatography can be used to select for enzyme containing only unproteolyzed polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1576529469,"Magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy has been used to characterize the oxidation-reduction behavior of cytochromes a and a3 during potentiometric experiments. The experiments were complicated by the presence of slow, time-dependent changes during reduction, and it appears that reliable results can only be obtained during reoxidation or with enzyme that has been subjected to a cycle of reduction and oxidation. Under all experimental conditions the reduction levels of cytochrome a and a3 are comparable. This result cannot be reconciled with a model in which the two heme centers have defined and well resolved potentials. The most straightforward explanation of the data requires an oxidation-reduction coupling of the potentials of the two hemes, i.e. an allosteric or heme-heme interaction, which is about 2 K cal/mol in magnitude. There is a good correlation between magnetic circular dichroism and EPR measurements obtained on parallel samples. The kinetics of the slow, time-dependent processes have been characterized by measurement of a variety of spectral properties and enzyme activity. All parameters measured change at comparable rates, implying a common rate-controlling event. A new copper EPR signal has been observed at high pH. This signal appears to rise from the EPR-undetectable copper center."
https://openalex.org/W1516739899,"[32P]ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was partially digested by trypsin. Two tryptic 32P-labeled phosphopeptides containing more than 90% of the 32P radioactivity present on the phosphorylated enzyme were purified and found to have overlapping amino acid sequences around the same phosphorylated site (Thr-Ala-Ser(32P)-Phe-Ser-Glu-Ser-Arg). Tryptic digestion of 32P-labeled ATP-citrate lyase purified from 32P-labeled hepatocytes exposed to glucagon yielded a major 32P-labeled peptide of identical amino acid composition with that indicated above. Thus, the site on ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro resides on the same octapeptide as the site of glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation in intact hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1608189042,"The sequence of almost 700 nucleotides encompassing the gene for ribosomal protein S20 of Escherichia coli has been determined using the chemical technique of Maxam and Gilbert (Maxam, A. M., and Gilbert, W. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 560-564). Comparison of this sequence with that of known bacterial promoters reveals two promoter-like sequences whose putative initiation sites for transcription lie 132 (site 1) and 42 (site 2) base pairs to the 5' side of the coding sequence. Partial digestion experiments demonstrate that RNA polymerase is capable of binding to and protecting both of these sites from DNase 1 digestion, consistent with their functioning as promoters. Interestingly, site 1 is more compact that any previously described bacterial promoter. A second feature of the sequence is the presence of UUG as the translational initiation codon. Finally, the nucleotide sequence supports the hypothesis (Jue, R. A., Woodbury, N. W., and Doolittle, R. F. (1980) J. Mol. Evol. 15, 129-148) that S20 is composed of three tandemly repeated domains."
https://openalex.org/W1556531868,"An in situ autoradiographic assay for CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-sn-diacylglycerol ethanolamine phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.1) activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells was developed and used to screen approximately 10,000 individual mutagen-treated colonies attached to filter paper (Esko, J. D., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1190-1193). A variant (strain 40.11) was isolated in which the ethanolamine phosphotransferase specific activity in vitro was 6-10-fold less than in the parent, but the level of CDP-choline:1,2-sn-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.2) activity was normal. In extracts, the mutant was also defective in the synthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen. In vivo, the short term kinetics of labeling with [32P]phosphate or [14C]ethanolamine was correspondingly altered. However, the long tem growth rate and steady state phospholipid compositions of the mutant and parent were quite similar. These results show that the ethanolamine and choline phosphotransferases of Chinese hamster ovary cells are distinct as judged by genetic criteria, while the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and its plasmalogen share common enzymatic component(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1539949523,"Abstract Incubation of washed human blood platelets with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl [3H]adenosine (FSBA) covalently labels a single polypeptide of Mr = 100,000. Protection by ADP has suggested that an ADP receptor on the platelet surface membrane was modified. The modified cells, unlike native platelets, failed to aggregate in response to ADP (100 microM) and fibrinogen (1 mg/ml). The extent of binding of 125I-fibrinogen and aggregation was inhibited to a degree related to the incorporation of 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (SBA) into platelets, indicating FSBA could inhibit the exposure of fibrinogen receptors by ADP necessary for aggregation. Incubation of SBA platelets with alpha-chymotrypsin cleaved the covalently labeled polypeptide and concomitantly reversed the inhibition of aggregation and fibrinogen binding. Platelets proteolytically digested by chymotrypsin prior to exposure to FSBA did not require ADP for aggregation and fibrinogen binding. Moreover, subsequent exposure to FSBA did not inhibit aggregation or fibrinogen binding. The affinity reagent FSBA can displace fibrinogen bound to platelets in the presence of ADP, as well as promote the rapid disaggregation of the platelets. The apparent initial pseudo-first order rate constant of dissociation of fibrinogen was linearly proportional to FSBA concentrations. These studies suggest that a single polypeptide can be altered either by ADP-induced conformational changes or proteolysis by chymotrypsin to reveal latent fibrinogen receptors and promote aggregation of platelets after fibrinogen binding."
https://openalex.org/W1650181147,"Two N-1 type iron-sulfur clusters in NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I, EC 1.6.5.3) were potentiometrically resolved: one was titrated as a component with a midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of -335 mV at pH 8.0, and with an n-value equal to one; the other as an extremely low midpoint potential component (Em 8.0 less than -500 mV). These two clusters are tentatively assigned to N-1b and N-1a, respectively. Cluster N-1b is completely reducible with NADH and has a spin concentration of about 0.8/FMN. Its EPR spectrum can be simulated as a single rhombic component with principal g values of 2.019, 1.937, and 1.922, which correspond to the Center 1 reported earlier by Orme-Johnson, N. R., Hansen, R. E., and Beinert, H. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1922-1927. At extremely low oxidation-reduction potentials (less than -450 mV), additional EPR signals emerge with apparent g values of gz = 2.03, gy = 1.95, and gx = 1.91, which we assign to cluster N-1a. It is difficult, however, to simulate the detailed spectral line shape of this component as a single rhombic component, suggesting some degree of protein modification or interaction with a neighboring oxidation-reduction component. EPR spectra of soluble NADH dehydrogenase, containing 5-6 g atoms of non-heme iron and 5-6 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of FMN, were examined. Signals from at least two iron-sulfur species could be distinguished in the NADH-reduced form: one of an N-1b type spectrum; the other of a spectrum with g values of 2.045, 1.95, and 1.87 (total of about 0.5 spin equivalents/FMN). This is the first example of an N-1 type signal detected in isolated soluble NADH dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W179605333,"We have measured nuclear protein kinase activity during the prereplicative phase of rat liver regeneration. Total nuclear protein kinase activity increased significantly 15-18 h after partial hepatectomy, with the peak of activity occurring at 16 h. DEAE-Sephacel chromatography resolved nuclear protein kinase activity into two cAMP-independent (Ib and II) and two cAMP-dependent (Ia and III) protein kinases. Sixteen h after partial hepatectomy, there was a marked increase in the activities of the nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinases and a decrease in the activity of nuclear cAMP-independent protein kinase II. Characterization of the two nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinases revealed them to be identical with the cytosolic type I and II isozymes. Immunotitration of nuclear catalytic subunit and densitometric analysis of autoradiographs from 8-azido-[32P]cAMP-labeled nuclear RI revealed increases in both subunits 16 h afer partial hepatectomy. Concomitantly with the observed increase in nuclear protein kinase activity, we have observed an increase in the phosphorylation of histone H1 subspecies. Administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist DL-propranolol, which has been shown to cause delays of equal duration in both the second phase of increased intracellular cAMP levels and the initiation of DNA synthesis (MacManus, J. P., Braceland, B. M., Youdale, T., and Whitfield, J. F. (1973) J. Cell. Physiol. 82, 157-164), results in an equivalent delay of increased nuclear protein kinase activity. Colchicine, which has previously been shown to prevent the onset of DNA synthesis (Walker, P. R., and Whitfield, J. F. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1394-1398), also prevents the increased protein kinase activity normally observed 16 h after partial hepatectomy. We conclude that the onset of DNA synthesis in the regenerating rat liver is preceded by a cAMP-mediated translocation of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase to the nucleus and phosphorylative modification of histone H1 subspecies. The inhibitory effects of propranolol and colchicine suggest a common cAMP-mediated, colchicine-sensitive link between protein kinase translocation and the initiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1695140087,"Activation of normal or myeloperoxidase-deficient human granulocytes by phorbol myristate acetate resulted in an initial membrane depolarization as indicated by an increase in fluorescence of the lipophilic cation probe of membrane potential, 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine. A subsequent apparent hyperpolarization (decrease in fluorescence) was observed in normal but not myeloperoxidase-deficient cells. Addition of purified myeloperoxidase restored a normal pattern of fluorescence changes to the enzyme-deficient granulocytes. The secondary decrease in fluorescence in normal cells was markedly blunted by addition of azide, cyanide, or catalase. In a cell-free system, the fluorescence of 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine, but not that of 3,3'-dipentyloxadicarbocyanine, was rapidly eliminated by myeloperoxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a halide; this loss of fluorescence was inhibited by azide, cyanide, or catalase. These findings indicate that secretion of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide by activated granulocytes results in decreased fluorescence of 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine, probably by thioether oxidation. While the determination of initial rates of depolarization using this probe is unaffected by the myeloperoxidase system, measurement of extent of depolarization and any subsequent membrane potential changes requires the addition of inhibitors. In the absence of inhibitors, the secondary decrease in fluorescence can be used as an indicator of secretion of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1496789499,"The mechanism of prostaglandin synthase-dependent N-dealkylation has been investigated using an enzyme preparation derived from ram seminal vesicles. Incubation of an N-alkyl substrate, aminopyrine, with enzyme and arachidonic acid, 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid, or tert-butyl hydroperoxide resulted in the formation of the transient aminopyrine free radical species. Formation of this radical species, which was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and/or absorbance at 580 nm, was maximal approximately 30 s following initiation of the reaction and declined thereafter. Free radical formation corresponded closely with formaldehyde formation in this system, in terms of dependence upon substrate and cofactor concentration, as well as in terms of time course. Both aminopyrine free radical and formaldehyde formation were inhibited by indomethacin and flufenamic acid, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthase. The results suggest that the aminopyrine free radical is an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthase-dependent aminopyrine N-demethylase pathway. The aminopyrine free radical electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum revealed that this species is a one-electron oxidized cation radical of the parent compound. A reaction mechanism has been proposed in which aminopyrine undergoes two sequential one-electron oxidations to an iminium cation, which is then hydrolyzed to the demethylated amine and formaldehyde. Accordingly, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde product is derived from neither molecular nor hydroperoxide oxygen, but from water."
https://openalex.org/W1595057575,The guanine nucleotide regulatory protein component (N) of the frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase system appears to form a stable complex with the beta-adrenergic receptor (R) in the presence of agonist (H). This agonist-promoted ternary complex HRN can be solubilized with Lubrol. The guanine nucleotide regulatory protein associated with the solubilized complex can be adsorbed either to GTP-Sepharose directly or to wheat germ lectin-Sepharose via its interaction with the receptor which is a glycoprotein. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)(GTP gamma S) can be used to elute the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein from either Sepharose derivative. The resulting N.GTP gamma S complex conveys nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity when combined with a Lubrol-solubilized extract of turkey erythrocyte membranes. The ability to observe GTP gamma S-dependent reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity in the eluate from either resin required the formation of the HRN complex prior to solubilization. The N protein can be identified by its specific [32P]ADP ribosylation catalyzed by cholera toxin in the presence of [32P]NAD+. The existence of a stable HRN intermediate complex is supported by the observation that agonist pretreatment of frog erythrocyte membranes results in a 100% increase in the amount of 32P-labeled N protein eluted from the lectin-Sepharose in the presence of GTP gamma S compared to membranes pretreated with either antagonist or agonist plus GTP. Our results therefore provide evidence that the same guanine nucleotide-binding protein that associates with the beta-adrenergic receptor in the presence of agonist mediates adenylate cyclase activation.

Of several potential assay methods tested for their ability to separate receptor-bound from free ligand, only gel filtration through an acrylamide cross-linked agarose matrix yielded satisfactory results. Approximately 70% of the receptor initially present in the membrane was recovered in the digitonin extract. Binding of 125I-labeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys to the soluble receptor was rapid (t 1/2 at 22 degrees C less than 5 min), of high affinity (Kd = 2.2 nM) and saturable. The relative potencies of a small series of peptides as inhibitors of binding to the soluble receptor paralleled their potencies as inhibitors of the membrane-bound receptor. N-Formylation of the peptides was required for high affinity binding. Binding was maximal at pH 6.5 and was sulfhydryl-dependent; 20 microM p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid decreased binding by 50%. 125I-labeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys was specifically cross-linked to the soluble receptor with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) and an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 to 70,000 and determined for the soluble receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A strategy for obtaining an active, detergent-soluble receptor preparation based on covalent affinity labeling is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1491269109,"The accessibility of five specific DNA sequences to six different single site restriction endonucleases was evaluated in replicating and mature simian virus 40 chromosomes isolated by three different methods. Electron microscopic and gel electrophoretic analysis of the DNA digestion products demonstrated that DNA accessibility in chromatin was established within 400 base pairs of replication forks and remained essentially unchanged during production of mature chromosomes and their subsequent re-entry into the replication pool. Saturating amounts of each enzyme reproducibly cut a fraction of the chromosomes, ranging from 13 to 49%. This is consistent with a nearly random phasing of chromatin structure. Examples in which all chromosomes were either cleaved or intact were never observed. Although variation in the accessibility of DNA sites near the origin of replication could be interpreted as preferred phasing in about 25% of the chromosomes, the finding that two isoschizomers, Hpa II and Msp I, did not cut chromosomes to the same extent precludes an unambiguous interpretation of the extents of cleavage of individual restriction enzymes. Since the extent of DNA cleavage observed at each restriction site was essentially indistinguishable in replicating as compared to mature chromosomes, the accessibility of DNA sequences near the origin is not obviously related to replication. Furthermore, the accessibility of DNA sites on one arm of a single replication fork was the same as the homologous sites on the other arm, consistent with a nearly random phasing of chromatin structure on both arms. This suggests that chromatin assembly occurs independently on the 2 sibling molecules of a single replicating chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1582507827,"Chicken delta-crystallin has at least two similar genes containing multiple intervening sequences. Hybridization experiments utilizing DNA probes derived from intervening sequences contained within cloned delta-crystallin gene fragments indicated that both of these two delta-crystallin genes are transcribed in the embryonic lens. No evidence for transcription of these genes was found in nuclei prepared from decapitated chicken embryos. Comparison of restriction enzyme digests of genomic DNA prepared from lens and non-lens tissues showed that the delta-crystallin gene sequences are not grossly rearranged in the lens during development. Msp I and Hpa II digests revealed that there are at lest three -CCGG- sites in the delta-crystallin genes that are hypomethylated in the embryonic lens DNA but are hypermethylated in sperm, red blood cell, or headless embryo DNAs. The delta-crystallin genes were not transcribed and these three sites were methylated in embryonic lens epithelial cells that were transformed with a temperature-sensitive Rous sarcoma virus. These results associate delta-crystallin gene transcription and site-specific hypomethylation of the delta-crystallin DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1620315017,"Involvement of covalently linked protein or peptide in the structure or synthesis of hyaluronate has not previously been convincingly demonstrated. We have developed conditions for double-labeling with [3H]leucine and [14C]acetate, then isolating and characterizing the cell-associated and secreted hyaluronate-protein complexes of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts. The preparations were purified by Bio-Gel A-15m gel filtration and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation under dissociative conditions, followed by acid agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The purified hyaluronate preparations did not change their 3H:14C ratios after further sodium dodecyl sulfate or alkali treatment. The cell-derived hyaluronate-protein was resistant to pronase but susceptible to proteinase K in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. After chondroitinase ABC digestion, the cell-derived 3H-labeled protein was separated from the 14C-labeled hyaluronate disaccharides, then shown to give a broad band corresponding to Mr approximately 12,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and to be susceptible to both pronase and proteinase K. The corresponding 3H-labeled peptide was prepared in the same manner from the medium hyaluronate and the [3H]leucine shown to be present in material smaller in amount and size than that from the cell. We propose from these and other published data that the cell-associated hyaluronate-protein may be bound to the cell surface and that the hyaluronate in the medium may be derived from it as a result of proteolytic scission."
https://openalex.org/W1494177376,"The atomic models of the cytochrome b562 and cytochrome c' monomers have been compared. When the respective heme groups are superimposed, the four alpha-helices of each nearly coincide. Four aromatic side chains, including the heme ligands, and a methionine occur in spatially equivalent positions in contact with the heme groups. This structural evidence suggests that the two cytochrome families may have diverged from a common molecular ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1556888736,"The pore-forming protein of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, porin, was chemically modified with acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and glycinamide. Extensive modification of amino groups of the functional porin trimers caused reduced diffusion rates of the negatively charged solutes such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate and AMP, but did not reduce significantly the diffusion of positively charged molecules carbobenzoxy-glycyl-prolyl-arginine-p-nitranilide and tosyl-glycyl-prolyl-arginine-p-nitranilide. Modification of carboxyl groups of trimers caused decreased diffusion rates of the positively charged solutes more significantly than the diffusion rates of negatively charged solutes. The results suggest that the ionic interactions play an important role for the diffusion of charged solutes through the porin pore. The diffusion of p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucoside, an uncharged solute, ws not influenced significantly by modification of either amino or carboxyl groups. This observation suggests that modifications only occurred in areas outside of the narrowest portion of the pore or, alternatively, that amino and carboxyl groups are exclusively located at noncylindrical area of the pore. The structural integrity of the acetylated and the succinylated trimers seemed well preserved. On the other hand, modification of carboxyl groups decreased the thermal stability of trimers and extensive modifications caused the dissociation of trimers into monomers at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1493621680,"Monolayer cultures of chondrocytes isolated from 11-day-old chick embryo vertebral cartilage were transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, and the effects of transformation on synthesis and secretion of extracellular proteins by these cells were studied. Transformation resulted in decreased synthesis of type II collagen which did not appear to be due to underhydroxylation of collagenous protein but to a decrease in the total amount synthesized. Carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis failed to demonstrate any alpha 2 chains as a result of the transformation, suggesting that conversion of type II to type I collagen did not occur. In contrast to the decrease in collagen synthesis, synthesis of a molecule with biochemical characteristics similar to fibronectin increased markedly in virally transformed cultures. Although there were no significant differences in the amount of fibronectin-like molecules in the cell layers of normal and transformed chondrocytes, a marked increase of these molecules in the culture media of the transformed cells was demonstrated. These findings were confirmed by experiments with temperature-sensitive mutants of the virus."

https://openalex.org/W1593642694,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the cardiac isozyme of phosphorylase kinase. beta-Subunit phosphorylation achieves a maximum level of between 1 to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of phosphorylase kinase, a value less than the stoichiometric content of beta-subunits in the enzyme. This, less than stoichiometric incorporation, is not a result of the presence of endogenous phosphate in equivalent sites in the remaining beta-subunit moieties. Pretreatment of phosphorylase kinase with phosphoprotein phosphatase, under conditions proven to dephosphorylate such sites, does not modify the observed extent of beta-subunit phosphorylation. alpha'-Subunit phosphorylation is initiated at a slower rate than beta but achieves a higher maximum level of incorporation. alpha'-Subunit phosphorylation, but not the extent of beta-subunit phosphorylation, is stimulated by MnCl2 and partially inhibited by NaF; neither is effected by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The activation of cardiac phosphorylase kinase that occurs concomitantly with phosphorylation appears to be dependent upon phosphate incorporation into both the alpha- and beta-subunits. At low levels of activation a close correlation is observed between activation and either alpha-subunit phosphorylation, beta-subunit phosphorylation, or total phosphorylation. However, the cAMP-dependent catalyzed phosphorylation of alpha, at a time after which beta-subunit phosphorylation is already maximal, also results in activation of cardiac phosphorylase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1599177165,"Ecto-cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was determined from freshly isolated and cultured liver cells. The cells were capable of hydrolyzing cyclic AMP in the medium. The ecto-phosphodiesterase represents a low Km phosphodiesterase which was activated by physiological concentrations of insulin. The product, 5'-AMP, was recovered in the medium and not with the cells. The enzyme was inhibited with aminophylline and trypsin. The ecto-phosphodiesterase activity was proportional to cell number, and total phosphodiesterase activity increased 5- to 10-fold when the cells were ruptured. About one-third of the ecto-phosphodiesterase activity from freshly isolated liver was due to phosphodiesterase in the medium. No phosphodiesterase was in the medium of cultured liver cells."

https://openalex.org/W1530432631,"Incubation of rat liver plasma membranes with MgCl2, ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system at 4 degrees C provides a 4-7-fold persistent activation of adenylate cyclase. Enzyme activation is time-dependent and 48 h of incubation is usually required to achieve maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The activation described is not affected by GTP, cAMP, or cGMP, and does not occur when ATP is replaced by a nonphosphorylating analogue, adenyl-5'-imidodiphosphate. In addition to ATP, the activation requires Mg2+ and an ATP-regenerating system. The activation described is not additive with that produced by fluoride and analysis of basal and fluoride activities following extended incubation for 48 h reveals identical activities which decay at the same rate. These results are consistent with our model (11) which invokes phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanisms in regulating adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2103262543,"Cytochrome c synthetase in yeast mitochondria catalyzes the formation of a yeast cytochrome c-like species from the apoprotein and hemin (Basile, G., DiBello, C., and Taniuchi, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7181-7191). To test the specificity of this enzyme, 125I-labeled horse apocytochrome c was incubated with the yeast mitochondrial fraction in the presence of hemin, NADPH, and an ethanol extract of the postmitochondrial fraction. A radioactive 125I-labeled cytochrome c-like species was formed in yields of up to 26%. This 125I-labeled species is indistinguishable from horse cytochrome c by ion exchange chromatography (under the conditions which allow separation of horse and yeast cytochrome c), resistance in its reduced form to digestion by trypsin, resistance against autoxidation, reduction by cytochrome b2, and generation of the apoprotein after treatment with silver sulfate and dithiothreitol. With unlabeled horse apoprotein and [59Fe]hemin, the yield of a [59Fe-labeled horse cytochrome c-like species was up to 7% with respect to the apoprotein incubated. The yield of the 59Fe-labeled species was not altered by the addition of unlabeled FeCl3. Conversely, synthesis of the 59Fe-labeled species was not detectable after incubation of yeast mitochondria with unlabeled horse apoprotein, unlabeled hemin, and 59FeCl3. The formation of both 125I- and 59Fe-labeled cytochrome c-like species was sensitive to heat. Thus, we conclude that cytochrome c synthetase catalyzes direct bonding of heme (or hemin) to the apoprotein. Since the amino acid sequences of horse and yeast cytochromes c differ considerably, cytochrome c synthetase may recognize only a limited region(s) of the apoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1480144064,"The rate of phosphorylation of sodium and potassium ion-transport adenosine triphosphatase by 10 microM [gamma-32P]ATP was much slower with Ca2+ than with Mg2+ (0.13-10 mM) in the presence of 16 to 960 mM Na+ at 0 degrees C and pH 7.4. In the presence of a fixed concentration of Mg2+ or Ca2+, the rate became slower with increasing Na+ concentration. When the Na+ concentration was fixed, the rate became slower with decreasing divalent cation concentration. Sodium ions appear to antagonize the divalent cation in the phosphorylation to slow its rate. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and 126 or 270 mM Na+, the rate was slow enough to permit the manual addition of a chasing solution at various times before the phosphorylation reached the steady state. Therefore, we studied the time-dependent change of the sensitivity to ADP or to K+ of the phosphoenzyme by a chase with unlabeled ATP containing ADP or K+ during the time range from the transient to the steady state of the phosphorylation. The ADP sensitivity decreased and the K+ sensitivity increased with the progress of the phosphorylation. With 270 mM Na+, the phosphoenzyme found at 1 s, when its amount was 5.5% of the maximum level, was virtually completely sensitive to ADP. Under these conditions, it was concluded that the form of the phosphoenzyme initially produced from the enzyme.ATP complex has ADP sensitivity and that the phosphoenzyme acquires K+ sensitivity later. The initially produced ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme partially lost its normal instability and sensitivity upon adding a chelating agent, probably because of dissociation of a divalent cation from the phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1496886082,"The structures of phage-coded dihydrofolate reductases are of interest because of 1) possible relationship to plasmid-coded dihydrofolate reductases; 2) unusual regulation of enzyme synthesis; and 3) multiple roles and intermolecular interactions involving the protein. To prepare for primary structural studies, we have cloned the T4 frd gene, which codes for dihydrofolate reductase, and we have determined for redetermined some physical properties of the enzyme. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of about 44,500, as determined by sedimentation velocity and gel filtration, and a subunit molecular weight of about 23,000, as determined by aminopterin titration and denaturing gel electrophoresis. We conclude that the enzyme is a dimer, with each subunit containing one methotrexate-binding site. A 1.1-kilobase pair fragment from a HindIII restriction digest of cytosine-substituted T4 DNA was cloned into pBR322, and recombinants were identified by trimethoprim resistance. Cells carrying this recombinant plasmid produce both the host cell and phage-coded dihydrofolate reductases."

https://openalex.org/W1567655755,"Ribonuclease T2, nuclease S1, and snake venom phosphodiesterase were used as a structural probe for investigation of the interaction between Escherichia coli tRNAfMet and methionyl-tRNA synthetase, and the cleavage sites were analyzed by a rapid sequencing gel electrophoresis of 5'-32P-labeled tRNA. Both endonucleases cleaved the D-loop of synthetase-bound tRNA much more extensively than that of the free tRNA. Positions of A14, G15, A22, and G23 in the D-loop and C35 in the anticodon of the synthetase-bound tRNA were more susceptible to RNase T2. The synthetase-bound tRNA was predominantly cleaved by nuclease S1 at position of G15, G19, G20, and G23 in the D-loop and G2 in the acceptor stem. In contrast, the synthetase-bound tRNA was more resistant to the 3'-exonuclease, snake venom phosphodiesterase, than was the free tRNA molecule. These results suggest conformational change of the tRNA by the synthetase binding which weakened tertiary interaction between the D-loop and T psi C-loop/extra-loop. Production of acid-soluble radioactivity was also examined in the limited digestion of 5'-32P-labeled tRNA or 3'-14C-labeled methionyl-tRNA. The synthetase enhanced the release of acid-soluble oligonucleotides from the 5'-end of the tRNA but suppressed that from the 3'-end of the molecule. These results are consistent with that obtained by gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1571198004,"The expression of the X and Y pseudo-ovalbumin genes is stimulated by estrogen to a much lesser extent than the expression of the authentic ovalbumin gene in the chicken oviduct. Since it is possible that the primary structures of the 5' flanking regions of these genes are responsible for their differential hormonal responses, we have identified the 5' transcription domains of the X and Y pseudo-ovalbumin genes and determined their nucleotide sequences. Similar to many other eukaryotic genes, the X, Y, and ovalbumin genes each contain an (A + T)-rich heptamer located about 30 nucleotides upstream from the cap site. This sequence is TATATAT for the X and ovalbumin genes, but GATATAT for the Y gene. The 5' flanking sequences of all three genes are about 70% homologous when allowances are made for deletions and insertions. There is no obvious feature of the 5' flanking sequences of the pseudo-ovalbumin genes which can be related to differential hormonal responsiveness. Nevertheless, these 5' flanking regions appear to have been conserved relative to the intervening sequences of the pseudogenes, and thus may be important to gene function."

https://openalex.org/W1563361064,Human growth hormone and a few other related polypeptide hormones enhanced porphyrin formation induced by 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide in chick embryo liver cells maintained in a serum-free medium. The stimulatory effect of human growth hormone on drug-induced porphyrin formation was significant at 10 ng/ml and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Human growth hormone did not stimulate porphyrin formation in otherwise untreated cultures. These findings thus demonstrate a potentiating effect of growth hormones on hepatic porphyrin formation.
