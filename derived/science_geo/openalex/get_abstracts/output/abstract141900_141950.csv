https://openalex.org/W2119502087,"Ced-4 and Apaf-1 belong to a major class of apoptosis regulators that contain caspase-recruitment (CARD) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains. Nod1, a protein with an NH2-terminal CARD-linked to a nucleotide-binding domain and a COOH-terminal segment with multiple leucine-rich repeats, was identified. Nod-1 was found to bind to multiple caspases with long prodomains, but specifically activated caspase-9 and promoted caspase-9-induced apoptosis. As reported for Apaf-1, Nod1 required both the CARD and P-loop for function. Unlike Apaf-1, Nod1 induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) and bound RICK, a CARD-containing kinase that also induces NF-κB activation. Nod1 mutants inhibited NF-κB activity induced by RICK, but not that resulting from tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation. Thus, Nod1 is a leucine-rich repeat-containing Apaf-1-like molecule that can regulate both apoptosis and NF-κB activation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2094627540,"Previous studies have demonstrated a synergistic interaction between rhuMAb HER2 and the cytotoxic drug cisplatin in human breast and ovarian cancer cells. To define the nature of the interaction between rhuMAb HER2 and other classes of cytotoxic drugs, we applied multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis to a variety of chemotherapeutic drug/rhuMAb HER2 combinations in vitro. Synergistic interactions at clinically relevant drug concentrations were observed for rhuMAb HER2 in combination with cisplatin (CI=0.48, P=0.003), thiotepa (CI=0.67, P=0.0008), and etoposide (CI=0.54, P=0.0003). Additive cytotoxic effects were observed with rhuMAb HER2 plus doxorubicin (CI=1.16, P=0.13), paclitaxel (CI=0.91, P=0.21), methotrexate (CI=1.15, P=0.28), and vinblastine (CI=1.09, P=0.26). One drug, 5-fluorouracil, was found to be antagonistic with rhuMAb HER2 in vitro (CI=2.87, P=0.0001). In vivo drug/rhuMAb HER2 studies were conducted with HER-2/neu-transfected, MCF7 human breast cancer xenografts in athymic mice. Combinations of rhuMAb HER2 plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, etoposide, and vinblastine in vivo resulted in a significant reduction in xenograft volume compared to chemotherapy alone (P<0.05). Xenografts treated with rhuMAb HER2 plus 5-fluorouracil were not significantly different from 5-fluorouracil alone controls consistent with the subadditive effects observed with this combination in vitro. The synergistic interaction of rhuMAb HER2 with alkylating agents, platinum analogs and topoisomerase II inhibitors, as well as the additive interaction with taxanes, anthracyclines and some antimetabolites in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells demonstrates that these are rational combinations to test in human clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2065550467,"KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinase, one of the two VEGF receptors induces mitogenesis and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells. We have previously reported that a major target molecule of KDR/Flk-1 kinase is PLC-γ, and that VEGF induces activation of MAP kinase, mainly mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) in the NIH3T3 cells overexpressing KDR/Flk-1 (Takahashi and Shibuya, 1997). However, the signal transduction initiated from VEGF in endothelial cells remains to be elucidated. In primary sinusoidal endothelial cells which showed strictly VEGF-dependent growth, we found that VEGF stimulated the activation of Raf-1-MEK-MAP kinase cascade. To our surprise, an important regulator, Ras was not efficiently activated to a significant level in response to VEGF. Consistent with this, dominant-negative Ras did not block the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase. On the other hand, PKC-specific inhibitors severely reduced VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of MEK, activation of MAP kinase and subsequent DNA synthesis. A potent PI3 kinase inhibitor, Wortmannin, could not inhibit either of them. These results suggest that in primary endothelial cells, VEGF-induced activation of Raf-MEK-MAP kinase and DNA synthesis are mainly mediated by PKC-dependent pathway, much more than by Ras-dependent or PI3 kinase-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2108625211,"To prevent neoplasia, cells of multicellular organisms activate cellular disposal programs such as apoptosis in response to deregulated oncogene expression, making the suppression of such programs an essential step for potentially neoplastic cells to become established as clinically relevant tumors. Since the mutation of ras proto-oncogenes, the most frequently mutated proto-oncogenes in human tumors, is very rare in some tumor types such as glioblastomas and gastric cancers, we hypothesized that mutated ras genes might activate a cell death program that cannot be overcome by these tumor types. Here we show that the expression of oncogenically mutated ras gene induces cellular degeneration accompanied by cytoplasmic vacuoles in human glioma and gastric cancer cell lines. Cells dying as a result of oncogenic Ras expression had relatively well-preserved nuclei that were negative for TUNEL staining. An immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the cytoplasmic vacuoles are derived mainly from lysosomes. This oncogenic Ras-induced cell death occurred in the absence of caspase activation, and was not inhibited by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. These observations suggested that oncogenic Ras-induced cell death is most consistent with a type of programmed cell death designated `type 2 physiological cell death' or `autophagic degeneration', and that this cell death is regulated by a molecular mechanism distinct from that of apoptosis. Our findings suggest a possible role for this non-apoptotic cell death in the prevention of neoplasia, and the activation of the non-apoptotic cell death program may become a potential cancer therapy complementing apoptosis-based therapies. In addition, the approach used in this study may be a valuable way to find genetically-regulated cell suicide programs that cannot be overcome by particular tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W1997261294,"Previous work has led to the identification of inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the first glycosylation step in the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. These inhibitors have two identified sites of action: the inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase, resulting in the depletion of cellular glycosphingolipids, and the inhibition of 1-O-acylceramide synthase, resulting in the elevation of cell ceramide levels. A new series of glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors based on substitutions in the phenyl ring of a parent compound, 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (P4), was made. For substitutions of single functional groups, the potency of these inhibitors in blocking glucosylceramide synthase was primarily dependent upon the hydrophobic and electronic properties of the substituents. An exponential relationship was found between the IC50 of each inhibitor and the sum of derived hydrophobic (π) and electronic (ς) parameters. This relationship demonstrated that substitutions that increased the electron-donating characteristics and decreased the lipophilic characteristics of the homologues enhanced the potency of these compounds in blocking glucosylceramide formation. A novel compound was subsequently designed and observed to be even more active in blocking glucosylceramide formation. This compound,d-threo-4′-hydroxy-P4, inhibited glucosylceramide synthase at an IC50 of 90 nm. In addition, a series of dioxane substitutions was designed and tested. These included 3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl-, 3′,4′-ethylenedioxyphenyl-, and 3′4′-trimethylenedioxyphenyl-substituted homologues.d-threo-3′,4′-Ethylenedioxy-P4-inhibited glucosylceramide synthase was comparably active to thep-hydroxy homologue. 4′-Hydroxy-P4 and ethylenedioxy-P4 blocked glucosylceramide synthase activity at concentrations that had little effect on 1-O-acylceramide synthase activity. These novel inhibitors resulted in the inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis in cultured cells at concentrations that did not significantly raise intracellular ceramide levels or inhibit cell growth.

This cerebroside is synthesized from uridine diphosphate-glucose and ceramide by a glucosyltransferase, GlcCer synthase. GlcCer-based sphingolipids have been identified as important mediators of a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, development, and cell-cell recognition (1Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 23: 147-162Google Scholar). The (R,R)-(d-threo)-isomer of 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and its homologues are potent inhibitors of GlcCer synthase. These compounds have been used extensively to study the metabolism and function of glycosphingolipids in living cells (2Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J.

In previously reported work, a series of PDMP homologues and analogues was synthesized (4Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J.

In addition, replacing the morpholino ring with a pyrrolidino ring, formingdl-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (dl-threo-P4), also enhanced the inhibitory activity. It was also noted that the dl-threo-P4 derivative possessing a p-methoxy substituent on the phenyl group increased the inhibitory activity further. This latter observation led to the present study, an evaluation of other phenyl group substitutions in which the phenyl group of the P4 compound was modified by various electron-donating or -withdrawing groups. As expected, only the d-threo-enantiomers among P4 or P4 derivatives specifically inhibited the enzyme activity. The potency of these compounds in inhibiting GlcCer synthase was quantitatively related to the hydrophobic and electronic properties of the phenyl group substitutions of single substituents. This association resulted in the design of a new PDMP homologue (4′-hydoxy-P4) that was significantly more potent than those studied to date. The acetophenones and amines were from Aldrich, Lancaster Synthesis Inc., and Maybridge Chemical Co. Silica gel for column chromatography (70–230 mesh ASTM) and silica gel thin-layer chromatography plates were purchased from Merck. The reagents and their sources included non-hydroxy fatty acid ceramide from bovine brain and delipidated bovine serum albumin from Sigma, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine from Avanti, dl-dithiothreitol from Calbiochem, and uridine diphosphate-[1-3H]glucose from NEN Life Science Products. Octanoylsphingosine was prepared as described previously (7Abe A. Wu D. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The aromatic inhibitors were synthesized by the Mannich reaction from 2-N-acylaminoacetophenone, paraformaldehyde, and pyrrolidine, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride as described previously (2Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J.

For syntheses in which phenyl-substituted starting materials were used, the chloroacetophenone, methoxyacetophenone, methylenedioxyacetophenone, and methylacetophenone were brominated and converted to the primary amine. Brominations of the methoxyacetophenone, dimethoxyacetophenone, and 3′,4′-(methylenedioxy)acetophenone were performed in chloroform at room temperature, and the products were recrystallized from ethyl acetate and hexane. The synthesis of 1-(4′-hydroxy)phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol is described in detail in Fig. 1. This synthesis differed from those of the other compounds because of the need for the placement of a protecting group on the free hydroxyl (product 2) and its subsequent removal (product 8). All other syntheses employed a similar synthetic scheme. 4′-Hydroxyacetophenone (compound 1; 13.62 g, 100 mmol), benzyl bromide (17.1 g, 100 mmol), and cesium carbonate (35.83 g, 100 mmol) were added to tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and stirred overnight. The product was concentrated to dryness and recrystallized from ether and hexane to yield 15 g of 4′-benzyloxyacetophenone, which appeared as a white powder. An R F of 0.42 was observed when resolved by thin-layer chromatography using methylene chloride. 1H NMR (ppm, CDCl3) δ 7.94 (2H, d, 8.8 Hz, O-Ar-C(O)), 7.42 (5H, m,Ar′CH2O-), 7.01 (2H, d, 8.8 Hz, O-Ar-C(O)), 5.14 (2H, s, Ar′CH2O-), and 2.56 (3H, s, CH3). Bromine (80 mmol) was added dropwise over 5 min to a stirred solution of 4′-benzyloxyacetophenone (70 mmol) in 40 ml of chloroform. This mixture was stirred for an additional 5 min and quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate in water until the pH reached 7. The organic layers were combined, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to dryness. The crude mixture was purified over a silica gel column and eluted with methylene chloride to yield 2-bromo-4′-benyloxyacetophenone. AnR F of 0.62 was observed when resolved by thin-layer chromatography using methylene chloride. 1H NMR (ppm, CDCl3) δ 7.97 (2H, d, 9.2 Hz, O-Ar-C(O)), 7.43 (5H, m, Ar′CH2O-), 7.04 (2H, d, 9.0 Hz, O-Ar-C(O)), 5.15 (2H, s, Ar′CH2O-), and 4.40 (2H, s, CH2Br). Hexamethylenetetramine (methenamine; 3.8 g, 23 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 2-bromo-4′-benyloxyacetophenone (6.8 g, 23 mmol) in 100 ml of chloroform. After 4 h, the crystalline adduct was filtered and washed with chloroform. The product was dried and heated with 150 ml of methanol and 8 ml of concentrated HCl in an oil bath at 85 °C for 3 h. Upon cooling, the precipitated hydrochloride salt (2.5 g) was removed by filtration. The filtrate was left at −20 °C overnight, and additional product (2.1 g) was isolated. The yield was 4.6 g (82.6%).

Sodium acetate (50% in water, 29 ml) was added in three portions to a stirred solution of 2-amino-4′-benzyloxyacetophenone HCl (4.6 g, 17 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (200 ml). Palmitoyl chloride (19 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (25 ml) was added dropwise over 20 min, yielding a dark brown solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The aqueous fraction was removed by use of a separatory funnel, and chloroform/methanol (2:1, 150 ml) was added to the organic layer, which was then washed with water (50 ml). The yellow aqueous layer was extracted once with chloroform (50 ml). The organic solutions were then pooled and rotoevaporated until near dryness. The residue was redissolved in chloroform (100 ml) and crystallized by the addition of hexane (400 ml). The flask was cooled to 4 °C for 2 h. The crystals were filtered, washed with cold hexane, and dried in a fume hood overnight. The product yield was 3.79 g (8 mmol).

Concentrated HCl (0.26 ml) was added through the condenser, and the mixture was heated to reflux for 16 h. The resultant brown solution was cooled on ice, and then sodium borohydride (1.3 g, 34 mmol) was added in three portions. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, and the product was dried in a solvent evaporator. The residue was redissolved in dichloromethane (130 ml) and hydrolyzed with 3 n HCl (pH ∼4). The aqueous layer was twice extracted with dichloromethane (50 ml). The organic layers were pooled, washed twice with water (30 ml) and twice with saturated sodium chloride (30 ml), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dichloromethane solution was rotoevaporated to a semisolid and purified by use of a silica rotor using a solvent consisting of 10% methanol in dichloromethane. This yielded a mixture ofdl-threo- anddl-erythro-enantiomers (2.53 g, 4.2 mmol).R F values of 0.43 for theerythro-diastereomers and 0.36 for thethreo-diastereomers were observed when resolved by thin-layer chromatography using methanol/methylene chloride (1:9).

The suspension was filtered through a glass frit, and the filter was rinsed with acetic acid/methylene chloride (1:1, 5 ml). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and crystallized to yield a pale yellow semisolid (190 mg, 0.4 mmol). An R F of 0.21 was observed when resolved by thin-layer chromatography using methanol/methylene chloride (1:9).

Hexamethylenetetramine (methenamine, 5.4 g, 39 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of ethylenedioxyphenacyl bromide (10.0 g, 39 mmol) in 200 ml of chloroform. After 2 h, the crystalline adduct was filtered and washed with chloroform. The product was then dried and heated with methanol (200 ml) and concentrated HCl (14 ml) in an oil bath at 85 °C for 2 h. On cooling, the precipitated ammonium chloride was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was left in a freezer overnight. After filtration, the crystallized aminoacetophenone HCl was washed with cold isopropyl alcohol and then with ether. The yield of this product was ∼7.1 g (81%). Aminoacetophenone HCl (7.1 g, 31 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (300 ml) were placed in a 1-liter three-neck round-bottom flask with a large stir bar. Sodium acetate (50% in water, 31 ml) was added in three portions to this suspension. Palmitoyl chloride (31 ml, 10% excess, 36 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (25 ml) was then added dropwise over 20 min to yield a dark brown solution. This mixture was stirred for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The resultant mixture was poured into a separatory funnel to remove the aqueous solution. Chloroform/methanol (2:1, 150 ml) was then added to the organic layer and washed with water (50 ml). The yellow aqueous layer was extracted once with chloroform (50 ml). The organic solutions were pooled and rotoevaporated until almost dry. The residue was redissolved in chloroform (100 ml) and crystallized by the addition of hexane (400 ml). The flask was then cooled to 4 °C for 2 h. The crystals were filtered and washed with cold hexane until they were almost white and then dried in a fume hood overnight. The yield of the product was 27 mmol (11.6 g). Palmitoylaminoacetophenone (11.6 g, 27 mmol), paraformaldehyde (0.81 g, 9 mmol), pyrrolidine (3.6 ml, 42 mmol), and ethanol (250 ml) were added to a 500-ml round-flask under nitrogen flow. Concentrated HCl (0.8 ml) was added to this mixture through the reflux condenser, and the mixture was refluxed for 16 h. The brown solution was cooled in an ice bath. Sodium borohydride (2.28 g, 60 mmol) was added in three portions. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then rotoevaporated. The residue was dissolved in 130 ml of dichloromethane, and the borate complex was hydrolyzed with HCl (3 n) until the pH was ∼4. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with 50 ml of dichloromethane. The organic layers were pooled, washed twice with H2O (30 ml) and saturated NaCl (30 ml), and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The dichloromethane solution was rotoevaporated to a viscous oil, which was purified by use of a Chromatotron with a solvent consisting of 10% methanol in dichloromethane to obtain a mixture of dl-threo- and erythro-enantiomers (2.24 g, 4 mmol). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resolution of thedl-threo- anddl-erythro-enantiomers was performed using a preparative HPLC column (Chirex 3014, (S)-Val-(R)-1-(α-naphthyl)ethylamine, 20 × 250 mm; Phenomenex Inc.) eluted with hexane/1,2-dichloroethane/ethanol/trifluoroacetic acid (64:30:5.74:0.26) at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. The column eluant was monitored at 254 nm in both the preparative and analytical modes. The isolated products were reinjected until pure by analytical HPLC analysis using an analytical Chirex 3014 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and the same solvent mixture at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The enzyme activity was measured as described previously (8Shukla G. Shukla A. Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell homogenates (120 μg of protein) were incubated with uridine diphosphate-[3H]glucose (100,000 cpm) and liposomes consisting of 85 μg of octanoylsphingosine, 570 μg of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, and 100 μg of sodium sulfatide in a 200-μl reaction mixture and kept for 1 h at 37 °C. P4 and P4 derivatives dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was dispersed into the reaction mixture after adding the liposomes. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was <1%. At this concentration, there was no inhibition of the enzyme activity. MDCK cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 10-cm dishes containing 8 ml of serum-free supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (9Shayman J.A. Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G. Barcelon F. Inokuchi J.

The GlcCer synthase inhibitors were added to the medium as a 1:1 molecular complex with delipidated bovine serum albumin (4Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R.

After the incubation, the cells were washed twice with 8 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2 ml of cold methanol. The fixed cells were scraped and transferred to a glass tube. An additional 1 ml of methanol was used to recover the remaining cells in the dish. Three ml of chloroform were added to the tube and briefly sonicated using a water bath sonicator. After centrifugation at 800 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred into another glass tube. The residues were reextracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1). After the centrifugation, the resultant supernatant was combined with the first one. The residues were air-evaporated and kept for protein analysis by the bicinchoninic acid method. NaCl (0.9%) was added to the supernatant, and the ratio of chloroform/methanol/water was adjusted to 1:1:1. After centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 5 min, the upper layer was discarded. The lower layer was washed with methanol/water (1:1) in an volume equal to that of the lower layer. The resultant lower layer was transferred into a glass tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. A portion of the lipid was used for lipid phosphate determination (10Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). The remainder was analyzed using high performance thin-layer chromatography. The structures of the parent compound, d-threo-P4, and the phenyl-substituted homologues including the new dioxy-substituted and 4′-hydroxy-P4 homologues are shown in Fig. 2. Initially, the effect of each P4 isomer separated by chiral chromatography on GlcCer synthase activity was determined (Fig. 3A). Four peaks were observed for the chiral separation of P4. Peaks 1 and 2 represent the erythro-diastereomers, and peaks 3 and 4 represent the threo-diastereomers as determined by a sequential separation of the P4 mixture by reverse-phase chromatography followed by the chiral separation. The enzyme activity was specifically inhibited by the fourth peak, the d-threo-isomer (Fig. 3B). This specificity for thed-threo-enantiomer was consistent with the previous results observed in PDMP and PDMP homologues (2Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Abe A. Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Shayman J.A. Shukla G.S. Radin N.S. J. Biochem.

The IC50 of d-threo-P4 was 0.5 μm for GlcCer synthase activity measured in the MDCK cell homogenates.Figure 3Effects of P4 andp-methoxy-P4 on GlcCer synthase activity.Enantiomeric mixtures of P4 or p-methoxy-P4 were separated by chiral chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (A).

Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This improved efficacy was confirmed for the d-threo-enantiomer. The enzyme activity was potently inhibited byd-threo-p-methoxy-P4 (IC50 = 0.2 μm) (Fig. 3C). Chiral chromatography of the four p-methoxy-P4 enantiomers failed to resolve completely to base line each enantiomer (Fig. 3A). A slight inhibition of the enzyme activity byp-methoxy-P4 in a combined mixture ofd-erythro- andl-threo-enantiomers (peaks 2 and 3) was observed; this might have been due to contamination of thed-threo-isomer (peak 4) into these fractions, although this is not apparent on the separation shown. Next, a series of d-threo-P4 derivatives containing other single substituents on the phenyl group was investigated. The potency of these phenyl-substituted compounds as GlcCer synthase inhibitors was inferior to that ofd-threo-P4 orp-methoxy-d-threo-P4 (TableI). For many drugs, the effect of aromatic substitutions on the biological activity has been characterized and is often predictive. Generally, the IC50can be described by the following equation (11Högberg T. Norinder U. Larsen P.K. Bundgaard H. A Textbook of Drug Design and Development. Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia1991: 55-91Google Scholar): log(1/IC50) = a (hydrophobic parameter (π)) +b (electronic parameter (ς)) + c (steric parameter) + d (another descriptor) + e, wherea–e are the regression coefficients.Table IRelation between the electronic and partitioning properties of phenyl-substituted compounds and the inhibition of GlcCer synthased-threo-P4 derivativeς + πaThese values were estimated from the table in Ref. 11: for methoxy, ςm = 0.12, ςp = −0.27, and π = −0.02; for hydro, ς = 0 and π = 0; for methyl, ςp = −0.17 and π = 0.56; for chloro, ςp = 0.23 and π = 0.71.IC50μmp-Methoxy-P4−0.290.2bThese values were derived from Fig. 3.

For other compounds, the same analytical approach as shown in Fig. 3 was carried out to obtain the IC50 values (data not shown). Open table in a new tab The hydrophobic effect (π) is described by the equation π = logP X − log P H, whereP X is the partition coefficient of the substituted derivative and P H is that of the parent compound, measured as the distribution between octanol and water. The electronic substituent parameter (ς) was originally developed by Hammett (12Hammett L.P. Physical Organic Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1940Google Scholar) and is expressed as ς = log K X − logK H, where K X andK H are the ionization constants for apara- or meta-substituted derivative and benzoic acid, respectively. Positive ς values represent electron-withdrawing properties, and negative ς values represent electron-donating properties. The potency of d-threo-P4 and P4 derivatives as inhibitors is mainly dependent upon two factors (hydrophobic and electronic properties) of a substituent of the phenyl group (Table I). Surprisingly, a linear relationship was observed between log(IC50) and π + ς (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that the more negative the value of π + ς, the more potent ared-threo-P4 derivatives made as GlcCer synthase inhibitors. The strong association between π + ς and GlcCer synthase inhibition suggested that a still more potent inhibitor could be produced by increasing the electron-donating properties and decreasing the lipophilic properties of the phenyl group substituent. A predictably negative π + ς value would be observed for the p-hydroxy homologue. This compound was synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”), and thed-threo-enantiomer was isolated by chiral chromatography. An IC50 of 90 nm for GlcCer synthase inhibition was observed (Fig. 5), suggesting that thep-hydroxy homologue was twice as active as thep-methoxy compound. Moreover, the linear relationship between log(IC50) and π + ς was preserved (Fig. 4). To further evaluate the potential effects of structurally similar but more complex substitutions, newd-threo-P4 derivatives with methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, and trimethylenedioxy substitutions on the phenyl group were designed (Fig. 2). The enzyme activity was most strongly inhibited by d-threo-3′,4′-ethylenedioxy-P4, with an IC50 of 100 nm (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the IC50 values ford-threo-3′,4′-methylenedioxy-P4 andd-threo-3′,4′-trimethylenedioxy-P4 were ∼500 and 600 nm, respectively. Interestingly, d-threo-3′,4′-dimethoxy-P4 was inferior to these dioxy derivatives, even tod-threo-P4 or m- ord-threo-p-methoxy-P4, as an inhibitor (Fig. 6). As the parameters ςm and ςp (the Hammett constants for the meta- and para-substitutions, respectively) and π for a single methoxy substituent are 0.12, −0.27, and −0.02, respectively (11Högberg T. Norinder U. Larsen P.K. Bundgaard H. A Textbook of Drug Design and Development. Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia1991: 55-91Google Scholar), the value of π + ς ford-threo-dimethoxy-P4 is presumed to be negative. Therefore, based only on the electronic substituent parameters,d-threo-dimethoxy-P4 deviates quite far from the correlation observed in Fig. 4. This may be due to a repulsion between two methoxy groups in the dimethoxy-P4 molecule that induces a steric effect that was negligible in mono-subs"

G., Wigley, W. C., Zeng, W., Noel, L. E., Marino, C. R., Thomas, P. J., and Muallem, S. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 3414–3421). In the present work we examine the significance of this regulation in cells naturally expressing CFTR. These include the human colonic T84 cell line and the mouse submandibular gland and pancreatic ducts, tissues that express high levels of CFTR in the luminal membrane. As in heterologous expression systems, stimulation of T84 cells with forskolin increased the Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity independently of CFTR Cl− channel activity. Freshly isolated submandibular gland ducts from wild type mice showed variable Cl−/HCO3−exchange activity. Measurement of [Cl−]i revealed that this was largely the result of variable steady-state [Cl−]i. Membrane depolarization with 5 mm Ba2+ or 100 mmK+ increased and stabilized [Cl−]i. Under depolarized conditions wild type and ΔF/ΔF mice had comparable basal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. Notably, stimulation with forskolin increased Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in submandibular gland ducts from wild type but not ΔF/ΔF mice. Microperfusion of the main pancreatic duct showed Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in both the basolateral and luminal membranes. Stimulation of ducts from wild type animals with forskolin had no effect on basolateral but markedly stimulated luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. By contrast, forskolin had no effect on either basolateral or luminal Cl−/HCO3−exchange activity of ducts from ΔF/ΔF animals. We conclude that CFTR regulates luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in CFTR-expressing cells, and we discuss the possible physiological significance of these findings regarding cystic fibrosis.

Med. 1996; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most of the HCO3− is secreted by duct or duct-like cells to the lumen and thus requires transductal HCO3− transport. Little is known about the pathways mediating HCO3− entry in the basolateral membrane (BLM). The best studies available to date are in the pancreatic duct, in which Case and co-workers (4Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Lindsay A.R. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Wilson R.W. Case R.M. J. Physiol.

(Lond.). 1998; 511: 407-422Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) provided strong evidence that HCO3− influx is mediated largely by a BLM Na+-HCO3− cotransport. HCO3− efflux across the luminal membrane (LM) and its regulation are equally poorly understood. Most models assume that the electroneutral portion of HCO3− secretion is mediated by a luminal Cl−/HCO3−exchanger (AE, anion exchanger) (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar, 2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R.

(Lond.). 1998; 511: 407-422Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This function is also believed to mediate part of Cl− absorption by the duct. Cl− is supplied to the duct lumen in the plasma-like primary fluid secreted by acinar cells (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar, 2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed.

The pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis indicates that CFTR plays a critical, but poorly defined, role in HCO3− secretion and Cl− absorption. In tissues such as the salivary glands, in which acinar cells secrete the bulk of the fluid, CFTR is assumed to mediate the electrogenic part of Cl− absorption (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar). The same role is attributed to CFTR in sweat glands (7Quinton P.M. Yankaskas J.R. Knowles J.R. Cystic Fibrosis in Adults. Lippincott, Philadelphia1998: 419-438Google Scholar) and intestinal epithelia (8Schultz S.G. Frizzell R.A.

Recent work suggests that airway epithelia absorb Na+ and Cl− to produce a hypotonic airway surface fluid (Ref. 10Zabner J. Smith J.J. Karp P.H. Widdicombe J.H. Welsh M.J. Mol.

Because Na+ and Cl−concentrations in airway surface liquid produced by cystic fibrosis airway epithelium are isotonic (10Zabner J. Smith J.J. Karp P.H. Widdicombe J.H. Welsh M.J. Mol.

Rev. 1987; 67: 1143-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In glands like the pancreas, fluid secretion by acinar cells is limited, and the duct secretes the bulk of the fluid in pancreatic juice (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar). In this type of gland the limited supply of Cl− secreted by acinar cells led to the proposal that CFTR mediates Cl− secretion to the lumen of duct cells to fuel the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar). However, a recent work showed that agonist- and cAMP-stimulated HCO3− secretion in guinea pig pancreatic duct is independent of luminal Cl− (6Ishiguro H. Naruse S. Steward M.C. Kitagawa M. Ko S.B.H. Hayakawa T. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 407-422Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hence, the role of CFTR in ion transport by these tissues remains obscure. To date direct evidence in support of the two models is meager indeed. Localization of CFTR in the luminal membrane of all CFTR-expressing epithelia is well documented (14Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15Marino C.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In SMG ducts the AE isoform 2 (AE2) was localized in the BLM (19He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The isoform(s) expressed in the LM is not known. A relationship between HCO3− secretion and CFTR was documented in two cell lines and intestinal epithelia. In a human airway epithelial cell line CFTR-dependent HCO3− conductance (20Illek B. Yankaskas J.R. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L752-L761PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee M.C. Penland C.M. Widdicombe J.H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L450-L453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed to be mediated by CFTR itself. By contrast, similar studies in a human pancreatic duct cell line concluded that electrogenic Cl−and HCO3− secretions are mediated by independent proteins (22Cheng H.S. Leung P.Y. Chew S.B.C. Leung P.S. Lam S.Y. Wong W.S. Wang Z.D. Chan H.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In duodenal epithelium basal and acid-stimulated HCO3− secretions were reduced or absent in CFTR −/− mice (23Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky De Muckadell O.B. Ainsworth M.A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 533-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in a recent study Seidler et al. (24Seidler U. Blumenstein I. Kretz A. Viellard-Baron D. Rossmann H. Colledge W.H. Evans M. Ratcliff R. Gregor M. J. Physiol (Lond.). 1997; 505: 411-423Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) showed that all forms of HCO3− secretion stimulated by agonists or agents that elevate cAMP, cGMP, and, in particular, [Ca2+]i were impaired in the intestinal epithelia of CFTR −/− mice. These studies suggest the likely involvement of CFTR in the electrogenic component of HCO3− secretion, which is particularly prominent in the intestine (25Allen A. Flemstrom G. Garner A. Kivilaakso E. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 823-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Grubb B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G505-G513PubMed Google Scholar). However, a large fraction of HCO3− secretion in tissues such as salivary glands (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar) and the rat and mouse pancreas (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed.

The intimate relationship between CFTR expression and HCO3− secretion seen in intestinal (23Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky De Muckadell O.B.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) raises the question of whether and how CFTR modulates HCO3− secretion in other CFTR-expressing tissues. In addition to its possible function as a regulator of a HCO3− conductive channel, CFTR may also regulate luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. In a recent study (28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W.

To evaluate the physiological relevance of these findings, in the present work we report the regulation of the luminal AE activity by CFTR in the mouse SMG and pancreatic ducts. The SMG and pancreatic ducts were selected as model systems for several reasons. The fraction of electroneutral HCO3− secretion in these tissues is relatively high (1Argent B.E. Case R.M.

Among all CFTR-expressing tissues, the mechanism of fluid and electrolyte secretion is understood best in the SMG (2Cook D.I. van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R.

Although the mouse is not the ideal species to study HCO3− secretion (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed.

To supplement the studies in the native ducts we also used the human colonic cell line T84 because these cells have been used extensively to study the properties of naturally occurring CFTR (32Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C859-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Illek B. Fischer H. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C265-C275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that stimulation of CFTR with cAMP increased Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in T84 cells. More importantly, stimulation of CFTR by cAMP resulted in selective activation of luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in SMG and pancreatic ducts of WT mice, which was absent in ducts prepared from ΔF/ΔF mice. We conclude that CFTR regulates luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity of SMG and pancreatic ducts and probably other CFTR-expressing cells. The standard perfusate was termed solution A and contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. The HCO3−-buffered NaCl solution B contained (in mm) 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. The HCO3−-buffered Cl−-free solution C contained (in mm) 120 Na+-gluconate, 25 NaHCO3, 5 K+-gluconate, 1 MgSO4, 9.3 hemicalcium cyclamate, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. To prepare HCO3−-buffered high KCl (100 mm K+) solution D, 95 mm NaCl in solution B was replaced with 95 mm KCl. To prepare HCO3−-buffered, high K+(100 mm K+), Cl−-free solution E, 95 mm Na+-gluconate was replaced with 95 mm K+-gluconate in solution C. For calibration of intracellular Cl−, solution E was supplemented with 5 μm nigericin and 10 μm tributyltin cyanide. The KSCN solution contained (in mm) 127 KSCN, 25 choline- HCO3−, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with 2m Tris). The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mosm with the major salt prior to use. T84 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 248, Rockville, MD) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated on a sterile 22 × 40-mm coverslip at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 for intracellular pH measurements. A cystic fibrosis mouse model in which the ΔF508 mutation was introduced in the mouse CFTR by gene targeting in ES cells (31Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J. Smith J.J. Puga A.P. McCray Jr., P.B. Capecchi M.R. Welsh M.J. Thomas K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2051-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Kirk R. Thomas (Eccles Institute of Human Genetics, HHMI, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City). The mice were maintained on a standard diet, and genotyping was carried out on day 14 postpartum as described previously (16Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R.R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Duct fragments from the mouse SMG were prepared by a slight modification of our published procedure (16Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R.R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed by exposure to a methoxyflurane-saturated atmosphere and subsequent cervical dislocation, and the SMGs were removed to a cold pancreatic solution A (PSA). The composition of PSA was (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 glucose, 10 pyruvate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Each gland was cleaned by injection of 5 ml of PSA and minced. The minced tissue was transferred to 8 ml of PSA containing 2.5 mg of collagenase (CLS4, 254 units/mg; Worthington Biochemicals) and digested for 8–10 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were then washed twice with PSA, resuspended in 2 ml of PSA, and kept on ice until use. Microperfusion experiments were performed with microdissected pancreatic ducts from WT and ΔF/ΔF mice. The procedure for preparation and perfusion of the main pancreatic duct was identical to that used for perfusion of the rat pancreatic duct (17Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ducts were dissected in PSA, cannulated, and perfused through the lumen and the bath with solution A. After completion of BCECF loading the ducts were perfused with HCO3−-buffered solution B for at least 10 min prior to manipulation of Cl−gradients. The procedure of pHi measurement in T84 cells was identical to that described in detail in our recent work (28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the case of SMG cells, the dissociated cells were loaded with BCECF by a 10-min incubation at room temperature in PSA containing 1 μm BCECF-AM. The cells were then washed with PSA and plated on a polylysine-coated coverslip that was assembled into a perfusion chamber. The chamber was placed on an inverted microscope, and intralobular ducts were identified by morphology. The BCECF fluorescence of 10–16 cells of a duct fragment was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 490 nm. Fluorescence ratios of 490/440 were calibrated using the procedures described previously (28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the case of the perfused pancreatic duct BCECF loading was accomplished by including 2.5 μm BCECF-AM in the luminal perfusate for 10 min. Changes in Cl−/HCO3−exchange activity were estimated from the initial rate of pHi changes (T84 cells and pancreatic ducts) or from the extent of pHi changes (SMG ducts). Initial rates of pHi changes were obtained from the first derivative of the traces using a single exponential fit. The extent of pHi changes was estimated by averaging the pHi changes measured as a result of Cl− removal and addition. All results are given as mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. [Cl−]i was measured with the aid of the Cl−-sensitive dye MQAE using the procedure described before for 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ; 18) with minor modifications. SMG cells were suspended in PSA containing 10 mm MQAE and incubated for 20 min at room temperature and 40 min at 0 °C before plating on coverslips. About 2 min after plating, unattached cells and external MQAE were washed by starting the perfusion with solution A. MQAE fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm with the dichroic mirror and emission cut-off filter set normally used to monitor Fura-2 fluorescence. At the end of each experiment a two-point calibration procedure was performed. To obtain the maximal fluorescence the cells were perfused with high K+, Cl−-free solution containing 5 μm nigericin and 10 μm tributyltin cyanide. Incubation in a Cl−-free solution without ionophores did not result in complete depletion of intracellular Cl−. To obtain the minimal fluorescence the cells were then exposed to a solution containing 127 mm KSCN. Significant dye leak, in particular after exposure to tributyltin cyanide, precluded a more extensive in vivo calibration. A Stern-Volmer constant of 12.4 m−1 reported before for rabbit SMG ducts (34Lau K.R. Evans R.L. Case R.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 427: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used to calculate [Cl−]i. The results of multiple experiments with each cell type and under the different conditions were analyzed using paired or nonpaired Student'st test, as appropriate. We have described previously the regulation of AE activity by CFTR in cells stably or transiently transfected with CFTR (28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to determine whether such regulation exists in a cell line and in native cells naturally expressing CFTR. The first set of experiments was performed with the human colonic cell line T84, which can serve as a suitable model system in future studies. This cell line has been used in the past in several studies as a model system to characterize natively expressed CFTR (32Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C859-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Illek B. Fischer H. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C265-C275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows representative experiments, and Fig. 2 summarizes the results under each experimental condition. DIDS-sensitive, Cl−- and HCO3−-dependent changes in pHi indicate the expression of relatively modest AE activity in T84 cells. Stimulation of the cells with 5 μm forskolin caused a reproducible reduction in pHi. This reduction in pHi was less pronounced than that observed in NIH 3T3 and HEK 293 cells expressing high levels of CFTR. Removal and addition of Cl− to the incubation medium showed that forskolin increased the rate of AE activity by about 2.2-fold or 0.051 ΔpH unit/min. As was found in NIH 3T3 and HEK 293 cells expressing CFTR (28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the AE activity stimulated by forskolin was not affected by inhibition of CFTR-mediated Cl− current with 0.1 mm N-phenylanthranilic acid (DPC in Fig. 1a) or 0.1 mm glibenclamide (Glib in Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the AE activity was nearly abolished by 0.5 mm DIDS (Fig. 1b), as was found in 293 cells expressing modest levels of CFTR (see Fig. 7b of Ref. 28Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W.

To test this possibility we measured the effect of membrane depolarization on HCO3− fluxes. In Figs. 1cand 2, T84 cells were depolarized by raising the external K+ concentration from 5 to 100 mm. This had a minor effect on pHi. Membrane depolarization nearly doubled the initial rate of HCO3− influx observed upon Cl− removal (Figs. 1c and Fig. 2,first and third bars fromleft).

https://openalex.org/W2316716290,"Cells lacking an intact ATM gene are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and show multiple defects in the cell cycle-coupled checkpoints. DNA damage usually triggers cell cycle arrest through, among other things, the activation of p53. Another DNA-damage responsive factor is NF-κB. It is activated by various stress situations, including oxidative stress, and by DNA-damaging compounds such as topoisomerase poisons. We found that cells from Ataxia Telangiectasia patients exhibit a defect in NF-κB activation in response to treatment with camptothecin, a topoisomerase I poison. In AT cells, this activation is shortened or suppressed, compared to that observed in normal cells. Ectopic expression of the ATM protein in AT cells increases the activation of NF-κB in response to camptothecin. MO59J glioblastoma cells that do not express the DNA-PK catalytic subunit respond normally to camptothecin. These results support the hypothesis that NF-κB is a DNA damage-responsive transcription factor and that its activation pathway by DNA damage shares some components with the one leading to p53 activation."

The structure suggests Tyr152/Tyr215 as the residues involved in substrate binding, stabilization of the transition state, and possibly protonation of the epoxide oxygen. Epoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3) are a group of functionally related enzymes that catalyze the cofactor-independent hydrolysis of epoxides to their corresponding diols by the addition of a water molecule. Epoxides are very reactive electrophilic compounds frequently found as intermediates in the catabolic pathway of various xenobiotics. For instance they are the carcinogens formed by bioactivation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450. Therefore, conversion of epoxides to less toxic, water-soluble compounds is an essential detoxification step in living cells. Consequently, epoxide hydrolases have been found in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals, invertebrates, plants, and bacteria (1Archelas A. Furstoss R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 108-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Until now most research has been focused on mammalian epoxide hydrolases (2Lacourciere G.M. Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Arand M. Grant D.F. Beetham J.K. Friedberg T. Oesch F. Hammock B.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which, together with glutathioneS-transferases, are the most important enzymes to convert toxic epoxides to more polar and easily excretable compounds (4Herandez O. Bend J.R. Metabolic Basis of Detoxication. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 207-228Crossref Google Scholar). However, much progress has recently also been made in the characterization of bacterial epoxide hydrolases (5Jacobs M.H.J. van den Wijngaard A.J. Pentenga M. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enzymes show a significant sequence homology with those of mammalian origin. They can be easily obtained in large amounts, and they exhibit enantioselectivity with various industrially important epoxides, which makes them promising biocatalysts for the large scale preparation of enantiopure epoxides and/or their corresponding vicinal diols (8Lutje Spelberg J.H. Rink R. Kellogg R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, extensive studies have been performed on the epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, a Gram-negative bacterium that is able to use the environmental pollutant epichlorohydrin as its sole carbon and energy source (5Jacobs M.H.J. van den Wijngaard A.J. Pentenga M. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol.

Tetrahedron: Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This epoxide hydrolase is a soluble monomeric globular protein of 35 kDa with a broad substrate range. Epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin are its best substrates, and the optimum pH range for catalysis is 8.4–9.0. Sequence and secondary structure analysis suggested that this enzyme belongs to the α/β hydrolase-fold family of enzymes (9Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations indicated Asp107, His275, and Asp246 as the catalytic triad residues. The proposed catalytic mechanism involves two steps analogous to haloalkane dehalogenase (10Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In the first reaction step, an ester bond is formed between enzyme and substrate by attack of the nucleophilic Asp107 on the primary carbon atom of the substrate; in the second step, this ester bond is hydrolyzed by a water molecule activated by the His275/Asp246 pair. The reaction proceeds via two different transition states, one during the binding and opening of the epoxide ring and the second during the hydrolysis of the ester intermediate. However, several important questions remained unanswered. Until now it has not been possible to identify the residue responsible for the binding and protonation of the epoxide oxygen, nor was the location known of the oxyanion hole that stabilizes the Asp107 oxyanion during the hydrolysis of the ester intermediate. Structural information may also resolve why an Asp246 → Ala mutant still retains some residual activity (6Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here we report the 2.1-Å resolution x-ray structure of the epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1 (Ephy). 1The abbreviations used are: Ephy, epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1; DhlA, haloalkane dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus GJ10; Pgl, triacylglycerol lipase from P. glumae ; Hpl, human pancreatic lipase; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; r.m.s., root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: Ephy, epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1; DhlA, haloalkane dehalogenase from X. autotrophicus GJ10; Pgl, triacylglycerol lipase from P. glumae ; Hpl, human pancreatic lipase; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; r.m.s., root mean square. It is the first epoxide hydrolase for which the structure has been solved. The result of this work can provide a general better understanding about the structural basis of the reaction mechanism for this class of important ubiquitous enzymes. The epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1 was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described previously (6Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The stock protein solution, containing 5 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10% glycerol (pH 6.8) was concentrated and extensively washed using 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) in a Centricon-10 ultracentrifugation concentrator with a 10-kDa cut-off (Amicon) to a final protein concentration of 5.5 mg/ml. The extensive washing procedure is essential to remove the glycerol before crystallization. The glycerol induces high polydispersity in the protein sample, as was determined by dynamic light scattering analysis on a DynaPro 801 instrument (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Removing the glycerol resulted in a solution containing particles with a 2.7-nm diameter (apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa) and a polydispersity of 15%. Crystallization experiments with the protein in the presence of glycerol gave only very thin needles as a best result. An initial promising crystallization condition was obtained from a Sparse Matrix screening (11Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Refinement of this Sparse Matrix condition resulted in the following crystallization protocol: hanging drops (4 μl of protein solution and 4 μl of precipitant) were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir containing 1.6 to 1.8 mKH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.0) at room temperature. After 2 weeks, the experiments were allowed to slowly evaporate to a phosphate concentration of about 2.0m. The slow increase of the phosphate concentration in the drop results in the appearance of crystals with typical sizes of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3. They are highly x-ray-sensitive, and therefore, all data collections were performed at cryotemperature (100 K), using 30% glycerol added to the stabilizing mother liquor (1.8 mKH2PO4/K2HPO4) as a cryoprotectant. The crystals diffract up to 2.1-Å resolution using synchrotron radiation, and they belong to space group C2 with unit cell parameters of a = 146.62 Å, b = 100.20 Å, c = 96.88 Å, β = 100.68°. This unit cell gives a V M value of 2.57 Å3/Da−1assuming 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The deduced solvent content of the crystals is 52%. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in solutions obtained by dissolving the heavy atom compounds in the standard mother liquor (1.8 mKH2PO4/K2HPO4). The search resulted in only one good isomorphous derivative obtained by soaking a crystal of epoxide hydrolase for 2 days in a solution of 2.0 mm ethyl mercury phosphate, (C2H5HgO)3PO. A 2.1-Å resolution native data set and one of the two ethyl mercury phosphate derivative data sets were collected at the x-ray diffraction beamline of the ELETTRA synchrotron in Trieste (Italy), equipped with a 30-cm MAR image plate area detector (MAR Research, Hamburg, Germany) with the wavelength tuned to λ = 1.0 Å. An in-house derivative data set was collected on a Mac Science DIP-2030H area detector equipped with a dual 30-cm image plate, with graphite monochromatized CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from a FR591 rotating anode generator with a double mirror x-ray focusing system (model MAC-XOS) as x-ray source (Enraf Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands). All data sets were collected at 100 K, integrated, and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and software from the BIOMOL crystallographic package (Protein Crystallography Group, University of Groningen). Derivative data were scaled to the native data set using the program PHASES (13Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1 was solved by the method of single isomorphous replacement supplemented by anomalous scattering, using both the in-house and synchrotron derivative data sets. A major heavy atom site (8.5 ς) for the ethyl mercury phosphate derivative was located in a difference Patterson map (12.0–4.5-Å data). The remaining 21 heavy atom positions were determined using difference Fourier techniques. Heavy atom position search, parameter refinement including anomalous data, and phase calculations were performed with PHASES (13Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (Table I). The initial phases calculated at 3.7 Å yielded a figure of merit of 0.47 and were improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching techniques using the program DM (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators (three orthogonal 2-fold axes) relating the 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit were determined with the help of FINDNCS, 2G. Lu,http://gamma.mbb.ki.se/∼guoguang/findncs.html. using the 8 heavy atom sites with the highest occupancies. They were checked by comparing them with the rotation matrices calculated from a self-rotation function (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). An initial mask was built around one molecule in the asymmetric unit with the program MAMA (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar); this mask was then used to refine the NCS operators by maximizing the correlation between the electron density maps of the 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit using the program IMP (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of density averaging, improvement of the mask, and refinement of the NCS operators, along with solvent flattening and phase extension to 2.6 Å resolution, resulted in a map of interpretable quality. The model was traced using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Nearly the complete polypeptide chain of one monomer could be interpreted in agreement with the amino acid sequence. By applying the refined NCS operators to the coordinates of the first molecule, coordinates for the other three molecules in the asymmetric unit were generated. The four molecules were then refined using the program X-PLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar). During the first runs of the refinement (simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement), tight NCS restraints were applied (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), but in the final stage of the refinement (conventional positional refinement and individual B-factor refinement), they were gradually released or not even used at all for those residues that clearly showed different conformations in the 4 monomers in the asymmetric unit. The best refinement results were obtained using a flat bulk solvent correction. Special care was taken in the selection of the test set for theR free calculation; the test set was selected by dividing the reflections in 102 thin-resolution shells to minimize the correlation between test set and working set reflections that could be caused by the presence of NCS (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 15: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Water molecules were placed according to strict density and distance criteria, starting with the buried and NCS-related ones. The final model consists of 4 × 282 residues, 610 water molecules (33 of them refined with double positions), and 4 potassium ions. The crystallographic R factor andR free are 19.0% and 22.7%, respectively. PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (22Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar) were used to assess the stereochemical quality. The structure was further analyzed using the program VOIDOO (23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), the programs from the CCP4 suite (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab As a starting model, the atomic coordinates of the refined structure of the wild type epoxide hydrolase were used in which only the internal solvent molecules were retained. The crystal structure was energy-minimized prior to the modeling using a conjugate gradient routine implemented in X-PLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar). To completely remove the possible bias because of the conformation of the protein in the crystal, a slow-cooling molecular dynamics simulation (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar) of 25 ps with temperature coupling (25Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22550) Google Scholar) was performed in which the temperature was slowly reduced from 1000 K to 300 K. The missing loop 138–148 and the loop containing Asp246 were built using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). To model a likely conformation of the active Ephy enzyme, we assumed that the acid member of the catalytic triad, Asp246, should lie at interaction distance to the catalytic His275 side chain, as found in many other members of the α/β hydrolase-fold family (9Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Haloalkane dehalogenase (PDB accession code 2HAD) (26Verschueren K.H.G. Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and bromoperoxidase A2 (PDB accession code1BRO) (27Hecht H.J. Sobek H. Haag T. Pfeifer O. van Pée K.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were used as templates to model the new Ephy Asp246 position, analogous to Asp260 of dehalogenase and Asp228 of bromoperoxidase, respectively. Secondly, we assumed that the Gln134 side chain should be removed from the active site, as it blocks the putative substrate binding site. This was done by giving the Pro132-Ile133-Gln134 loop a similar conformation as the human pancreatic lipase (PDB accession code 1LPB) (28Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) Pro177-Ala178-Glu179 motif, which has an equivalent topological position. The loop of residues 138–148, which is not observed in the electron density, was built like in the bromoperoxidase structure, connecting the core and the cap domains. Several cycles of stereochemical regularization were performed using the REFI and LEGO option of O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The model was subsequently subjected to energy minimization to tidy up unacceptable close contacts and poor stereochemistry. To overcome the possibility that the energy-minimized structure was trapped in a local minimum, a second molecular dynamics-simulated annealing run was performed using the same setting as before. Extensive energy minimization was applied until convergence was reached, leading to a model with no residues outside the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (29Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 7: 95-99Google Scholar) and good stereochemical quality (r.m.s. deviation bond lengths = 0.005 Å, r.m.s. deviation bond angles = 1.61°). Asp107 and Asp131 have slightly deviating backbone torsion angles, like in the x-ray structure. Although the position of the modeled loop 132–148 is only one of the possible conformations it can assume, we are confident that the rebuilding of the loop containing Asp246, in a fashion common to many α/β hydrolase-fold enzymes, gives a plausible picture of the catalytic site of the fully active epoxide hydrolase. Epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD1 (Ephy) crystallizes in the monoclinic space groupC2, with 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit. A superimposition of the Cα atoms of the four molecules gave an average r.m.s. difference of 0.24 Å for molecules B, C, and D and a higher r.m.s. difference of 0.40 Å if molecule A is included. All results discussed below apply to all 4 molecules (A, B, C, and D) unless stated otherwise. The final model consists of 4 × 282 residues, 610 water molecules (33 of them refined with double positions), and 4 potassium ions, originating from the crystallization buffer, one for each molecule in the asymmetric unit. In each monomer (294 residues), the first N-terminal residue (Met) is not visible nor is there interpretable electron density for the loop 138–148. The final crystallographic R factor and R freevalues are 19.0% and 22.7%, respectively. The r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry are 0.008 Å for bond lengths and 1.338° for bond angles. No residues are in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (29Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 7: 95-99Google Scholar). Pro39 was found in a cisconformation. The Ephy monomer has a nearly globular shape with approximate dimensions of 48 × 47 × 47 Å3. It consists of two domains: domain I (or “core” domain), which shows the typical features of the α/β hydrolase-fold topology (9Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), and the mainly α-helical domain II (or “cap” domain), which lies on top of domain I (Figs.1 and 2). The core domain comprises amino acids 1–137 and 219–294, and it consists of a central eight-stranded β-sheet with seven parallel strands (only the second strand is antiparallel). The β-sheet is flanked on both sides by α-helices, two on one side and four on the other. Helix α9 is a one-turn 310 helix. Domain II, containing α-helices α4 to α8, forms a large excursion between β-strands β6 and β7 of the core domain. It has a double-layered structure with helices α7 and α8 located between the core domain and the plane formed by α4, α5, and α6.Figure 2Secondary structure topology diagram and location of the catalytic triad residues, Asp107, Asp246, and His275. The dashed line represents the missing loop 138–148. Short 310helices are located at the N terminus (α′), between β3 and α1 (α′1), between β4 and α2 (α′2), and between α3 and β6 (α′3). The last α-helix shows a conspicuous bend at residue 281 (α′11-α11) because of the presence of Pro282 in the center of the helix.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proposed active-site residues (6Rink R. Fennema M. Smids M. Dehmel U. Janssen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14650-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) Asp107 and His275 are located in a predominantly hydrophobic internal cavity between domains I and II. The core domain contributes to the lining of the cavity with residues Gly37, Trp38, Pro39, Glu44, His106, Asp107, Phe108, Ile133, Phe137, Ile219, His275, Phe276, Val279. The cap domain supplies Tyr152, Trp183, and Tyr215 (Fig. 3). Asp107 is situated at the very sharp “nucleophile elbow” between the central strand β5 and helix α3. At this topological position, all α/β hydrolase-fold enzymes present the nucleophile, which can either be Ser, Cys, or Asp (9Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The (φ, ψ) angles of Asp107 are slightly unfavorable (φ = 57°, ψ = −124°), but its conformation is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds involving residues of the sharp turn, as has been found in other α/β hydrolase enzymes (9Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). In addition, the main chain nitrogen atom of Asp107 interacts via a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen atom of Asp131, the other residue with slightly deviating backbone torsion angles (φ = 31°, ψ = 69°). Furthermore, the side chain of Asp107 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond of its Oδ2 atom with the backbone amide groups of Trp38 and Phe108 and by a salt bridge between the Oδ1 atom of Asp107 and the Nε2 atom of the His275 side chain. An ∼20-Å long tunnel, filled with water molecules, is located between α-helices α1, α10, the loop connecting α-helix α1 and β-strand β3 of the core domain, and α7 of the cap domain (Fig. 4). This tunnel leads to the back of the active-site cavity, and it is perfectly suited to replenish the hydrolytic water molecule at hydrogen bond distance to the Nε2 atom of the His275 side chain (Fig. 3) after the reaction. In our structure, the active site cavity is exposed to the solvent from the front part too, where the missing l"

There appeared to be no single answer; in the physiological range, control shifted between the glucose transporter on the one hand and aldolase (ALD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) on the other hand. The other kinases, which are often thought to control glycolysis, exerted little control; so did the utilization of ATP.We identified potential targets for anti-trypanosomal drugs by calculating which steps need the least inhibition to achieve a certain inhibition of the glycolytic flux in these parasites. The glucose transporter appeared to be the most promising target, followed by ALD, GDH, GAPDH, and PGK. By contrast, in erythrocytes more than 95% deficiencies of PGK, GAPDH, or ALD did not cause any clinical symptoms (Schuster, R. and Holzhütter, H.-G. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 229, 403–418). Therefore, the selectivity of drugs inhibiting these enzymes may be much higher than expected from their molecular effects alone. Quite unexpectedly, trypanosomes seem to possess a substantial overcapacity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, making these “irreversible” enzymes mediocre drug targets.

Quite unexpectedly, trypanosomes seem to possess a substantial overcapacity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, making these “irreversible” enzymes mediocre drug targets. Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular, eukaryotic parasite. It causes the African sleeping sickness in humans and a related disease, nagana, in livestock. When this organism lives in the mammalian bloodstream, it depends completely on glycolysis for its supply of ATP. It possesses neither a functional Krebs cycle nor oxidative phosphorylation, nor does it store any carbohydrate. Glycolysis in trypanosomes and in other members of the Kinetoplastida family differs substantially from the corresponding pathway in other organisms (for reviews see Refs. 1Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Michels P.A.M. Hannaert V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Hannaert V.

Since 90% of the protein content of these organelles consists of glycolytic enzymes, they have been called glycosomes (5Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The glycosomal membrane is hardly permeable to metabolites (6Visser N. Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, under aerobic conditions, the NADH produced in glycolysis is reoxidized by molecular oxygen via a mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate:DHAP (Gly-3-P:DHAP) shuttle (Fig. 1). Since there is neither a cytosolic glycerol kinase (GK) nor any significant activity of glycerol 3-phosphatase (5Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 7Hammond D.J. Aman R.A. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all Gly-3-P is shuttled back via DHAP to the mitochondria and converted to pyruvate, leading to the production of two molecules of pyruvate per molecule of glucose consumed. Under anaerobic conditions, equimolar amounts of pyruvate and glycerol are produced due to requirements of glycosomal redox and ATP balance (1, 5, 7–10). This decreases the ATP production to one molecule of ATP per glucose. Third, the glycosomal enzymes are hardly regulated by any of the compounds that strongly affect the corresponding enzymes in other organisms. Most notably, in trypanosomes, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates the cytosolic enzyme PYK (11Van Schaftingen E. Opperdoes F.R. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Callens M. Kuntz D.A. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1992; 50: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) rather than the glycosomal PFK (14Cronin C.N. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Cronin C.N. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The physiological function of this activation is elusive, since the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration in the bloodstream form substantially exceeds its activation constant for PYK (12Callens M. Kuntz D.A. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,16Van Schaftingen E. Opperdoes F.R. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the transport of glucose into the cells is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis in bloodstream form trypanosomes (17Gruenberg J. Sharma P.R. Deshusses J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yet, our present day knowledge of control of metabolism led us to re-evaluate the evidence for this statement (4Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Michels P.A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the development of metabolic control analysis (18Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar, 19Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J.

Portland Press, London1997Google Scholar), it has been known that in general there is no single rate-limiting step in a metabolic pathway, but control can be shared among several steps. The quantitative measure of the strength of the control of the steady-state flux J through a pathway by an enzymei in this pathway is given by its flux control coefficient, CiJ. This coefficient is defined as the percentage increase of the flux caused by a 1% activation of enzyme i (for a more precise definition see Refs. 22Kholodenko B.N. Molenaar D. Schuster S. Heinrich R. Westerhoff H.V. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and23Burns J.A. Cornish-Bowden A. Groen A.K. Heinrich R. Kacser H. Porteous J.W. Rapoport S.M. Rapoport T.A.

Flux control coefficients can have any value between 0 (not limiting) and 1 (completely rate-limiting) (e.g. Refs.24Groen A.K. Wanders R.J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Van der Meer R. Tager J.M. J. Biol.

Bioeng. 1996; 51: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the sum of the flux control coefficients of all enzymes in the pathway should be 1 (18Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar). To measure a flux control coefficient, it is necessary to modulate the activity of the enzyme of interest with small steps around the normal wild type level. For the trypanosome glucose transporter, this has not been done. Consequently, the evidence presented for the glucose transporter being rate-limiting is only indirect and qualitative. In the first place, glucose, fructose, and mannose were metabolized at different rates (17Gruenberg J. Sharma P.R. Deshusses J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the comparison of different substrates alone did not correspond to the small modulation required for metabolic control analysis. In addition, the modulation of the transport activity was not quantified, nor did this experiment exclude control by phosphorylation. Also the low intracellular glucose concentration (0.4 mm) has been taken as evidence that glucose transport was rate-limiting (29Ter Kuile B.H. Opperdoes F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 857-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a theoretical analysis, based on the kinetics of the glucose transporter and of HK, showed that an intracellular glucose concentration of 0.4 mm may be consistent with any flux control coefficient between 0 and 50%, but not 100% (4Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Michels P.A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggests that, if at all important, glucose transport is not the only step controlling trypanosome glycolysis. Because bloodstream form trypanosomes depend completely on glycolysis for their supply of ATP and because the organization of glycolysis in the parasite is very different from that in the host cells, this pathway has been selected as a target for drugs against the African sleeping sickness (30Michels P.A.M. Biol. Cell. 1988; 64: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The selectivity of drugs might be enhanced by choosing a target enzyme that has a high control in the parasite and a low control in the host. Despite the great interest, it is not yet known completely for any organism how the control of the glycolytic flux is distributed. In yeast, for example, many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (HK, phosphoglucose isomerase, PGK, PYK, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase) have been overexpressed manifold, but in none of the mutants did the glycolytic flux differ substantially from the wild type flux (31Schaaff I. Heinisch J. Zimmermann F. Yeast. 1989; 5: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Davies S.E.C. Brindle K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This may be due to several reasons. First, glycolysis in yeast (and many other organisms) is part of a much wider metabolic network. Consequently, the glycolytic flux may be controlled by steps outside glycolysis, such as the utilization of ATP, the respiratory branch, the synthesis of storage carbohydrates, and/or the glucose transporter proteins (33Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Second, the effects of overexpression are necessarily investigated at time scales at which the cells may adjust the expression of other genes. For example, the PFK-overproducing cells contained decreased levels of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. Thus, they compensated for the increased amount of PFK by decreasing the concentration of its activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (32Davies S.E.C. Brindle K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, when the activity of an enzyme is increased, it often (but not always) loses control (34Kholodenko B.N. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By using overexpression mutants, one therefore runs the risk of underestimating the control coefficients. Several studies dealt with the control of glucose utilization in mammalian cells. Measurements indicated that the rate of glycogen synthesis was controlled by glucose transport and hexokinase (35Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The control of mammalian glycolysis has been measured by the so-called matrix inversion method (36Kashiwaya Y. Sato K. Tsuchiya N. Thomas S. Fell D.A. Veech R.L. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25502-25514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, most control was shared by glucose transport and hexokinase. This method, however, requires that all relevant enzymes be included, but important steps such as PFK and GAPDH were missing. The above mentioned problems with the determination of control coefficients should not apply, or should apply to a lesser extent, to bloodstream form T. brucei. First, except for the utilization of ATP, there are no branches with a substantial flux under aerobic conditions. Second, the kinetics of glycolytic enzymes fromT. brucei have been investigated thoroughly in a limited number of laboratories under standard conditions. This has enabled us to develop a detailed kinetic model of trypanosome glycolysis containing most glycolytic enzymes. The model calculations of the flux and the metabolite concentrations corresponded unexpectedly well with experimental information (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We here use the kinetic data to calculate what controls trypanosome glycolysis under physiological conditions. It will be shown that there is a distribution of control of trypanosome glycolysis, which depends strongly on glucose supply. All experiments were performed with the bloodstream form ofT. brucei stock 427. Male, 300-g Wistar rats were infected with T. brucei, and the parasites were isolated from the blood by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (DE52, Whatman) (38Lanham S.M. Nature. 1968; 218: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The cells were washed by centrifugation; resuspended in a 90 mmTris/HCl buffer containing 2.5 mm KCl, 77.5 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa2HPO4, and 50 mm glucose at pH 7.5 (modified from Ref. 39Kiaira J.K. Njogu M.R. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1994; 20: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); and stored on ice. In this buffer, the cells maintained a constant motility and oxygen consumption capacity for at least 7 h after isolation. An aliquot of cells was washed three times by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in the assay buffer at 37 °C. The measurements were performed in a 90 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 3.1 mm KCl, 96.9 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa2HPO4, and the indicated concentration of glucose. The protein concentration was measured in each aliquot of cells, according to Lowry (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Since the buffer weakly disturbed the assay, the same amount of buffer as present in the samples was added to the bovine serum albumin standards. The rate of oxygen consumption was monitored in a closed and thermostated vessel with a Clark electrode. For determination of the concentrations of other metabolites, the cells were kept in an open, thermostated vessel and aerated with water-saturated pressurized air. To check that the cell suspensions remained aerobic, the oxygen concentration was monitored with a Clark electrode throughout the experiment. Samples were taken by injecting 75 μl of the cell suspension into 37.5 μl of 15% perchloric acid. Samples were vortexed, centrifuged (5 min, Eppendorf table centrifuge, full speed), neutralized by mixing 80 μl of supernatant with 45 μl of 1m K2CO3, and centrifuged again. The pH of the supernatants was checked with pH paper (pH was between 7 and 8). Supernatants were stored at −20 °C and analyzed further within 1 week. Glucose, pyruvate, and glycerol were measured by NADH-linked analysis (41Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1974Google Scholar) in an automatic analyzer (COBAS FARA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Phloretin was from Sigma. A phloretin stock was made up in 70% ethanol. The ethanol concentration in cell suspensions was always kept below 1%. The kinetic model of trypanosome glycolysis that was used in this study has been described and validated previously, its predictions being compared with experimental results (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It contained enzyme kinetics, measured with purified trypanosome enzymes, for most reactions depicted in Fig. 1. The reactions catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and adenylate kinase were taken to be at equilibrium. The rationale was that their measured ratios of substrate and product concentrations were close to equilibrium (phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase) (42Visser N. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), that they catalyze a dead-end branch (adenylate kinase), or that they were close to equilibrium in initial model calculations with explicit kinetics for these reactions (phosphoglucose isomerase and TIM). The glycosomal membrane was assumed to be impermeable to metabolites (6Visser N. Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except to those that need to be transported to allow glycolysis to proceed. Because of a lack of kinetic information, the latter transport steps were assumed to be at equilibrium. The transport of glucose across the cytoplasmic and subsequently the glycosomal membranes was lumped into one kinetic equation, because no distinction could be made so far (29Ter Kuile B.H. Opperdoes F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 857-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Eisenthal R. Game S. Holman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This is equivalent to assuming the glycosomal glucose transporter to be at equilibrium. The glycosomal concentration of inorganic phosphate was assumed to be saturating. This assumption has been validated partially. At the normal blood concentration of inorganic phosphate (0.4–0.5 mm (44Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Frederickson D.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 5th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1993Google Scholar)), the measured rate of oxygen consumption by intact trypanosomes,i.e. the glycolytic flux, was fully saturated with phosphate (result not shown). The concentrations of both the adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) and the nicotinamide adenine nucleotides (NAD, NADH) were treated as free (although interdependent) variables, rather than fixed parameters of the system. Due to the compartmentalization of the pathway, the model contained distinct pools of cytosolic and glycosomal adenine nucleotides. In principle, the model allowed both dynamic and steady-state calculations, but the present study is limited to steady states only. Below, only the changes that were made to the model described in Ref. 37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar are described. The kinetics of GDH have been determined more accurately 2S. Marché, F. R. Opperdoes, and P. A. M. Michels, unpublished results. :K m, DHAP = 0.1 mm;K m, Gly-3-P = 2 mm;K m, NADH = 0.01 mm;K m, NAD+ = 0.4 mm; and the ratio of the reverse and forward V max(V −/V +) = 0.28. The specific activity of the purified enzyme in the forward direction was 213 μmol min−1 (mg of enzyme)−1. The amount of GDH in the cell is 0.25% of the total cell protein (45Misset O. Bos O.J.M. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Expressed per total cell protein, V+ is then 533 nmol min−1 mg of protein−1. Bakker et al. (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) took the hexose kinases to be insensitive to their products. Originally only an indirect and weak effect of glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) on HK and of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP) on PFK was included in the model via the conservation relation of bound phosphates. Under some conditions, this might cause the set of equations defining the steady state to be underdetermined. This would be the case, for instance, if ALD were saturated with Fru-1,6-BP. Then none of the enzymes would sense the concentration of Fru-1,6-BP, and consequently the latter could assume any value, only restricted by the conserved sum. It has been reported that Fru-1,6-BP does inhibit PFK, by acting both on the V max and the K m for Fru-6-P (14Cronin C.N. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study the following rate equation was used, νPFK=V+·Ki1[Fru­1,6­BP]+Ki1·Equation 1 [Fru­6­P]Km,Fru­6­P1+[Fru­6­P]Km,Fru­6­P+[Fru­1,6­BP]Ki2·[ATP]Km,ATP1+[ATP]Km,ATPin which K i1 = 15.8 mm and K i2 = 10.7 mm (14Cronin C.N. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All other parameters held the same values as described previously (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). HK was reported to be insensitive to Glc-6-P (46Nwagwu M. Opperdoes F.R. Acta Trop. 1982; 39: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar). Due to salt effects and a high affinity of the enzyme for glucose (K m = 0.1 mm), a competitive inhibition by Glc-6-P with a K m above 10 mm would not be measurable. 3J. van Roy and F. R. Opperdoes, unpublished results. Under some conditions, such a weak inhibition was relevant to prevent unrestrained accumulation of Glc-6-P in the model, and therefore the rate equation was modified to the following equation. νHK=V+·[Glc]Km,Glc1+[Glc]Km,Glc+[Glc­6­P]Km,Glc­6­P·[ATP]Km,ATP1+[ATP]Km,ATP+[ADP]Km,ADPEquation 2 K m,Glc-6-P was taken to be 12 mm, which does not contradict the measurements. The other parameters were not changed (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The rate of PYK was assumed to be independent of the concentrations of its products, ADP and pyruvate, unless otherwise mentioned. If the rate depended on the ATP concentration, the following rate equation was used. νPYK=V+·(([P­enolpyruvate]Km,P­enolpyruvate)n1+([P­enolpyruvate]Km,P­enolpyruvate)n)·([ADP]cKm,ADP1+[ADP]cKm,ADP+[ATP]cKm,ATP)Equation 3 K m,ATP was taken to be 0.1 mm (equal to K m,ADP (47Barnard J.P. Pedersen P.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), and the other parameter values were not changed (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Non-competitive inhibition of glucose transport was simulated by multiplying the rate equation for glucose transport by a factorK i/(K i + [I]), in which [I] represents the inhibitor concentration and K i is the inhibition constant. Competitive inhibition of glucose transport was simulated by multiplying the K m values for both extracellular and intracellular glucose by a factor 1 + [I]/K i. Under anaerobic conditions, bloodstream form T. brucei maintains its glycosomal redox and ATP balance by producing equimolar amounts of pyruvate and glycerol (Fig. 1). The ΔG 0′ of GK does not favor the production of glycerol. An inhibition of glycolysis by glycerol has indeed been measured under anaerobic conditions (48Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Nature. 1977; 265: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the original kinetic model (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the concentration of glycerol required to inhibit the flux was much lower than had been found experimentally. The model assumed the transport of Gly-3-P and DHAP across the glycosomal membrane to be independent of each other and at equilibrium. Consequently, any increase of the glycosomal concentration of Gly-3-P was accompanied by an identical increase of the cytosolic concentration of Gly-3-P. Both the cytosolic and the glycosomal concentration of Gly-3-P participated in a conserved sum of organic phosphate groups that are not exchanged with inorganic phosphate as follows, [Gly­3­P]gVg+[Gly­3­P]cVc+[DHAP]gVg+[DHAP]cVc+Equation 4 [Glc­6­P]gVg+[Fru­6­P]gVg+2[Fru­1,6­BP]gVg+[GA­3­P]gVg+ [1,3­BPGA]gVg+2[ATP]gVg+[ADP]gVg=C4·Vgin which V g is the glycosomal volume andV c is the cytosolic volume. Since the cytosolic volume was more than 20 times the glycosomal volume, any increase of the cytosolic Gly-3-P concentration led to an enormous drain of the glycosomal metabolites. This effect enhanced the inhibition of the anaerobic glycolytic flux by glycerol. If the transport of Gly-3-P and DHAP would occur via an antiport mechanism, as proposed by Opperdoes and Borst (5Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), the conserved sum of bound phosphates would split in distinct glycosomal and cytosolic conserved sums.

Therefore, it was expected that the inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis by glycerol would be much weaker. This hypothesis was tested by implementing a Gly-3-P:DHAP antiporter in the model. It was assumed that the antiporter was in equilibrium. Also, TIM was taken to be in equilibrium, as previously. Therefore, the triosephosphates were considered to behave as a single metabolite pool. [triose­P]≡[DHAP]cVc+[DHAP]gVg+[GA­3­P]gVgVtotEquation 7 The time derivative of [triose-P] remained exactly the same as in the model with the two independent transporters (37Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The implementation of the antiporter entailed the solving of a set of five equations with five unknowns, i.e. Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7 and the equilibrium constraints for TIM and the exchanger itself.

Stone B.A. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 521-540Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar), it is likely that every plant cell produces AGPs. Despite this widespread occurrence, AGP functions, particularly at the molecular level, remain to be established. Various forms of evidence, however, have pointed to roles of AGPs in several aspects of growth and development (1Nothnagel E.A. Int. Rev.

Evidence of a more direct nature regarding AGP action has been obtained through perturbation experiments. Application of exogenous AGPs altered the course of somatic embryogenesis, thus suggesting an active role of AGPs in this process (9Kreuger M. van Holst G.-J. Planta. 1995; 197: 135-141Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Toonen M.A.J. Schmidt E.D.L. van Kammen A. de Vries S.C. Planta. 1997; 203: 188-195Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Another perturbation approach of growing popularity involves use of (β-d-Glc)3 Yariv phenylglycoside, a synthetic molecule that binds and precipitates AGPs. Experiments in which (β-d-Glc)3 has been applied to living plants or cells have yielded evidence of AGP action in cell proliferation (11Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Planta. 1994; 193: 542-550Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), cell expansion (12Willats W.G.T. Knox J.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Ding L. Zhu J.-K. Planta. 1997; 203: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), somatic embryogenesis (14Thompson H.J.M. Knox J.P. Planta. 1998; 205: 32-38Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), pollen tube growth (15Roy S. Jauh G.Y. Hepler P.K. Lord E.M. Planta. 1998; 204: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and cell death (16Langan K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Protoplasma. 1997; 196: 87-96Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One line of research in this laboratory has focused on the localization and structure of AGPs at defined sites at the plant cell surface. The aims have been to determine whether different AGPs are located at different sites (thereby implying different functions), to determine how AGPs are held at these sites, and to elucidate possible precursor-product relationships between the various AGPs. The model system for this work has been suspension-cultured cells of “Paul's Scarlet” rose (Rosa sp.). Through biochemical purification and chemical structural analysis, PM-AGPs bound to the plasma membrane, CW-AGPs bound to the cell wall, and soluble CM-AGPs of the cell wall space/culture medium have been characterized in this model system (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two major AGPs, plus other minor forms, were found at each of these three sites. This distribution had both unique and common elements. Thus, one of the major PM-AGPs was distinct from any at the other two sites, and one major CW-AGP was distinct from any PM- or CM-AGP. On the other hand, one of the major PM-AGPs shared many structural features with one of the major CM-AGPs (1Nothnagel E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 174: 195-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present investigation was motivated by this observation of substantial similarity, perhaps even identity, between a PM-AGP and a CM-AGP. In particular, because the CM-AGP was highly water soluble, we wished to determine how the similar PM-AGP was held on the membrane. As none of the PM-AGPs had aminoacyl compositions that were more hydrophobic than those of CM-AGPs (1Nothnagel E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 174: 195-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a membrane anchor consisting of a hydrophobic, α-helical polypeptide domain seemed unlikely, despite the fact that such a domain has been predicted by several cDNAs encoding core polypeptides of AGPs (3Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Li S.-X. Showalter A.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Instead, the direction of this investigation was charted on the basis of our observation that the NMR spectrum of a PM-AGP included a signal of appropriate frequency and amplitude that it could have arisen from approximately two hydrocarbon chains per AGP molecule, such as might occur in a GPI or other lipid anchor (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We now report several additional lines of evidence showing that a GPI lipid anchor does occur on some AGPs. Some of these data have been previously presented in poster format (21Svetek J. Yadav M.P. Nothnagel E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 303aGoogle Scholar). Total PM-AGPs were purified from suspension-cultured cells of Paul's Scarlet rose (Rosa sp.) as described (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, plasma membrane vesicles were purified from the microsomal fraction by aqueous two-phase partitioning, optimized for rose (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PM-AGPs were fully extracted from the plasma membrane vesicles with 1% (w/w) Triton X-100 (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and then (β-d-Glc)3 Yariv phenylglycoside was added to the solubilized fraction to precipitate AGPs. Named chemically as 1,3,5-tri-(p-β-glucosyloxyphenylazo)-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene, (β-d-Glc)3 selectively binds AGPs. The AGP-(β-d-Glc)3 complex is soluble in pure water but precipitates in solutions of 1% (w/v) NaCl or higher ionic strength (1Nothnagel E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 174: 195-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AGPs thus precipitated from the 1% Triton X-100 extract were further purified through three cycles of solubilization in pure water and precipitation in 1% NaCl. The final AGP-(β-d-Glc)3 complex was dissolved in Me2SO, and acetone was added to precipitate the AGPs while leaving the (β-d-Glc)3 in the supernatant. After six Me2SO-acetone cycles, the final precipitate was dissolved in water and filtered (0.22 μm pore) to yield the total PM-AGP fraction. As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining, total PM-AGPs thus obtained were free of contaminating proteins (see Fig. 5 of Ref. 19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Total CM-AGPs were similarly purified from the medium of the same cell cultures as described (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (16Langan K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Protoplasma. 1997; 196: 87-96Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesicles purified by aqueous two-phase partitioning were stored in 5 mm EDTA, pH 6, at liquid N2 temperature. Upon thawing from storage, the vesicles (2.4 mg of protein) were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5 mm EDTA and then pelleted by centrifugation (“first centrifugation”; 1 h at 150,000 × g, 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended and incubated with 3 units of PI-PLC (from Bacillus thuringiensis, recombinant in Bacillus subtilis, Oxford GlycoSciences, Wakefield, MA) in 2 ml of the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer for 1 h at 20 °C in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors including 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, and 11 μg/ml phosphoramidon. A control sample without PI-PLC was similarly treated. After the 1 h incubation, the membrane vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation (“second centrifugation”; 1 h at 150,000 × g, 4 °C). Supernatants from the first and second centrifugations were separately concentrated in Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) ultrafiltration units. Aliquots (50 μg of protein) of pellets from the second centrifugation and supernatants from both centrifugations were subjected to rocket electrophoresis (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 15 μm(β-d-Glc)3 Yariv phenylglycoside, which selectively precipitates and stains AGPs as they move through the gel. Gum arabic was used as a standard. In typical experiments, samples of CM- or PM-AGPs (up to 1.7 mg of carbohydrate dissolved in water up to 300 μl) were analyzed on a 3-ml Resource-RPC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using equipment and elution with gradients of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid as described (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected and analyzed for total carbohydrate by the 2-aminothiophenol fluorometric assay (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In experiments involving enzyme treatment of AGPs prior to RPC separation, CM- or PM-AGPs (0.09–1.7 mg of total carbohydrate) were incubated with 3.5–4 units of PI-PLC in 200–300 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 3 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the solution was loaded directly onto the RPC column. Some experiments involved N-acetylation of AGPs prior to RPC. As an adaptation of the method of Menon (22Menon A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 418-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), 1.7 mg of AGPs were dissolved in 50 μl of saturated NaHCO3 solution and cooled in an ice-water bath. Three aliquots (each 3 μl) of acetic anhydride were then added at 10-min intervals. After further incubation for 1 h at 8 °C, the solution was loaded directly onto the RPC column. Thorough cleaning of the RPC column, which was needed to remove traces of glycolipids remaining after chromatography of PM-AGPs, was performed with 0.5 m NaOH and 6 m guanidine-HCl according to instructions provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Almond glycoamidase A (peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)-asparagine amidase, also called peptide:N-glycanase A) was obtained from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA) and applied to AGPs under conditions reported to result in cleavage of oligosaccharides from intact glycoproteins (23Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10776-10780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of 310 μg of AGPs and 1.5 milliunits of glycoamidase A were dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.12m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 0.75 mNaSCN, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 md-galactono-1,4-lactone. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, cooled, extensively dialyzed (12,000 molecular weight cutoff tubing) against water, and analyzed for glycosyl composition. A negative control reaction was performed in a similar manner except that the addition of glycoamidase A was delayed until heating in the boiling water bath was under way at the end of the 24-h incubation. Positive control reactions, in which the 310 μg of AGPs were replaced with 1 mg of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (Sigma), were performed in parallel, except that 3500 molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing was used. Aliquots of AGP solutions were dried and then methanolyzed at 85 °C for 15–18 h with 1.75m methanolic HCl (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) in the presence of 20% (v/v) methyl acetate in glass vials with Teflon-lined screw caps (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of fatty acid methyl esters, water was added to methanolysates to achieve a 4:1 (v/v) methanol-water ratio, and then the mixture was extracted three times, each with two volumes of hexane. The three hexane phases were pooled in glass vials, dried under N2, and TMS-derivatized. Compounds (methyl glycosides) remaining in the aqueous phase after hexane extraction were also dried under N2, N-acetylated, and TMS-derivatized. The derivatized samples were dissolved in iso-octane for injection into the GC column. In the analysis of glycolipids (see Table III), the hexane extraction step after methanolysis was omitted.Table IIIChemical analysis of glycolipids copurifying with PM-AGPsComponent1st 60-ml volume2nd 60-ml volumerelative molGal1.01.0Man2.72.9Ara2.41.3GlcA0.730.64GlcN0.100.15Inositol0.070.05Long-chain fatty acid1.42.0Long-chain base0.771.7Distribution of long-chain fatty acids (mol %)C22:0aDocosanoic acid.3.21.3C23:0bTricosanoic acid.2.71.8C24:0cTetracosanoic acid.46.852.8C23:0-2-OHd2-Hydroxytricosanoic acid.4.31.3C25:0ePentacosanoic acid.2.47.3C24:0-2-OH36.318.5C26:0fHexacosanoic acid.0.6911.7C25:0-2-OH3.75.4Distribution of long-chain bases (mol %)Phytosphingosineg4-Hydroxysphinganine.21.149.74-Hydroxysphingenine51.331.5Unidentified long-chain basehPossibly a degradation product of 4-hydroxysphingenine.27.618.8Two consecutive 60-ml volumes were collected in isocratic elution with 65% acetonitrile after the elution of PM-AGP-III in an experiment such as the control shown in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab Two consecutive 60-ml volumes were collected in isocratic elution with 65% acetonitrile after the elution of PM-AGP-III in an experiment such as the control shown in Fig. 2. The two 60-ml volumes were analyzed separately. When analyzing GlcN and inositol in small amounts of AGPs, a single-vial method was used for N-acetylation prior to methanolysis. The AGPs (20–200 μg) were dissolved in 50 μl of water, and 50 μl of pyridine were added. Three aliquots (each 10 μl) of acetic anhydride were then added at 10-min intervals, and stirring was continued for an additional 1 h at 23 °C. The solvent was then evaporated at 50 °C, and the residue was washed by sequential addition and evaporation of three aliquots of methanol totaling 1 ml. Methanolic HCl was then added to the residue to begin methanolysis. The nature of the linkage of fatty acids to AGPs was investigated by alkaline hydrolysis. Dry AGP (3 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 1:1 (v/v) methanol-14.8 N NH4OH and heated at 37 °C for 2 h. The sample was then evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 10 mm HCl, and extracted three times with diethyl ether. As applied to other molecules containing GPI lipid anchors, this procedure results in quantitative cleavage of hydroxyester-linked fatty acids and recovery as free fatty acids in the combined ether phases (22Menon A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 418-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The remaining aqueous phase was subsequently desalted by ultrafiltration, dried, methanolyzed, and extracted with hexane (as above). The ether extract was methanolyzed, and then the ether and hexane extracts were separately derivatized and injected into the GC column. The GC-flame ionization detector and GC-MSD equipment and procedures were as described (17Komalavilas P. Zhu J.-K. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15956-15965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Results of sugar analysis by GC-flame ionization detector were occasionally checked and confirmed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Positive identifications of inositol, GlcN, and lipids in AGPs required use of GC-MSD and were based on matches to both retention times and mass spectra of the authentic standards or, when authentic standards were not available, by matches to standard mass spectra in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Library provided by Hewlett-Packard with the model 5971A MSD. Authentic standards for hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, octadecenoic acid, eicosanoic acid, heneicosanoic acid, docosanoic acid, tetracosanoic acid, 1-O-octadecyl-rac-glycerol, phytosphingosine, andN-stearoyl dihydroglucocereboside were obtained from Sigma. Heneicosanoic acid was used as an internal standard when quantitating total fatty acids, although accuracy of quantitation was reduced for components for which no authentic standard was available. In these cases, quantitation was estimated in proportion to the total ion current identifying each lipid. Authentic standards for sugars andmyo-inositol were obtained from Pfanstiehl Laboratories (Waukegan, IL). Analyses of aminoacyl compositions were performed at the Macromolecular Structure Facility at the Michigan State University. The hypothesis that PM-AGPs contain a GPI lipid anchor was tested by quantitating the release of AGPs from plasma membrane vesicles upon treatment with PI-PLC. After PI-PLC treatment, or after equivalent incubation under control (no added PI-PLC) conditions, plasma membrane vesicles were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for AGP content by rocket electrophoresis. Fig. 1A shows that larger AGP rockets resulted from the supernatants of PI-PLC-treated membranes (lanes 9 and 10) than from the supernatants of control membranes (lanes 11 and 12). Because 50 μg of total protein were loaded in each lane, this result demonstrated an enrichment of AGPs relative to other proteins in the supernatant after treatment of plasma membrane vesicles with PI-PLC. Although the supernatants from the control (lanes 11 and12) and from the first centrifugation before treatment (lanes 5–8) also contained significant amounts of AGPs, results (data not shown) from experiments with various amounts of added PI-PLC revealed a proportionality between the amount of added PI-PLC and the amount by which the AGP content of the treatment supernatant exceeded the AGP content of the control supernatant. The excess AGP content of the treatment supernatant amounted to approximately 1.8 μg of AGPs per unit of added PI-PLC per 1 h at 20 °C. The significant levels of AGPs in the supernatant of the first centrifugation (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8) before treatment and in the supernatant of the control (lanes 11and 12) suggested that an inherent mechanism was also acting to release AGPs from the plasma membrane. Although a mixture of protease inhibitors was used in these experiments, the presence of these protease inhibitors did not alter either the inherent or the PI-PLC-catalyzed release of AGPs from plasma membrane vesicles (data not shown). To test for the action of an endogenous PI-PLC, inherent release of AGPs was examined when plasma membrane vesicles were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, ZnCl2, or Na3VO4. Although EDTA has no inhibitory effect on the PI-PLC from B. thuringiensis (24Ikezawa H. Taguchi R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 731-741Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), millimolar EDTA is strongly inhibitory of a glycosyl inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C from peanut (25Butikofer P. Brodbeck U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17794-17802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that EDTA caused a 40% inhibition of AGP release into the supernatant of rose plasma membrane vesicles. Millimolar ZnCl2 inhibits both bacterial (24Ikezawa H. Taguchi R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 731-741Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Griffith O.H. Volwerk J.J. Kuppe A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 197: 493-503Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and peanut (25Butikofer P. Brodbeck U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17794-17802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) PI-PLCs. Relatively little AGP was detected in the supernatant of rose plasma membrane vesicles in the presence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 1B). This effect was not due solely to inhibition of PI-PLC, however, as ZnCl2promoted precipitation of both vesicles and proteins, resulting in a sticky pellet that was difficult to resuspend. Tetravanadate inhibits both bacterial (27Campbell A.S. Thatcher G.R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 655-658Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and peanut (25Butikofer P. Brodbeck U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17794-17802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) PI-PLCs but only slightly inhibited inherent release of AGPs from rose plasma membranes (Fig. 1B). Whereas EDTA, ZnCl2, and Na3VO4 inhibited the inherent release of AGPs from plasma membrane vesicles, higher temperatures (up to 37 °C) and/or 70 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (in place of Tris-HCl buffer) accelerated the inherent release of AGPs (data not shown). Thus, Tris-HCl buffer and a relatively low temperature (20 °C) were used during incubation of plasma membrane vesicles with the exogenous PI-PLC enzyme. The hypothesis that PM-AGPs contain a GPI lipid anchor was further tested by RPC, as the presence of long-chain hydrocarbons could be predicted to retard the elution of AGPs from the column. Fig. 2 (untreated control) shows that RPC fractionated total PM-AGPs into a large complex peak (PM-AGP-I) eluting at 5–6% acetonitrile, plus two smaller symmetric peaks eluting at approximately 37% (PM-AGP-II) and 54% (PM-AGP-III) acetonitrile. The major peak, PM-AGP-I, was partially split, consistent with earlier work that showed that rose cells contain two major PM-AGPs, both of which eluted from the RPC column at 5–6% acetonitrile (19Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In that earlier work, it was also noted that the major CM-AGPs of rose eluted from the RPC column at approximately 5% acetonitrile, indicating that the major PM-AGPs were not appreciably more hydrophobic than the major CM-AGPs. Fig. 1C shows that the three largest PM-AGP peaks from the RPC column all interacted with (β-d-Glc)3 Yariv phenylglycoside. Fig. 2 also shows that treatment with exogenous PI-PLC caused a change in the elution profile of total PM-AGPs on RPC. The treatment with PI-PLC resulted in extensive depletion of peak III and a slight depletion of peak II. The remainder of the RPC elution profile was essentially unchanged. When material in peak III was separately collected, treated with exogenous PI-PLC, and rechromatographed on the same column, approximately two-thirds of the total carbohydrate eluted at a lower acetonitrile concentration corresponding to the positi"
https://openalex.org/W2000265293,"Full-length Drosophila kinesin heavy chain from position 1 to 975 was expressed in Escherichia coil (DKH975) and is a dimer. The sedimentation coefficient of DKH975 shifts from 5.4 S at 1 m NaCl to ∼6.9 S at <0.2m NaCl. This transition of DKH975 between extended and compact conformations is essentially identical to that for the heavy chain dimer of bovine kinesin (Hackney, D. D., Levitt, J. D., and Suhan, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8696–8701). Thus the capacity for undergoing the 7 S/5 S transition is an intrinsic property of the heavy chains and requires neither light chains nor eukaryotic post-translational modification. DKH960 undergoes a similar transition, indicating that the extreme COOH-terminal region is not required. More extensive deletions from the COOH-terminal (DKH945 and DKH937) result in a shift in the midpoint for the transition to lower salt concentrations. DKH927 and shorter constructs remaining extended even in the absence of added salt. Thus the COOH-terminal ∼50 amino acids are required for the formation of the compact conformation. Separately expressed COOH-terminal tail segments and NH2-terminal head/neck segments interact in a salt-dependent manner that is consistent with the compact conformer being produced by the interaction of domains from these regions of the heavy chain dimer. The microtubule-stimulated ATPase rate of DKH975 in the compact conformer is strongly inhibited compared with the rate of extended DKH894 (4 s−1 and 35 s−1, respectively, for k cat at saturating microtubules).

Separately expressed COOH-terminal tail segments and NH2-terminal head/neck segments interact in a salt-dependent manner that is consistent with the compact conformer being produced by the interaction of domains from these regions of the heavy chain dimer. The microtubule-stimulated ATPase rate of DKH975 in the compact conformer is strongly inhibited compared with the rate of extended DKH894 (4 s−1 and 35 s−1, respectively, for k cat at saturating microtubules). Kinesin is an ATP-dependent motor protein that is involved in movement of membranous vesicles along MTs 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; GST, glutathioneS-transferase.

Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal ∼340 amino acids of the heavy chain forms a globular motor domain (head) that has MT-stimulated ATPase activity (see Fig. 2B). The motor domain is followed by a long central coiled-coil stalk region and a small nonhelical domain at the COOH-terminal. The central region contains several positions at which the coiled-coil propensity is low and these likely represent hinges in the stalk. The first coiled-coil region that extends from the motor domain is designated the neck region. Constructs that contain the head and the COOH-terminal part of the coiled-coil neck form dimers (3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There is a likely hinge at position ∼400 that marks the boundary between the neck and the stalk. Peptides from the neck (4Morii H. Takenawa T. Arisaka F. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Tripet B. Vale R.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and stalk (6deCuevas M. Tao T. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to interact in a coiled-coil manner by several criteria. The crystal structure of a dimeric head plus neck construct has been recently determined (7Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Schonbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and it directly demonstrates the coiled-coil interactions in the neck region. Native kinesin is a heterotetramer composed of a dimeric heavy chain core with two light chains attached in the COOH-terminal region (8Kuznetsov S.A. Vaisberg E.A. Shanina N.A. Magretova N.N.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3409-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). At high salt kinesin exist in an extended conformation with ans 20,w value of ∼6 S, but adopts a more compact conformation at low salt concentration with ans 20,w value of ∼9 S. This global conformational transition is readily reversible and can be observed by electron microscopy (10Hisanaga S. Murofushi H. Okuhara K. Sato R. Masuda Y. Sakai H. Hirokawa N. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A species lacking detectable light chains is also obtained from bovine brain and undergoes a corresponding salt-dependent transition between extended (∼5 S) and compact (∼7 S) conformations (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here thatDrosophila heavy chain dimers also undergo a 7 S/5 S transition. Furthermore, specific regions of the tail and head/neck interact in a salt-dependent manner that is consistent with this interaction being responsible for producing the compact conformation. Isolated head domains have a high MT-activated ATPase activity when prepared by limited proteolysis (12Kuznetsov S.A. Vaisberg E.A. Rothwell S.W. Murphy D.B. Gelfand V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 589-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or as fusion proteins (13Stewart R.J. Tahler J.P. Goldstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The rate of ∼40 s−1 at saturating MT concentration that is observed with dimeric head constructs (see Ref. 3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is consistent with tight coupling of 1 ATP per step during motility (40 s−1per head × 2 heads per dimer × 8 nm per tubulin dimer along protofilament predicts a sliding rate of ∼600 nm/s that is equal to the observed sliding rate of single molecules, see Ref. 14Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, for discussion). The maximum ATPase rate of bovine kinesin in the compact conformer, however, is only ∼1 s−1 for the 9 S heterotetramer and ∼7 s−1 for the 7 S dimer (15Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Wagner D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and this suggests that the inhibition of full-length kinesinversus free head domains is due to interaction of the heads with tail domains in the compact conformer. Myosin from smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells undergoes a similar conformational transition at low salt concentration that produces a compact form with a highly inhibited rate of actin-stimulated ATP hydrolysis (16Trybus D.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6151-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Ikebe M. Hinkins S. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4580-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has not, however, been possible to directly test the inhibition of ATPase of kinesin in the compact versus the extended conformers because the transition could only be produced at high ionic strength. MT-stimulated ATPase and MT-stimulated ADP release are strongly inhibited by even moderate salt concentrations (18Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Bloom G.S. Brady S.T. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Cheng J.-Q. Jiang W. Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5288-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and it would be difficult to separate the direct inhibitory effect of salts from their possible secondary activation linked to the 7 S/5 S transition. We report here that removal of a small COOH-terminal region blocks formation of the compact conformation. This allows comparison of the MT-stimulated ATPase rate of full-length kinesin in the compact conformation to that of this slightly shorter extended construct at low salt where both are potentially active. Under these conditions, the extended construct has the same high ATPase activity as short dimers of heads, whereas the compact construct is strongly inhibited. All reactions were performed at 25 °C in A25 buffer as described previously (3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Centrifugation on sucrose density gradients and gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m were performed using standard proteins as described previously (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) using a 4% stacking gel and a 11% separating gel, except for the separation of the long constructs (Fig. 1B) which used a 6% separating gel. All kinesin constructs were derived from the original Drosophila cDNA clone of Yang et al. (21Yang J.T. Saxton W.M. Goldstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). pGST864–975 encodes the tail domain region between positions 864 and 975 as a fusion protein with GSTase. It was obtained by ligation of the PvuII fragment of kinesin that contains the COOH-terminal into the SmaI site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia). pGST864–893 was obtained by cleavage of pGST864–975 with NcoI and EcoRI, treatment with DNA polymerase (Klenow), and religation. This procedure removes the coding region between amino acids 894 and the COOH terminus and results in a fusion protein with an extension of EFIVTD beyond position 893. pGST893–975 was obtained by insertion of theNcoI/EcoRI fragment of kinesin that contains the COOH-terminal into a modified pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) that contains anNcoI site following the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site. The resulting construct contains pGEX-2T sequence through the thrombin cleavage site terminating in PRGS, followed by PA and then kinesin sequence from Met893 to the COOH-terminal. This was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGST613–975 was similarly obtained by insertion of the NcoI/EcoRI fragment of kinesin that was not cut at the internal NcoI site at 893. Constructs terminating at 910, 937, and 960 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pDK613–975 (see below) as the target and with T7 promoter primer in the forward direction and reverse primers that introduced a stop codon at the appropriate position followed by an EcoRI site. These polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved with XhoI and EcoRI and inserted into a backbone derived from pGST613–975 by cleavage withXhoI and EcoRI. This produced a set of constructs in pGEX with kinesin sequence from 613 to the new stop positions. pGST893–910, pGST893–937 and pGST893–960 were produced from these constructs by cleavage with NcoI and religation of the backbone to remove the 613–892 region. pDKH975 contains the entire coding region of Drosophilakinesin heavy chain from position 1 to 975 as a non-fusion protein. It was derived from pDKH392 (22Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by cleavage with NsiI andEcoRI and insertion of the NsiI toEcoRI fragment of kinesin. pDKH894, pDKH910, pDKH927, pDKH937, pDKH945, and pDKH960 code for amino acids from position 1 to the indicated stop position. They were produced by insertion into pDKH975 of either the NcoI/EcoRI fragment from pGST893–910, pGST893–937, and pGST893–960 or of new polymerase chain reaction fragments. In the final constructs, the only coding region that is polymerase chain reaction-derived is between theNcoI site at Met893 and the stop codon and this was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pDKH614 was derived from pDKH894 by cleavage with NcoI and religation of the backbone. In pDKH614, Ala614 is converted to Glu. pDKH560 was derived from pDKH614 by cleavage with NsiI and NcoI and insertion of the NsiI/AflIII fragment of kinesin. In pDKH560, Ser560 is converted to Glu. pDK613–975 and pDK893–975 contain the indicated kinesin regions as non-fusion proteins in pET-21d (Novagen). Kinesin head domains were prepared as described previously (3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The long heavy chain constructs, DKH894-DKH975, were expressed and processed through the P-11 chromatography step as described for the head domain constructs except that induction with isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed at ≤25 °C. MgATP was included at ≥0.1 mm in all solutions. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled P-11 fractions to 36% and centrifuged to collect the kinesin in the pellet. Both bovine kinesin and long heavy chain constructs ofDrosophila kinesin precipitate at this low concentration of ammonium sulfate. Shorter Drosophila kinesin constructs, as well as most Escherichia coli proteins, remain soluble and this step provides considerable further purification. After dissolving the ammonium sulfate pellet in minimal A25 with 1 m NaCl, it was subjected to gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m in 1 mNaCl. The peak fractions were dialyzed versus KA buffer (14Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), loaded on a Bio-Gel DEAE column, and eluted with 150 mm NaCl in KA buffer. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against A25 buffer with 50 mm KCl in 50% glycerol with 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Cells containing induced GSTase fusion proteins were lyzed and clarified essentially as described for DKH340 except that the buffer was 50 mm Bicine/NaOH, pH 8, with 10 mm EDTA. The clarified extract was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column, washed with 20 mm Bicine/NaOH, pH 8, containing 1000 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. The protein was eluted with 20 mm Bicine/NaOH, pH 8, containing 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm glutathione. Control GSTase was obtained by expression of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). When the long non-fusion constructs (DKH894-DKH975) are induced at 37 °C, the pool of soluble construct is vanishingly small and essentially all of the expressed protein is present as inclusion bodies. For isolation of inclusion bodies, cells that had been induced at 37 °C were lysed and centrifuged as described above. The pellet was washed by resuspension and centrifugation at 10,000 × g successively in MgM buffer (14Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Triton (twice), and finally with 0.05 m NaCl (twice). The washed pellets were solubilized by heating to 100 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and used as size markers for unproteolyzed constructs. Constructs containing the extreme COOH terminus are highly susceptible to proteolysis during isolation and the particular preparations used here have some proteolytic cleavage as indicated in Fig. 1. For the GSTase fusions, the largest species is the size expected for a full-length construct in each case (Fig. 1A). The proteolytic cleavages are not likely to have occurred in the GSTase domain because GSTase itself is resistant to proteolysis and because all of the proteolytic fragments continue to bind tightly to glutathione-Sepharose. Also, in preparations that have been more extensively proteolyzed, the ladder of fragments shifts down toward the mass for GSTase, but not below, as expected for proteolytic removal of the kinesin-derived COOH-terminal region. The longer fragment (PF-I) results from cleavage at ≤960 as this fragment of GST893–975 comigrates slightly faster than uncleaved GST893–960. The short fragment (PF-II) results from cleavage at ∼940 as this fragment of GST893–975 and GST893–960 is slightly larger than GST893–937. In more extensively proteolyzed preparations such as that used in Fig. 5, the fragment terminating at ∼940 is the major species. Constructs lacking the 940–975 region are not significantly proteolyzed. Full-length DKH975 is also partially proteolyzed to species corresponding to cleavage at the PF-I and PF-II sites as indicated in Fig. 1B. Proteins obtained from inclusion bodies were used for size standards as they have likely precipitated before undergoing proteolysis. Although there is some unproteolyzed protein, the major band in a typical preparation of DKH975, as indicated in Fig. 1B, corresponds to cleavage at the PF-I site. There is also a significant band corresponding to cleavage at the PF-II site. Some preparations of DKH975 are more highly proteolyzed with the major band corresponding to PF-II and these preparations have not been included in the work presented here. Preparations of DKH960 show much less proteolysis and appear predominately as a single band of the expected size. Although it cannot be excluded that some proteolysis of DKH960 has occurred to produce the PF-I product, which is approximately the same size as DKH960, there is no major accumulation of the PF-II product as observed with DKH975. All of the shorter constructs (DKH894-DKH945) migrated as single bands at the same position as the corresponding proteins isolated from inclusion bodies. The sedimentation coefficients of the full-lengthDrosophila kinesin heavy chain construct, DKH975, and truncated DKH960 are 5.4 S in A25 buffer with 25 mm KCl and 1 m NaCl, but shift to 6.7–7.0 S at low salt concentration with a midpoint for the transition of ∼0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 2A). The behavior of these long Drosophila constructs is essentially identical to that of the bovine kinesin heavy chain dimer (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution position of DKH975 and DKH960 during gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m at high and low salt (not shown), as well, is essentially identical to that of the bovine heavy chain dimer (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an increase in Stokes radius at high salt. The similarity of the sedimentation and diffusion properties to those of bovine dimer indicates that DKH975 and DKH960 are also dimers that undergo a transition from a compact conformation at low salt to an extended, highly asymmetric, conformation at high salt concentration. A possible model for this transition is presented in Fig. 2Bas a framework for discussion. The sedimentation coefficient of DKH894, DKH910, and DKH927 remain ≤5.6 S (Fig. 2A), even at low salt and thus removal of the COOH-terminal 48 amino acids inhibits formation of the compact conformer. Deletions of intermediate length, DKH945 and DKH937, still form the compact conformation at low salt, but the midpoint for the transition is shifted to lower salt concentration. The midpoints for DKH945 and DKH937 are similar, but DKH937 is shifted slightly to lower concentrations. In the preparations of DKH975 that were used, the major component was a proteolysis fragment, PF-I, of approximately the same size as DKH960 (see “Materials and Methods”). Thus the observed sedimentation behavior of DKH975 preparations is dominated by the PF-I species and does not necessarily represent the behavior of true full-length DKH975. At 300 mm NaCl, DKH960 should be in the compact conformation, but DKH945 and shorter should be mainly extended. Chromatography of DKH975 preparations at 300 mm NaCl indicates that full-length DKH975 comigrates with the PF-I species at the position expected for the compact conformer, and thus it is likely that full-length DKH975 does behave similarly to DKH960. The smaller PF-II species elutes earlier at the position expected for the extended conformer, consistent with its length of ∼940. The inability of DKH894-DKH927 to from the compact conformer at low ionic strength suggests that formation of the compact conformer results from interaction of the COOH-terminal region with regions closer to the head domain. A GSTase fusion protein containing the kinesin heavy chain from amino acids 864–975, designated GST864–975, was used to determine if it could interact with head domains in a salt-dependent manner. GST864–975 was loaded onto a column containing glutathione-Sepharose and head domains were passed down the column in low salt buffer to determine if binding could occur. As indicated in Fig. 3A, DKH365, DKH381, and DKH392 were retained by the column, whereas DKH340 and DKH357 passed through. Subsequent elution of the columns with high salt buffer released the bound DKH365, DKH381, and DKH392. In order to further localize the site of interaction in the tail region, GSTase fusions containing smaller parts of the COOH-terminal region were tested for interaction with DKH392. As indicated in Fig. 3B, the region between 893 and 975 was sufficient for salt-dependent interaction, but the region between 864 and 893 was not sufficient for tight interaction. Column binding tests were also performed with GSTase fusions containing kinesin tail sequences from 893 to 937 and 893 to 960 as indicated in Fig. 4. Under these conditions, none of the three head domains binds to a GSTase control, GST893–910 (not shown), or GST893–937. Extension of the tail domain to 960 (GST893–960) does produce salt-dependent binding of DKH365 and DKH405, but not DKH346. However, the binding of DKH405 is stronger than that of DKH365, as DKH365 is rapidly eluted by 150 mmsalt, whereas higher concentrations of salt are required to rapidly elute DKH405. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of DKH392 alone in the absence of added salt (Fig. 5A) gives a sedimentation coefficient of 5.9 S compared with 5.2 S observed previously in 25 mm KCl (22Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The self-aggregation of DKH392 is more extensive at lower salt (3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and this shift ins 20,w value likely results from some reversible aggregation under these conditions. Sedimentation of GST893–975 alone gives a sedimentation coefficient of 4.4 S that is consistent with a dimeric protein of its subunit molecular weight and is similar to the value of 4.4 S obtained for the parent dimeric GSTase (not shown). The preparation of GST893–975 used here is more extensively proteolyzed than the sample of GST893–975 in Fig. 1A. The proteolytic fragment PF-II is the most abundant species and only a minor amount of PF-I is present, but considerable full-length GST893–975 is still present. When GST893–975 is mixed with an excess of DKH392 before sedimentation, full-length GST893–975 comigrates with DKH392 at a higher sedimentation coefficient of ∼7 S (Fig. 4C). Most of the major proteolytic fragment (PF-II) of GST893–975 does not migrate more rapidly in the presence of DKH392, but some of the proteolytic fragment does shift as indicated by streaking into fractions further down the gradient. Weaker interaction of PF-II with DKH392 is consistent with the size of the COOH-terminal truncation to ∼940 (Fig. 1B) and the shift in the midpoint for DKH937 and DKH945 that is observed in Fig. 2. The parent GSTase protein shows no shift in sedimentation coefficient when centrifuged under these conditions in the presence of excess DKH392 (not shown). The interaction observed between GST893–975 and DKH392 is likely to be weak and reversible under these conditions and is only observed in Fig. 5C because DKH392 was in excess. Sedimentation of GST893–975 with excess DKH392 in buffer with 25 mm KCl results in only a partial shift of GST893–975 (not shown), indicating that even low concentrations of added salt are sufficient to inhibit association. GST893–975 also fails to comigrate with DKH392 in the absence of added salt when the concentration of DKH392 is reduced (not shown), indicative of a weak interaction that requires high levels of DKH392 to maintain a significant fraction of the GST893–975 as the complex. The initial rates for ATP hydrolysis was determined for compact DKH975 and extended DKH894 in A25 buffer with 50 mm KCl (Fig. 6). Thek cat and K 0.5(MT)values were 35 and 3.8 s−1 and 1.9 and 0.27 μm, respectively, for DKH894 and DKH975. The heavy chain dimer of bovine kinesin has previously been shown to undergo a transition from an extended conformer at high salt concentration to a more compact conformer at low salt concentration (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bovine dimer, however, likely results from proteolysis of the light chains during isolation of the native bovine heterotetramer (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Hackney D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the heavy chain dimer could potentially still contain small light chain domains that are not easily detected by SDS-PAGE. The ability of the Drosophila heavy chain dimer obtained by expression in E. coli to form the compact conformer at low ionic strength indicates that the heavy chain itself possesses the capability to form a compact conformation without the involvement of light chains or eukaryotic post translational modification. Two types of mechanisms could produce the compact conformer. One possibility is that the stalk is bent back on itself at the likely hinge at position ∼600 and that the interaction of the front and back half of the stalk along their lengths provides the major stabilization of the compact conformer. In the other type of model, as indicated in Fig. 2B, formation of the compact conformer is driven by a favorable interaction between a domain in the NH2-terminal head region and a domain in the COOH-terminal tail region that can occur because there is sufficient flexibility in the stalk for the two ends of kinesin to come into contact. The break in the predicted coiled-coil of the stalk around position 600 is a candidate hinge for either model. The inability of DKH927 to form the compact conformer at low salt (Fig. 2A) indicates that the COOH-terminal region between 927 and 960 is required and, conversely, that the stalk domain itself cannot produce a stable compact conformation. This suggests that the compact conformer is not produced by interactions within the stalk, but rather by interaction between specific segments in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions as indicated in Fig. 2B. Such a direct interaction is supported by the observation that separately expressed tails and heads interact in a salt-dependent manner (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). This does not totally preclude involvement of antiparallel interactions between the front and back half of the stalk domain in the compact conformer, but does indicate that any such interactions within the stalk are not the major energetic driving force for formation of the compact conformer. Analysis of the tendency for coiled-coil formation indicates (Fig. 7) that the region between 850 and 910 is likely to be coiled-coil in heptad frame 7N with a weak area around Pro883. The region between 910 and 930 has a weaker predicted tendency for coiled-coil formation in heptad frame7N-3. Detailed inspection (Fig. 7) indicates that there is a reasonable heptad repeat in both heptad frames 7N-3 and7N, that could facilitate a 4-helix or antiparallel coiled-coil interaction between the ∼883 and 930 region of the tail and the helical region of the neck. The ability of DKH937 to form the compact conformer at low salt (Fig. 2A) and the ability of GST893–960 to bind to DKH365 (Fig. 4) indicate that the tail region from 893–937 and the head region of 1–365 are sufficient for tight interaction, although interaction of additional regions may provide further stabilization. The NH2-terminal half of the coiled-coil neck is likely to play a critical role as even partial deletion (DKH357 versusDKH365) strongly inhibits interaction with the tail domains. These regions of both the neck and tail are highly charged (16 charged for 340–365 and 15 charged for 912–936) and this could account for the high salt dependence of the interaction. The whole region between 883–936, however, has an abundance of charged groups and is it not possible to definitely predict the alignment of the tail and neck regions in the complex. Although the NH2-terminal half of the neck is likely to be important for the binding of the tail domain, several constructs containing the neck and adjacent regions, in the absence of complete head domains, have been tested for binding to the tail domain and none have been found to bind strongly. 2M. Stock and D. Hackney, unpublished observations. It is thus likely that strong binding to the tail domain requires interaction over a more extended region than just the NH2-terminal half of the coiled-coil neck. Although the ability of DKH937 to form a compact conformation at low salt indicates that the region beyond 937 is not absolutely required, the shift in the midpoint for the transition with longer constructs indicates that the region beyond 937 can stabilize the interaction. If the region of ∼345–365 interacts with ∼910–930 in an antiparallel configuration as in Fig. 2B, then the region of the tail beyond 930 would be juxtaposed to the head domain and in a position for potential interaction. Conventional kinesins show strong sequence conservation in this region up to position 950 (Fig. 7) and the conserved region (940–950) surrounding the IAK at positions 942–944 is thus a candidate for this additional area of interaction with the head. This antiparallel alignment would also juxtapose the COOH-terminal half of the neck with the region between ∼883 and 910 and interaction of these regions could be responsible for the stronger interaction of DKH405 versusDKH365 with tails (Fig. 4). The highly charged NH2-terminal half of the coiled-coil neck has a gap in the hydrophobic heptad repeat and this region was postulated to be capable of reversibly uncoiling, while the dimer remained anchored by the stronger interactions in the better heptad repeats of the COOH-terminal half of the neck (24Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16508-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work with peptides from the neck region has established that such uncoiling of the NH2-terminal half of the neck can occur (4Morii H. Takenawa T. Arisaka F. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Tripet B. Vale R.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the exact oligomeric state of the complex between the tail and head/neck is not known, the interaction between monomeric DKH365 and GST893–975 suggests that formation of a 4-helix bundle is not necessary, at least for the NH2-terminal half of the neck. An alternative possibility is that strand displacement may occur with uncoiling of the NH2-terminal half of the neck to allow formation of a pair of antiparallel coiled-coils with the region from ∼910 to 930 of the tail. The relatively poor prediction for a parallel coiled-coil interaction of this region of the tail with itself may be reflective of an actual role in antiparallel interaction with the neck. Fungal kinesins are relatives of conventional kinesin (25Steinberg G. Schliwa M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that have lost the highly charged nature of both the neck and tail regions that are homologous to those implicated above in formation of the compact conformation. Either these regions of fungal kinesins do not interact, or both regions have co-evolved to maintain an interaction that is not as highly dependent on charge. Interestingly, the IAK region is, however, conserved between conventional and fungal kinesins. Entropic effects are likely to be the major cause of the weaker apparent interaction of domains on separate constructs relative to domains that are covalently linked. For example, DKH975 remains predominantly in the compact conformation at 0.3 m salt, whereas interaction of GST893–975 and DKH392 during cosedimentation is weak and readily reversible even in the absence of added salt. When the domains are on separate constructs, they are free to diffuse away from each other following dissociation, whereas the dissociated domains of DKH975 are restrained to remain near each other because they are covalently linked through the stalk. The failure of DKH405 or DKH365 to bind to GST893–937 in the column binding assay (Fig. 4) while DKH937 can still form the compact conformer, likely also reflects the more stringent requirements for association of fragments that are not covalently linked. Additive contributions from the entire extended binding region including the IAK region that is present in GST893–960 are apparently required for binding to be tight enough to be observed under these more stringent assay conditions. Entropic considerations also predict that the column binding experiments (Figs. 3 and 4) can better detect weak interactions compared with cosedimentation experiments (Fig. 5). The sedimentation velocity of an equilibrating mixture is directly related to the fraction associated; but in the column binding assay, head domains must interact sequentially with many bound GST-tail fusions before they can be eluted. The analysis of ATPase rates of heavy chain constructs that are close to full-length is complicated by the tendency for formation of asters of MTs in the presence of ATP as originally reported by Urrutiaet al. (26Urrutia R. McNiven M.A. Albanesi J.P. Murphy D.B. Kachar B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The heavy chain constructs used here can also produce such asters during the course of an ATPase assay at high concentration as verified by electron microscopy. 3D. Hackney, unpublished observations. The ATPase results in Fig. 6 were obtained as initial rates at low kinesin concentration (30 nm) in order to minimize the contribution from kinesin molecules in asters. Extended DKH894 has a highk cat at saturating MT concentration that is similar to that of fully active shorter constructs (3Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thek cat of DKH975, however, is 10-fold lower, indicating inhibition in the compact conformer. The true rate of DKH975 in the compact conformer may be even lower than the observed rate of 3.4 s−1 as the K 0.5(MT) of 0.27 μm is unexpectedly low and part of the observed activity likely represents catalysis by the contaminating PF-II species which has a high ATPase rate and a lowK 0.5(MT)value. 2M. Stock and D. Hackney, unpublished observations. With bovine kinesin, inhibition of MT-stimulated ATPase activity results from inhibition of the ability of MTs to stimulate ADP release from the compact conformer that is present at low ionic strength (15Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Wagner D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This inhibition could result directly from steric blockage by the tail of the MT interaction site on the head or indirectly by a conformational change in the head or neck that is induced by binding of the tail domains. If the site on the tail domain to which the head domain bound was overlapping with the site on the tail to which the vesicle receptor bound, then competition between these two binding modes would provide a natural basis for regulation by mass action (11Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as illustrated by the model of Fig. 8. Even if the receptor-binding site is on the light chains, the binding of tails to heads versus receptors could be still be competitive as long as steric constraints prevented both interactions from occurring at the same time. When free in solution, kinesin would be in the compact conformer and be inhibited, while binding of the membrane receptor to the tail would release the heads in their active form. If the binding of the tail to the receptor was stronger than binding of the tail to the heads and if kinesin was in excess, then all the receptors would be occupied with active kinesin and any excess kinesin would be in the compact conformer and thus inhibited. Such binding-induced activation of kinesin has been reported with nonphysiolgical surfaces (27Jiang M.Y. Sheetz M.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 283s-285sPubMed Google Scholar, 28Coy D.L. Howard J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A36Google Scholar, 29Moraga D.E. Murphy D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 258aGoogle Scholar) and is likely to also be responsible for the high motor activity of adsorbed kinesin in motility assays, but activation by physiological receptors remains to be demonstrated. The occurrence of receptor-induced activation by induction of the extended conformer would not preclude additional or alternative regulation by other means such as phosphorylation (30Lee K. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, the role in receptor activation of charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) and cysteines in the extracellular loops (EL) of the human P2Y1receptor has been investigated. The mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and measured for stimulation of phospholipase C induced by the potent agonist 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-diphosphate (2-MeSADP). In addition to single point mutations, all receptors carried the hemagglutinin epitope at the N- terminus for detection of cell-surface expression. The C124A and C202A mutations, located near the exofacial end of transmembrane helix 3 and in EL2, respectively, ablated phospholipase C stimulation by ≤100 μm 2-MeSADP. Surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of both mutant receptors showed <10% expression, suggesting that a critical disulfide bridge between EL2 and the upper part of transmembrane 3, as found in many other G protein-coupled receptors, is required for proper trafficking of the P2Y1 receptor to the cell surface. In contrast, the C42A and C296A mutant receptors (located in the N-terminal domain and EL3) were activated by 2-MeSADP, but the EC50 values were >1000-fold greater than for the wild-type receptor. The double mutant receptor C42A/C296A exhibited no additive shift in the concentration-response curve for 2-MeSADP. These data suggest that Cys42 and Cys296 form another disulfide bridge in the extracellular region, which is critical for activation. Replacement of charged amino acids produced only minor changes in receptor activation, with two remarkable exceptions. The E209A mutant receptor (EL2) exhibited a >1000-fold shift in EC50. However, if Glu209 were substituted with amino acids capable of hydrogen bonding (Asp, Gln, or Arg), the mutant receptors responded like the wild-type receptor. Arg287 in EL3 was impaired similarly to Glu209 when substituted by alanine. Substitution of Arg287 by lysine, another positively charged residue, failed to fully restore wild-type activity.

P2 receptors have been divided into two structurally distinct families as follows: the P2X receptor class of ligand-gated ion channels, which are primarily activated by ATP, and the P2Y receptor class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; 2-MeSADP, 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-diphosphate; 2-MeSATP, 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-triphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EL, extracellular loops; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; HT-AMP, 2-(hexylthio)adenosine-5′-monophosphate; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PLC, phospholipase C; TM, (helical) transmembrane domain; AT, angiotensin. which are activated by both extracellular adenine and uridine nucleotides (1Fredholm B.B.

As many as 11 subtypes of P2Y receptors have been cloned, but only 5 of these are from mammalian species and have been shown to be functionally activated by extracellular nucleotides. Of these 11, several may be either non-nucleotide receptors such as P2Y5, P2Y7, P2Y9, and P2Y10 or species homologues like p2y3 and P2Y6. The P2Y1 subtype specifically recognizes adenine nucleotides, which act as either potent agonists (e.g. 2-methylthio-ADP) or selective antagonists (e.g. MRS 2179). The P2Y1 receptor, which is coupled to activation of phospholipase C (PLC), is expressed in heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and various smooth muscle cells and is associated with the vasodilatory action of ATP (3Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In platelets, it serves as one of the receptors through which ADP induces aggregation, an action attenuated by ATP and other triphosphate derivatives (4Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Previously we have investigated the determinants of ligand recognition in P2Y1 receptors using site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acid residues in the transmembrane helical domains (TMs) (5Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee M. Kim Y.C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), molecular modeling based on similarity to rhodopsin in sequence and overall geometry (6Moro S. Guo D. Camaioni E. Boyer J.L. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the chemical synthesis of novel agonists (7Fischer B. Boyer J.L. Hoyle C.H.V. Ziganshin A.U. Brizzolara A.U. Knight G.E. Zimmet J. Burnstock G. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and antagonists (8Camaioni E. Boyer J.L. Mohanram A. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Positively charged and other conserved residues in TM3, TM6, and TM7, such as Arg128, Arg310, and Ser314, were found to be critical for the activation by nucleotides of human P2Y1 receptors. A molecular model of the TM domains based on these findings has been proposed (6Moro S. Guo D. Camaioni E. Boyer J.L. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Most of the interest in GPCRs to date has focused on the TM domains for locating amino acids that are specifically involved in recognition of small, non-peptide ligands, including nucleotides (5Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee M. Kim Y.C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, for peptide receptors residues within the extracellular loops (ELs) are essential for ligand recognition (11Berthold M. Bartfai T. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Currently, there is accumulating evidence that residues within the ELs are also important in GPCRs that recognize small molecules as ligands. In adenosine receptors, amino acids in EL2 were shown to be involved in agonist and antagonist binding (12Kim J. Jiang Q. Glashofer M. Yehle S. Wess J. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 683-691PubMed Google Scholar) and high affinity binding of xanthine antagonists (13Olah M. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24692-24698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, amino acids in EL2 and EL3 were found to be important for ligand binding (14Perlman J.H. Colson A.-O. Jain R. Czyzewski B. Cohen L. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15670-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the α1-adrenergic receptor, three amino acids at the C-terminal end of EL2 were shown to be responsible for subtype-specific antagonist binding (15Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). In angiotensin II type 2 receptors, amino acid residues in EL2 and EL3 contribute to angiotensin II binding (16Heerding J.N. Yee D.K. Jacobs S.L. Fluharty S.J. Regul. Pept. 1997; 72: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas in angiotensin II type 1 receptors, an additional residue in EL1 is involved in this process (17Hjorth S.A. Schambye H.T. Grenlee W.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30953-30959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A conserved disulfide bridge between Cys residues in the second extracellular loop (EL2) and the exofacial end of TM3 has been shown to be essential for various biogenic amine and other GPCRs. It is generally thought that this disulfide bond is required to maintain overall receptor geometry, although its role in transport to the cell surface is contradictory (18Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Cook J.V. McGregor A. Lee T. Milligan G. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An additional disulfide bridge between a cysteine in the EL3 and the N-terminal domain was found in the angiotensin receptor (20Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Sano T. Nakagomi Y. Hamakubo T. Morishima I. Inagami T. Regul. Pept. 1995; 57: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The extracellular portions of the human P2Y1 receptor carry four cysteines, and sequence comparison has revealed that all of these cysteines are conserved among P2Y receptors (21Filtz T.M. Harden K.T. Nicholas R.A. Jacobson K.A. Jarvis M.F. Purinergic Approaches in Experimental Therapeutics. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 39-53Google Scholar). Hence P2Y receptors might form two disulfide bridges within the extracellular receptor portions. Interestingly, the P2Y receptors are GPCRs that recognize small molecules as ligands, but they exhibit the highest sequence identity with peptide receptors such as somatostatin, platelet-activating factor, angiotensin II, and neuropeptide Y receptors (22van Rhee A.M. Fischer B. van Galen P.J.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Design Discovery. 1995; 13: 133-154PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this paradox (binding of a small ligand and sequence homology with peptide receptors), we have investigated the role of amino acids in the ELs in human P2Y1 receptor activation. The aim of this study was to identify amino acids that potentially may be involved in either direct ligand contact or in conformational restriction of the ELs. We hypothesized that disruption of either of the two potential disulfide bonds in the ELs or substitution of amino acids potentially involved in ionic interactions (Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg) might have a marked effect on ligand recognition and thus receptor-mediated activation of PLC. The expression construct coding for the human P2Y1 receptor (pCDP2Y1) was prepared as described previously (5Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee M. Kim Y.C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K.

A hexahistidine tag (26Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Luthin D.R. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Biochem.

Cells were transfected approximately 24 h later with plasmid DNA (10 μg DNA/dish) using the DEAE-dextran method (27Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) for 40 min, followed by treatment with 100 μm chloroquine for 2.5 h, and grown for an additional 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Assays were carried out according to the general approach of Harden et al. (28Harden T.K. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Boyer J.L. Downes P. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). About 24 h after transfection, the cells were split into 6-well plates (Costar, ∼0.75 × 106 cells/well) in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 3 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol. After a 24-h labeling period, cells were preincubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were slightly swirled to ensure uniformity. Following the addition of agonists, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and 750 μl of cold 20 mmformic acid was added to each well. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, cell extracts were neutralized with 250 μl of 60 mm NH4OH. The inositol monophosphate fraction was then isolated by anion exchange chromatography (29Berridge M.J.

For cell surface ELISA measurements, cells were transferred to 96-well dishes (4–5 × 104 cells per well) 1 day after transfection. About 72 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS and blocking with DMEM (containing 10% FBS), cells were incubated with the HA-specific monoclonal antibody (12CA5), 20 μg/ml, for 3 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Hydrogen peroxide and o-phenylenediamine (each 2.5 mm in 0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0) served as substrate and chromogen, respectively. The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 30 min at room temperature with 1m H2SO4 solution containing 0.05m Na2SO3, and the color development was measured bichromatically in the BioKinetics reader (EL312, BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) at 490 and 630 nm (base line). The reading for cells transfected with expression constructs coding for the human P2Y1 wild-type receptor was approximately 0.5 OD units, and approximately 0.2 OD units for cells transfected with vector DNA alone. The difference was normalized as 100% surface expression. Wild-type and all cysteine mutant receptors were detected with the polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml, clone BMG-His-1, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) directed against the hexa-His tag present at the C-terminal domain of all receptors. Samples containing 50 μg of solubilized membrane protein prepared from transfected COS-7 cells as described previously (30Jakubik J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% miniplus sepragel, Owl Separation Systems, Woburn, MA), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the polyhistidine monoclonal antibody as described (31Lui J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:2500, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Among P2Y receptors, four cysteines in the extracellular domains are conserved (21Filtz T.M. Harden K.T. Nicholas R.A. Jacobson K.A. Jarvis M.F. Purinergic Approaches in Experimental Therapeutics. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 39-53Google Scholar). For the human P2Y1 receptor these cysteines are Cys42 in the N-terminal domain, Cys124 near the exofacial end of TM3, Cys202 in EL2, and Cys296 in EL3. Each of these cysteine residues was individually mutated to alanine, and the corresponding mutants were tested for activation of PLC by three different agonists (2-MeSATP, 2-MeSADP, and HT-AMP). The results are summarized in Table I. The C202A mutant receptor showed no activation up to 100 μm concentration of all agonists used in this study. Analogously, the C124A mutant receptor exhibited the same properties, with no increased stimulation of PLC detectable at ≤100 μm agonist.Table IReceptor-stimulated PLC activation ([ 3H]inositol phosphate accumulation) and surface expression assays (ELISA) of wild-type and mutant human P2Y1 receptorsConstructEC50Expression2-MeSATP2-MeSADPHT-AMPnmnmnm%Wild-type4.9 ± 3.32.2 ± 0.51,420 ± 580100 ± 3N-terminal domainC42A21,200 ± 6,50048,000 ± 500>100,00012 ± 4Extracellular loop 1C124ANAaNA, no activation detectable for ≤100 μm agonist.NANA10 ± 1K125A12.9 ± 1.95.9 ± 7.86,600 ± 2,85044 ± 3Extracellular loop 2R195A17.6 ± 14.64.7 ± 0.62,100 ± 680218 ± 3K196A4.0 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.82,660 ± 540175 ± 4K198A5.0 ± 2.817.5 ± 2.12,720 ± 1,350241 ± 3C202ANANANA0 ± 7D204A119 ± 1766.5 ± 11.522,800 ± 3,200183 ± 5D204N1,000 ± 70595 ± 5.0>100,00029 ± 2D204E267 ± 3.4145 ± 15.424,400 ± 5,70081 ± 2D208A27.0 ± 11.63.6 ± 0.71,990 ± 720109 ± 4E209A17,000 ± 8,50017,200 ± 7,400>100,00028 ± 3E209D3.1 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.69,310 ± 5,200127 ± 8E209Q5.1 ± 1.58.6 ± 2.16,410 ± 1,880135 ± 13E209R2.7 ± 0.24.9 ± 1.34,180 ± 32077 ± 3R212A3.9 ± 2.97.8 ± 5.51,810 ± 78093 ± 3Extracellular loop 3R285A33.2 ± 24.59.2 ± 5.42,440 ± 1,530129 ± 3R287A52,100 ± 35,10014,800 ± 2,600>100,000161 ± 4R287K80.9 ± 3.174.9 ± 5.54,210 ± 610193 ± 1R287Q9,670 ± 5,3105,290 ± 360>100,00077 ± 1R287E>100,000>100,000>100,00076 ± 2D289A10.5 ± 7.13.9 ± 0.43,940 ± 28079 ± 13C296A19,600 ± 5,7005,160 ± 920>100,00020 ± 5D300A25.7 ± 12.29.8 ± 0.510,900 ± 770124 ± 3R301A9.0 ± 7.32.6 ± 0.33,480 ± 690111 ± 4Double mutantsE209R/R287E>100,000>100,000>100,000117 ± 4E209A/R287A>100,000>100,000>100,00077 ± 3C42A/C296A2,250 ± 1603,420 ± 1,380>100,0008 ± 5EC50 values are mean values ± S.E. of two to seven independent experiments each done in duplicate.

Maximal stimulation for each receptor was between 2.5- and 4.5-fold over basal. Determination of surface expression represents the average of six to eight experiments. All mutant receptors contained an HA epitope at the N terminus, allowing cell-surface expression levels to be measured by ELISA (TableI). Both C124A and C202A mutant receptors showed strongly diminished surface expression. The C124A mutant receptor was detectable at approximately 10% of the level of the wild-type receptor, whereas the level of the C202A mutant receptor was not significantly different from vector-transfected control. Western blot analyses of membrane fractions prepared from transfected cells showed that these cysteine mutant proteins were expressed in almost equal amounts compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1). These results, together with the lack of agonist-promoted functional activity, suggest that a disulfide bridge between Cys124and Cys202 is critical for proper receptor trafficking of the human P2Y1 receptor to the cell surface. These results are in concordance with previous studies indicating that this conserved disulfide bridge found in the vast majority of GPCRs is important for proper receptor function (11Berthold M. Bartfai T. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above cysteine mutant receptors, the C42A and C296A mutant receptors were activated by 2-MeSADP; however, the 2-MeSADP concentration-response curves were shifted by more than 1000-fold to the right compared with the wild-type receptor. The same relative shift in receptor activation was observed for the two other agonist ligands (Table I), indicating a similar influence on the general recognition of the agonist ligands. The double point mutant C42A/C296A exhibited a similarly impaired response as the single alanine mutants, indicating that the effect of this cysteine substitution is not additive (Fig. 2). Although the expression levels of C42A, C296A, and C42A/C296A mutant receptors were low, activation of PLC was clearly detectable. Control experiments (inositol phospate assay and ELISA) in which the amount of DNA used for transfection was varied showed that the wild-type P2Y1 receptor was significantly stimulated, even at expression rates as low as 10% of the normal expression level attained using 10 μg of DNA. No significant shift in EC50 values was observed with a 10% expression rate of wild-type receptor (Fig. 3, A and B); thus, the EC50 values observed for these three cysteine mutant receptors likely reflect the intrinsic activity of these constructs. Only two positions in EL1 were selected for investigation of their influence on agonist activation of P2Y1 receptors as follows: Cys124 (see above) and Lys125, which is functionally conserved within the P2Y family. The K125A mutant showed no difference compared with the wild-type receptor in agonist-promoted PLC activation. ELISA data for this mutant receptor showed approximately 45% of wild-type receptor expression, indicating that Lys125 does not influence receptor activation. No further mutations were made in EL1, since this loop is presumed to be located distal to the ATP-binding site (6Moro S. Guo D. Camaioni E. Boyer J.L. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Seven positively or negatively charged amino acids and one cysteine residue (see above) are located in EL2. All of these amino acids were mutated individually to alanine. Although R195A, K196A, K198A, D208A, and R212A mutant receptors showed no detectable changes in activation of PLC and were well expressed on the cell surface (Table I), the D204A and E209A mutant receptors behaved much differently. The D204A mutant receptor was activated at 20–25-fold higher agonist concentrations compared with the wild-type receptor. Furthermore, this shift was observed for all agonists, independent of the length of the 5′-phosphate chain. To investigate further the role of Asp204 in receptor activation, we constructed D204E and D204N mutant receptors. Extension of the alkyl carboxylate side chain at position 204 (D204E) further impaired agonist-promoted activation of the receptor, resulting in a 55–65-fold shift of the concentration-response curves. Surprisingly, the relatively small change of a carboxylate to carboxamide in the D204N mutant receptor caused an even greater change (200–270-fold shift in EC50 values) in receptor activation (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast, the E209A mutant receptor exhibited a dramatically different activation pattern. This mutant receptor was activated by >1000-fold higher concentrations of each agonist than the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5 and Table I). The nature of the interaction of this carboxylate side chain with agonists was further tested by additional mutant receptors E209D, E209Q, and E209R. These mutant receptors were fully active and responded in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type receptors (Table I). Beside Cys296 (see above), five charged amino acids were investigated in EL3. The R285A, D289A, D300A, and R301A mutations had no effect on PLC activation, whereas the R287A mutant receptor was activated at more than 1000-fold higher agonist concentrations than wild-type receptors, and the profile of the concentration-response curves was surprisingly similar to that of the E209A mutant receptor (see Fig. 5). Thus, Arg287 was targeted for a more detailed analysis. The R287K, R287Q, and R287E mutant receptors were generated and tested for PLC activation. The R287Q mutant receptor required >1,000-fold higher agonist concentrations for activation of PLC compared with the wild-type receptor, whereas the R287E mutant receptor was not significantly activated by agonist concentrations up to 100 μm. In contrast to these findings, receptor activity could be partially to fully retained by changing Arg287 to lysine. However, the concentration-response curves for the nucleoside diphosphate and triphosphate were shifted to the right (35- and 17-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type receptors), whereas the concentration-response curve for the nucleoside monophosphate was not shifted. Since the E209A and R287A mutant receptors exhibited very similar activation patterns when stimulated with 2-MeSADP (Fig. 5), we tested the hypothesis that a direct interaction between these residues might be required for stabilization of the EL.

As a lipoprotein complex, apohA-I is thought to mediate a variety of functions, including (i) the binding and transport of plasma lipids, (ii) activation of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (1Jonas A. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar), (iii) stimulation of cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues (2Glomset J.A. J.

The later two processes have been called “reverse cholesterol transport” and may account for the inverse relationship observed between plasma high density lipoprotein concentration and the risk of developing coronary artery disease (6Rhoads G.G.

However, it is not clear which of two disparate models best describes the orientation of these helices within the lipoprotein complex. One model positions the helices of apohA-I around the perimeter of a lipid bilayer disc and orients them perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. This “picket fence” model (Fig. 1, right) (11Wald J.H. Goormaghtigh E. De Meutter J. Ruysschaert J.M. Jonas A. J. Biol.

In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, lipoprotein complexes adsorb to supported monolayers and permit one to record polarized internal reflection infrared absorption spectra of oriented complexes (Fig. 1). Since the complexes remain in buffer throughout the measurement, this approach permits a direct spectroscopic study of uniformly oriented lipoprotein complexes under native conditions (25Harris C.C. Hollstein M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The 243-residue wild type apolipoprotein A-I (apohA-I) was purified from human plasma, and a 200-residue NH2-terminal deletion mutant (apoΔ(1–43)A-I) was expressed and purified as described previously (26Cheung P. Chan L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M.

Lipid-free apoproteins were prepared for study by dissolving them in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm HEPES, and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4, then extensively dialyzed using tubing with a 5,000-dalton cutoff to remove the guanidine. Following this, they were dialyzed against a D2O-based buffer (30 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pD = 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride by absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 1.13 and 0.992 ml/(mg·cm) for apohA-1 and apoΔ(1–43)A-1, respectively. Lipoprotein complexes were reconstituted as discoidal lipoproteins using synthetic dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS) from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). The lipid was a mixture of DMPC:DMPS at a 9:1 molar ratio in organic solution, dried with a stream of nitrogen, and then further dried under vacuum for at least 4 h (15Brouillette C.G. Jones J.L. Ng T.C. Kercret H. Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The lipids were resuspended with proteins and 8m guanidine hydrochloride in PBS buffer (0.02 msodium phosphate, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4) and diluted with PBS to a protein concentration of <1 mg/ml. This sample was gently shaken at room temperature for 3–5 h and dialyzed exhaustively against PBS with a 12–14-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane, followed by dialysis against 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with a 50-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane to remove excess free protein. This procedure produced heterogeneously sized particles with two to three discrete complexes between 10 and 13 nm in diameter as confirmed by native gradient gel electrophoresis. Homogeneously sized particles were produced by detergent dialysis (27Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), followed by gel filtration to remove excess free protein. Prior to spectroscopic study, the optically clear solution was dialyzed against 100 ml of 30 mm HEPES, pD 7.4, D2O buffer. This procedure yielded homogeneously sized particles of approximately 7.8 nm in diameter that migrated as a single band before and after prolonged exposure to 1 mm Ca2+. The concentrations of DMPS used in these experiments are well below the threshold at which nonliquid lipid phases would be induced by 1 mmCa2+ (29Hoekstra D. Biochem. 1982; 21: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Polarized attenuated total internal reflection Fourier-transform (PATIR-FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a previously described instrument (19Axelsen P.H. Braddock W.D. Brockman H.L. Jones C.M. Dluhy R.A. Kaufman B.K. Puga F.J.I. Appl. Spectrosc. 1995; 49: 526-531Crossref Google Scholar), modified such that the internal reflection crystal is applied flat onto a monolayer at the air-water interface in a Langmuir trough (23Wimley W.C.

The angle of incidence between the IR beam and the crystal surface was 30°. The internal reflection crystal was treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane to render the surface hydrophobic (19Axelsen P.H.

All spectra (1024 co-added interferograms) were collected at room temperature, using a Bio-Rad FTS-60A spectrometer in rapid-scanning mode, a liquid-nitrogen-cooled MCT detector, a resolution of 2 cm−1, triangular apodization, and one level of zero filling. Base-line single-beam spectra were recorded immediately before the addition of 10 μg of lipoprotein complex or lipid-free apoprotein to a continuously stirred buffer subphase (30 mm HEPES in D2O, pD 7.4). The volume of the subphase was 6.0 ml, making the protein concentration approximately 60 and 70 nm for apohA-1 and apoΔ(1–43)A-1, respectively. The supported monolayers consisted of 80 mol % DMPC and 20 mol % DMPS. Phospholipid concentrations were assayed colorimetrically (31Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sets of parallel and perpendicular spectra were analyzed simultaneously using “IRfit” (24Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When hA-1 and Δ(1–43)A-1 lipoprotein complexes were injected into a subphase buffer containing 1 mm Ca2+, spectroscopic signals developed and slowly reached an intensity plateau over approximately 60 min. Because the total cross-sectional area of all the complexes (assuming 130 nm diameter) corresponding to 10 μg of protein is less than the surface area of the trough (approximately 90 cm2), the signal plateau most likely corresponds to adsorption of the entire injected sample onto the monolayer, and it is unlikely the lipoprotein complexes have “stacked” on the support membrane. Irrespective of whether the complexes are stacked, however, conclusions drawn below with respect to the relative orientation of protein and lipid components remain valid. Representative infrared spectra of the hA-1 lipoprotein complex are shown in Fig. 2, a andb; spectra of the Δ(1–43)A-1 complex are similar. The lipid components are seen as bands at 2920 cm−1 from the antisymmetric CH2stretch, at 2850 cm−1 from the symmetric CH2stretch, and at 1740 cm−1 from the ester C = O stretch. Amide I from the protein component is maximal at 1645 cm−1, consistent with an α-helical conformation, while amide II at 1550 cm−1 (off scale in Fig. 2b) is not detectable. The absence of an amide II band at 1550 cm−1 indicates that H → D exchange is virtually complete. When lipid-free apohA-I or apoΔ(1–43)A-1 was introduced into a subphase buffer containing 1 mm Ca2+, an amide I signal developed over a similar period of time as did the lipoprotein complexes, and their amplitudes were comparable with those of the complexes. The amide I absorption maximum occurred at 1645 cm−1, but there were no characteristic lipid absorption signals (Fig. 2c). Bands originating from the supported monolayer are not seen because they are part of the background spectrum collected prior to introduction of the complexes. When calcium was omitted from the subphase, the signal arising after the introduction of lipoprotein complexes into the subphase was negligible. This demonstrates that freely diffusing complexes do not contribute to the spectroscopic signal. In contrast, omitting Ca2+ from the subphase buffer reduced the signal from the apoproteins by only 50%. This is important control information, because it indicates that the preparation of lipoprotein complexes used in these experiments is effectively free of apoprotein. If this were not true, we would have detected an amide I absorption when the lipoprotein complexes were examined in the absence of Ca2+. From the polarized absorption spectra, dichroic ratiosR z = ∫A ∥/∫A ⊥ were evaluated using integrated areas of characteristic absorption bands, ∫A, as described elsewhere (24Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dichroic ratios were converted to order parameters, S(R z), according to Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3.

Angle brackets indicate mean values, P2(x) = (3x 2 − 1)/2 is the second-order Legendre polynomial, which relates to order parameters according toS x = 〈P2(cos x)〉, θ is the angle between the molecular axis and the vibrational transition moment, γ is the angle between the molecular axis and the surface normal, and ξ is the angle representing the orientation of the monolayer surface with respect to the crystal surface (the mosaic spread) (30Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An order parameter of 1.0 indicates a uniform orientation perpendicular to the membrane surface, while a value of −0.5 indicates a uniform orientation parallel to the membrane. An order parameter of 0.0 may indicate either a uniform orientation at the magic angle (54.7° relative to the surface normal), complete disorder as in an isotropic system, or any other orientation distribution for which 〈cos2 γ〉 = 1/3. S(R z) values between −0.45 and −0.41 were obtained for the symmetric methylene stretching mode at ∼2850 cm−1 in the lipoprotein complexes (TableI). S θ = −0.5, because this mode is oriented 90° from the acyl chain axis, andS ξ < 1.0, because there will always be some mosaic spread due to imperfections in the crystal support. Therefore the molecular order of the lipid acyl chains in the complexes S γ =S(Rz)/S θ·S ξ) ≥ 0.82. This is close to the maximum possible value of 1.0, and it indicates that the discoidal lipoprotein complexes are highly ordered on the monolayer surface with their acyl chains oriented perpendicular to the surface. In the same spectra, we find that the antisymmetric methylene stretching mode (at 2920 cm−1) is also highly ordered and similarly oriented.Table IOrder parameters obtained for the apoproteins and their lipid complexesVibrational bandHeterogeneous apohA-I complexes (n = 5)Heterogeneous apoΔ(1–43)A-I complexes (n = 5)Homogeneous small apoΔ(1–43)A-I complex (n = 43)Amide I (∼1645 cm−1)Rz1.62 ± 0.121.53 ± 0.191.36 ± 0.04S(Rz)−0.19 ± 0.04−0.22 ± 0.06−0.28 ± 0.02Tilt angle of helix axis67–90°70–90°71–90°CH2 symmetric stretch (∼2852 cm−1)Rz0.98 ± 0.111.03 ± 0.090.95 ± 0.02S(Rz)−0.43 ± 0.05−0.41 ± 0.04−0.45 ± 0.01Tilt angle of acyl chain0–18°0–20°0–15°Order parameters were calculated using the “two-phase” approximation because the proteins are not actually embedded within a thin film, and because it yields results that are numerically identical to the “thin film” approximation for methylene stretching modes when they lie in the plane of the membrane (20Axelsen P.H.

This does not, however, change any principal conclusions. S(R z) was −0.19 for the amide I band at ∼1650 cm-1 in the heterogenous apohA-I complexes, −0.22 for the apoΔ(1–43)A-I complexes, and −0.28 for the homogeneously sized small complexes (Table I). The difference between the heterogenous apohA-I complexes and the homogeneously sized small complexes is statistically significant, and it suggests that the first 43 residues of apohA-I may not be aligned with the remainder of the protein. The difference between the heterogeneous and the homogeneous apoΔ(1–43)A-I complexes is not statistically significant, and differences in the order of the methylene stretching modes suggests that the appearance of some change in amide I transition order may be due to the smaller complexes simply being more uniformly oriented. Estimates of S θ range from 0.53 to 0.83 for right-handed α-helices (30Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and S ξ > 0.82 from the preceding paragraph. Therefore −0.5 ≤S γ −0.28 for α-helices in the heterogenous complexes, and −0.5 ≤ S γ −0.34 for the smaller homogeneous complexes. When molecular orientations are uniform, order parameters may be re-interpreted as “tilt angles” (30Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This view assigns a tilt angle between 0° and 20° from the membrane normal to the lipid acyl chains and between 67° and 90° to the protein helices. These results have several important implications. First, they show that lipid molecules within these complexes are highly ordered, as in a bilayer membrane with its surface oriented parallel to the monolayer support. Second, they show that the protein component of these complexes is preferentially oriented parallel to the surface of the lipid bilayer as in the belt model (Fig. 1, left). Third, they show that complexes made with apoΔ(1–43)A-I (for which a crystal structure is available) yield results that are similar to those made with apohA-I. The apoΔ(1–43)A-I crystal structure is a homotetramer of predominantly helical amphiphilic segments in the shape of a bent elliptical ring. With simple and plausible manipulations, one may transform a pair of these segments into a circular ring (10Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) with a hydrophobic inner circumference and a diameter of 7.8 nm (the same as that of the small homogeneously sized complexes examined in this report). A ring of this size is well suited to encircle 60 lipid molecules per protein segment in the manner prescribed by the belt model and to explain all of the experimental results reported herein. Our measurements were made on complexes under conditions that do not denature the protein or disrupt the complexes (25Harris C.C. Hollstein M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). In contrast, the earlier study of apolipoprotein A-I on which the picket fence model has been based was performed on complexes that had been dried onto a crystal surface as a multibilayer film (13Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By drying the complexes, one forfeits control over conditions such as ionic strength and pH and risks denaturing the protein and/or disrupting the complexes, because the hydrophobic effect is largely responsible for their stability. Although the film is partially rehydrated by exposure to water vapor, relatively few water molecules are actually present (32White S.H. Wiener M.C. Disalvo E.A. Simon S.A. Permeability and Stability of Lipid Bilayers. CRC Press, New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar), and preparations of this type yield spectroscopic results that differ from lipid monolayers and bilayers in ways that suggest denaturation and/or aggregation (22Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 96: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In summary, our results unambiguously support the belt model of lipoprotein A-I structure and refute the picket fence model (Fig. 1). The data were obtained using an approach that combines internal reflection infrared spectroscopy and Langmuir film balance technology and is advantageous because it provides an abundance of quantitative structural information about protein-lipid interactions under conditions that are unlikely to disrupt the complexes or denature the protein component.

A great deal of evidence is now available to indicate that phosphorylation of the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides is a critical step in many intracellular signaling pathways activated by insulin and growth factors (1Shepherd P.R.

A family of phosphoinositide (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide. 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide.3-kinases have been identified that are capable of phosphorylating the D-3 position of the inositol head group (3Domin J.

Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Of these, the class Ia PI 3-kinases have been most intensely studied, and enzymes in this class all possess a catalytic subunit tightly associated with an adapter subunit containing two SH2 domains. The binding of these SH2 domains to specific phosphotyrosine containing peptide motifs facilitates recruitment of class Ia PI 3-kinases into receptor tyrosine kinase-induced signaling complexes and thus provides the most clearly identified mechanism by which growth factors can regulate PI 3-kinase activity. However, the ability of growth factors to regulate PI 3-kinase activity via other classes of PI 3-kinase has not been extensively studied. The class II PI 3-kinases represent a novel group of PI 3-kinases characterized by the presence of a C2 domain at the C terminus. These were originally cloned from Drosophila (5MacDougall L.K.

The in vitro substrate specificity of all the class II PI 3-kinases is similar in that they prefer phosphatidylinositol as a substrate but they also phosphorylate PI 4-phosphate under certain conditions. However, the class II PI 3-kinases do not phosphorylate PI 4,5-bisphosphate. The class II PI 3-kinase isoforms can be distinguished pharmacologically because PI3K-C2α is relatively resistant to the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (7Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A.

The role of class II PI 3-kinases in the cell and how they might be involved in signaling cascades is poorly understood, and it is clearly of interest to determine whether these enzymes can be activated or recruited to signaling complexes by different agonists. In this regard there are reports that the activity of class II PI 3-kinases can be increased by stimuli using heterotrimeric G-protein-linked signaling pathways. The chemokine MCP-1 induces a transient activation of PI3K-C2α via a Gαi-linked mechanism in monocytes (13Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas platelet aggregation induces a transient activation of PI3K-C2β (14Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies have not addressed the question of whether class II PI 3-kinases are stimulated following activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We have therefore investigated the regulation of PI3K-C2α and PI3K-C2β by insulin in a range of cell types. These studies show that although PI3K-C2α was not activated by insulin in HEK293 cells, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, or L5L6 myoblasts, there was a 2–3-fold increase in activity of PI3K-C2α in fully differentiated L5L6 myotubes, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors (CHO-IR) cells. PI3K-C2β was not activated by insulin in HEK 293 cells and only poorly activated in transfected CHO-IR cells. PI3K-C2α existed as a doublet in all cells tested. In the cells in which insulin activates PI3K-C2α, insulin also caused a redistribution from the lower molecular weight band to the higher molecular weight band. This suggests that insulin was stimulating phosphorylation of PI3K-C2α. Consistent with this, in vitro phosphatase treatment reduced the intensity of the upper band back to that seen in unstimulated cells. The ratio of the upper and lower bands was not altered in the HEK 293 cells in which PI3K-C2α was not stimulated. These findings suggest that insulin-induced phosphorylation could play a role in regulation of the activity of PI3K-C2α. The finding that PI3K-C2α is activated by insulin in cell culture models of physiologically relevant insulin target tissues raises the possibility that in addition to class Ia PI 3-kinases, class II PI 3-kinases also play a role in insulin signaling pathways.

PI3K-C2α antibodies were raised to a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 2–337 of the human PI 3KC2α sequence. The PI3K-C2α expression construct was in PBK-CMV, and the PI3K-C2β expression construct was cloned into pCDNA3.1. Both contained a Glu tag at the N terminus. The Myc-tagged IRS-1 was supplied by Dr. J. Whitehead (Cambridge University). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method, and CHO-IR cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). For protein analysis and PI 3-kinase assays, cells were serum-starved for 16 h prior to insulin stimulation and then treated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min (unless otherwise stated) at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 supplemented with 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 ng/ml leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate. Where indicated immunoprecipitates were incubated with 200 units of λ-protein phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of cell lysate were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% gel with an 80:1 ratio of bis-acrylamide:acrylamide (National Diagnostics) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride for Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations were performed from the Triton-soluble fraction using the indicated antibodies, and PI 3-kinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates with phosphatidylinositol (Lipid Products, Redhill, Surrey, UK) as a substrate using methods previously described (15Navé B.T.

TLC plates and radiolabeled Western blots were analyzed using Fuji FLA-2000 phosphorimager, whereas Western blots visualized with ECL were analyzed us a Fuji LAS1000 chemiluminesence imager. The current study aimed to determine whether class II PI 3-kinases are activated following insulin stimulation. Initial studies found that all the cell types used in the current study express PI3K-C2α (data not shown). Insulin causes a 2–3-fold increase in the PI 3-kinase activity present in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from CHO-IR cells, L5L6 myotubes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in immunoprecipitates from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, undifferentiated L5L6 myoblasts, or HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1). In the case of 3T3-L1 cells, the levels of PI3K-C2α protein and PI 3-kinase activity in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from fibroblasts into adipocytes were very similar, increasing only 2-fold during differentiation. Therefore the lack of insulin stimulation of PI3K-C2α in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts is not due to a deficiency of PI3K-C2α. To show that the observed activation of PI3K-C2α was not an artifact of the antibody used, Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α was transiently expressed in CHO-IR cells, and the expressed protein was specifically immunoprecipitated via the epitope tag. The transiently transfected PI3K-C2α was stimulated by insulin to a similar extent to that of the endogenous enzyme (data not shown). Of the cells studied only the human-derived HEK 293 cells express detectable levels of PI3K-C2β (data not shown). However, as for PI3K-C2α, insulin did not cause an increase in the activity of the endogenous PI3K-C2β in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). Therefore PI3K-C2β was transiently expressed in CHO-IR cells to study the effects of insulin on this isoform and to compare it with the effects on PI3K-C2α. In CHO-IR cells insulin consistently induced only a very small (1.22-fold ± 0.12) increase in the activity of the PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1). One explanation for this is that PI3K-C2β may be genuinely less able to be activated by insulin, although an alternative explanation could be that insulin is activating only a small part of the total pool of PI3K-C2β. It is also possible that because PI3K-C2β is not normally expressed in the CHO cells, the cellular machinery necessary for its activation may be absent. Therefore these data do not preclude the possibility that insulin or other growth factors may activate PI3K-C2β to a greater extent in appropriate cell types. However, as insulin clearly activated the cellular pool of PI3K-C2α, we chose to further study this isoform. The insulin-induced increase in PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates was rapid reaching nearly maximum activation within 1 min (Fig. 2A). We also find that the activation was observed at doses as low as 1 nm insulin with near full activation at 10 nm insulin in CHO-IR cells (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the activation of PI3K-C2α is likley to occur in physiological contexts. We next used the inhibitor wortmannin to determine whether contamination by class Ia PI 3-kinases or PI3K-C2β was contributing to the insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates. The class Ia PI 3-kinases and PI3K-C2β are at least 1 order or magnitude more sensitive to wortmannin than the PI3K-C2α (7Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Our studies show that there is no contamination by class Ia PI 3-kinases or PI3K-C2β in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates because the PI 3-kinase activity found in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from basal or insulin-stimulated cells was resistant to wortmannin (IC50>100 nm), whereas the PI 3-kinase activity present in antiphosphotyrosine or anti p85 immunoprecipitates had the characteristics of class Ia PI 3-kinase activity because it was sensitive to wortmannin (IC50 = ∼10 nm) (Fig. 3). Overall these results provide strong evidence that insulin actually increases the catalytic activity of the PI3K-C2α in CHO-IR cells, L5L6 myotubes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Figure 3Characterization of wortmannin sensitivity of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase fractions. Serum-starved CHO-IR cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min, and cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) using an antibody to either the p85α adapter subunit of class Ia PI 3-kinase, the PY99 antiphosphotyrosine antibody, or an antibody specific for PI3K-C2α.

Binding of Ca2+ or phospholipid to the C2 domains can play a role in regulating protein function (16Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), making this a potential candidate to explain growth factor regulation of class II PI 3-kinases. Indeed there is evidence that this domain is involved in regulating the activity of class II PI 3-kinases because deletion of this domain in PI3K-C2β increases catalytic activity (10Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R. Watton S.J. Layton M.J. Gout I. Ahmadi K. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further, a recent report has indicated that PI3K-C2β is activated following platelet aggregation by a mechanism that is blocked by addition of calpain inhibitors, suggesting a calcium regulated pathway (14Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it appears unlikely that a similar mechanism operates in the case of insulin activation because we only see a very weak activation of PI3K-C2β by insulin. Further we find calpain inhibitors do not block the ability of insulin to activate PI3K-C2α (data not shown), and previous studies demonstrate that insulin does not acutely increase cytosolic free calcium levels (17Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 247: E297-E304Google Scholar, 18Klip A. Ramlal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9141-9146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cheung J.Y. Constantine J.M. Bonaventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C163-C172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making it unlikely that a calcium-dependent mechanism is involved. It has also been reported that the chemokine MCP-1 activates PI3K-C2α via a Gαi-linked signaling pathway (13Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the insulin-induced activation of PI3K-C2α acts via this mechanism because there is no evidence that insulin acts via heterotrimeric G-proteins. Therefore, the mechanism by which insulin activates PI3K-C2α is unclear. In the case of class Ia PI 3-kinases, insulin stimulation causes phosphorylation of tyrosines in YMXM motifs in IRS proteins that results in SH2 domain-mediated recruitment of the PI 3-kinase. This interaction both increases the activity of the PI 3-kinase (20Herbst J.L. Andrews G. Contillo L. Lamphere L. Gardner J. Lienhard G.E. Gibbs E.M.

Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,22Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ricort J.M.

Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is clear that PI3K-C2α does not form a tight complex with the insulin receptor because in PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells no tyrosine phosphorylated bands are observed at 95 kDa, which would correspond to the insulin receptor (Fig. 4A). However, these co-immunoprecipitation experiments do suggest that the PI3K-C2α associates with two tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, one of 207 kDa and the other of 160 kDa (Fig. 4A). The intensity of the 207-kDa phosphotyrosine band is similar in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation level of this protein by the insulin receptor is not the mechanism by which insulin controls the activity of PI3K-C2α. The identity of the 207-kDa phosphoprotein is currently unknown, but the fact that the Drosophilahomologue of PI 3-kinase C2 also associates with a tyrosine phosphorylated protein of a similar size (6Molz L. Chen Y. Hirano M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13892-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) indicates this may represent a protein important in the regulation of members of the class II PI 3-kinases. The 160-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein is only associated with PI3K-C2α following insulin stimulation, suggesting that it could play a role in regulating the activity of this enzyme. At first appearance the size of the band suggested it might represent IRS-1, although several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. Firstly, although we clearly see an increase in wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase activity in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations after insulin stimulation (Fig. 3A), no significant amount of wortmannin-resistant PI 3-kinase activity is observed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from either basal or insulin-stimulated cells. Because the activity in PI3K-C2α is clearly resistant to wortmannin (Fig. 3), this suggests that PI3K-C2α is not recruited to the same complexes as class Ia PI 3-kinase. Secondly, Western blotting revealed that no IRS-1 or IRS-2 was present in the PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates from stimulated CHO-IR cells (data not shown), and transient transfection of CHO-IR cells with a Myc-tagged IRS-1 construct and subsequent immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 via the Myc tag also failed to reveal any association of PI3K-C2α with IRS-1 (data not shown). The above clearly indicates that the mechanism of activation of PI3K-C2α is distinct from that of the class Ia PI 3-kinases. We cannot exclude the possibility that the 207- and 160-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins may play a role in regulating the activity of PI3K-C2α, but further progress on this issue will await the identification of these proteins. Immunoblots of PI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates blotted back with PI3K-C2α antibody consistently revealed two bands of 193 and 195 kDa, respectively, in all cell types tested (Fig. 4B). One possibility is that these could represent a bandshift due to the presence of two differently phosphorylated forms of the PI3K-C2α. This is supported by the finding that in CHO-IR cells insulin causes the intensity of the lower band to decrease and the intensity of the upper band to increase (Fig. 4B). To quantitate this, the results of seven observations from four independent experiments were compared by calculating the intensity of each band as a percentage of the combined intensity of the upper and lower bands. This showed that in the basal state 27 ± 4% of PI3K-C2α immunoreactivity was in the upper band, and following insulin stimulation this increased to 46 ± 3%. This represents a 1.7-fold increase in the proportion of PI3K-C2α in the higher molecular weight form. The phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells returned the ratio of the bands back to that seen in the basal state (Fig. 4B). Identical results were seen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not shown). In HEK293 cells PI3K-C2α activity did not increase with insulin stimulation (Fig. 1). In these cells a significant proportion of the PI3K-C2α was present in the upper band in unstimulated cells, and there was no appreciable change in the ratio of the upper and lower bands following insulin stimulation (Fig. 4C). Therefore the changes in the proportion of PI3K-C2α in the upper band in response to insulin correlates well with changes in the activity of PI3K-C2α, with a band shift being observed in cells in which PI3K-C2α was stimulated but not in those in which it was not. Conversely, Western blots of PI3K-C2β from unstimulated cells show only a single band, and this was not altered by insulin stimulation of CHO-IR cells transiently transfected with PI3K-C2β (Fig. 4D). In summary these results clearly indicate that insulin causes a rapid activation of PI3K-C2α, which is consistent with a role in downstream signaling. Further, the mechanism of activation of PI3K-C2α differs from that of class Ia PI 3-kinases and may involve insulin-induced phosphorylation of the PI3K-C2α. Given the important role of D-3 phosphoinositides in insulin signaling, these findings suggest that PI3K-C2α is a novel downstream effector in insulin signaling cascade, although the end point effects that this is involved in regulating remain unknown."

NifS acts on both l-cysteine and l-selenocysteine (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 2Lacourciere G.M.

Several enzymes participating in sulfur metabolism also act on the selenium analogs of the substrates (3Stadtman T.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 48: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SCL exclusively decomposesl-selenocysteine. Selenium is specifically metabolized by such enzymes as selenophosphate synthetase (4Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol.

We have found that the peptide sequences obtained from the proteolysate of SCL are similar to those of NifS proteins. 2H. Mihara, T. Kurihara, T. Yoshimura, and N. Esaki, unpublished results. However, a gene encoding SCL has not been cloned yet, and the physiological role of the enzyme remains to be investigated.

However, the exact roles of thenifS-like genes in these non-nitrogen-fixing organisms have not been clarified, and it is possible that some of these NifS homologs act physiologically as selenocysteine-specific enzymes (e.g.SCL) to facilitate the selenophosphate synthesis, as proposed by Lacourciere and Stadtman (2Lacourciere G.M.

CSD exhibits both selenocysteine lyase and cysteine desulfurase activities in addition to cysteine sulfinate desulfinase activity, and the enzyme is distinct from A. vinelandii NifS in its amino acid sequence, absorption spectrum, and lack of cysteine residues catalytically essential for the decomposition of l-selenocysteine (16Mihara H.

The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into pUC118, and then the resultant expression plasmid, pCSDB, was introduced into E. coli JM109 competent cells. The enzyme was assayed in 0.12 mTricine-NaOH buffer at pH 7.5. The enzymatic activities towardl-selenocysteine and l-cysteine were measured with lead acetate as described previously (16Mihara H.

Sulfite produced from l-cysteine sulfinic acid was determined with fuchsin (26Leinweber F.-J. Monty K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Production of alanine from substrates was determined with a Beckman 7300 high performance amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Specific activity was expressed as units/mg of protein, with 1 unit of enzyme defined as the amount that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of the product in 1 min. Purification was carried out at 0–4 °C, and potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.4) was used as the buffer throughout the purification. E. coli JM109 cells harboring pCSDB were grown in 9 liters of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 mm KPB, and disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (25–50% saturation). The enzyme was dissolved in 10 mm KPB and dialyzed against the same buffer. The enzyme was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (3 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After the column was washed with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a 0.8-liter linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in the buffer. The active fractions were pooled (110 ml) and concentrated by ultrafiltration through an Advantec UP-20 membrane (Advantec, Naha, Japan). The enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm buffer containing 0.65m ammonium sulfate and applied to a Phenyl-Toyopearl column (3 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 0.7-liter linear gradient of 0.65–0.3 mammonium sulfate in the buffer, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated as above. The enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm buffer and applied to a Gigapite column (3 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of 10–150 mm KPB, and the active fractions were collected and concentrated. The final preparation was further concentrated with Centriprep-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to a volume of 2.7 ml. Purification of CSD fromE. coli JM109 transformed with a plasmid pCSD1 containing the csdA gene was performed as described previously (16Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Kurihara, T. Yoshimura, and N. Esaki, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, theiscS gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the Kohara miniset clone No. 430 (25Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) as a template and inserted into the NdeI and HindIII sites in pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to yield pEF1. IscS was isolated from BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells harboring pEF1 by sonication, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography with Phenyl-Toyopearl, DEAE-Toyopearl, Butyl-Toyopearl, Gigapite, and Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) columns. Protein was quantified by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using Protein Assay CBB solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of the purified enzyme was determined with the value εM = 4.8 × 104m−1·cm−1 at 280 nm, which was calculated from the content of tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine (28Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The subunit and the native M r of CsdB were determined by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and gel filtration with Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), respectively. The PLP content of the enzyme was determined fluorometrically with KCN according to the method of Adams (30Adams E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Crystals of CsdB were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Each droplet was prepared by mixing 5 μl of 20 mg/ml enzyme in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.4) with an equal volume of each reservoir solution of the Crystal Screen™ (Hampton Research, CA) initially and of a modified reservoir solution subsequently. The yellow crystals of CsdB were mounted in glass capillaries with the crystallographic c* axis along the rotation axis of the spindle and subjected to x-ray experiments. Native data for structure determination were collected at 20 °C with a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC imaging plate detector using double focusing mirror-monochromated CuK α radiation that was generated with a 0.3-mm focal cup of an x-ray generator RU300 (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The crystal-to-detector distance was set to 130.0 mm. Data reduction was carried out using the R-AXIS IIC software package. For the production of a large amount of CsdB, expression plasmids were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with chromosomal DNA isolated from E. coliK-12. The nucleotide sequence of csdB in the expression vector (pCSDB) was confirmed to be identical with that registered in GenBank™ accession number D90811 (open reading frame o320#17). The clone provided overexpression of the cloned gene: about 10% of the total protein in the extract of E. coli JM109 recombinant cells. In the representative purification (TableI), about 8 mg of homogeneous preparation of CsdB was obtained per liter of culture.Table IPurification of CsdBStepTotal proteinTotal activityaDetermined with l-selenocysteine as a substrate.Specific activityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits/mg-fold%Crude extract310016000.521100Ammonium sulfate10009200.921.858DEAE-Toyopearl3708902.44.656Phenyl-Toyopearl854305.19.827Gigapite703905.61124a Determined with l-selenocysteine as a substrate. Open table in a new tab CsdB provided a single band corresponding to the M r of 43,000 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme, MIFSVDKVRA, agreed with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of csdB. The M rof the native enzyme was determined to be 88,000 by gel filtration. Consequently, the enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical subunits. The spectrophotometric properties of the enzyme were very similar to those of CSD with an absorption maximum at 420 nm (Fig. 2) at pH 7.4. No significant changes in the absorption spectrum were observed in the range of pH 6–8. This absorption peak is characteristic of PLP enzymes, which contain the cofactor bound to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue at the active site. However, CsdB is distinct from either of two A. vinelandii proteins, NifS and IscS, and also from IscS of E. coli, all of which have an absorption maximum around 390 nm (15Zheng L. White R.H.

Reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in a decrease in the absorption peak at 420 nm with a concomitant increase in the absorbance at 335 nm (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with that this is a PLP enzyme. The PLP content of CsdB was determined to be 1.0 mol per mol of subunit by the fluorometric method (30Adams E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Figure 2Absorption spectra of CsdB. The conditions were as follows: 10 mm KPB, pH 7.4, 25 °C, 0.64 mg/ml of the enzyme.

The production of elemental selenium and elemental sulfur froml-selenocysteine and l-cysteine, respectively, in the reaction was confirmed in the same manner as reported previously (31Esaki N. Karai N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The optimal pH value for the removal of selenium froml-selenocysteine was between 6.5 and 7.5 in Tricine-NaOH or Mes buffer. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is summarized in Table II; l-selenocysteine was the best substrate followed by l-cysteine sulfinic acid and l-cysteine, in that order. The specific activity of CsdB on l-selenocysteine (5.5 units/mg) was comparable with that of CSD and IscS (Table III) but was about 7 times lower than that of SCL (37 units/mg) (8Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine desulfurase activity of CsdB was about 2 and 5% of that of CSD and IscS, respectively, at a substrate concentration of 12 mm(Table III). The specific activity of CsdB for l-cysteine was about 1/290 of the activity with l-selenocysteine (Table III). This value is much lower than those of CSD and IscS (TableIII). In contrast with CsdB, A. vinelandii NifS favorsl-cysteine as a substrate over its selenium analog (2Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30921-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CsdB acted on l-cystine, l-selenocystine, andl-aspartic acid, although at extremely low rates (<0.08% of the rate for l-selenocysteine) (Table II).Table IISubstrate specificity of CsdBSubstrateSpecific activityaActivity was measured in the reaction buffer containing one of the following substrates:l-selenocysteine, 12 mm; l-cysteine sulfinic acid, 12 mm; l-cysteine, 12 mm; l-selenocystine, 20 mm;l-cystine, 20 mm; l-aspartic acid, 20 mm.Relative activityunits/mg%l-Selenocysteine5.5100l-Cysteine sulfinic acid0.8215l-Cysteine0.0190.35l-Selenocystine0.00440.080l-Cystine0.00310.056l-Aspartic acid0.00440.080The following amino acids were inert as the substrates when production of alanine was examined in the reaction mixture containing 10 mm substrate at 37 °C for 12 h:d-selenocysteine, d-cysteine,d-selenocystine, d-cystine,dl-kynurenine, l-djenkolic acid,dl-selenocysteamine,S-benzyl-l-cysteine.a Activity was measured in the reaction buffer containing one of the following substrates:l-selenocysteine, 12 mm; l-cysteine sulfinic acid, 12 mm; l-cysteine, 12 mm; l-selenocystine, 20 mm;l-cystine, 20 mm; l-aspartic acid, 20 mm.

CsdB was crystallized at 25 °C within 2 days by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a 100 mm cacodylate solution (pH 6.8) containing 1.4 m sodium acetate, which corresponds to the solution No.7 in the Crystal Screen™. The crystals were also obtained in 100 mm KPB (pH 6.8) containing 1.4m sodium acetate and 10 μm PLP, and these conditions were further used for the crystallization of the enzyme. The yellow crystals (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.4 mm3) had tetragonal-bipyramidal shapes (Fig. 3). They were grown in amorphous debris, which was removed from the crystals before they were sealed in thin-walled glass capillaries. The space group of the CsdB wasP43212 with the cell dimensions ofa = b = 128.1 Å, and c= 137.0 Å. The assumption that a single dimer (89 kDa) exists in the asymmetric unit of the crystal gives a Vm value of 3.19 Å3/Da, which is equivalent to a solvent content of 62%. These values lie within the range of values commonly found for proteins (32Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). A set of native data was collected to 2.8 Å resolution on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC using 1.5° oscillation over a range of 45° (94.2% complete with 23,770 independent reflections). TheR merge value for the intensity data was 7.22%. The data collection statistics obtained for the native CsdB crystals are given in Table IV.

Open table in a new tab We also obtained crystals of CSD at 25 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a 100 mm sodium acetate solution (pH 4.6) containing 200 mm ammonium acetate and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. However, these crystals were small and not suitable for x-ray analysis. Further optimization of crystallization conditions by changing pH, polyethylene glycol concentration, and salt has resulted in little improvement. Grishin et al. (33Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) classified PLP enzymes into seven distinct fold types on the basis of primary structure, secondary structure prediction, and biochemical function. NifS proteins have been classified as “aminotransferases class V” in the fold type I together with serine-pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51), phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52), isopenicillin N epimerase, and the small subunit of the soluble hydrogenase.

Jansonius, unpublished results. were solved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, with the codes 1BT4 and 1BJN, respectively. Comparison of the structures of phosphoserine aminotransferases with that of CsdB will contribute to the understanding of how the related proteins confer separate reaction specificities on the same coenzyme. The reaction of CsdB shares some common features with that of other PLP-dependent enzymes such as aspartate β-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.12) (34Tate S.S. Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1971; 35: 503-543PubMed Google Scholar), kynureninase (EC 3.7.1.3) (35Soda K. Tanizawa K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 49: 1-40PubMed Google Scholar), and SCL. These enzymes catalyze removal of β-substituent from the substrate to form alanine. None of their structures have been solved. The solution of the three-dimensional structure of CsdB would contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of these PLP-dependent enzymes. Genome sequencing projects have revealed that homologs of A. vinelandii nifS are widespread throughout nature and that some organisms contain more than one copy of a nifS homolog (16Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Some of the “NifS-like proteins” characterized so far preferl-cysteine to l-selenocysteine, and some of them show the opposite preference. Further experiments will need to be done to determine whether putative NifS-like proteins can play a role in Fe-S cluster assembly. Lacourciere and Stadtman (2Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30921-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have pointed out that in vivoconcentrations of sulfur-containing compounds are on the order of a thousand times greater than those of their selenium analogs (36Sliwkowski M.X. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3140-3144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, enzymes showing higher activity toward l-cysteine, such asA. vinelandii NifS, will preferentially utilizel-cysteine over l-selenocysteine in vivo (2Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30921-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be reasonable to assume that enzymes which are specific toward l-selenocysteine probably function as a physiological selenide delivery system in E. coli. Although CsdB is not strictly specific to selenocysteine, its discrimination factor (290 times over the activity on cysteine) is much higher than those of other NifS homologs of E. coli. Accordingly, the enzyme can be regarded as an E. colicounterpart of mammalian selenocysteine lyase. It would be particularly intriguing to determine whether CsdB is more effective than CSD and IscS as a selenide delivery protein in the formation of selenophosphate catalyzed by E. coli selenophosphate synthetase. Thein vivo function of CsdB is now being studied by disrupting its gene.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2378-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we purified Drosophila mtSSB and studied its effects in in vitro DNA synthesis by pol γ, in an assay that mimics lagging DNA strand synthesis in mitochondrial replication (9Thommes P.

These studies allowed the first demonstration of stimulation by a mtSSB of DNA synthesis by a near-homogeneous pol γ. Our biochemical data are consistent with an important role for mtSSB in mitochondrial DNA replication that has been documented genetically by the fact that a null mutation in the gene for the yeast homolog (RIM1) results in complete loss of mitochondrial DNAin vivo (7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found thatDrosophila mtSSB stimulates pol γ by a mechanism highly similar to that which we found for E. coli SSB (9Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

Here we demonstrate a dual role for mtSSB in initiation and elongation of DNA strand synthesis catalyzed by pol γ, and evaluate for the first time the effects of mtSSB on the mispair-specific 3′ → 5′ exonuclease in pol γ.DISCUSSIONWe have evaluated mechanistically the effects of mtSSB on the catalytic activities of pol γ under in vitro conditions that mimic lagging DNA strand synthesis in mitochondrial replication. Our finding that mtSSB stimulates similarly both the DNA polymerase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities of pol γ over a broad range of KCl concentrations suggests functional coordination of the two activities at the replication fork. In evaluating 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity, we measured specific mispair hydrolysis on oligonucleotide-primed ssDNA. At the replication fork, the growing 3′-terminus is paired to the template strand that is coated with mtSSB (23Van Tuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, coordination of DNA polymerase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease in pol γ is anticipated in the catalysis of proofreading DNA synthesis that is required to ensure replication fidelity, and our results support this. In fact, that mispair hydrolysis is specifically stimulated by mtSSB over base pair hydrolysis may reflect a lower cost of editing in mitochondrial DNA replication as compared with bacterial and bacteriophage systems with replicative DNA polymerases that exhibit high nucleotide turnover (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar).We have shown previously that SSB increases severalfold the processivity of nucleotide polymerization by pol γ (18Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, neither the major contribution of mtSSB to increasing the rate of nucleotide polymerization nor its stimulation of 3′ → 5′ exonuclease are apparently a consequence of it. We have shown here that in stimulating the rate of initiation of DNA strand synthesis by pol γ, mtSSB increases the fraction of substrate molecules utilized 30-fold and thus likely recruits pol γ to the primer terminus. Whether this occurs by an active or passive mechanism remains to be elucidated, but our DNase I footprinting analysis supports the recruiting model. Remarkably, the footprinting data show that unlike most replicative DNA polymerases, the native pol γ heterodimer forms stable complexes with template-primer DNA, and template-primer binding is enhanced in the presence of mtSSB. mtSSB alone does not protect the primer from digestion, nor does it alter the footprinting pattern of pol γ, which protects two helical turns of the DNA template strand at the primer terminus.Mikhailov and Bogenhagen (24Mikhailov V.S. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18939-18946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) found mtSSB to inhibit binding ofXenopus pol γ to template-primer DNA, in a gel mobility shift analysis on short oligonucleotides. On such substrates, we would anticipate efficient binding of pol γ alone because the ssDNA present is less than 50 nt per substrate molecule. Indeed, we find that oligonucleotide template-primer binding by Drosophila pol γ is not stimulated by mtSSB nor is the initiation of DNA synthesis on such substrates. 2Y. Wang and L. S. Kaguni, unpublished results. We suggest that initiation of lagging DNA strand synthesis in mitochondrial replication should require mtSSB-facilitated primer recognition and binding by pol γ where, as in our model M13 assayin vitro, the displaced lagging DNA strand template is thousands of nucleotides in length (25Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Our data show clearly that the rate of initiation of DNA strand synthesis to produce an 8–11-mer on a long ssDNA is stimulated up to 30-fold by mtSSB.What factors mediate the functional interactions of pol γ with mtSSB? Functional interactions may occur upon DNA binding and/or by specific physical interactions. E. coli SSB is known to bind DNA in several modes depending on ionic conditions (26Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Studies of mtSSBs also show salt-dependent effects on DNA binding and, in particular, on binding site size and in cooperativity of DNA binding (5Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ionic conditions likely affect both DNA conformation and SSB structure, and these may vary on different template primers. Likewise, pol γ binding to the template DNA at the primer terminus may differ from that in long ssDNA regions. Our data show that mtSSB stimulates DNA synthesis by pol γ on M13 DNA over a broad range of salt concentrations, under which the effects on mtSSB on template-primer binding and dissociation by pol γ vary substantially. This suggests flexibility in presumptive protein-protein interactions and perhaps in the mode of mitochondrial DNA replication under the fluctuating ionic conditions that occur in vivo (21Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 120-121Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Specific physical interactions have been demonstrated between replicative DNA polymerases and SSB proteins in several systems. Both bacteriophage T4 and T7 DNA polymerases interact physically with their cognate SSBs, the gene 32 and 2.5 proteins, respectively (27Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In that regard, E. coli DNA pol III holoenzyme has recently been shown to interact physically withE. coli SSB (34Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

This interaction involves the χ subunit of the former and the acidic carboxyl-terminal tail of the latter and has a dual effect on in vitro DNA synthesis under elevated salt conditions in DNA strand initiation and in chain elongation. Our functional data resemble those studies: mtSSB stimulates both primer recognition by pol γ and enhances the processivity of nucleotide polymerization. Interestingly, although mtSSB is a homolog of bacterial SSB, sharing significant sequence (7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J.

Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, the carboxyl terminus appears as a disorganized loop in the crystal structure of the human mtSSB (36Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, future studies to link functional with physical interactions between pol γ and mtSSB have the potential to reveal novel interaction domains. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; pol, DNA polymerase; mtSSB, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein; nt, nucleotide(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; pol, DNA polymerase; mtSSB, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein; nt, nucleotide(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. serve critical roles in DNA replication, repair and recombination (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). Whereas high affinity DNA binding by SSBs can occur independently of other proteins, both functional and physical interactions between SSBs and a variety of enzymes involved in the above processes have been documented. In particular, interactions between SSBs and replicative DNA polymerases have been demonstrated in bacterial, nuclear, and viral systems (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). The near-homogeneous mitochondrial DNA polymerase fromDrosophila embryos catalyzes relatively efficient DNA synthesis on both predominantly double- and single-stranded DNA templates (2Wernette C.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, neither the major contribution of mtSSB to increasing the rate of nucleotide polymerization nor its stimulation of 3′ → 5′ exonuclease are apparently a consequence of it. We have shown here that in stimulating the rate of initiation of DNA strand synthesis by pol γ, mtSSB increases the fraction of substrate molecules utilized 30-fold and thus likely recruits pol γ to the primer terminus. Whether this occurs by an active or passive mechanism remains to be elucidated, but our DNase I footprinting analysis supports the recruiting model. Remarkably, the footprinting data show that unlike most replicative DNA polymerases, the native pol γ heterodimer forms stable complexes with template-primer DNA, and template-primer binding is enhanced in the presence of mtSSB. mtSSB alone does not protect the primer from digestion, nor does it alter the footprinting pattern of pol γ, which protects two helical turns of the DNA template strand at the primer terminus. Mikhailov and Bogenhagen (24Mikhailov V.S. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18939-18946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) found mtSSB to inhibit binding ofXenopus pol γ to template-primer DNA, in a gel mobility shift analysis on short oligonucleotides. On such substrates, we would anticipate efficient binding of pol γ alone because the ssDNA present is less than 50 nt per substrate molecule. Indeed, we find that oligonucleotide template-primer binding by Drosophila pol γ is not stimulated by mtSSB nor is the initiation of DNA synthesis on such substrates. 2Y. Wang and L. S. Kaguni, unpublished results. We suggest that initiation of lagging DNA strand synthesis in mitochondrial replication should require mtSSB-facilitated primer recognition and binding by pol γ where, as in our model M13 assayin vitro, the displaced lagging DNA strand template is thousands of nucleotides in length (25Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Our data show clearly that the rate of initiation of DNA strand synthesis to produce an 8–11-mer on a long ssDNA is stimulated up to 30-fold by mtSSB. What factors mediate the functional interactions of pol γ with mtSSB? Functional interactions may occur upon DNA binding and/or by specific physical interactions. E. coli SSB is known to bind DNA in several modes depending on ionic conditions (26Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Studies of mtSSBs also show salt-dependent effects on DNA binding and, in particular, on binding site size and in cooperativity of DNA binding (5Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J.

Ionic conditions likely affect both DNA conformation and SSB structure, and these may vary on different template primers. Likewise, pol γ binding to the template DNA at the primer terminus may differ from that in long ssDNA regions. Our data show that mtSSB stimulates DNA synthesis by pol γ on M13 DNA over a broad range of salt concentrations, under which the effects on mtSSB on template-primer binding and dissociation by pol γ vary substantially. This suggests flexibility in presumptive protein-protein interactions and perhaps in the mode of mitochondrial DNA replication under the fluctuating ionic conditions that occur in vivo (21Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 120-121Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both bacteriophage T4 and T7 DNA polymerases interact physically with their cognate SSBs, the gene 32 and 2.5 proteins, respectively (27Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In that regard, E. coli DNA pol III holoenzyme has recently been shown to interact physically withE. coli SSB (34Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

This interaction involves the χ subunit of the former and the acidic carboxyl-terminal tail of the latter and has a dual effect on in vitro DNA synthesis under elevated salt conditions in DNA strand initiation and in chain elongation. Our functional data resemble those studies: mtSSB stimulates both primer recognition by pol γ and enhances the processivity of nucleotide polymerization. Interestingly, although mtSSB is a homolog of bacterial SSB, sharing significant sequence (7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J.

Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, the carboxyl terminus appears as a disorganized loop in the crystal structure of the human mtSSB (36Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, future studies to link functional with physical interactions between pol γ and mtSSB have the potential to reveal novel interaction domains."

We have shown that the lower activity of eNOS is caused by a lower ability of its flavoprotein reductase domain to transfer electrons to the catalytic heme domain (25Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the structural features that impair the reductase activity in eNOS, and hence lower the overall catalytic activity, remain unknown. Recent evidence (26Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

The presence of such an autoinhibitory moiety has precedence among CaM-binding enzymes. Indeed, the skeletal and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases, multifunctional CaM-dependent protein kinase II, CaM-dependent protein phosphatase 2B, calcineurin, and phosphorylase kinase are among the CaM-dependent enzymes that possess autoinhibitory structural elements (27Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, CaM acts by displacing an autoinhibitory element that interferes with substrate access to the catalytic domain. In calcineurin, the autoinhibitory element is composed of two α helices of 23 amino acids located 54 amino acids after the CaM binding sequence (28Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 29Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J.

In nNOS and eNOS, the proposed autoinhibitory domain is composed of a 52–55-amino acid insert within the FMN binding domain located approximately 80 amino acid residues after the CaM binding sequence (Fig. 1). Location of the putative autoinhibitory element near the junction between the NOS oxygenase and reductase domains is consistent with a possible role in controlling electron transfer between these two domains. To establish definitively whether the peptide insert in its native protein context functions as an autoinhibitory loop, we have constructed mutants of wild-type and chimeric NOS enzymes lacking the insert and have studied the consequences of deleting the loop on their Ca2+ dependence and catalytic activities. Our results clearly identify the eNOS insert as an autoinhibitory loop that functions not only as an effector of the Ca2+ dependence but also as an electron transfer control element that lowers the catalytic activity of eNOS relative to that of nNOS and iNOS. Bovine endothelial NOS expression plasmid 6xHis-pcWori/beNOS was identical to that described previously (20Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Enzymes used in DNA manipulation were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).l-Arg was from Aldrich, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego), and HEPES buffer from Fisher. Recombinant human CaM was purified from Escherichia coli according to published procedures (31Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA purification kits and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose were purchased from QIAGEN (Chatsworth, CA). BL21(DE3)-competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). All other reagents and materials were from Sigma. The genes encoding the N/E and I/E chimeras were prepared as described previously (25Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The structures of all of the protein constructs employed in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 2. All PCR extensions were performed with VentR polymerase, which possesses a 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease to minimize extension errors. The E portion was generated by PCR primer extension using template pBluescript/eNOS, primer 1 (5′-CAACC ATCCT GTACG CTAGC GAGAC CGGCC GGG), which introduced the 5′-NheI splice site (in bold), and primer 2 (5′-CAGCC CCTCT CTTCT AGAAC TGCAG TGG), which produced a 3′ XbaI site (bold) after the stop codon. These sites were used to produce pcWori//N/E by subcloning of the eNOS reductase domain PCR fragment into pcWori/nNOSNheI761, a Thr761 → Ser nNOS mutant possessing the NheI splice site (25Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ser is the homologous amino acid found in eNOS. The iNOS fragment containing the heme domain and CaM binding of I/E was generated by PCR extension using template pBluescript/iNOS and primers 3 (5′-AGTCT CACAT ATGGC TTGCC CGTGC AAGTT TCTGT TCAA) and 4 (5′-CGGGC GTCGC TAGCA AAGAG GACTG TGGC) to produce, respectively, 5′-NdeI and 3′-NheI restriction sites (bold), which allowed for subcloning into pcWori//N/E. The genes encoding for chimeras E/I and N/I were prepared in a similar manner. The iNOS reductase domain was generated by PCR primer extension using primer 5 (5′-CACAT GCCTC TTTGC TAGCG AGACA GGGAA GTCT) and primer 6 (5′-TGCTC TAGAT CAGAG CCTCG TGGCT TT) to produce NheI and XbaI sites (bold), respectively. These sites were used to subclone the macrophage reductase domain PCR fragment into pcWori//E/N and pcWori//N/E, producing pcWori//E/I and pcWori//N/I, respectively. The eNOS loop deletion was made by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis (32Tao B.Y. Lu K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar) using template pcWori//N/E and primers 7–10 (5′-ATTAA CTAGT CCCGT CCTTT GAATA CCAG, 5′-GGTGC CCAGG GCGCC TGCAC TCTCC ATCAG, 5′-ATGGA GAGTG CAGGC GCCCT GGGCA CCCTC, and 5′-CAGCA GCTGG AGGCC C). Two PCR fragments were generated using primers 7 (which anneals before theNheI site) and 8 (mutagenesis primer), producing fragment A; and primers 9 (mutagenesis primer) and 10 (which anneals 20 bases after the unique KpnI site of eNOS), producing fragment B. A and B possessed a 15-base overlap, allowing for mutually primed synthesis of full-length AB using A, B, primer 7, and primer 10. Subcloning via the 5′-NheI and 3′-KpnI sites into pcWori//N/E yielded pcWori//N/EΔ. Sequencing was performed to ensure against PCR errors in fragment AB. To produce pcWori//E/EΔ, the parent chimera E/E plasmid, whose splice site produces a silent mutation, was produced by subcloning via NheI and XbaI the E reductase domain fragment from pcWori//N/E into pcWori//E/N followed by subcloning of the above EΔ fragment (AB, digested withNheI and KpnI) into pcWori//E/E. Expression and purification were performed as described previously (25Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rate of ⋅NO synthesis, determined from the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, and that of cytochrome c reduction were measured at 37 °C as reported previously (25Nishida C.R.

Where specifically indicated, an additional 100 mm KCl was included in the incubation mixture. Ferricyanide reduction was monitored at 420 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.2 mm−1 cm−1 with an assay solution identical to that used for the other assays except that potassium ferricyanide was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm in place of cytochrome c or oxyhemoglobin. Protein concentrations were estimated using an extinction coefficient of εSoret = 100 mm−1cm−1 for the NOS proteins and ε276 nm = 3300m−1 cm−1 for human CaM. Free calcium concentrations were reproduced as reported before (33Tsien R. Pozzan T.

Expression and purification of the NOS proteins (for protein structures, see Fig. 2) was done as reported previously using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and 2′,5′-ADP-agarose affinity chromatography (25Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The final purity of all of the proteins was judged to be greater than 95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the spectra of all the proteins were consistent with the formation of heme-bound, functional proteins (not shown). The insert in the eNOS and nNOS reductase domains may function as an autoinhibitory element that impedes the Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM except at high Ca2+ concentrations (26Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ⋅NO synthesizing activity of the enzymes as a function of the free-Ca2+ concentration. The effects of the insert in the reductase domain on the Ca2+ and CaM dependence of the activities of the recombinant proteins were measured in the presence of 500 nm CaM and various free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3). The desired free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by adding EGTA and Ca2+-EGTA as indicated by the Ca2+-EGTA equilibrium dissociation constant at the given temperature and ionic strength (33Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The ionic strength in these studies was controlled by adding KCl to the buffer. The results thus obtained with wild-type nNOS (Fig. 3A), from which an apparent KD (K D(app)) of 300 nm for Ca2+ is calculated, were consistent with those reported by Ruan et al. (34Ruan J. Xie Q. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22679-22686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A slightly lower value of 150 nm was obtained for eNOS. The iNOS activity was independent of the free Ca2+ concentration, again in accord with Ruan et al. (34Ruan J. Xie Q. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22679-22686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TheK D(app) values for Ca2+in the N/E, E/I, and N/I chimeras were 200, 10, and 10 nm, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). For these three chimeras, the Ca2+ dependence correlates well with the presence (N/E) or absence (E/I, N/I) of the insert in the reductase domain. Proteins with the insert-deleted eNOS reductase domain required significantly less free Ca2+ for catalytic activity than their parent isoforms (Fig. 3B). eNOSΔ, which only differs from wild-type eNOS by deletion of the putative autoinhibitory loop, had a K D(app) value of 20 nmfor Ca2+ rather than 150 nm and thus was activated by a 7-fold lower Ca2+ concentration. Likewise, activation of N/EΔ required 4-fold less Ca2+(50 nm) than the parent N/E chimera (200 nm). The lower K D(app) values for Ca2+ in the proteins without the insert approach those for the E/I and N/I chimeras, which bear the insert-less iNOS reductase domain (e.g. compare the open circles and open squares in Fig. 3A with the open diamondsand open squares in Fig. 3B). The I/E and I/EΔ chimeras did not differ significantly in their Ca2+dependence; both exhibited some activity even at a 0.1 nmfree Ca2+ concentration, but their activity was not fully expressed at the lowest Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3B). NOS-dependent ⋅NO synthesis, monitored via the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin, and cytochromec reduction were assayed in two different buffers. The first buffer, which included flavins and other necessary cofactors, was similar in its lack of added salt to buffers conventionally employed to assay the pure proteins (35Murphy M.E. Noack E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The second buffer differed from the first only in that it contained 100 mm KCl to reproduce the conditions employed to assay Ca2+ dependence. In the presence of CaM, the activity of the wild-type constitutive NOS isoforms is expected to approach zero when [Ca2+]free ≪K D(app) for Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). A similar Ca2+ dependence might be expected for the mutants without the insert, but the maximum NOS activities for the insert-less mutants might be expected to be the same as those for the corresponding CaM-bound wild-type proteins when [Ca2+]free ≫K D(app) for Ca2+. Under these conditions, the CaM-bound insert-less eNOS mutant should have the same activity as CaM-bound, wild-type eNOS. Contrary to this expectation, the proteins without the peptide insert have enhanced catalytic activities (Fig. 4). In the presence of a high salt concentration, the activities of eNOSΔ, N/EΔ, and I/EΔ (51.4 ± 2.3, 128 ± 19, and 55.4 ± 1.2 min−1, respectively) are approximately double those for the parent eNOS, N/E, and I/E proteins (23.5 ± 2.3, 69.9 ± 2.0, and 32.6 ± 2.8 min−1, respectively). Identical effects were seen with KCl or NaCl as the ionic strength buffer (not shown). Thus, in the presence of an approximately physiological salt concentration, the loop deletion mutants consistently expressed a higher activity than the corresponding parent proteins. Under low salt conditions, the activities of eNOS and the chimeras bearing the eNOS reductase domain were comparable; the eNOS, N/E, and I/E activities were 17.9 ± 1.8, 28.0 ± 2.3, and 16.4 ± 0.7 min−1, respectively. Comparison with the high salt values reported above shows that the eNOS and I/E activities are increased modestly by salt. However, although the activity of N/E in the absence of salt was only slightly higher than that of the other eNOS reductase domain-containing proteins, in the presence of salt, N/E exhibited an activity (69.9 ± 2.0 min−1) comparable to the higher activities of the loop-deleted eNOSΔ and I/EΔ mutants (51.4 ± 2.3 and 55.4 ± 1.2 min−1, respectively). The chimeras were the only proteins whose activities were altered significantly by changes in the salt concentration, with a higher activity being observed for chimeras with the eNOS reductase domain and a lower activity for those with the iNOS reductase domain. Significant salt-dependent changes in activity were not seen for wild-type eNOS or for the loop-deleted mutant eNOSΔ in which the wild-type quaternary structure is presumably preserved better than in the chimeras. The increases in the activities caused by salt alone are therefore probably linked to changes in the quaternary structure introduced by the chimeric construct. The subtle change in the reductase/oxygenase interface which would suffice to increase electron transfer and catalytic activity is consistent with the suggestion that salt effects modulate interdomain electron transfer without causing major changes in the NOS structure (37Schrammel A. Gorren A.C.F. Stuehr D.J. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c reduction can be used to measure the intrinsic reductase activities of both NOS (38Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Böhme E. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Coon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the presence of CaM and 500 μm Ca2+, the trends in the cytochrome c reductase activities of the proteins adhere to the pattern observed for ⋅NO synthesis. The rates of the CaM-bound loop deletion mutants (Fig. 5, gray bars) are up to 3-fold higher than those of the corresponding parent proteins. Thus, the activities (+KCl) of eNOSΔ, N/EΔ, and I/EΔ are 3,440 ± 210, 5,580 ± 210, and 1,990 ± 130 min−1, respectively, compared with 1,354 ± 24, 1,770 ± 49, and 1,373 ± 90 min−1 for the corresponding parent proteins. The enhancement of cytochrome c reduction caused by removal of the insert is even more pronounced for the CaM-free proteins (Fig. 5, white bars, and Table I): CaM-free eNOSΔ and N/EΔ had activities of 2,150 ± 120 and 2,720 ± 370 min−1, respectively, values that are 10–30-fold higher than those for the corresponding parent proteins (111 ± 4 and 119 ± 5 min−1, respectively). In accord with this finding, the E/I and N/I chimeras with the iNOS loopless reductase have high cytochrome c-reducing activities in the absence of CaM (3,360 ± 150 and 4,390 ± 170 min−1). The CaM-free activities of I/E and I/EΔ could not be determined because the proteins had to be coexpressed with CaM. As for overall NOS activity, the cytochrome c reduction rates of the proteins with the iNOS reductase suffered a rate decrease of 50–80% at high salt concentrations.Table IComparison of CaM-bound and CaM-free cytochrome c reduction ratesProteinAssay conditions−KCl+KCleNOS13.512.2eNOSΔ1.41.6N/E15.214.8N/EΔ1.82.0Values shown are the rate ratio, calculated as the rate of CaM­bound proteinrate of CaM­free protein. Open table in a new tab Values shown are the rate ratio, calculated as the rate of CaM­bound proteinrate of CaM­free protein. A comparison of thewhite and gray bars for each protein in Fig. 5shows that the stimulation (“disinhibition”) by CaM is much lower for the loop-deleted mutants. The binding of CaM to eNOS and N/E, which have the wild-type eNOS reductase domain, enhances their activities 12- and 15-fold, respectively. In contrast, the binding of CaM to the corresponding loop-deleted mutants only enhances that of eNOSΔ by a factor of 0.5 and N/EΔ by a factor of 2. The comparison could not be made for I/E and I/EΔ because the proteins had to be coexpressed with CaM. The greater enhancement in the cytochrome c reductase activities of the CaM-free than CaM-bound NOS proteins caused by insert deletion in each instance makes the activities of the CaM-free and CaM-bound proteins nearly equal, as indicated by a lowering in the ratio of the rates (Table I). The high reductase activities of the CaM-free, insert-deleted proteins are similar to those of the CaM-free chimeras with the insert-less iNOS reductase domain. For example, the cytochrome c reduction rates are comparably high for E/I in the presence and absence of CaM (3,360 ± 150 and 21,37 ± 27 min−1, respectively), and the corresponding rates for N/I are 4,390 ± 170 and 1,654 ± 27 min−1, respectively. Similarly, the isolated iNOS reductase domain expressed in E. coli has high reductase activity (43Rafferty S. Malech H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acidification of these intracellular compartments is in turn essential for a variety of cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, protein processing and degradation, and coupled transport. V-ATPases are also present in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells, where they function in such processes as renal acidification (7Gluck S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), bone resorption (10Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Fuchs R. Baron R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The V1 domain is a peripheral complex of molecular mass of 570 kDa composed of eight different subunits of molecular mass 70–14 kDa (subunits A-H) that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five subunits of molecular mass 100–17 kDa (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c“) that is responsible for proton translocation. This structure is similar to that of the ATP synthases (or F-ATPases) that function in ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria (12Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

These results have led us to suggest that the 100-kDa subunit is the V-ATPase homolog to the a subunit of the F-ATPases. Mutational studies have identified several critical buried charged residues in the last two transmembrane segments of the F-ATPase a subunit that are important for proton translocation (27Cain B.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), essentially no information has yet been reported concerning the folding of the V-ATPase a subunit. In the present study, we have employed a combination of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and chemical modification together with introduction of factor Xa cleavage sites in putative loops to investigate the topographical arrangement of the V-ATPase a subunit.DISCUSSIONWe have used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis together with chemical modification by membrane permeable and impermeable reagents, as well as introduction of protease cleavage sites, to analyze the membrane topography of the 100-kDa a subunit of the yeast V-ATPase. The cysteine-scanning method depends upon the successful construction of a functionally active Cys-less form of the protein together with mutants containing unique cysteine residues that do not significantly perturb activity. In the case of the a subunit, this required the simultaneous replacement of seven endogenous cysteine residues. In addition, because the a subunit is part of a multisubunit complex, the mutations introduced must not alter the interactions between the a subunit and the remaining V-ATPase subunits. We observed that both the Cys-less form of the a subunit and all but one of the single cysteine-containing mutants give rise to complexes showing near wild type levels of activity, suggesting that these changes do not significantly alter the structure or function of the a subunit. In the case of G763C, a loss of approximately 50% of proton transport activity was observed.The labeling strategy employed depends upon the membrane permeability of MPB and the membrane impermeability of AMS. This allows MPB to react with cysteine residues on both sides of the membrane, whereas AMS reacts only with cysteine residues exposed on the surface of the membrane vesicles. In the case of yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles used in the present study, the exposed surface is the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The orientation and sealed state of the vesicles employed is supported by the similar ratio of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis that we have observed when compared with other sealed, well oriented vesicles, including intact yeast vacuoles (46Liu Q. Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and purified clathrin-coated vesicles (47Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strategy has been successfully used to study the membrane topography of several other integral membrane proteins, including in particular subunit a of the E. coliF-ATPase (32Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These latter studies have led to the current five membrane spanning model for the F-ATPase a subunit.In addition to the cysteine modification approach, we have also introduced factor Xa cleavage sites into three putative loop regions of the protein. Although the mutant bearing a factor Xa site at position 606 showed only approximately 50% of wild type levels of activity, the other two mutants showed nearly normal proton transport, suggesting minimal perturbation of structure.The results obtained in the current study have led to the model for the folding of the V-ATPase a subunit shown in Fig. 4. In addition, a hydropathy plot for Vph1p together with the location of each of the putative membrane spanning segments is shown in Fig. 5. The protein is proposed to span the bilayer nine times, with the amino terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and the carboxyl terminus on the lumenal side. All four of the cysteine residues introduced into the amino-terminal soluble domain showed a labeling pattern consistent with a cytoplasmic orientation whereas S840C at the carboxyl terminus showed labeling characteristic of a lumenal orientation. This suggests that the amino and carboxyl termini are on opposite sides of the membrane, requiring that the protein span the bilayer an odd number of times.Figure 5Hydropathy plot of Vph1p and location of putative transmembrane segments. The amino acid sequence of Vph1p (24Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was analyzed using the method of Kyte and Doolittle (49Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17007) Google Scholar), and the resultant hydropathy plot shown. The location of the nine putative transmembrane segments are also shown and labeledI--IX. There are four consensusN-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in Vph1p at Asn-113, Asn-280, Asn-324, and Asn-374. Because all four sites are located in the amino-terminal soluble domain, which our labeling data clearly shows is cytoplasmic, it is unlikely that any of these four sites are glycosylated in vivo. In fact, it has not clearly been demonstrated that Vph1p is glycosylated in yeast. If Vph1p is glycosylated, it is possible that carbohydrate is attached atO-linked sites, for which there is not a clear consensus sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our original folding model for the a subunit (25Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we had postulated that the amino-terminal soluble domain was exposed on the lumenal side of the membrane based upon the increased labeling observed for the bovine a subunit using membrane impermeant reagents when the membrane was disrupted with detergents (47Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result may be explained by a change in conformation of the protein in the presence of detergent such that previously shielded sites on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane become exposed. In addition, because the a subunit is not synthesized with an amino-terminal leader sequence, a cytoplasmic orientation for the amino terminus is more consistent with what is known concerning the requirements for translocation of hydrophilic protein segments across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during biosynthesis.A lumenal orientation of the carboxyl terminus is also at odds with our previously proposed model, in which we suggested a cytoplasmic orientation for the carboxyl terminus (26Leng X.H. Manolson M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This was based on the identification by random mutagenesis of a cluster of five mutations between residues Leu-800 and Gly-814 that disrupted attachment of the V1 and V0 domains, suggesting that this region may be important in assembly of the V-ATPase complex (26Leng X.H. Manolson M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is nevertheless possible that disruption of assembly in these mutants results from conformational changes in the structure of the 100-kDa subunit or the V0 domain that prevent attachment of V1 to V0. Interestingly, our current model places nearly all of the residues that have been observed to disrupt assembly, including Asp-425, Lys-538, and Arg-735, as well as the five mutations between residues 800 and 814 on the lumenal side of the membrane. It is possible that these residues may form a lumenal domain that senses the intravesicular pH and conveys this information through conformational changes in the 100-kDa subunit to the cytoplasmic domain of the complex.With respect to the loop regions, four of the introduced cysteine residues (at positions 561, 564, 761, and 763) are not labeled by MPB, suggesting that they are shielded from reaction by interaction with other V0 subunits or other regions of the 100-kDa subunit itself. It is also possible that one or more of these cysteine residues may be shielded from reaction with MPB by interaction with the lipid bilayer. Of the remaining introduced cysteine residues, three appear to have a cytoplasmic orientation (N447C, N450C, and S703C) whereas G602C appears to be lumenal. The cytoplasmic orientation of residues 447 and 450 requires that the hydrophobic region between residues 405 and 443 span the bilayer twice rather than once (as originally postulated (25Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), placing Asp-425 on the lumenal side of the membrane. A lumenal orientation for Gly-602 and a cytoplasmic orientation for Ser-703 is consistent with a single membrane span between these sites. That Ser-703 is cytoplasmic is also consistent with the observation that the bovine V-ATPase a subunit can be cleaved by low concentrations of trypsin at a site immediately upstream of this residue in intact coated vesicles (48Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the large soluble loop between residues 653 and 727 is likely to be oriented toward the cytoplasm.Of the three factor Xa sites introduced into the 100-kDa subunit, protease cleavage was observed only for the tandem sites introduced at position 560. The fact that this cleavage happened in intact vacuolar membrane vesicles as well as in the presence of detergent indicates that this site is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. For the sites introduced at positions 499 and 606, no cleavage by factor Xa was observed in either the presence or absence of detergent, again suggesting that these sites may be shielded through interaction with other regions of the protein. Nevertheless, the observation that all three of these mutants show significant proton transport activity suggests that all three sites are located in loop regions between transmembrane segments in the a subunit. This conclusion comes from results obtained with lac permease, where it has been observed that factor Xa sites introduced into loops between transmembrane segments generally do not affect activity, whereas sites introduced within transmembrane segments invariably lead to loss of both correct folding and transport activity. 3R. Kaback, personal communication. It is important to emphasize that the model shown in Fig. 4 is only a working model for the topography of the V-ATPase a subunit based upon the first available data presented here concerning the disposition of this polypeptide with respect to the membrane. The labeling and proteolysis approaches taken in the current study, like all other methods of analyzing the topography of membrane proteins, are subject to several possible sources of error. For instance, it is possible that local differences in the environment of individual cysteine residues, in addition to their disposition with respect to the membrane, may influence their relative reactivity toward the two sulfhydryl reagents employed. We have shown that permeabilization of the membranes with detergent allows the lumenally oriented cysteine residues to be effectively blocked by AMS. Nevertheless, it will be important that the proposed model be further tested, both by introduction of additional labeling and cleavage sites and by employing other approaches to determine topography, such as epitope tagging and preparation of site-specific antibodies that recognize the native protein. The current study, however, represents a first step in determining the folding pattern of this important V-ATPase subunit.

Acidification of these intracellular compartments is in turn essential for a variety of cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, protein processing and degradation, and coupled transport. V-ATPases are also present in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells, where they function in such processes as renal acidification (7Gluck S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), bone resorption (10Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Fuchs R. Baron R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPases from fungi, plants, and animals are structurally very similar and are composed of two functional domains (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The V1 domain is a peripheral complex of molecular mass of 570 kDa composed of eight different subunits of molecular mass 70–14 kDa (subunits A-H) that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five subunits of molecular mass 100–17 kDa (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c“) that is responsible for proton translocation. This structure is similar to that of the ATP synthases (or F-ATPases) that function in ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria (12Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1999975150,"A new mouse connexin gene has been isolated that codes for a connexin protein of 505 amino acid residues. Based on the predicted molecular mass of 57.115 kDa, it has been designated connexin-57. Similar to most other mouse connexin genes, the coding region of connexin-57 is not interrupted by introns and exists in the mouse genome as a single-copy gene. Within the connexin family, this new gene shows highest sequence identity to porcine connexin-60 in the α group of connexins. The connexin-57 gene was mapped to a position on mouse chromosome 4, 30 centimorgans proximal to a cluster of previously mapped connexin genes. Low levels of connexin-57 mRNA were detected in skin, heart, kidney, testis, ovary, intestine, and in the mouse embryo after 8 days post coitum, but expression was not detected in brain, sciatic nerve or liver. In order to analyze gene function, the connexin-57 coding region was expressed by transfection in human HeLa cells, where it restored homotypic intercellular transfer of microinjected neurobiotin. Heterotypic transfer was observed between HeLa connexin-57 transfectants and HeLa cells, expressing murine connexin-43, -37, or -30.3. Double whole-cell voltage clamp analyses revealed that HeLa-connexin-57 transfectants expressed about 10 times more channels than parental HeLa cells. Voltage gating by transjunctional and transmembrane voltages as well as unitary conductance (∼27 picosiemens) were different from intrinsic connexin channels in parental HeLa cells."

Whereas RhoA stimulation of ARF-sensitive PLD has been reported in some cell-free systems (24Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

We have recently reported that in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), PLD activity depends on PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that PLD stimulation by phorbol ester-activated PKC involves the Ras-related Ral proteins, whereas m3 mAChR signaling to PLD is mediated by members of the ARF and Rho GTPase families (20Schmidt M.

We demonstrate here that the PLD stimulatory effect of recombinant RhoA in HEK-293 cell membranes is phosphorylation-dependent. In the search for the putative kinase, we studied the effect of the RhoA-stimulated serine/threonine kinase Rho-kinase (35Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), which has also been termed ROKα (36Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and ROCK-II (37Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), on PLD regulation. We found that overexpression of Rho-kinase greatly increases m3 mAChR-mediated but not PKC-mediated PLD stimulation in intact cells. Furthermore, we show that HA-1077, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, specifically suppresses receptor-mediated PLD stimulation and that recombinant Rho-kinase mimics the stimulatory effect of RhoA on PLD activity in HEK-293 cell membranes. These findings strongly suggest that Rho-kinase is involved in Rho-controlled PLD stimulation by the G protein-coupled m3 mAChR in HEK-293 cells. [3H]Oleic acid (10 Ci/mmol) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoyl-glycerophosphocholine ([3H]PtdCho; 37.5 Ci/mmol) were from New England Nuclear. HA-1077 was from Calbiochem, and glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled PtdCho, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and TNM-FH insect medium were from Sigma, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 and GTPγS were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies against RhoA and Rho-kinase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA encoding human RhoA was subcloned into pRK5 expression vector. DNA encoding myc-tagged C3 transferase subcloned in pEF (38Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treismann R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. A. Hall. DNAs encoding myc-tagged wild-type Rho-kinase, the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase, Rho-kinase-CAT (amino acids 6–553), and the kinase-deficient mutant of Rho-kinase-CAT, Rho-kinase-CAT-KD (Rho-kinase-CAT K121G), were subcloned into pEF (39Amano M.

For expression in Sf9 cells, DNA encoding RhoA was subcloned into a pAcGHLT baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen), and DNA encoding Rho-kinase-CAT was subcloned into a pAcGLT transfer vector (39Amano M.

Culture conditions of HEK-293 cells stably expressing the m3 mAChR were as reported previously (31Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells subcultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium were grown to near confluence (145-mm culture dishes) and transfected with either the indicated concentrations of DNA encoding RhoA, myc-tagged C3 transferase, Rho-kinase, Rho-kinase-CAT or Rho-kinase-CAT-KD, or the corresponding vectors using the calcium phosphate method (40Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency of HEK-293 cells, which ranged from 50% to 80%, was determined by in situ staining for β-galactosidase activity of the cells cotransfected with the constitutively active pSVβ-gal (Promega). All assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Transient overexpression of the proteins was verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates using specific antibodies. Transient overexpression of C3 transferase was detected by the mobility shift of ADP-ribosylated endogenously expressed RhoA (41Aktories K. Just I. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 87-112Google Scholar). Morphological changes induced by overexpression of RhoA and Rho-kinase were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (Nikon TMS). For measurement of PLD activity in intact HEK-293 cells, the cells were replated 24 h after transfection on 145-mm culture dishes. Cellular phospholipids were labeled by incubating monolayers for 20–24 h with [3H]oleic acid (2 μCi/ml) in growth medium. Thereafter, cells were detached from the dishes, washed twice in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmd-glucose buffered at pH 7.4 with 15 mm HEPES, and resuspended at a cell concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. PLD activity was measured for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl containing 100 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells), 400 mmethanol, and the indicated stimulatory agents. The reaction was stopped, and labeled phospholipids, including the specific PLD product [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PtdEtOH), were isolated as described previously (31Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The formation of [3H]PtdEtOH is expressed as a percentage of the total amount of labeled phospholipids. Data shown are the mean ± S.D. from one experiment performed in triplicate and repeated as indicated in the figure legends. To measure PLD activity in HEK-293 cell membranes prepared as described previously (30Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Nehls C. Ott S. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), [3H] PtdCho was mixed with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a molar ratio of 8:1, dried, and resuspended in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, followed by sonication on ice. PLD activity was determined as described previously (30Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Nehls C. Ott S. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with [3H]PtdCho/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (200 μm/25 μm) as substrate vesicles and 200 μg of membrane protein for 60 min at 37 °C or for 15 min at 30 °C. Sf9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) cultured at 25 °C in TNM-FH insect medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were infected with pAcGHLT containing RhoA or pAcGLT containing Rho-kinase-CAT baculovirus transfer vectors (multiplicity of infection = 5) for 48 h at 25 °C. Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged, resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and homogenized by sonication on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 20,000 × g. The supernatant, which contained GST-RhoA or GST-Rho-kinase-CAT, was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were washed three times with Buffer A to remove unbound proteins. RhoA and Rho-kinase-CAT were released from the parent GST-fusion proteins bound to the beads by incubation with thrombin (PharMingen; 10 units) overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the excess thrombin was removed by the addition of p-aminobenzamidine beads. The homogeneity of the recombinant RhoA and Rho-kinase-CAT proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For immunoblot analysis, an aliquot of the homogenates was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels to separate the proteins. After a transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and a 1-h incubation with anti-RhoA (1:500 dilution) or anti-Rho-kinase (1:200 dilution) antibodies, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. We have reported previously that PLD stimulation by the m3 mAChR, which activates endogenous RhoA in HEK-293 cells (42Keller J. Schmidt M. Hussein B. Rümenapp U. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), is potently inhibited by the inactivation of Rho family GTPases with Clostridium difficile toxin B (20Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that toxin B and the Rho-specific C3 transferase (41Aktories K. Just I. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 87-112Google Scholar) decrease the cellular level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulates PLD activity in HEK-293 cell membranes (30Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Nehls C. Ott S. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Grannass A.

Thus, to study PLD stimulation by Rho proteins in HEK-293 cells, we measured PLD activities in the membranes of HEK-293 cells in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Several previous studies have demonstrated that activated RhoA stimulates purified recombinant PLD1 enzymes under this condition, apparently by a direct RhoA-PLD1 interaction (16Hammond S.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In HEK-293 cell membranes, the addition of GTPγS (100 μm) alone caused about a 2-fold increase in PLD activity, which is probably due to the activation of endogenous membrane-associated ARF proteins (30Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Nehls C. Ott S. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Grannass A. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the addition of purified recombinant RhoA (10 μm) in the presence of GTPγS (100 μm) had no effect on PLD activity (Fig. 1). Similar data were obtained in the membranes of HEK-293 cells pretreated with toxin B, causing the inactivation of endogenous Rho proteins (data not shown). In contrast, under the same assay conditions, GTPγS-activated recombinant RhoA stimulated PLD activity in the membranes of human PLD1a-expressing Sf9 cells about 20-fold, from 50 ± 10 to 1070 ± 80 pmol × h−1 × mg protein−1 (mean ± SD; n = 5 experiments). Besides PtdIns4P 5-kinases, Rho GTPases can stimulate various protein kinases (for reviews, see Refs. 28Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and 44Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether a phosphorylation reaction is involved in RhoA stimulation of HEK-293 cell PLD activity. For this study, PLD activity was measured in the presence of 1 mm MgATP. Under this condition, the addition of RhoA in the presence of GTPγS markedly increased PLD activity in HEK-293 cell membranes (Fig. 1). Although a permissive effect of MgATP on GTPγS binding by RhoA cannot be excluded, we first considered the possibility that a RhoA-dependent lipid or protein kinase is involved in PLD stimulation by RhoA. The involvement of a RhoA-stimulated PtdIns4P 5-kinase was unlikely for the following reasons: (a) PtdIns(4,5)P2 was added at a maximally effective concentration of 25 μm (30Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Nehls C. Ott S. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); (b) although the added PtdIns(4,5)P2 was degraded at the end of the incubation period in the absence of MgATP to 10 μm, this PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration was virtually identical to that (12 μm) used by many others to demonstrate RhoA stimulation of PLD in vitro (16Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar); and (c) in the presence of MgATP, which by itself prevented (by ∼50%) the degradation of added PtdIns(4,5)P2, the addition of RhoA had a very modest protective effect on the PtdIns(4,5)P2 level (data not shown), which was quite distinct from the marked PLD stimulation by RhoA under this condition. Thus, the phosphorylation-dependent PLD stimulation by RhoA in HEK-293 cell membranes may involve a protein kinase rather than PtdIns4P 5-kinase. Recently, several direct RhoA target proteins have been identified, including the two Rho-stimulated serine/threonine kinases: (a) Rho-kinase, also termed ROKα or ROCK-II, and (b) p160ROCK, also termed ROCK-I (35Matsui T.

To test the hypothesis that Rho-induced PLD stimulation involves Rho-kinase, we studied the effects of HEK-293 cell transfection with RhoA and different Rho-kinase constructs on cell morphology and PLD activity. Expression of RhoA and the myc-tagged Rho-kinases was verified by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting (data not shown). Overexpression of RhoA caused drastic changes in HEK-293 cell morphology, as demonstrated by the occurrence of a high number of rounded cells (Fig. 2). As reported previously by others (36Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar,44Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), similar morphology changes were observed in HEK-293 cells overexpressing Rho-kinase-CAT, which lacks the regulatory Rho-binding and PH domains and is constitutively active, and although less pronounced, in wild-type Rho-kinase-overexpressing cells. In contrast, overexpression of a kinase-deficient mutant of Rho-kinase-CAT, Rho-kinase-CAT-KD, did not cause rounding of HEK-293 cells. We then determined the effects of the same proteins on PLD activity in HEK-293 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 3, overexpression of RhoA and either wild-type Rho-kinase or Rho-kinase-CAT markedly increased m3 mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation without significantly altering basal PLD activity. The PLD stimulatory effects were most pronounced in cells overexpressing RhoA and Rho-kinase-CAT. For example, the transfection of HEK-293 cells with 100 μg of RhoA DNA and Rho-kinase-CAT DNA increased PLD stimulation by carbachol (1 mm) by about 150% and 250%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and C).

In the present study, the intracellular distribution of CPD was examined in AtT-20 cells, a mouse anterior pituitary-derived corticotroph. CPD-containing compartments were isolated using antibodies to the CPD cytosolic tail. The immunopurified vesicles contained TGN proteins (TGN38, furin, syntaxin 6) but not lysosomal or plasma membrane proteins. The CPD-containing vesicles also contained neuropeptide-processing enzymes and adrenocorticotropic hormone, a product of proopiomelanocortin proteolysis. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that CPD is present within the TGN and immature secretory granules but is virtually absent from mature granules, suggesting that CPD is actively removed from the regulated pathway during the process of granule maturation. A second major finding of the present study is that a soluble truncated form of CPD is secreted mainly via the constitutive pathway in AtT-20 cells, indicating that the lumenal domain does not contain signals for the sorting of CPD to mature secretory granules. Taken together, these data are consistent with the proposal that CPD participates in the processing of proteins within the TGN and immature secretory vesicles.

Electron microscopic analysis revealed that CPD is present within the TGN and immature secretory granules but is virtually absent from mature granules, suggesting that CPD is actively removed from the regulated pathway during the process of granule maturation. A second major finding of the present study is that a soluble truncated form of CPD is secreted mainly via the constitutive pathway in AtT-20 cells, indicating that the lumenal domain does not contain signals for the sorting of CPD to mature secretory granules. Taken together, these data are consistent with the proposal that CPD participates in the processing of proteins within the TGN and immature secretory vesicles. Most peptide hormones and neurotransmitters are produced from larger precursors by limited proteolysis. Initially, the prohormone precursors are processed at multiple basic amino acid cleavage sites by a family of endoproteases collectively known as prohormone convertases (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; PAM, peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ACTH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

Biochimie. 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The subsequent processing step is mediated by carboxypeptidases, which remove the basic amino acids from the C terminus of the peptide to generate either the bioactive product, or a precursor for the formation of the C-terminal amide group (3Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 4$$Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase E (CPE, also known as carboxypeptidase H and enkephalin convertase) is the major carboxypeptidase involved with the processing of many peptides (3Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 4$$Google Scholar). Within several tissues, CPE has been localized to the peptide-containing secretory granules (5Fricker L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3886-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Docherty K. Hutton J.C.

The involvement of CPE in peptide processing is evident from the finding that fat/fat mice have a reduced ability to convert proinsulin into insulin (8Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). A missense mutation in the CPE gene is the molecular basis for the fat mutation (8Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Although a full-length CPE protein is translated, the protein is inactive due to a point mutation in the coding region of the gene (8Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y.

Despite the absence of functional CPE, the mature forms of numerous neuropeptides are detectable in brain and other tissues of fat/fat mice (8Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M.

The presence of correctly processed peptides indicates that an additional enzyme is able to compensate for the deficiency of CPE. Recently, a second carboxypeptidase designated metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) has been identified in the secretory pathway of bovine pituitary glands (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This protein was independently discovered as gp180, a duck protein that binds duck hepatitis B virus particles (15Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In duck and rat, CPD is present in many tissues (15Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J.

In general, the protein is highly conserved among species, and shows similar enzymatic properties (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human, rat, and duck CPD cDNAs encode proteins that contain three carboxypeptidase-like domains, followed by a transmembrane domain and a 58-residue cytosolic tail. The cytosolic tail contains several consensus routing motifs found in other integral membrane peptide processing enzymes such as furin and peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) (24Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CPD is predominantly located in the TGN, and also cycles between the cell surface and the TGN (25Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-localization of CPD and the TGN endoprotease furin (25Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that these two enzymes may function in the same pathway. We were previously unable to detect CPD in mature secretory granules by light microscopy. As mature secretory vesicles contain many of the peptide processing enzymes (prohormone convertases 1 and 2, CPE, PAM), the lack of detectable CPD in this compartment raised doubts as to whether CPD can participate in peptide processing. Although the processing of some neuropeptides begins in the TGN, immature vesicles appear to be the most productive proteolytic compartments. For example, the processing of proinsulin begins in immature secretory granules in β-cells (26Orci L. Ravazzola M. Storch M.J. Anderson R.G.W. Vassalli J.D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1987; 49: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Also, the generation of ACTH and β-endorphin from the larger precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in AtT-20 cells is predominantly a post-TGN event (27Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Tanaka S. Yora T. Nakayama K. Inoue K. Kurosumi K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although POMC processing may be initiated in the TGN (29Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 30Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 737-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble forms of CPD have been identified in various bovine and rat tissues (17Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The intracellular distribution of the soluble CPD was not previously examined. Interestingly, both the soluble and membrane-associated forms of PAM are packaged into mature secretory granules in AtT-20 cells (32Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), indicating that the lumenal domain of PAM contains sorting information. In the present study, we further characterized the intracellular distribution of CPD using immunoisolation and electron microscopic approaches. We have also examined the intracellular distribution of a soluble truncated form of CPD. Although neither the full-length or the truncated form of CPD are efficiently routed to mature secretory vesicles, both forms are present in immature secretory vesicles. These findings strongly support the proposal that CPD functions in the processing of prohormones and other proteins that transit either the regulated or constitutive secretory pathways. gp180 and gp170 constructs previously described for baculovirus expression (23Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into AtT-20 cells using the standard calcium phosphate procedure (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were selected using 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (G418). Cells expressing both constructs were identified by Western blot analysis. For each of these constructs, several positive clones were selected and analyzed as described below; the data shown are representative of two or three separate clones. The antiserum to duck CPD recognizes both the soluble and membrane-associated forms of the protein (i.e.gp170 and gp180) but does not cross-react with mouse CPD (24Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The antiserum to the C-terminal cytosolic tail of CPD (17Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) recognizes both rat and duck proteins. The antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide of bovine CPE recognizes the mouse protein (9Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antisera to ACTH and β-endorphin that recognize both precursor and processed peptide (31Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. Richard Mains (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The antiserum to TGN38 was a gift of Dr. Sharon Milgram (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), the antiserum to the furin C-terminal tail was a gift of Dr. Ruth Angeletti (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY), the monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 6 was a gift of Jason Bock and Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), the antiserum to PC1 was a gift of Dr. Iris Lindberg (Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA), the antiserum to cathepsin B was a gift of Dr. Regina Kuliawat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), the monoclonal antibody to SNAP-25 was a gift of Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY), and the antiserum to calnexin was a gift of Dr. Ari Helenius (Yale University, New Haven, CT). For immunoisolation, polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal cytosolic tail of CPD were subjected to affinity purification using glutathione S-transferase-CPD cytosolic tail peptide coupled to Sepharose 4B by the standard cyanogen bromide method (Sigma). Affinity-purified antibodies were concentrated to 1 mg/ml in PBS, and used for the immunoisolation procedure as described below. Typically, six confluent 10-cm plates of AtT-20 cells expressing gp180 were used for the immunoisolation. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, scraped from the plates, and gently pelleted at 700 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of cold 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μm aprotonin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 15 μm pepstatin A, 22 μm leupeptin, 14 μm E-64, and 40 μm bestatin). The suspension was passed five times through a 22-gauge needle, and then homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (25 strokes). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 × g twice, and the supernatant was layered onto 4 ml of 1.6 m sucrose and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor (Sorvall) for 1 h at 200,000 ×g. Typically, 1 ml of a microsomal fraction was collected from the interface of the 0.25 and 1.6 m sucrose, and then subjected to immunoisolation. The affinity resin for the immunoisolation was prepared by incubation of 100 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) with 100 μg of affinity-purified antibodies to the CPD C-terminal cytosolic tail. An aliquot (300 μl) of the microsomal fraction was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation with 100 μl of the affinity resin in a final volume of 500 μl containing 140 mm NaCl and the protease inhibitors described above. The Pansorbin resin was recovered by low speed centrifugation and was washed three or four times with the same buffer, and then vesicle-associated proteins were subjected to a detergent elution using 1% Triton X-100. IgG-associated gp180 was eluted from the beads by boiling in 1% SDS gel loading buffer for 5 min. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis using antisera to various secretory pathway proteins at 1:1000 dilution. AtT-20 cells expressing gp170 were labeled with [35S]Met (100 μCi/ml) for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for different periods of time. Media were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and then frozen in 10 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells and the media were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using the antiserum to either duck CPD or CPE as described (30Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 737-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether CPD-containing compartments contain the neuropeptide precursor POMC and its proteolytic fragments, AtT-20 cells expressing gp180 were either continuously incubated with [35S]Met (100 μCi/ml) for 8 h, or pulsed for only 20 min and then chased for 0 or 90 min in the presence of unlabeled Met. Following the labeling, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then subjected to the immunoisolation procedure described above. The resulting fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antisera to either ACTH or β-endorphin, and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide Tricine gels. To examine whether gp170 is secreted via the regulated pathway, the cells expressing gp170 were grown on 35-mm cell culture dishes to 90% confluence. The cells were washed twice with PBS, then treated with the secretagogue 5 mm8-Br-cAMP or control media for 30 min and the secreted proteins analyzed by Western blotting. To examine the regulated secretion of [35S]Met-labeled proteins, cells were labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met, chased for 2 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated for 30 min in either control media or with 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP. The media were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the antiserum to either CPE or duck CPD. Transfected AtT-20 cells were cultured on growth-supporting glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then permeabilized for 15 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After 1 h of blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin, the cells were immunostained for 1 h with the primary antisera (1:1000 dilution). Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse or rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc., 1:200 dilution) for 1 h, followed by extensive PBS washing. Immunofluorescence staining was examined using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Stably transfected AtT-20 cells expressing either gp180 or gp170 were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, then dehydrated, embedded in LR-White resin according to standard procedure, sectioned, and mounted on either gold or nickel grids. Each grid was incubated for 30 min in blocking solution containing 10% goat serum, 2.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS at pH 8.2, and then incubated for 1 h in the same solution containing the antiserum to either duck CPD or CPE (final dilution 1:200). Cells were extensively washed in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and incubated for 2 h with 10-nm colloidal gold (BioCell) coupled to anti-rabbit antibodies in blocking solution (dilution 1:10). After extensive washes, sections were stained for 2 min with uranyl acetate in 30% ethanol and examined with a Jeol 100CX electron microscope. For conventional electron microscopy, the cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, then postfixed in 1% OsO4 and embedded in LR-White resin. To quantitate the intracellular distribution of gp180, gp170, and CPE, electron micrographs that were immunogold-labeled with antibodies to either duck CPD or CPE were scanned in random order. In total, about 1000 gold particles/grid were analyzed, and the percentage of total label that was found in specific compartments was determined. The main morphological criterion to distinguish different subclasses of the secretory granules was the size of the vesicles and the size of the dense cores (34Tooze S.A. Flatmark T. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which were measured from negatives taken at magnification ×54,000. An additional morphological criteria was the presence of the lighter core in immature granules surrounded by a broad electron-lucid peripheral zone (this zone was much broader in granules at the low state of condensation). Light aggregates of condensing proteins were observed in the dilated cisterns of the TGN, consistent with previous studies that formation of the dense core aggregates begins at the level of the TGN in AtT-20 cells (35Tooze J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These electron-dense granules at the low state of condensation, which may represent cross-sections of the TGN or early immature vesicles, had an average diameter of 280 nm and dense cores that were too variable to accurately determine an average. Electron-dense granules at an intermediate state of condensation had an ovoid or spherical shape, and were in the process of detaching or already detached from the TGN. The average diameters of these granules were 170 nm, and their dense cores were 120 nm. These vesicles closely resemble immature secretory granules previously described in AtT-20 cells (35Tooze J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another type of vesicle was found in close proximity to the plasma membrane; these vesicles had a regular spherical shape and highly condensed dense cores, which are characteristic features of mature secretory granules in endocrine cells (35Tooze J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The average diameters of mature secretory granules were typically 150 nm and their dense cores were 110 nm, which is consistent with previous studies on AtT-20 cells (28Tanaka S. Yora T. Nakayama K. Inoue K. Kurosumi K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Matsuuchi L. Buckley K.M. Lowe A.W. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Koedam J.A. Cramer E.M. Briend E. Furie B. Furie B.C. Wagner D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that endogenous CPD is predominately localized to the perinuclear region in AtT-20 cells (25Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To biochemically determine the proteins that co-localize with CPD, we used an immunoisolation technique. For these studies, microsomes from cells stably transfected with full-length duck CPD (gp180) were isolated at the interface between a 1.6 m and a 0.25m sucrose layer (Fig. 1A, Ms). Typically, about 30% of the total gp180 in the cell homogenate was recovered in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 1B). Similarly, 20–30% of the calnexin (an ER membrane protein), SNAP-25 (a plasma membrane protein), and syntaxin-6 (a TGN protein) were also recovered in this microsomal fraction (Fig. 1B). None of these proteins were detected in the 0.25 m or the 1.6 m sucrose layers (Fig. 1B), indicating no enrichment or loss of these organelles during the preparation. For immunoisolation, Pansorbin was precoated with the affinity-purified antibodies to the cytosolic tail of CPD, incubated with the microsomal fraction from AtT-20 cells, and then both bound and non-bound materials were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to various secretory pathway markers (Fig. 1C, right panels). In control experiments, when rabbit IgG was used instead of antibodies to the CPD tail, most of the gp180 immunoreactivity and secretory markers were recovered in non-bound fractions (Fig. 1C, left panels), indicating that nonspecific binding of microsomes to the affinity carrier is very low. When using antibodies to the CPD tail, most of the gp180 (typically >95%) is recovered in the bound fraction (Fig. 1C, top). Furin, TGN38, and syntaxin 6, which have been previously localized to the TGN and immature secretory granules (38Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 39Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 40Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), are exclusively associated with gp180-containing vesicles (Fig. 1C, right panels). In contrast to the TGN proteins, CPE and PC1 which were previously found within mature secretory granules (5Fricker L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3886-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 41Guest P.C. Ravazzola M. Davidson H.W. Orci L. Hutton J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Hornby P.J. Rosenthal S.D. Mathis J.P. Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Neuroendocrinology. 1993; 58: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), demonstrate only a partial co-localization with the gp180 compartment (Fig. 1C, right panel). Typically, 20–30% of CPE, and 40–50% of PC1 were recovered in non-bound fractions. To further validate the specificity of our immunoisolation technique, we probed bound and non-bound fractions with antibodies to cathepsin B, calnexin, and SNAP-25 (Fig. 1C). Cathepsin B and SNAP-25 are exclusively recovered in the non-bound fraction (Fig. 1C), indicating that lysosomes and plasma membrane are not present in the immunoisolates. Approximately 30% of the calnexin is associated with the CPD-containing compartment (Fig. 1C), consistent with the expectation that the ER contains newly synthesized CPD. The finding that the plasma membrane and ER membrane proteins are not efficiently isolated in the CPD-containing organelles further suggests that co-sedimentation of the TGN proteins and gp180 is not due to nonspecific binding of membrane proteins to the affinity resin. Identical immunoisolation procedure using wild type AtT-20 cells demonstrated a similar distribution of the various secretory pathway markers (data not shown), indicating that this pattern of distribution is not due to overexpression of gp180 in AtT-20 cells. To test whether the CPD-containing compartments contain the neuropeptide precursors or their proteolytic fragments, AtT-20 cells were labeled with [35S]Met for 8 h and then subjected to the immunoisolation procedure with antibodies to the CPD cytosolic tail. To reduce the possibility of nonspecific proteolysis, a mixture of protease inhibitors was included throughout the isolation procedure. Typically, 30–40% of the total POMC and POMC-derived material was recovered in the microsomal fraction (data not shown). Pansorbin-bound and non-bound materials were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies either against ACTH or β-endorphin. The antisera against ACTH used in the present study recognizes both POMC and its processed product (31Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically 70–80% of the ACTH (both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms) was recovered in the bound fraction (Fig. 2A, right panel). In experiments with control IgG, most of the ACTH is found in the non-bound fraction (Fig. 2A, left panel), although the 30-kDa POMC shows some nonspecific binding (Fig. 2A, left panel). When immunoisolated material was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to β-endorphin, the bulk of the β-endorphin-reactive material was recovered in the bound fraction (data not shown). As an additional control for nonspecific proteolysis, we also immunoprecipitated the immunoreactive ACTH peptides in the homogenate, intermediate fractions and microsomes, prior to the vesicle immunoisolation. All fractions showed similar relative amounts of ACTH versus the larger peptides, indicating that no significant proteolysis of POMC o"

Mutational evidence strongly suggested that phenylacetate is converted to homogentisate through two sequential hydroxylating reactions in positions 2 and 5 of the aromatic ring. Using cDNA substraction techniques, we have characterized a gene, denoted phacA, whose transcription is strongly induced by phenylacetate and which putatively encodes a cytochrome P450 protein. A disrupted phacA strain does not grow on phenylacetate but grows on 2-hydroxy- or 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate. Microsomal extracts of the disrupted strain are deficient in the NADPH-dependent conversion of phenylacetate to 2-hydroxyphenylacetate. We conclude that PhacA catalyzes theortho-hydroxylation of phenylacetate, the first step ofA. nidulans phenylacetate catabolism. The involvement of a P450 enzyme in the ortho-hydroxylation of a monoaromatic compound has no precedent.

Aerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons by microbes involves the action of oxygenases (enzymes that incorporate one or two atoms from dioxygen into substrates) acting at two different levels in specific catabolic pathways (1Harayama S. Kok M. Neidle E.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 565-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 2Harayama S. Timmis K.N. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1992: 99-155Google Scholar). First, oxygenase enzymes acting at the upstream segment of these pathways incorporate one (monooxygenases, aromatic ring hydroxylases) or two (aromatic ring dioxygenases) oxygen atoms into the aromatic substrate as hydroxyl groups, preparing the ring for a subsequent ring-opening step. In this second step, the dihydroxylated aromatic ring is opened by ring-cleavage dioxygenases. Monooxygenases are a mechanistically diverse group of enzymes (1Harayama S. Kok M. Neidle E.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 565-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) including, for example, flavoproteins such asp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (3Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), multicomponent enzymes such as Pseudomonas mendocina toluene 4-monoxygenase, in which one of the terminal hydroxylase polypeptides contains a binuclear iron cluster (4Whited G.M. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3010-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), or heme-containing cytochrome P450 systems. Monooxygenases of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (5Nelson D.R.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) are widely distributed among living organisms and catalyze a multiplicity of biosynthetic and catabolic reactions, usually with narrow substrate specificity, including the hydroxylation of a variety of lipophylic drugs. In common with other saprophytic microbes, the genetically amenable, obligate aerobic fungus Aspergillus nidulans shows notable metabolic versatility. For example, it can use the aromatic hydrocarbon compound phenylacetate (PhAc) 1The abbreviations used are: PhAc, phenylacetate; CYP, cytochrome P450; kbp, kilobase pair(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. as sole carbon source. Despite the abundant information available on the catabolic pathways of other aromatic compounds, which have been extensively studied in bacteria, our understanding of PhAc degradation pathways is scarce. In Pseudomonas putida U, it is known that PhAc is degraded through phenylacetyl-CoA (7Olivera E.R. Minambres B. Garcı́a B. Muñiz C. Moreno M.A. Fernández A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. Luengo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6419-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), although the ring cleavage steps remain uncharacterized. In A. nidulans, PhAc degradation proceeds through 2,5-dihydroxy-PhAc (homogentisate, see Fig. 1). The three structural genes mediating the conversion of homogentisate to Krebs cycle intermediates (i.e. the “lower” PhAc pathway) have been characterized (8–10,) but the steps leading to homogentisate have not yet been reported. We describe here mutational and molecular analysis showing that A. nidulans PhAc catabolism proceeds via homogentisate through two sequential hydroxylating steps, of which the first is the 2-hydroxylation of the ring catalyzed by a novel cytochrome P450. Targeted inactivation of this gene results in penicillin overproduction. A nidulans strains carried markers in standard use (11Clutterbuck A.J. O'Brien S.J. Genetic Maps. Locus Maps of Complex Genomes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 3.71-3.84Google Scholar). Standard media for A. nidulans (12Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for strain maintenance, growth tests, and transformation. Complementation tests were carried out in constructed diploids. A biA1 strain was the source of cDNA, and a biA1 methG1 argB2 strain was the recipient strain for phacAgene disruption. A biA1 methG1 strain was used as wild type control in experiments with the disrupted strains. Culture conditions inducing high levels of expression of the PhAc catabolic genes have been described (13Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were used to grow mycelia for protein extraction. PhAc and its monohydroxy and dihydroxy derivatives were used as sole carbon source at 10 mm (although homogentisate was occasionally used at 25–50 mm), and 10 mmammonium chloride was used as sole nitrogen source. 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorophenylacetate at a 5 mm concentration were shown to prevent growth of A. nidulans in the presence of a derepressing carbon source, indicating that their catabolism was toxic for the mold. However, some residual growth was observed when plates were incubated for more than 3 days at 37 °C. Sectors of markedly more vigorous mycelia frequently arose after prolonged incubation. Although the reason why catabolism of these PhAc derivatives results in toxicity is not clear, preliminary tests showed that mutations preventing the toxicity of 2- and 3-fluorophenylacetate also prevented the catabolism of PhAc. Therefore, conidiospores of ayA2 pantoB100 strain were plated to obtain isolated colonies, which were transferred to minimal medium with 0.05% lactose (w/v) as carbon source in the presence of 5 mm 2- or 3-fluorophenylacetate. Sectors with more vigorous growth were purified and tested for the utilization of different PhAc derivatives as sole carbon source. Two major classes were found, which were denoted class I and II (see “Results”). A pUC18-based plasmid denoted pPhacA::argB was constructed by standard techniques. This plasmid contains (starting from the lacZ promoter in pUC18) 0.94 kbp of the phacA upstream region sequentially followed by its genomic coding region up to codon 297, a genomic, 3.2-kbp fragment containing an argB + allele, the genomic sequence of phacA corresponding to codons 393–518, and finally 1.2 kbp of the phacA 3′-downstream region. This insert was purified from the plasmid after digestion withEcoRI and used for transformation (14Tilburn J. Scazzocchio C. Taylor G.G. Zabicky-Zissman J.H. Lockington R.A. Davies R.W. Gene. 1983; 26: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Transformed (arginine-independent) clones in which the resident phacAgene had been replaced by the transforming fragment were identified by Southern analysis. The mutated allele would encode a protein truncated at residue 297 and therefore would lack the predicted region involved in heme binding. phacA cDNA clones were obtained by differential screening of a cDNA library enriched in PhAc-induced transcripts, as described (8Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9132-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Seven cDNA clones were obtained. The insert of one such clone was used to isolate genomic clones from a standard λEMBL4 library. Cross-hybridizing sequences were mapped to two contiguous BamHI fragments, 2.4 kb and 1.9 kb long (aBamHI site was shown to split the phacA open reading frame). Nucleotide sequencing and comparison of genomic and cDNA clones revealed the intron-exon organization of the gene and showed that all seven cDNA clones were incomplete at the N-terminal coding region, the longest of which (at the 5′-end) ended within predicted codon 6. cDNAs including the predicted initiation codon were obtained by direct polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA library using an internal phacA primer and λgt10-specific primers followed by a second polymerase chain reaction reaction primed with the above internal oligonucleotide and a second oligonucleotide ending 1 nucleotide upstream of the ATG codon. The presence of the ATG codon in the resulting cDNA product (and the absence of introns between codons 1 and 6) was confirmed by sequencing. Mycelia from the isogenic ΔphacA and phacA strains were pregrown in glucose minimal medium, washed, transferred to 10 mm PhAc minimal medium, and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C to induce transcription of genes for PhAc catabolism (13Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by filtration, washed, resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and disrupted with a glass bead beater (Braun, 0.5-mm glass beads) at 4 °C. Crude extracts were clarified after centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 15 min. Microsomal pellets were recovered after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. These extracts contained 1–4 mg/ml protein. Enzyme activities of the microsomal extract were determined using standard procedures (15Strobel H.W. Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 16Benveniste I. Lesot A. Hasenfratz M.P. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was assayed in 1-ml reactions at 25 °C with 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, following the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c (0.05 mm initial concentration; ε550 = 21 mm−1 cm−1) or ferrycyanide (0.5 mm initial concentration; ε420 = 1.02) by the decrease of absorbance at 550 nm and 420 nm, respectively. PhAc 2-hydroxylase was assayed by measuring the formation of 2-hydroxy-PhAc in a reaction that required PhAc (added at 1 mm) and NADPH (also at 1 mm) in the presence of a microsomal fraction. 2-Hydroxy-PhAc was chemically determined using diazotized 4-nitroaniline essentially as described (17Sugumaran M. Vaidyanathan C.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1979; 5: 427-430Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Absorbance was read at 550 nm and converted to nmol of 2-hydroxy-PhAc using a reference plot. The range of linear response was 1–100 nmol of 2-hydroxy-PhAc. This method also detected 3-hydroxy-PhAc, and therefore, the identity of the reaction product as 2-hydroxy-PhAc was confirmed by direct HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures (see “Results”). Proteins were precipitated in the presence of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and 10 μl samples were injected into a Nucleosil 300–5 C18 column (250 × 4 mm) coupled to a 11 × 4-mm precursor column of this support, using as mobile phase (at 0.6 ml/min) a solution containing 50 mm monohydrogen potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm trifluoroacetic acid, and 8% (v/v) acetonitrile. Detection was at 220 nm. Cultures for penicillin production were inoculated with spores of the ΔphacA or thephacA + strain in penicillin production broth (18Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with 2% lactose as the main carbon source, 2.5% (w/v) corn steep liquor, and the indicated concentrations of sodium phenylacetate. Flasks were shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C. Samples were taken at different time points and used to measure penicillin using a bioassay with Micrococcus luteus, with penicillin G as standard (18Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We found that 2-, 3-, or 4-fluoro-PhAc prevents A. nidulans growth on 0.05% (w/v) lactose as carbon source. We therefore selected mutations resulting in fluorophenylacetate resistance, assuming that they would prevent PhAc utilization and following Apirion (19Apirion D. Genet. Res. 1965; 6: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), who used fluoroacetate resistance to select acetate nonutilizing mutants. Mutations preventing PhAc utilization (phac) were efficiently selected with 2-fluorophenylacetate. They were recessive in diploids, indicating that they represent loss-of-function mutations. They were classified in two major classes. Class I mutants did not grow on PhAc but grew on 2-hydroxy-PhAc or 2,5-dihydroxy-PhAc. By contrast, class II mutants did not grow on either PhAc or 2-hydroxy-PhAc but grew on 2,5-dihydroxy-PhAc. Class I or II mutations did not affect growth on acetate, Phe, Tyr, 3- or 4-hydroxy-PhAc, and 3,4-dihydroxy-PhAc, showing that they specifically prevented PhAc catabolism. Mutations in class I complemented class II mutations. As 2,5-dihydroxy-PhAc is known to be an intermediate of PhAc catabolism (8Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9132-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these data are consistent with the pathway shown in Fig. 1 in which PhAc is converted into homogentisate through two hydroxylating reactions, prevented by class I and class II mutations, respectively. We have previously used a differential screening procedure of a subtracted cDNA library to isolate cDNA clones representing transcripts induced by PhAc (8Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9132-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This collection of cDNAs included clones for the three genes (fahA,maiA, and hmgA) of the lower PhAc pathway (Fig. 1; Refs. 8Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9132-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Among the remaining cDNA clones, those that did not represent these previously described genes were identified and classified by restriction enzyme mapping and/or partial cDNA sequencing. Seven overlapping cDNAs represented a novel PhAc-induced transcript whose gene was named phacA and which contained an open reading frame putatively encoding a 518-residue polypeptide (M r 58,495). DNA sequencing of genomic clones showed that the phacA-coding region is interrupted by three introns, 65, 56, and 53 nucleotides long. The nucleotide sequence of phacA and the amino acid sequence of its derived protein product have been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank data bases under accession number AJ132442. Blastp searches against nonredundant Swissprot+Translation of EMBL nucleotide sequence data bases revealed that all 20 entries showing the highest amino acid sequence identity to PhacA were cytochrome P450 proteins of the CYP1 family (of which 19 were CYP1A1 P450s), including mammalian and fish proteins but only a single human CYP. Identity levels were in the 25% range, with the highest identity (27.4% in a 465 residue overlap) shown by a Sparus aurata (gilthead sea bream) P450 protein. Cytochromes P450 are heme-thiolate enzymes, and PhacA residues 431 to 439 contain the peptide motif Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Gly (where Xaa indicates any amino acid), which is involved in heme binding in proteins of this class (6Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). We conclude that phacA encodes a cytochrome P450. The above levels of identity are below those required to place it in an already existing family (>40% identity required (5Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar)). Therefore, PhacA defines a new family of these proteins. 2David R. Nelson, personal communication. It has been denoted CYP504 using the current P450 nomenclature system. phacAtranscript levels were analyzed by Northern analysis in cells grown in glucose and subsequently transferred to minimal media, each containing a different carbon source. This analysis (Fig. 2) showed that phacAtranscription is strongly induced by PhAc and largely repressed by glucose (PhAc plus glucose, Fig. 2). The transcript was absent in cells transferred to glucose alone or to gluconeogenic substrates acetate or glutamate. 2-Hydroxy-PhAc was also a strong inducer (although less so than PhAc), and 3-hydroxy-PhAc was a weak inducer. 4-Hydroxy-PhAc, 2,5-, or 3,4-dihydroxy-PhAc did not induce phacAtranscription. Notably, Phe (but not Tyr) induced phacAtranscription to some extent. These results support the contention thatphacA is involved in PhAc catabolism. To confirm the involvement of PhacA in PhAc catabolism, we constructed a disruption-deletionphacA mutation by reverse genetics. We transformed anargB2 arginine-requiring strain with a linear DNA fragment carrying a mutated phacA gene in which a 3.2-kbp fragment containing an argB + allele replaced a 289-base pair NaeI-KpnI phacA genomic fragment including codons 298–392 (see Fig. 3). This mutant phacA gene would encode a PhacA protein truncated at residue 297 and therefore lacking the 221 C-terminal residues, which include the essential Cys-containing peptide motif involved in heme binding. Homokaryotic transformant clones were purified after repeated streaking on medium lacking arginine and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. Two transformants showing an identical hybridization pattern consistent with the integration event shown in Fig. 3 were chosen for further analyses. Both grew normally on 0.05% (w/v) lactose but, in contrast to the wild type, showed residual growth (similar to that observed in the absence of a carbon source) on PhAc-minimal medium (Fig. 3), showing that PhacA is indeed involved in PhAc catabolism. By contrast, both transformants were able to grow on 2-hydroxy-PhAc (Fig. 3). These data indicate that PhacA is involved in the ortho-hydroxylation of PhAc. The disruption-deletion mutation (denoted ΔphacA) was recessive in diploids (in agreement with its predicted loss-of-function phenotype) and did not complement phac-4, a prototype of classical class I mutations that, in common with ΔphacA, leads to inability to use PhAc but allows growth on 2-hydroxy-PhAc. phac-4 is therefore a phacA allele that we renamedphacA4. Most eukaryotic cytochromes P450 are microsomal enzymes. Electrons are transferred to their catalytic heme center from (NADPH)-cytochrome P450 reductase, a microsomal enzyme containing FAD and FMN (see Fig. 4A). We prepared microsomal fractions from wild type and ΔphacAcells induced with PhAc, which showed similar (NADPH)-cytochrome P450 reductase activity, as assayed by the NADPH-dependent reduction of artificial electron acceptors such as ferricyanide or cytochrome c (20Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The correspondingphacA + and ΔphacA soluble fractions showed similar, high levels of homogentisate dioxygenase (a soluble enzyme of the PhAc degradation pathway, data not shown), indicating the equivalent induction of PhAc catabolism in both strains. Following incubation in vitro of wild type microsomes with PhAc and NADPH, we detected the formation of a monohydroxylated PhAc derivative using a chemical detection method ((Fig. 4A; see “Experimental Procedures”). Direct HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed that this compound was 2-hydroxy-PhAc and that its formation was absolutely dependent on the presence of both PhAc and NADPH (Fig. 4B). This showed that A. nidulansmicrosomes contain a phenylacetate ortho-hydroxylating activity. This activity was markedly and reproducibly reduced but not abolished by the ΔphacA mutation (Fig. 4, A andB). Finally, wild type mycelia pregrown in glucose and transferred to media containing PhAc secreted 2-hydroxy-PhAc to the culture supernatant (Fig. 5). In agreement with the above in vitro assays, secretion of 2-hydroxy-PhAc was also markedly reduced, but not abolished, by theΔphacA mutation (Fig. 5). All these data, together with the growth characteristics of the ΔphacA strain (see above), strongly support the conclusion that phacA encodes a phenylacetate 2-hydroxylase and that a second, minor enzyme showing this activity is present in A. nidulans microsomes (see “Discussion”). Penicillin-producing filamentous fungi use PhAc (activated as a CoA thioester) as a precursor for penicillin G biosynthesis. PhAc is exchanged with the l-aminoadipyl moiety of isopenicillin N to yield penicillin G in a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA::isopenicillin N-acyltransferase (see Ref. 21Luengo J.M. Peñalva M.A. Martinelli S.D. Kinghorn J.R. Aspergillus: 50 Years On. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 603-638Google Scholar for review). PhAc cannot be synthesized by fungi, and therefore it has to be fed to penicillin cultures. We reasoned that the PhAc degradation pathway would compete with the penicillin biosynthetic pathway for PhAc, suggesting that interrupting the initial step of the degradation pathway may improve the incorporation of PhAc into penicillins. This prediction was confirmed with the two aboveΔphacA strains, which in independent experiments reproducibly showed a marked elevation in penicillin production over the wild type. Fig. 6 shows one such experiment, illustrating how the increase is already evident in cultures supplemented with 0.125% (w/v) PhAc (1.8 μg/ml in the wild type, 5.2 μg/ml in the ΔphacA strain). Moreover, reduction of PhAc to 0.0625% (w/v) resulted in nearly a 40% decrease in wild type penicillin production but had no decreasing effect in mutant strain production (Fig. 6; for simplicity, results with only one of the two disrupted strains are shown; see the legend). Under such conditions, the ΔphacA mutation resulted in a 4.9-fold increase in penicillin production. We have analyzed the “upper pathway” of PhAc catabolism (i.e. the conversion of PhAc to homogentisate, Fig. 1) in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. Mutational and molecular evidence strongly indicates that this conversion proceeds via two sequential hydroxylating steps, the first of which is a 2-hydroxylation of the aromatic ring catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase encoded by the phacA gene. First, we have isolated a class of mutations preventing growth on PhAc but allowing growth on 2-hydroxy-PhAc or homogentisate as sole carbon source. Second, we describe a gene, denoted phacA, whose inactivation results in the same phenotype as the above mutations. This ΔphacAmutation does not complement with a prototypical classical mutation of the above class, indicating that both affect the same gene. Third,phacA encodes a CYP (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase). CYP enzymes are usually involved in a variety of biosynthetic and catabolic hydroxylating reactions (5Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, 6Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), in agreement with the predicted PhacA function. Fourth, phacA + microsomal extracts catalyze the PhAc- and NADPH-dependent synthesis of 2-hydroxy-PhAc. By contrast, a mutant ΔphacA microsomal fraction is markedly deficient in this reaction. An A. nigermicrosomal, NADPH-dependent phenylacetate-2-monooxygenase activity previously reported by others (17Sugumaran M. Vaidyanathan C.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1979; 5: 427-430Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) is possibly encoded by aphacA homologue. In agreement with our Northern analysis, such activity was detected in phenylacetate-grown cells and absent from glucose-grown cells (17Sugumaran M. Vaidyanathan C.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1979; 5: 427-430Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The ΔphacA mutation constructed here is almost certainly a null mutation, which strongly suggested that the residual PhAc 2-hydroxylase activity that we detected with ΔphacAmicrosomal extracts is encoded by a different gene. We have identified the gene (denoted pshA) encoding this minor activity. 3J. M. Mingot, M. A. Peñalva, and J. M. Fernández-Cañón, unpublished results. In agreement with our prediction, a double ΔphacA ΔpshAmutation abolished microsomal PhAc 2-hydroxylation.3 A ΔpshA strain grows on PhAc but does not grow on 3-hydroxy-PhAc (which in the wild type is also catabolized through homogentisate), indicating that pshA encodes a 3-hydroxy-PhAc 6-hydroxylase (i.e. andortho-hydroxylase), converting 3-hydroxy-PhAc to 2,5-dihydroxy-PhAc. This enzyme has been previously described in the fungus Trichosporum cutaneum, which converts PhAc to homogentisate through sequential hydroxylation of positions 3 and 6 of the ring (22Anderson J.J. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes have multiple cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyzing a variety of oxidative reactions. Such abundance is not found in the microbial world. For example, only three CYP genes are found in the genome of S. cerevisiae (23van den Brink H.M. van Gorcom R.F. van den Hondel C.A. Punt P.J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 23: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The marked metabolic versatility of filamentous fungi would suggest a greater variety of CYP enzymes in their proteomes. In addition tophacA, four stc genes of the A. nidulans sterigmatocystin biosynthetic cluster encode CYP enzymes (24Brown D.W. Yu J.H. Kelkar H.S. Fernandes M. Nesbitt T.C. Keller N.P. Adams T.H. Leonard T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The closely related organism A. niger has a very specific benzoate-4 hydroxylase enzyme, encoded by the bphAgene (25van Gorcom R.F. Boschloo J.G. Kuijvenhoven A. Lange J. van Vark A.J. Bos C.J. van Balken J.A. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, PhacA and BphA each define a new CYP family, suggesting that metabolically versatile saprophytic fungi may represent an as yet unexplored source of variability for CYP enzymes catalyzing novel metabolic reactions. Industrial penicillin production by Penicillium chrysogenumstrains requires the addition of PhAc, which is the side-chain precursor for the synthesis of penicillin G. Part of the added PhAc is oxidized (26Hockenhull D.J.D. Walker A.D. Wilkin J.D. Winder F.G. Biochemistry. 1951; 50: 605-609Google Scholar), and it is not transformed into penicillin. Therefore, strain improvement programs using mutation and selection techniques have been directed to prevent such oxidation (27Lein J. Vanek Z. Hostalek Z. Overproduction of Microbial Metabolites. Butterworths, Stoneham, MA1986: 105-139Google Scholar). Engineered expression in P. chrysogenum of a bacterial phenylacetyl-CoA ligase leading to increased levels of phenylacetyl-CoA available for penicillin biosynthesis resulted in penicillin overproduction (28Minambres B. Martı́nez Blanco H. Olivera E.R. Garcia B. Diez B. Barredo J.L. Moreno M.A. Schleissner C. Salto F. Luengo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We show here that targeted disruption of the gene mediating the first step of A. nidulans PhAc catabolism results in a 3- to 5-fold increase in penicillin production and makes the recombinant strain less dependent on the external supply of PhAc. This presumably results from increased availability of phenylacetate for penicillin G biosynthesis. A P. chrysogenum phacA homologue has been identified. Therefore, these results pave the way for the improvement of P. chrysogenum industrial strains using a similar methodology. We thank E. Reoyo for technical assistance, Brian Nowak-Thompson, Eduardo Dı́ez, and José Luis Garcı́a for critical reading of the manuscript, Beatriz Galán and Auxi Prieto for their advice with HPLC analysis, and David R.

The DHCR gene was mapped to chromosome 8q2.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Rat DHCR, calculated molecular mass of 54.15-kDa polypeptide, shares a close amino acid identity with mouse and human DHCRs (96 and 87%, respectively) as compared with its other related proteins (e.g. fungal sterol Δ14-reductase) and exhibits high hydrophobicity (>68%) with 9 transmembrane domains. Five putative sterol-sensing domains were predicted to be localized in transmembrane domains 4–8, which are highly homologous to those found in 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, and patched protein. The polypeptide encoded by DHCR cDNA was expressed in yeast as a 55.45-kDa myc-tagged fusion protein, which was recognized with anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and shown to possess full DHCR activity with respect to dependence on NADPH and sensitivity to DHCR inhibitors. Northern blot analysis indicates that the highest expression of DHCR mRNA was detected in liver, followed by kidney and brain. In rat brains, the highest level of mRNA encoding DHCR was detected in the midbrain, followed by the spinal cord and medulla. Feeding rats 5% cholestyramine plus 0.1% lovastatin in chow resulted in both approximately a 3-fold induction of DHCR mRNA and a 5-fold increase of the enzymic activity in the liver. When rats were fed 0.1% (w/w) AY-9944 (in chow) for 14-days, a complete inhibition of DHCR activity and a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol level were observed. However, the level of hepatic DHCR mRNA fell only slightly, suggesting that AY-9944 may act more rapidly at the protein level than at the level of transcription of the DHCR gene under these conditions.

It has been suggested that the 19-step conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol in mammals begins with C14-demethylation and is followed by C14-reduction, C4-demethylation, C8→7 isomerization, C24-reduction, C5-desaturation, and C7-reduction (see Fig. 1) (1Gaylor J.L.

The enzymes involved in this pathway (e.g. lanosterol 14α-demethylase) are major targets for various lipid-lowering drugs, and mutations in the genes encoding these enzymes can lead to sterol-related genetic diseases such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) 1The abbreviations used are: SLOS, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome; DHCR, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; kb, kilobase(s); ORF, open reading frame; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; SSD, sterol-sensing domain; AY-9944, trans1,4-bis(2-chlorobenzylaminomethyl)cyclohexane dihydrochloride; BM15. 766, 4(2-(1-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-piperazin-4-ylethyl)-benzoic acid; CL-diet, 5% cholestyramine plus 0.1% lovastatin in normal chow; IC50, a concentration of inhibitor required for 50% inhibition; lanosterol, 4,4′,14α-trimethyl-5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol; lathosterol, 5α-cholesta-7-en-3β-ol; PTC, patched protein; tamoxifen, trans-2-[4-(1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethylamine; U18666A, 3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one. 1The abbreviations used are: SLOS, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome; DHCR, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; kb, kilobase(s); ORF, open reading frame; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; SSD, sterol-sensing domain; AY-9944, trans1,4-bis(2-chlorobenzylaminomethyl)cyclohexane dihydrochloride; BM15. 766, 4(2-(1-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-piperazin-4-ylethyl)-benzoic acid; CL-diet, 5% cholestyramine plus 0.1% lovastatin in normal chow; IC50, a concentration of inhibitor required for 50% inhibition; lanosterol, 4,4′,14α-trimethyl-5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol; lathosterol, 5α-cholesta-7-en-3β-ol; PTC, patched protein; tamoxifen, trans-2-[4-(1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethylamine; U18666A, 3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one. because of mutation in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR) gene (3Fitzky B.U.

The sequences for each protein from GenBank™ are indicated in parentheses: Chinese hamster sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage activation protein SCAP (280–446, GenBank™ accession number U67060); Chinese hamster 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (57–224, GenBank™ accession number L00165); mouse Niemann-Pick type C1 (617–791, GenBank™ accession number AF003348); PTC (420–589, GenBank™ accession number U46155). The alignment of these sequences with rat DHCR was performed using CLUSTALW. Two genomicEcoRI-HindIII fragments, 0.16 and 1.6 kb in length, that mainly included the coding and spacer region of 5 S rRNA, respectively, were used for fluorescence in situhybridization analysis. The fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pUC119. The 0.16-kb fragment, which was derived from SD rats, included a 121-bp gene for mouse 5 S rRNA, which was amplified from total genomic DNA with the primers 5′-TGTCGGCGCCGCCCGCCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGAGACAGAGGGGAGTCCAA-3′. One genomic DNA fragment of DHCR gene was also prepared by polymerase chain reaction using rat genomic DNA as template and the primers derived from rat genomic sequences covering the 5′ end of exon 5 (5′-CATAGCAACGGGATCCA-3′) and the 3′ end (5′-CGTAGCCTTTCACCAAA-3′) of exon 6 (2.1-kb size: 17 bp of exon 5, 2030 bp of intron, and 17 bp of exon 6) of rat gene. 2J. N. Lee and Paik, Y.-K., unpublished data. The probe was labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of R-banded chromosomes and fluorescence in situhybridization were performed as described (36Matsuda Y. Harada Y.N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rat DHCR cDNA was subcloned into c-myc-tagged yeast episomal plasmid c-myc-YEp351ADC1, and transformation of S. cerevisiae JB811 (ade2–1 leu2–3, 112 pep4–3 trp1–289 ura3–52) was performed as described (33Moebius F.F.

Cells were harvested at an A 600of 1.2 and lysed with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. For the preparation of microsomes, the lysates were spun for 5 min at 500 × g (4 °C), and the supernatant was pelleted for 45 min at 100,000 × g(4 °C) as described (33Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Lee J.N. Paik Y.-K. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with a 9E10 c-myc monoclonal antibody following SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis was exactly the same as described previously (33Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Lee J.N. Paik Y.-K. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250-g body weight) were maintained on a standard rodent chow under a reverse light cycle (light 6:00 p.m-6:00 a.m.; dark 6:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.) as described previously (30Kim C.-K. Jeon K.-I. Lim D.-M. Johng T.-N. Trzaskos J.M. Gaylor J.L. Paik Y.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the diet feeding experiments, each diet-fed group (4 to 5 rats/group) was fasted for 12 h and then fed diets supplemented with various agents such as 5% cholestyramine plus 0.1% lovastatin (CL-diet) in or 0.1% AY-9944 in chow for 14 days (30Kim C.-K. Jeon K.-I. Lim D.-M. Johng T.-N. Trzaskos J.M. Gaylor J.L. Paik Y.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At the end of the treatment, the rats were fasted for 24 h and killed by CO2inhalation. Blood was drawn by heart puncture and analyzed for serum lipids. The plasma serum cholesterol was determined by an automatic analyzer Hitachi 7150. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated from the method of Friedewald formulation (38Mackness M.I. Durrington P.N. Lipoprotein Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-42Google Scholar). Rats that had been fed under various diet conditions were killed by decapitation at the midpoint of the dark period (10 p.m. for rats), and their livers were excised and processed for microsome preparation as described previously (30Kim C.-K. Jeon K.-I. Lim D.-M. Johng T.-N. Trzaskos J.M. Gaylor J.L. Paik Y.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A standard assay for DHCR was carried out using 300 μm substrate (ergosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, or lathosterol) that had been suspended in the detergent Tween 80 (70:1, detergent:sterol) and 1 to 2 mg of microsomal protein as described (7Lee J.-N. Paik Y.-K. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 30: 370-377Google Scholar). For the in vitro inhibition experiments for both rat liver microsomes and yeast overexpressed protein, drugs or agents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) such that the final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.3% (w/v) that of the incubation mixture (2Bae S.-H. Paik Y.-K. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sterol concentration in enzyme assay samples was measured in a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph 5890 II or a Young-In GC520 gas chromatograph (Seoul, Korea) (FID, capillary column; SAC-5, 5% diphenyl, 95% dimethylsiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm inner diameter, flow rate 2.44 ml/min) using 5α-cholestane as a standard (30Kim C.-K. Jeon K.-I. Lim D.-M. Johng T.-N. Trzaskos J.M. Gaylor J.L. Paik Y.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Kang M.-K. Kim C.-K. Johng T.-N. Paik Y.-K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the effects of diet on DHCR gene expression, total RNA from liver of either CL-diet, AY-9944-fed, or normal diet-fed rats were prepared with total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Fifteen μg of each tissue RNA were separated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in 30% (v/v) formaldehyde and blotted. RNAs were probed with 32P-labeled rat DHCR cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF071500). A rat β-actin cDNA probe was used as a control. After hybridization (42 °C, 50% (v/v) formamide), blots were washed at low stringency (e.g. 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 22 °C). Rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) and Multiple Choice™ Rat Brain Northern Blot (Origen) were probed with [32P]-labeled rat DHCR cDNA. The blots were exposed to Hyper x-ray film with intensifying screens at −70 °C for longer than 48 h. The bands that appeared in the blots were quantitatively analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics 425DE PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT program. DHCR mRNA signals obtained from different tissues by the Northern blot hybridization were normalized to those of β-actin mRNA expression. Screening of a rat liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) with the human cDNA probe yielded three positive clones (i.e. 7B-3-1, 7B-1-1, and 7-5) (Fig. 2A) of approximately >3.0 × 106 plaques screened. The nucleotide sequences of these clones were determined on both strands and revealed that all of these clones (e.g.clone 7B-3-1) encode the rat DHCR cDNA (Fig. 2B). The DHCR cDNA (clone 7B-3-1) is 2356 nucleotides long and consists of a 48-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region followed by a 1416-nucleotide coding region and a 892-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region. As expected, the nucleotide sequence of rat DHCR showed highest homology with mouse DHCR. That is, the coding region (ORF) of the cDNA sequence (1416 nucleotides) showed 96, 87, and 36% identity with mouse (GenBank™ accession number AF057368), human (GenBank™ accession numberAF034544), and Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank™ accession number U49398) DHCR cDNA sequences, respectively. Unlike human DHCR cDNA, which has an additional polyadenylation site, rat DHCR cDNA contains only a single polyadenylation site, similar to the mouse ortholog (3Fitzky B.U. Witsch-Baumgartner M. Erdel M. Lee J.N. Paik Y.-K. Glossmann H. Utermann G. Moebius F.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8181-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the rat DHCR mRNA sequence is that it contains an exceptionally long 3′-untranslated region (892 nucleotides), indicating the polyadenylation site is quite distant from the termination codon. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat DHCR (Fig. 2B) predicts a 471-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 54,155 Da, quite similar to the human (475 amino acid (33Moebius F.F.

At the polypeptide level, the rat DHCR ORF shows 96 and 87% identity to the mouse and human DHCR polypeptides over 471 amino acids (TableI). The relatively high degree of sequence similarity in ORF between DHCRs of different species suggests that they may be involved in fundamental physiological processes that are evolutionarily conserved between animals and plants. There is also a significant degree of similarity between the amino acid sequence of DHCR and related proteins (Table I). In particular, a relatively high similarity is seen between DHCR and fungal sterol Δ14-reductase (47%) (39LeCain E. Chenivesse X. Spagnoli R. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10866-10873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), human lamin B receptor (48%), which has been suggested as a putative sterol Δ14-reductase (41Silve S.

https://openalex.org/W2144413274,"Syndecan-4 is a unique member of the syndecan gene family that has the ability to bind and activate protein kinase C-α. Whereas increased syndecan-4 levels have been noted in ischemic hearts, little is known regarding the regulation of its expression. To investigate the role of cardiac myocytes in induction of syndecan-4 expression, human endothelial cells (ECV304) were exposed to a medium conditioned by primary mouse cardiac myocytes or H9c2 cells. The medium conditioned by hypoxic but not normal myocytes was able to induce syndecan-4 expression in ECV cells. Western analysis of the conditioned medium demonstrated an increased presence of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the medium conditioned by hypoxic but not normal myoblasts. Primary cardiac myocytes collected from the wild type C57/129 but not the homozygous TNF-α−/− knockout mice were able to induce syndecan-4 expression in ECV cells when cultured under hypoxic conditions. In vitro studies demonstrated that TNF-α induced endothelial cell syndecan-4 expression by both increasing syndecan-4 gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner and by prolonging syndecan-4 mRNA half-life. We conclude that TNF-α is the principal factor produced by the ischemic myocytes that is responsible for induction of endothelial cell syndecan-4 expression and that this requires both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.

We conclude that TNF-α is the principal factor produced by the ischemic myocytes that is responsible for induction of endothelial cell syndecan-4 expression and that this requires both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Syndecan-4 is one of the principal heparin sulfate-carrying proteins on the cell surface (1Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed by a number of different cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiac myocytes, although expression in quiescent tissues is fairly low. Syndecans can participate in a variety of biological functions including regulation of blood coagulation, cell adhesion, and low density lipoprotein transport (2Carey D.J. Biochem.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition to these activities shared by all syndecans, syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain can bind to and activate protein kinase C-α with the degree of activation regulated by the extent of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation (4Oh E.S.

Despite these interesting properties, little is known about the regulation of syndecan-4 gene expression. Its levels are increased after various forms of tissue injury including skin wounds (8Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsburn M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), vascular wall injury (9Nikkari S.T. Jarvelainen H.T. Wight T.N. Ferguson M. Clowes A.W. Am. J.

The increase in syndecan-4 expression in skin wounds and in the heart following myocardial infarction has been ascribed to the presence of a proline-arginine-rich peptide, PR39. No other factors responsible for this increase have been identified (8Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsburn M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present study was designed to study the role of cardiac myocytes in the induction of syndecan-4 expression under normal and ischemic (hypoxic) conditions. To this end, we determined the ability of myocyte- or myoblast-conditioned medium to induce syndecan-4 expression in a human endothelial cell line. We find that TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. secreted by hypoxic but not normal myocytes is able to induce syndecan-4 expression and that the mechanism of this induction involves both transcriptional activation of syndecan-4 gene expression and posttranscriptional regulation of syndecan-4 message half-life. A human umbilical endothelial cell line, ECV304 (ATCC), was cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A rat cardiac myoblast cell line, H9c2 (ATCC), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. IC-21 (ATCC), a mouse macrophage cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from day 2 neonatal C57/129 or same background TNF-α−/− mice (11Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Episkopou V. Kollias G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). A total of 24 hearts from each mouse strain was used. At sacrifice the hearts were removed aseptically, cut into 1–2-mm pieces, placed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced saline solution without either Ca2+ or Mg2+, and subjected to serial digestions with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase II (Worthington), 0.1% trypsin, 15 μg/ml DNase I, and 1% chicken serum at 37 °C with constant rotation. Supernatant was collected every 10–15 min, and digestion was stopped by addition of 10% horse serum. Dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 2 g/liter bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 3 mm pyruvic acid, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 μm ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 4 μg/ml transferrin, 0.7 ng/ml sodium selenium, and 5 μg/ml linoleic acid for 1 h to enrich for myocytes. The suspension was then plated onto 1% gelatin-coated dishes at 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. Bromodeoxyuridine (0.1 mm) was added to prevent proliferation of non-myocytes. Horse serum and bromodeoxyuridine were removed from the medium after 36 h. For determination of growth factor responsiveness of syndecan-4 expression, ECV304 cells were cultured in 10% FBS-DMEM to 80% confluence. At that point the cells were washed with PBS, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM for 6 h, and then one of the following growth factors was added: hrVEGF165 (25 ng/ml, Genentech, Inc.), hrbFGF (25 ng/ml, Chiron Corp.), hrPDGF-AA (20 ng/ml, Sigma) or hrPDGF-AB (20 ng/ml, Sigma), hrTGF-β (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems), hrTNF-α (20 ng/ml, Sigma), or mouse epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml, Becton Dickinson Labware). Cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted after 24 h and subjected to Northern blot analysis. H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 100-mm dishes to 90% confluence. At that point, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM. Following 24 h of culture under hypoxic (0–2% O2) or normal oxygen conditions, the medium was collected, centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g to remove debris, and then stored at −80 °C for further use. Similar procedures were used for collection of myocyte-conditioned medium. For Northern analysis, total RNA extracted from cultured cells with Tri Reagent (Sigma) was fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membrane. cDNA probes for human syndecan-4 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with α-[32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and hybridization was carried out for 3 h at 65 °C in Quickhyb solution (Strategene), followed by serial washes with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, 45 °C for 15 min, and 65 °C for 15 min. The quantitative analysis of hybridization signal was carried out using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. RNA loading was adjusted using ethidium bromide gel 18 S RNA signal or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression level. For determination of syndecan-4 protein levels, ECV cells were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), dissociated by 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C, and sedimented by 200 × gcentrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. Western blotting was carried out with anti-syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain antibody following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the total cell protein extract as described previously (6Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium collected from five 100-mm Petri dishes of confluent H9c2 cells cultured for 48 h under hypoxic or normal conditions was concentrated using Centriprep followed by Centricon columns (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of 80 μl. Aliquots of the concentrated material (20 μl) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore), and the blot was then incubated with a polyclonal goat anti-rat TNF-α antibody (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. An ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect the signal. 100 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole was added to ECV304 cells following overnight culture in 0.5% FBS-M199. The cells were then harvested at the indicated time points and total RNA was extracted as described above. 10 μg of total RNA for each time point were subjected to Northern blot analysis with a syndecan-4 cDNA probe. Signal was quantified using PhosphorImager with RNA loading adjusted by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. The mRNA half-life was calculated using the formulat½ = ln2/(mRNA decay rate constant) with the decay rate constant derived from the slope of the decay curve. A 715-nucleotide fragment (−690 to +25 nucleotide of the murine sequence) encompassing the basal elements of mouse syndecan-4 promoter (courtesy of Dr. T. Kojima, Nagoya University) was cloned into a pGL-3 vector (Promega) containing the luciferase reporter construct. The syndecan-4 promoter construct and a pGRE-Neo (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) construct were linearized and, following phenol/chloroform purification, used for electroporation. To this end, ECV304 cells were trypsinized and washed twice with a fresh medium; 6 × 106 of cells in 0.75 ml of medium were incubated with 30 μg of syndecan-4 promoter-containing pGL-3 and 3 μg of pGRE-Neo linearized plasmids for 5 min on ice in a 0.4-cm cuvette. Electroporation was carried out at 290 V, 600 microfarads using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Following electroporation, the cells were quickly diluted with the fresh M199 medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 5 mm sodium butyrate and plated onto a 100-mm Petri dish. Sodium butyrate was removed after overnight exposure, and the culture was continued for another 36 h in 10% FBS-M199. The cells were then passaged into two dishes and cultured in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). All colonies were pooled together after 10 days and maintained in the selection medium. For promoter studies, cells stably expressing syndecan-4 promoter construct were plated onto 12-well plates and allowed to come to 80% confluence in 10% FBS-M199 medium. The medium was then changed to 0.5% FBS-M199 overnight. TNF-α was added at the indicated concentration. After 6 h of exposure, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega). To assess the role of NF-κB in the TNF-α-dependent stimulation of syndecan-4 gene expression, ECV304 cells plated on 60-mm dishes were cultured until 90% confluence and subjected to serum starvation overnight. Lactacystin (Calbiochem) was then added to medium at a concentration of 10 μm. 1 h later, TNF-α (20 ng/ml) was added. Syndecan-4 mRNA levels were determined using Northern blot analysis 4 h after exposure of lactacystin-treated or control cells to TNF-α (20 ng/ml). To investigate the role of myocyte-endothelial cell interaction in the regulation of syndecan-4 expression in endothelial cells, we studied the ability of myoblast- or cardiac myocyte-conditioned medium to induce syndecan-4 expression in ECV304 cells. Exposure of ECV304 cells to the medium conditioned by the H9c2 cells cultured under normal conditions did not affect syndecan-4 expression. However, medium conditioned by H9c2 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions produced a nearly 2-fold increase in syndecan-4 mRNA expression in ECV304 cells and a 2.5-fold increase in syndecan protein (Fig. 1). These results suggested that myoblasts exposed to hypoxia secreted a factor that was responsible for induction of syndecan-4 expression. To determine whether any of the known myoblast-secreted growth factors were responsible for this event, ECV304 cells were exposed to a panel of cytokines. Of the growth factors tested, only TNF-α was able to induce syndecan-4 expression in ECV304 cells (Fig. 2) in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of syndecan-4 mRNA expression by TNF-α was prompt, beginning at 1 h, reaching maximal effect at 3 h (Fig. 2), and lasting for at least 24 h (data not shown).Figure 2Role of TNF-α in induction of syndecan-4 expression. A, growth factor induction of syndecan-4 expression. Subconfluent serum-starved ECV304 cells were treated with either vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 25 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 25 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA, 20 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB, 20 ng/ml), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β, 20 ng/ml), TNF-α (20 ng/ml), or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (20 ng/ml). Total RNA was harvested after 24 h and subjected to Northern analysis for syndecan-4 expression.B and D, time course of TNF-α-mediated induction of syndecan-4 expression.

C andE, dose response of TNF-α-dependent induction of syndecan-4 expression.

GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that TNF-α is produced by hypoxic myoblasts, cell culture medium conditioned by H9c2 cells under normal and hypoxic conditions was subjected to Western analysis with anti-TNF-α antibody. Cell lysate of IC-21 cells, a macrophage cell line known to produce large amounts of TNF-α under normal culture conditions, was used as a control. The presence of secreted TNF-α was detected in IC-21 cell lysate and in H9c2 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. Compared with the hypoxic H9c2 cell-conditioned medium, only a trace amount of TNF-α was detected in the medium conditioned by the normal H9c2 cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm that TNF-α is the primary factor responsible for myoblast-dependent induction of syndecan-4 expression, we used primary myocyte cultures from homozygous TNF-α knockout mice and age-matched controls to condition serum-free medium in the manner similar to the H9c2 experiments. Cell culture media conditioned by primary myocytes derived from either the TNF-α−/− or wild type C57/129 mice cultured under normal conditions did not induce endothelial cell syndecan-4 mRNA expression. However, medium conditioned by hypoxic myocytes from the C57/129 but not TNF-α−/− mice induced syndecan-4 expression to the extent similar to that seen with hypoxic H9c2 cells (Fig. 3B). To determine whether TNF-α regulates syndecan-4 gene expression by transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms, we measured syndecan-4 mRNA half-life in ECV304 cells in the presence or absence of TNF-α treatment. Exposure to TNF-α at 20 ng/ml increased syndecan-4 mRNA half-life from 16 to 24 h (Fig. 4A). To assess the effect of TNF-α on syndecan-4 gene transcription, we measured activity of a luciferase construct under control of the mouse syndecan-4 promoter. Exposure of the pooled population of ECV304 cells stably transfected with this construct to TNF-α at 20 ng/ml led to a 2-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). Because TNF-α is known to activate gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner and given that syndecan-4 promoter contains an NF-κB-binding site, we examined the effect of inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription on the ability of TNF-α to induce syndecan-4 expression. Pretreatment with lactacystin, an inhibitor of proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα expression, completely blocked TNF-α-induced activation of syndecan-4 expression (Fig. 5). These results indicate that TNF-α regulates syndecan-4 expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.Figure 5TNF-α induces syndecan-4 gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. To study the role of NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in TNF-α-induced activation of syndecan-4 expression, ECV304 cells were exposed to TNF-α (20 ng/ml) in the absence of lactacystin (TNF-α) or following 1 h pretreatment with lactacystin (LC+TNF-α). Note the increased syndecan-4 expression in TNF-α-treated cells that were blocked by pretreatment with lactacystin. Addition of lactacystin by itself (LC) had no effect on base-line syndecan-4 levels. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The principal finding of this study is that TNF-α, secreted by hypoxic but not normal myocytes, is able to increase syndecan-4 expression in endothelial cells. A number of findings point to TNF-α as the main factor responsible for the ability of hypoxic myocyte-conditioned medium to induce syndecan-4 expression. First, the cytokine is capable of increasing syndecan-4 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner and with an appropriate time course. Second, TNF-α is present in medium conditioned by hypoxic but not normal myoblasts. Finally, medium conditioned by myocytes cultured under either normal or hypoxic conditions derived from the TNF-α knockout mice fails to induce syndecan-4 expression. TNF-α-dependent activation of syndecan-4 expression involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events. The study of syndecan-4 transcription was carried out using a mixture of approximately 200 independent stable clones, thus eliminating artifacts potentially associated with the expression construct integration into hyper- or hypoactive regions of the genome. The promoter fragment used was previously shown to possess basal promoter activity (12Tsuzuki S. Kojima T. Katsumi A. Yamazaki T. Sugiura I. Saito H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although it is possible that additional control elements were missing. The degree of induction of the luciferase expression was similar to the extent of increase in the endogenous syndecan-4 mRNA level in TNF-α-treated ECV304 cells. Taken together, the extent of transcriptional activation as measured in luciferase assays and prolongation of mRNA half-life closely parallel the increase in endogenous syndecan-4 protein levels in these cells following TNF-α exposure. TNF-α is thought to regulate gene expression by inducing degradation of a transcriptional inhibitor, IκBα, thus allowing the p50 NF-κB·RelA complex to bind to its nuclear binding sites and activate gene expression (13Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Basal syndecan-4 promoter possesses an NF-κB binding site (GGGGGAATT, nucleotides −84 to −76 of the mouse sequence). Therefore, it is possible that syndecan-4 gene expression up-regulation by TNF-α occurs, at least in part, via the NF-κB-dependent pathway. To confirm this, we exposed ECV304 cells to TNF-α following pretreatment with lactacystin. Lactacystin is a specific inhibitor of proteasome function (14Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and, in particular, is known to block proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα. In accordance with these considerations, we found that pretreatment with lactacystin completely blocked the ability of TNF-α to induce syndecan-4 expression. Recent studies have suggested that syndecan-4 plays an important role in regulation of endothelial cell growth and migration and in basic fibroblast growth factor-dependent signaling (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 5Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Studies in our laboratory have suggested that increased syndecan-4 expression augmented the ability of endothelial cells to migrate, proliferate, and form vascular structures in Matrigel in response to basic fibroblast growth factor. 2R. Volk and M. Simons, unpublished observations. Thus, the ability of TNF-α to induce syndecan-4 expression while suppressing that of syndecan-1 (15Kainulainen V. Nelimarkka L. Jarvelainen H. Laato M. Jalkanen M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) may lead to enhanced endothelial cell growth. TNF-α is a potent angiogenic factor in a number of in vitro and in vivo systems (16Montrucchio G. Lupia E. Battaglia E. Passerini G. Bussolino F. Emanuelli G. Camussi G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Norrby K. Microvasc. Res. 1996; 52: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cytokine expression in the heart is induced by myocardial ischemia (18Chandrasekar B. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 108: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Meldrum D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R577-R595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of secreted TNF-α has been demonstrated in an in vitro model (20Gurevitch J. Frolkis I. Yuhas Y. Paz Y. Matsa M. Mohr R. Yakirevich V. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Whereas TNF-α has a wide range of biological activities, its ability to induce syndecan-4 expression may play a particularly important role in mediation of its angiogenic activity. In summary, ischemic myocytes can induce syndecan-4 expression in surrounding endothelial cells by paracrine secretion of TNF-α. This mechanism may play an important role in myocyte-dependent regulation of endothelial cell activity and the ability of ischemic tissues to initiate and propagate an angiogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W2331562219,"A molecular staging protocol using reliable markers is of importance in predicting the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for instituting their appropriate post-surgical treatment. We analysed tumor tissues from 187 NSCLC patients. The DNA and mRNA were extracted from frozen specimens, and then polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing were performed to investigate mutations of p53 from exons 5 – 8, and mutations of K-ras at exon 1. To determine MRP-1/CD9 gene and KA11/CD82 gene expression, which have been postulated to be metastasis suppressor genes, we have applied quantitative RT – PCR. A Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that nodal status, MRP-1/CD9 and K-ras status were significant factors for prognosis (P<0.0001, P=0.0083 and P=0.0004, respectively). Based on these results, we classified the patients into three groups according to their MRP-1/CD9 and K-ras status. Patients with both MRP-1/CD9 positive and wild K-ras tumors were defined as group A, patients with either reduced MRP-1/CD9 or mutant K-ras tumors were defined as group B and patients with both reduced MRP-1/CD9 and mutant K-ras tumors were designated as group C. This new classification was significantly correlated with the tumor status and pathological stage (P=0.0098 and P=0.0017, respectively). The overall survival rate of the group A patients was significantly better than the group B patients (59.6% vs 27.9%, P=0.0001) and also that of group B patients was better than the group C patients (27.9% vs 20.0%, P=0.0378). This tendency was also found in patients with 110 node-negative NSCLCs (A vs B vs C=75.8% vs 34.9% vs 0.0%, P<0.0001). A Cox multivariate regression analysis in NSCLC patients demonstrated that an evaluation for both MRP-1/CD9 expression and K-ras mutations had a significant prognostic effect as well as nodal status (P<0.0001)."

In contrast, <5% of labeled GH was internalized by cells expressing truncated GHR1–279. Using another truncated receptor, GHR1–317 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we have exploited fluorescence energy transfer to monitor the trafficking of ligand-receptor complexes.

The GH antagonist, B2036, blocked Jak2-Stat5-mediated GHR signaling but was internalized with a similar time course to native GH. The results: 1) demonstrate the rapid internalization of GH when studied under physiological conditions; 2) confirm the hypothesis that internalization of cytoplasmic domain truncated human GHRs is very inefficient, which explains their dominant negative action; and 3) show that the antagonist action of B2036 is independent of receptor internalization.

The GHR is a member of the type I cytokine family of receptors, which possess in common a single transmembrane domain and lack intrinsic kinase activity (1Finidori J. Kelly P.A. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding of a single molecule of GH results in receptor dimerization and signaling through a phosphorylation cascade that includes the Jak-Stat pathway. Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway is dependent on an intact cytoplasmic domain of the receptor forming multisubunit complexes with associated tyrosine kinases. Recently, we (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and others (3Dastot F. Sobrier F. Duquesnoy P.

A. 1996; 93: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) identified a truncated form of the receptor, GHR1–279, in normal human liver and certain human cell lines. This truncated receptor lacks 97% of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor and has a dominant negative action on Jak-Stat signaling (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In human tissues the truncated receptor is expressed at a low level compared with the full-length receptor (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in cell transfection experiments, the truncated receptor always demonstrates a greater level of receptor expression at the cell surface compared with the full-length receptor (2Ross R.J.M.

It has been hypothesized that the truncated receptor lacks essential internalization signals in the cytoplasmic domain and therefore remains at the cell surface available to heterodimerize with the full-length receptor and inhibit signaling (2Ross R.J.M.

Youdim M.B.H. Amselem S. Hochberg Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3813-3817PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the truncated receptor generates large amounts of GH-binding protein (GHBP) (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Dastot F. Sobrier F. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Goosens M. Amselem S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Confirmation that these truncated receptors have a dominant negative action on GHR signaling comes from patients who are heterozygous for a mutation that encodes a very similar truncated receptor, GHR1–277 (6Ayling R.M.

Nose O. Okimura Y. Abe H. Chihara K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These patients have high levels of GHBP and GH insensitivity, presumably because of increased levels of truncated receptor at the cell surface, which fails to internalize and heterodimerizes with the full-length receptor to inhibit signaling (6Ayling R.M. Ross R.J.M. Towner P. Von Laue S. Finidori J. Moutoussamy S. Buchanan C.R. Clayton P.E. Norman M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 13-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The GHR is internalized via clathrin-coated pits (8Ilondo M.M. Smal J. De Meyts P. Courtoy P.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1597-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Govers R. Kerkhof P.V. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This internalization is dependent upon an intact ubiquitination system, and GHR ubiquitination is dependent upon an intact endocytic pathway (9Govers R. Kerkhof P.V. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a small fraction of GHR is constitutively ubiquitinated and internalized but that GH-induced dimerization results in an increase in ubiquitination and internalization (9Govers R. Kerkhof P.V. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Phe327 residue within the cytosolic tail of the GHR is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and ligand-induced receptor endocytosis (9Govers R. Kerkhof P.V. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Kelly P.A. Nielson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that there is an ubiquitin-independent internalization signal, based on a di-leucine repeat (Leu347,348), which is inactive in the full-length receptor but is activated in a truncated receptor, GHR1–349 (11Govers R. Van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16426-16433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this motif may function in the internalization of an as yet unidentified GHR isoforms (11Govers R. Van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16426-16433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Internalization is not required for Jak-Stat signal transduction, as GHR mutated at Phe327 signals but is not internalized (10Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G.

However, there is strong evidence for the importance of receptor dimerization for signal transduction, which is derived from a number of experiments. In the presence of a molar excess of GH, which favors the formation of the monomeric GH-GHR complex, there is inhibition of the GH signal (12Silva C.M. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), truncated receptors that lack the cytoplasmic signaling domain block signal transduction by heterodimerization (2Ross R.J.M.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and receptor dimerization is associated with a conformational change that is required for receptor signaling (13Mellado M.

The strongest evidence, however, comes from work with a GH antagonist mutated at GH binding site 2 (G120R), which blocks GH-stimulated cell proliferation (14Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and does not generate the conformational change associated with receptor dimerization and Jak-Stat signaling (13Mellado M.

However, the GH antagonist G120R does appear to dimerize in a (GH)2-(GHR)2complex and is internalized (15Harding P.A. Wang X. Okada S. Chen W.Y. Wan W. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol.

This antagonist, B2036, has 8 additional mutations at GH binding site 1, which increases the affinity of the antagonist for GHBP (18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). There are no publications on the effect of this antagonist on internalization and cell signaling. To date, most studies of GHR trafficking have depended on techniques that require the use of nonphysiological conditions, including acid stripping of cell surface receptor (19Leung K. Waters M.J.

We have used fluorescent confocal microscopy and a combination of fluorescent-labeled GH and GHR to study GHR trafficking in real time at the level of the single cell. The results show: 1) the previously unrecognized, extremely rapid internalization of GH and of its antagonist, B2036; 2) that this internalization is independent of signaling; and 3) the failure of the naturally occurring truncated GHR1–279 to internalize. The full-length GHR and truncated receptor GHR1–279 were subcloned into pcDNA1/ampicillin (Invitrogen) as described previously (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The LHRE-EGFP reporter construct was generated by subcloning the Stat5-binding element (LHRE) fused to the minimal TK promoter (25Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) into EGFP-p1 (CLONTECH). The truncated GHR1–317-EGFP chimera was created by subcloning the N terminus of EGFP to the EcoRI site in the cytoplasmic domain of the human GHR in the expression vector pcDNA1/ampicillin (Invitrogen). Stable clones were generated in 293 cells (human kidney embryonal cell line) by transfection with the calcium phosphate procedure of the GHR plasmid with pcDNA3/Neo (Invitrogen). Selection was made using G418 (400 μg/ml, Sigma). 24 h after plating, cells were serum-starved for 12 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with125I-hGH (1 × 105 cpm/well) for 3 h at room temperature in the absence or presence of various concentrations of unlabeled hGH. The cells were then washed in the same buffer and solubilized in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH for counting radiation. The recombinant human GH used was Genotrophin (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milton Keynes, UK). The GH antagonist, B2036, is mutated at GH binding site 2 with G120K. In addition, to the G120K mutation there are 8 additional mutations at site 1 that are thought to increase the affinity of the receptor (18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The GH antagonist (B2036) was kindly supplied by William Bennett of Sensus Drug Development Corp.(Austin, Texas). Texas Red labeling was performed using Texas Red-X succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). GH or antagonist were dialyzed overnight against borate-buffered saline (pH 8.5). 100 μg of GH or antagonist were incubated with Texas Red at a 1:1 molar ratio in a final volume of 200 μl for 1 h at room temperature and away from light. The reaction mixture was separated on a 1-ml-bed volume Bio-Gel P10 5-kDa polyacrylamide gel. Transcription assays were performed in 293 cells expressing the GHR using either a reporter gene containing a Stat5-binding element (LHRE) fused to a minimal TK promoter and luciferase or the LHRE-TK fused to EGFP. Luciferase activity was measured as previously reported (2Ross R.J.M. Esposito N. Shen X.Y. Von Laue S. Chew S.L. Dobson P. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In studies using the LHRE-TK·EGFP, 293 cells were plated on 4-well coverglass slides, precoated with fibronectin at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well (ml), transfected by the calcium phosphate method with LHRE-TK·EGFP (550 ng/slide), and incubated overnight in complete medium before transfer into serum-free medium containing either 500 ng/ml GH and 100 ng/ml dexamethasone (stimulated) or dexamethasone alone (unstimulated). Fluorescence was detected 24 h later on the stage incubator of the confocal microscope, an analysis of images was performed using the public domain NIH Image (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih.image). For experiments on living cells, fluorescence was detected using a Molecular Dynamics CLSM2010 confocal fluorescent microscope equipped with dual fluorescence and transmission detection. Images were transferred from the Silicon Graphics INDY on the CSLM 2010, converted to Macintosh 8-bit Tagged Image File Format, and analyzed with NIH Image, and the data were exported to EXCEL for further analysis. All experiments were performed at 37 °C using a stage incubator enclosure fitted to the microscope. For the detection of Texas Red, cells were excited at 568 nm, and detection was through a 610 nm long pass filter (red channel). For EGFP, cells were excited at 488 nm and detection was through a 530 nm band pass filter (green channel). In all experiments used for quantitative analysis, the laser power was kept below the level of saturation for the fluor and the photomultiplier voltage set so that the brightest pixels were <250 8-bit units. In the fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) experiments cells were excited with the 488 nm line, and data were collected on the red channel. Using NIH Image the fluorescence within the cell membrane was divided by the total fluorescence of the cell after subtracting the background. This number was multiplied by 100 to give a percentage, and the mean of two measurements for each cell was used in the analysis. 293 cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then stimulated for 15 min at 37 °C with GH or antagonist. Cells were lysed in PBS-TDS (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 12 mm sodium deoxycholate, 3.5 mmSDS, and 4.7 nm sodium orthovandate), and 1 mg of protein was precipitated with Jak2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Buckingham, UK) at 1:250 dilution with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma). Precipitated proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and after blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride, phosphorylation was detected with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (1:2500) (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Buckingham, UK) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To compare internalization of the truncated GHR1–279 with the full-length human GHR, we generated stable clones in a human kidney cell line, 293 cells. Cells were transfected with either receptor and selected under G418. Clones were picked that expressed a high level of GH binding. In our experimental conditions (125I-hGH, 1 × 105 cpm, on 3 × 105 cells), the selected full-length human GHR expressing clone showed 16% specific binding, and the GHR1–279 clone showed 28% specific binding. In cells expressing the full-length receptor, competition studies with 125I-hGH and125I-B2036 showed a single class of receptors (Fig. 1). The antagonist B2036 has 8 mutations in the GH binding site 1, which would be expected to increase its affinity for the extracellular domain of the GHR (18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In an assay based on GHBP immobilized on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate, the antagonist had an affinity five times greater than native GH. 2William Bennett, personal communication. We compared the binding of GH and the antagonist, B2036, on intact cells expressing the full-length GHR. In displacement studies using either labeled GH or antagonist, the apparent affinities calculated by Scatchard analysis for GH (K a = 1.00 × 109m−1) and B2036 (K a = 0.96 × 109m−1) were comparable (Fig. 1). Thus, in intact cells, the antagonist appears to have a similar affinity to native GH. Functional activity of the full-length receptor was measured in transient transfections with Stat5 reporter constructs, consisting of Stat5 binding sites (LHRE) fused to either EGFP or luciferase. In the luciferase assay test, GH stimulation induced a bell-shaped curve with maximal stimulation (5-fold) occurring between 50 and 500 ng/ml and returning to basal values for GH levels >10 μg/ml. These results confirm that excess of GH favors the formation of GH-GHR monomers and blocks signal transduction (12Silva C.M. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the EGFP test, stimulation with 500 ng/ml GH also resulted in a 5-fold induction of fluorescence compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 2). This induction of fluorescence was seen across the whole range of cell sizes (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the stable clone expressing the truncated GHR1–279, despite a high level of GH binding, showed no induction of fluorescence when transfected with the LHRE-EGFP reporter and no induction of luciferase activity (data not shown).Figure 2Stimulation of the LHRE-TK· EGFP reporter gene by hGH . Confocal images (×20) are shown of 293 cells stably expressing the full-length human GHR and transiently transfected with a Stat5 reporter construct with the LHRE-TK fused to EGFP.

However, to provide a clear representation and show the backgrounds, the contrast has been enhanced in both A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For internalization studies, GH and the antagonist B2036 were labeled with Texas Red. We first examined the effect of labeling on GH binding to its receptor and then incubated Texas Red with GH at different molar ratios from 1:1 to 1:10 (GH:Texas Red). A ratio greater than 1:3 resulted in a GH molecule with a reduced affinity for the GHR. Therefore, for all of the studies we elected to label GH and antagonist with a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to Texas Red. To study internalization, 293 cells were plated on coverglass and incubated overnight in serum-free medium. Analysis was performed by confocal microscopy at 37 °C. 10 nm Texas Red-labeled GH was added in new starvation medium, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before washing and the addition of phenol red-free medium. Confocal images were recorded sequentially over time. Images were analyzed with NIH Image, and internalization was assessed by measuring the fluorescence within the cell membrane expressed as a percentage of the total fluorescence associated with the cell. No binding or internalization was seen in 293 cells not transfected with the GHR, and in all experiments binding and internalization were specifically displaced by the simultaneous addition of 2 μg of unlabeled GH. For cells expressing the full-length GHR, internalization of GH was rapid with more than 80% of labeled GH internalized at 5 min (Fig. 3A), and membrane binding was difficult to detect at 20 min (Fig. 3B). After 15 min, most GH was internalized (mean ± S.E., 92 ± 1.3%;n = 8 cells). In contrast, cells expressing the truncated GHR1–279, which lacks 97% of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, showed little internalization. At 5 min there was well defined surface binding with <5% internalization of Texas Red-labeled GH (Fig. 3C), and at 20 min there was <30% internalization (Fig. 3D). After 15 min, internalization of Texas Red-labeled GH was 6.7 ± 1.8% (mean ± S.E.;n = 14 cells). The difference in internalization for the full-length and truncated receptor over time is shown in Fig. 3E. Previous publications (19Leung K. Waters M.J. Markus I. Baumbach W.R. Ho K.K.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11381-11386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) had reported inhibition of internalization by cooling cells to 4 °C. We attempted to repeat these studies. However, cells incubated for 10 min at 4 °C on coverglass behaved abnormally, showing delayed internalization and frequently separating from the coverglass. To further study the trafficking of the GHR, we generated fusion proteins with EGFP. Transient expression of the EGFP expression vector alone (pEGFP-N2,CLONTECH) in 293 cells resulted in a diffuse distribution of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of some cells. In contrast, transient and stable transfection of the truncated GHR1–317 fused to EGFP resulted in a cell surface distribution as shown by radioligand binding and laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). In addition, the GHR1–317-EGFP was distributed within the cell consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization as well as in a large juxtanuclear fluorescent area representing the Golgi complex (Fig. 4A). The Golgi localization of the GHR represented a large proportion of the total fluorescent GHR in the cell. Control experiments with classical immunofluorescence on fixed cells were performed to verify that the presence of the GFP moiety did not significantly alter the distribution of the receptor. Labeling was done on 293 cells expressing either the full-length or the 279 truncated receptor permeabilized or not with Triton X-100 (Fig. 5). Labeling was present both at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments with a juxtanuclear accumulation in the Golgi apparatus. Such distribution has been described previously in COS-7 cells (26Goujon L. Allevato G. Simonin G. Paquereau L. Le Cam A. Clark J. Nielsen J.H. Djiane J. Postel-Vinay M. Edery M. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 293 cells (27Wojcik J. Berg M.A. Esposito N. Geffner M.E. Sakati N. Reiter E.O. Dower S.K. Francke U. Postel-Vinay M. Finidori J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 4481-4489PubMed Google Scholar) transfected with the GHR. In cells expressing the GHR1–317-EGFP, the fluorescence resulting from the antibody was superimposed on that from the GFP, so that even in the absence of Triton X-100, some intracellular labeling appeared because of the GFP. We analyzed the labeling distribution with confocal microscopy. Two slices, corresponding respectively to the top of the cell or the middle of the cell, confirm that the fusion receptor was present both at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments. This distribution is comparable with that seen for the truncated receptor GHR 1–279.Figure 5Immunofluorescence for GHR in fixed cells expressing full-length and truncated receptor. 293 cells expressing full-length GHR (GHR FL, A andD), GHR1–279 (B and E), or GHR1–317-EGFP (C and F) were grown on coverslips. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized (D–F) or not (A–C) with 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then labeled with 5 mg/ml anti-GHR antibody (monoclonal antibody 263), of which the epitope is in the extracellular domain of the receptor, and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate. Cells were observed under a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope (LSM 510). C andF show two different slices of the same cell focused, respectively, at the top of the cell (C) and in the middle of the cell (F).

We reported recently that Ral-A purified from human erythrocyte membrane binds to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner at a calmodulin binding domain identified near its C-terminal region (Wang, K. L., Khan, M. T., and Roufogalis, B. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16002–16009). In this study we show the enhancement of GTP binding to Ral-A by Ca2+/calmodulin. The stimulation up to 3-fold by calmodulin was Ca2+-dependent, with half-maximum activation occurring at 180 nm calmodulin and 80 nm free Ca2+ concentration. The present work supports a regulatory role of Ca2+/calmodulin for the activation of Ral-A and suggests a possible direct link between signal transduction pathways of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ral-A proteins. Ral-A is a Ras-related GTP-binding protein that has been suggested to be the downstream target of Ras proteins and is involved in the tyrosine kinase-mediated, Ras-dependent activation of phospholipase D.

The present work supports a regulatory role of Ca2+/calmodulin for the activation of Ral-A and suggests a possible direct link between signal transduction pathways of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ral-A proteins. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous, highly conserved Ca2+sensor protein that translates the Ca2+ signal into a wide variety of cellular processes. In response to an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change that results in binding to its target proteins and acts as a trigger to modify their functions. Calmodulin-binding proteins therefore play an important role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling and in various physiological functions, including glycogen metabolism, secretion, muscle contraction, actin/cytoskeletal organization, and cell division (1Cohen P.

Ras proteins are integral to signal transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus, thus regulating a diverse spectrum of intracellular processes (3Bokoch G.M. Der C.J.

Accumulating evidence indicates the existence of a direct link between signaling pathways of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ras proteins. RasGRF, a neuronal Ras-guanine nucleotide releasing factor, has been shown to be activated in response to Ca2+ via direct binding of calmodulin (5Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A.

In rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+channels induces neurite growth via activation of Ras, which in turn activates the serine/threonine protein kinase, Raf (6Rosen L.B.

Rapid activation of Rap1 in human platelets has been shown to be mediated by an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (9Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, an increasing number of Ras-related proteins and Ras protein effectors have been identified as calmodulin-binding proteins, supporting the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin in regulation of Ras-related GTPase function. IQGAP1, a novel RasGAP-related and Ras-binding protein, has been found to bind to calmodulin and the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 is modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (10Joyal J.L. Annan R.S.

RalGDS was found to interact with ras p21 specifically and to function as an effector target in Ras signaling pathways, inducing cellular transformation in parallel with activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (11Urano T.

Ral-A has been shown to be involved in the tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of phospholipase D, suggesting that the signaling pathway from Ras to Ral leads to the regulation of phospholipid metabolism (14Jiang H.

Ral may also have a functional role in regulating the cytoskeleton through its interaction with the effector protein RLIP (Ral interacting protein) and Cdc42 (15Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In addition, the diverse subcellular localization of Ral-A, not only in plasma membrane, but also in endocytotic vesicles, synaptic vesicles (16Bielinske D.F. Pyun H.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.G.

However, the physiological activation of Ral by extracellular stimuli is largely unknown.We have reported that Ral-A, purified from human erythrocyte plasma membrane, can bind to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and its calmodulin binding domain has been identified and characterized near its C-terminal region (19Wang K.L.

The Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of Ral-A was strongly supported by the evidence that calmodulin could block Ral-A phosphorylation by PKA, 1The abbreviations used are: PK, protein kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; CaM, calmodulin; CaM kinase II, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PK, protein kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; CaM, calmodulin; CaM kinase II, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase.

In this study we report the effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on GTP binding activity of Ral-A. Up to 3-fold Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent stimulation of GTP binding to Ral-A was observed. The results raise the possibility that calmodulin may be a potential effector for Ral-A GTPase activation and serve as a molecular switch in response to changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration over the physiological range.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSince Ral-A, purified from human erythrocyte membrane, has been described as a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein (19Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we investigated a possible role of Ca2+/calmodulin to modulate the GTP binding of Ral-A. To test this hypothesis [α-32P]GTP binding activity of Ral-A was determined using a spin column filtration assay in the absence and presence of calmodulin. Although a nitrocellulose filtration assay is commonly used to measure [α-32P]GTP binding activity of Ras-related GTPases, spin column chromatography eliminates the possibility that calmodulin at high concentration might alter Ral-A binding to nitrocellulose membranes and generate false results. As shown in Fig. 1A, the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin enhances GTP binding to Ral-A significantly. The increase in GTP binding to Ral-A in the presence of 240 nm calmodulin required Ca2+, as the omission of Ca2+ completely abolished the stimulatory effect of calmodulin. Ca2+ alone does not affect GTP binding to Ral-A, indicating that GTP binding of Ral-A is not directly activated by Ca2+, but rather requires calmodulin in its Ca2+-bound form. Fig. 1B shows that the binding of GTP to Ral-A in the presence and absence of Ca2+/calmodulin is time-dependent and that Ca2+/calmodulin stimulates the initial rate of GTP binding.To assess how varying the concentration of GTP affects [α-32P]GTP binding to Ral-A in response to Ca2+/CaM, an experiment was performed in which unlabeled GTP at high concentration (0.5 μm) was displaced by addition of increasing amounts of [α-32P]GTP. Fig. 2 shows that Ca2+/CaM enhances the [α-32P]GTP binding over the concentration range examined. Based on Fig. 1B, the [α-32P]GTP binding stoichiometry of Ral-A is calculated to be 0.11 mol of GTP-bound per mol of Ral-A and 0.2 mol of GTP-bound per mol of Ral-A in the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM, respectively. However, the stoichiometry could be underestimated in the current experimental conditions, since Fig. 2 shows the [α-32P]GTP binding of Ral-A has not reached saturation over the [α-32P]GTP concentration range examined. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence shows that only a small amount of Ral, in the order of 10%, is in the active GTP-bound form in intact cells (23Wolthuis R.M.F. Zwartkruis F. Moen T.C. Bos J.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 471-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on these observations we suggest that most of the Ral-A purified from human erythrocyte may be in its inactive GDP-bound form and Ca2+-dependent calmodulin binding to Ral-A may accelerate the displacement of the bound GDP, thereby promoting GTP binding. The displacement of GDP may be incomplete under the conditions used.Figure 2Dependence of [32P]GTP binding to Ral-A on GTP concentrations. GTP binding activity of Ral-A was determined using a spin column filtration assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 200 μl of Ral-A preparation (about 20 pmol) was incubated with 0.5 μm GTP and various concentrations of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the absence and presence of CaCl2 and calmodulin at 37 °C for 90 min. Aliquots of 60 μl were withdrawn in triplicate and directly applied to the spin column matrix. The flow-through was collected from the spin columns, and [α-32P]GTP binding to Ral-A was measured by scintillation counting.

Since Ral-A was purified by elution from a calmodulin agarose column by a gradient EDTA elution buffer, the EDTA concentration in Ral-A was required for the accurate determination of free Ca2+ and was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A computer program (22Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) was then used to calculate the free Ca2+ concentration in the final assay buffer when EDTA, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were present. Fig. 3A shows the -fold calmodulin stimulation of Ral-A GTP binding activity as a function of increasing concentration of free Ca2+. In the presence of 240 nm calmodulin, half-maximum stimulation was achieved when the free Ca2+ concentration was about 80 nm. With increasing concentration of calmodulin in the presence of saturating free Ca2+ (1.1 μm), a stimulation of GTP binding activity up to 3-fold was observed, as shown in Fig. 3B. Approximately 180 nm calmodulin was required to induce half-maximum stimulation. The data in Fig. 3,A and B, was fit to the Hill equation B = Bmax[C]γ/(K Aγ+ [C]γ), where the Hill coefficient γ for free Ca2+ is 0.244, and γ for calmodulin is 0.352. The negative cooperativity allows sensitivity of response over a wide concentration range (Fig. 3, A and B,insets). These results are consistent with the known requirement of Ca2+ and calmodulin for the interaction between calmodulin and most of its target proteins (25Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 26Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 3-15Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, in vitro study shows the concentration of calmodulin producing half-maximal activation of immobilized CaM kinase II in response to Ca2+ spikes was 271 nm for α subunit and 70 nm for β subunit, respectively (27De Konink P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar).Figure 3Stimulation of [32P]GTP binding to Ral-A by Ca2+ and calmodulin. GTP binding activity of Ral-A was determined using a spin column filtration assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 200 μl of Ral-A preparation (about 20 pmol) was incubated with 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the absence and presence of CaCl2 and calmodulin at 37 °C for 90 min. Aliquots of 60 μl were withdrawn in triplicate and directly applied to the spin column matrix. The flow-through was collected from the spin columns, and [α-32P]GTP binding to Ral-A was measured by scintillation counting. Results represent the mean of three independent experiments and are expressed as -fold stimulation ± S.D. relative to control samples (in the absence of CaCl2 or calmodulin). A shows -fold stimulation at 240 nmcalmodulin as a function of increasing concentrations of free Ca2+. B shows -fold stimulation at 1.1 μm CaCl2 as a function of increasing concentrations of calmodulin. The data in A and Bwas fit to the Hill equation B =B max[C]γ/(K Aγ+ [C]γ), where K A for free Ca2+ is 80.5 nm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.978; K A for calmodulin is 180.2 nm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.992.Inset, -fold activation of [α-32P]GTP binding as a function of concentrations of CaCl2 or calmodulin on a logarithmic scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is known that guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as RalGAP, RalGDS, and RalGDI, are responsible for direct interaction with and regulation of the “on” and “off” status of Ral protein through the conformational transitions induced by the cycle of GTP/GDP exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Although Hinoi et al. (28Hinoi T. Kishida S. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19710-19716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that post-translational modification of Ral enhances the action of RalGDS to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange on Ral, the modes of activation and action of RalGDS or RalGAP have not yet been clarified. The Ca2+/calmodulin effect on GTP binding activity of Ral-A differs from that of Ral-A regulatory factors. The maximum stimulation of GTP binding by Ca2+/calmodulin of about 3-fold is lower than the enhanced proportion of Ral-A GTP-bound form induced by RalGDS in COS-7 cells (11Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). RalGAP partially purified from human platelet cytosol also stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ral-A by at least 6-fold (29Bhullar R. Seneviratne H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 181-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that activation by Ca2+/calmodulin may be less effective than those of Ral-A regulatory factors and thus it might act in conjunction with regulatory factors in vivo.The sensitivity of GTP binding of Ca2+ (half-maximal activation at 80 nm) is within the range of the increase in Ca2+ from a resting level of about 20 nm to levels of 1 μm or more in cells responding to incoming signals. Calmodulin, acting as a Ca2+-sensor protein, is present in large excess in cells, although the free concentration of Ca2+-bound calmodulin is limiting and essentially all the Ca2+-bound calmodulin present in the cell must be bound to targets (30Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The very low physiological levels of free Ca2+-bound calmodulin indicates that small changes in the affinity of a typical target could significantly affect the level of its activity at a submaximal intracellular Ca2+, as demonstrated recently for smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase activity (31Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports the notion that the sensitivity of Ral-A to Ca2+ has potential physiological significance. Wolthuis et al. (24Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) reported that an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ through Ca2+ influx stimulated by ionomycin, or release from intracellular Ca2+stores induced by thapsigargin, induced a rapid activation of Ral in platelets. In addition, Hofer et al. (32Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that endogenous levels of activated GTP-bound Ral (Ral-GTP) was increased by treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in Rat fibroblasts. However, the Ca2+ sensitivity of Ral activation has not yet been reported in these papers. Although the precise mechanism of Ral activation by Ca2+ is unknown, it is speculated that Ca2+-dependent calmodulin binding to Ral may have a direct effect on Ral activation (24Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Recently, a growing number of calmodulin binding proteins have been identified among Ras-related GTPases, including members of the Rad family of GTPases (including Rad, Gem, and Kir) and Rin family of GTPases (including Rin, Rit, and Ric) (33Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Zhu J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

However, [3H]GTP or [3H]GDP binding activity of GST/Rad was not affected by calmodulin, neither was its GTP hydrolysis activity (34Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Zhu J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11832-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and calmodulin inhibits GTP binding to GST/Kir and GST/Gem (33Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of calmodulin on Rad, Kir, and Gem were seen in the absence of Ca2+ (33Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Zhu J. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11832-11839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Parket al. (37Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported that the interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin with Rab3A induces its dissociation from synaptic membranes. The same effect can be achieved by RabGDI (37Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but compared with Ca2+/calmodulin with less effect and a less stringent requirement for GDP than that of RabGDI (37Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly to this finding, our work has shown that the stimulatory effect of calmodulin on Ral-A GTP binding is Ca2+-dependent and appears to be less effective than that of Ral-A regulatory effectors, suggesting that the regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin and GTP/GDP exchange factors of this Ras protein may occur by a different mechanism and possibly in conjunction with other Ral effectors. While Ca2+/CaM enhances the initial rate and apparent sensitivity of GTP binding to Ral-A, it needs to be determined whether this occurs via enhancement of GDP/GTP exchange, by increases in the number and/or affinity of GTP binding sites, or by displacement by calmodulin of an autoinhibitory domain from the active site (38Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This work shows a direct functional regulation of Ral-A by Ca2+/calmodulin in the physiological range and suggests a potential role of Ral-A in Ca2+-regulated pathways. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous, highly conserved Ca2+sensor protein that translates the Ca2+ signal into a wide variety of cellular processes. In response to an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change that results in binding to its target proteins and acts as a trigger to modify their functions. Calmodulin-binding proteins therefore play an important role in intracellular Ca2+ signaling and in various physiological functions, including glycogen metabolism, secretion, muscle contraction, actin/cytoskeletal organization, and cell division (1Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 2Walsh M.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ras proteins are integral to signal transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus, thus regulating a diverse spectrum of intracellular processes (3Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates the existence of a direct link between signaling pathways of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ras proteins. RasGRF, a neuronal Ras-guanine nucleotide releasing factor, has been shown to be activated in response to Ca2+ via direct binding of calmodulin (5Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+channels induces neurite growth via activation of Ras, which in turn activates the serine/threonine protein kinase, Raf (6Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S.

Delaat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported that epidermal growth factor-induced Ca2+ influx is mediated by Rac proteins. Rapid activation of Rap1 in human platelets has been shown to be mediated by an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (9Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, an increasing number of Ras-related proteins and Ras protein effectors have been identified as calmodulin-binding proteins, supporting the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin in regulation of Ras-related GTPase function. IQGAP1, a novel RasGAP-related and Ras-binding protein, has been found to bind to calmodulin and the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 is modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (10Joyal J.L. Annan R.S.

Ral proteins represent a distinct family of Ras-related GTP-binding protein. RalGDS was found to interact with ras p21 specifically and to function as an effector target in Ras signaling pathways, inducing cellular transformation in parallel with activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (11Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Ral-A has been shown to be involved in the tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of phospholipase D, suggesting that the signaling pathway from Ras to Ral leads to the regulation of phospholipid metabolism (14Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Ral may also have a functional role in regulating the cytoskeleton through its interaction with the effector protein RLIP (Ral interacting protein) and Cdc42 (15Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In addition, the diverse subcellular localization of Ral-A, not only in plasma membrane, but also in endocytotic vesicles, synaptic vesicles (16Bielinske D.F. Pyun H.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.G. Fine R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Volknandt W. Pevsner J. Elferink L.A. Scheller R.H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16383-16389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that Ral proteins may be involved in exo- or endocytosis and membrane traffic. However, the physiological activation of Ral by extracellular stimuli is largely unknown. We have reported that Ral-A, purified from human erythrocyte plasma membrane, can bind to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and its calmodulin binding domain has been identified and characterized near its C-terminal region (19Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Sequence analysis of AEBP2 cDNA revealed that it encodes a protein containing three Gli-Krüppel (Cys2-His2)-type zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis revealed two transcripts (4.5 and 3.5 kilobases) which were ubiquitously expressed in every mouse tissue examined. In co-transfection assays, AEBP2 repressed transcription from the homologous aP2 promoter containing multiple copies of the AE-1 sequence. Moreover, a chimeric construct encoding a fusion AEBP2 protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was able to repress the transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter containing the Gal4-binding sequence. The transcriptional repression function of AEBP2 was completely abolished when one of the conserved histidine residues and a flanking serine residue in the middle zinc finger were replaced with an arginine residue. The defective transcriptional repression function of the mutant derivative was due neither to lack of expression nor to a failure to localize to the nucleus. Moreover, both the wild-type and mutant derivative of either the histidine-tagged recombinant AEBP2 proteins or the in vitro translated Gal4-AEBP2 fusion proteins were equally able to bind to the target DNA. These results suggest that a portion of the zinc finger structure may play a direct role in transcriptional repression function, but not in DNA binding.

The AE-1 sequence (nucleotides −159 to −125) in the proximal promoter region of the aP2 gene functions in aP2 gene expression as either a positive or a negative regulatory element.

Other AE-1-binding proteins (termed AEBP) in 3T3 preadipocytes have been implicated as transcriptional repressors in the regulation ofaP2 gene expression (5Herrera R. Ro H.-S. Robinson G.S.

To clone a cDNA encoding a protein that interacts at the AE-1 site, we expressed cDNAs from a 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell library with a Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene) and screened for the clones by the Affinity Screening procedure using random concatamers of the AE-1 sequence. Three independent phage plaques were isolated that produce fusion proteins interacting specifically with the AE-1 sequence. Further analysis revealed that one cDNA clone encodes mRNA whose expression is down-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. This cDNA and its encoded protein, AEBP1, has been previously characterized in detail. AEBP1 is a novel carboxypeptidase, and the carboxypeptidase activity of AEBP1 is involved in aP2 repression. AEBP1, by binding to the regulatory AE-1 site, acts as a negative regulator ofaP2 gene expression (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A new member of the family of AE-1-binding proteins, being reported here, is a zinc finger protein which is able to repress reporter gene expression through both homologous and heterologous promoters. Overexpression of AEBP2 in cells with a reporter construct, which is driven by the aP2promoter containing a multiple copies of the AE-1 sequence, resulted in repression of transcriptional activity. Furthermore, an AEBP2 fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 was able to repress the expression of a reporter gene driven by a heterologous promoter with five copies of the Gal4-binding sequence. Significantly, the repression function of AEBP2 was completely abolished, without affecting its DNA binding ability and expression level, when one of the conserved histidine residues in the middle zinc finger motif was mutated. These results indicate that the middle zinc finger motif of AEBP2 is critical for the transcriptional function, and suggest that some of the zinc finger motif may not be involved in DNA binding. To clone a cDNA encoding a protein that interacts at the AE-1 site (nucleotides −159 to −125 of the aP2 gene, Refs. 8Ro H.-S. Roncari D.A.K. Mol. Cell.

The 303-residue AEBP2 sequence was compared with the non-redundant GenBankTM data base using the National Center for Biotechnology Information program tblastn. Sequences with significant matches around the zinc finger domain include the human GLI protein and other related zinc finger transcription factors (smallest sum probability values less than 10−10) with GenBankTM accession numbers X07385, U60762, U57454,AF026305, U42462, D14827, AB007297, AB007295, AB007298, AB007296,D14828, and U42461. The AEBP2 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) to construct the AEBP2 expression plasmid pRc/CMVAEBP2. The Gal4-AEBP2 fusion expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning the AEBP2 open reading frame (from amino acids 7 to 247) into the Gal4 fusion vector pG4 as described (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For this construction, we utilized another AEBP2 cDNA (clone 20) whose 5′ end corresponds to nucleotide 104 of the full-length AEBP2 cDNA. The AEBP2 coding sequence was subcloned as a SmaI-XmnI fragment into pG4 in both orientations to construct pG4-AEBP2 and pG4-AEBP2(−), respectively. Total RNA from different mouse tissues was prepared with the RNA STAT-60 Solution (TEL-TEST “B,” Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty micrograms of total RNA from each tissue were loaded on a formaldehyde denaturating 1% agarose gel and blotted onto MSI nylon transfer membrane (Micron Separations Inc.) as described (11Xu L. He G.-P. Li A. Ro H.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The filter was hybridized in the QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) with 32P-labeled AEBP2 cDNA probe in a hybridization oven (Hybaid) for 3 h at 65 °C. The filter was washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and twice with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C before exposure to x-ray film overnight at −70 °C. Recombinant AEBP2 protein was made by utilizing the expression vector pET-16b (Novagen) as described previously (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out by incubating the recombinant protein or the in vitro produced Gal4 fusion proteins, which were made by the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega), with 0.25 fmol of 32P-end-labeled AE-1 sequence in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 200 μm ZnCl2. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 6.75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.9, and 2.5% glycerol, and electrophoresed at 15 V/cm at 4 °C. Both the gel and the running buffer contained 200 μmZnCl2. For the competition assay, 50 fmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides, either specific AE-1 or nonspecific SP1 and AP3, were added to the reaction prior to the addition of the probe. The transient transfection assay was carried out by the Polybrene procedure (12Kawai S. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1172-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) as described previously (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells was performed with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid paP2(3AE-1/−120)CAT and 5 μg of the AEBP2 expression plasmid pRc/CMVAEBP2. The transfection was also performed with 5 μg each of the reporter plasmids pGALTKCAT or pTKCAT and the fusion Gal-AEBP2 expression plasmid pG4-AEBP2 or the control plasmid pG4-AEBP2(−). All transfections also included 1 μg of pHermes-lacZ. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed 48 h after transfection to normalize for transfection efficiency, and CAT activity was assayed as described (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cDNA expression library (Uni-Zap XR vector; Stratagene) was screened with random concatamers of the AE-1 sequence by the affinity screening procedure (10Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) as described previously (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Three independent phage plaques (A1, A2, and A8) produced fusion proteins interacting specifically with the AE-1 sequence. Further screening of the library with the partial cDNA sequence from A2 resulted in the isolation of a longer cDNA, which we named AEBP2 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 2, differing from AEBP1 (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA contains an open reading frame of 303 amino acid residues from the first ATG codon located at nucleotide 85 to a termination codon located at nucleotide 994 (Fig. 1A). The polypeptide predicted in the open reading frame from the first ATG codon has a calculated relative molecular mass of 33.3 kDa. Coupled in vitrotranscription and translation of the AEBP2 cDNA produced a protein with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa (data not shown). Moreover, a protein with a molecular mass of about 33 kDa was immunoprecipitated with antibody raised against the recombinant AEBP2 protein (data not shown). Therefore, based on the molecular weights of the endogenous andin vitro translated products and the Kozak rule for the translation initiation site (13Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), the first ATG codon is most likely the translation start site. The cDNA has a relatively long 3′-untranslated region with a consensus polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) and poly(A) tail. A schematic representation of AEBP2 cDNA is shown in Fig. 1B. The predicted protein contains three tandemly repeated sequence motifs related to the Gli-Krüppel (Cys2-His2)-type zinc finger (Fig. 2A). All three zinc fingers encoded by the cDNA of AEBP2 fit the consensus sequence for this type of zinc finger (Fig. 2B). Sequence alignment of the zinc fingers of AEBP2 with those of other zinc finger proteins containing three zinc finger motifs is shown in Fig. 2C. Outside the putative zinc finger motif, a single consensus phosphorylation site ((Ser*/Thr*)-Pro-X-(Lys/Arg)) for Cdc2 kinase, a highly conserved cell cycle regulatory serine/threonine kinase, exists in the open reading frame (SPSK, Fig. 1). The consensus phosphorylation site is flanked by the zinc finger domain and a region with high proportion of basic amino acids (KRRKLKNKRRR) that may be a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation at the SPSK site may affect the function of the NLS and regulate import of the protein into the nucleus (14Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Northern hybridization was conducted to determine the expression pattern of AEBP2 in a variety of mouse tissues. Two transcripts (∼4.5 and ∼3.5 kilobases) with different degrees of abundance were detected in all the tissues (Fig. 3). Relatively low levels of AEBP2 RNA were detected in the liver (lane 3). In contrast to all other tissues, the brain contained the larger form of AEBP2 RNA more abundantly (lane 6). In some tissues (e.g.skeletal muscle, brain, and heart) extra RNA with higher molecular weights were also detected (lanes 5, 6, and 8). The significance of such differential expression of AEBP2 mRNA in different tissues is not understood. AEBP2 transcripts were also detected in embryonic brain and liver tissues, and in the plancenta (data not shown). The ubiquitous nature of AEBP2 expression raises the possibility that AEBP2 may have an important function in mouse development. We have reported previously that the AE-1 site serves as a bifunctional element in the regulation ofaP2 gene expression (5Herrera R. Ro H.-S. Robinson G.S. Xanthopoulos K.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5331-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Ro H.-S. Roncari D.A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2303-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The AE-1 sequence binds either the transcriptional activator C/EBPα (5Herrera R. Ro H.-S. Robinson G.S. Xanthopoulos K.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5331-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or the transcriptional repressor AEBP1 (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). AEBP2, as another AE-1-binding protein, may also participate in this regulation. Histidine-tagged recombinant AEBP2 protein was used to characterize the binding properties of AEBP2 as described previously (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Here we show that AEBP2 binds to the AE-1 oligonucleotide in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 4). The AEBP2·AE-1 complex can be competed away by adding an excess amount of the unlabeled AE-1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 4, lane 3), but not by SP1 (lane 4) or by AP3 (lane 5) binding sequences. The binding reaction needs Zn2+, for very weak or no binding was observed in the absence of Zn2+ (data not shown). Interestingly, even without an intact second zinc finger motif, as indicated by mutating one of the conserved histidine residues (AEBP2 cDNA was digested with DraIII at nucleotides 422 to 430 and the newly created ends were blunted by exonuclease activity and ligated, replacing the histidine 114 and serine 115 residues with an arginine residue), the binding activity remained intact (data not shown). These results suggest that the second zinc finger motif is dispensable for DNA binding, and that the DNA binding activity may be localized in the other two fingers. To examine whether AEBP2 is able to regulate transcription through interaction with the AE-1 site, we used a reporter construct in which the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression is driven by the aP2promoter containing an AE-1 site (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), along with an AEBP2 expression plasmid (pRc/CMVAEBP2). In preliminary transient transfection experiments, we have not observed any effect of AEBP2 on expression of the CAT gene driven by the native aP2 promoter (−168 to +21), which contains the AE-1 site at nucleotides −159 to −125. This lack of effect may be due to a positive element (AP1) at nucleotide −125 to −118 (5Herrera R. Ro H.-S. Robinson G.S. Xanthopoulos K.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5331-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since transcriptional activity can be influenced by increasing the extent of binding site of a transcription factor, we have analyzed the transcription function of AEBP2 with a reporter containing a multiple copies of the AE-1 sequence. Transient transfection analysis with the CAT reporter plasmid paP2(3AE-1/−120)CAT, in which the CAT gene is driven by theaP2 promoter (−120 to +21) with three copies of the AE-1 sequence inserted upstream of the promoter, demonstrated that AEBP2 has repression activity. The CAT activity from cells co-transfected with pRc/CMVAEBP2 was significantly decreased compared with the CAT activity in cells co-transfected with the control plasmid pRc/CMV (Fig. 5A). From the in vitro binding assay, we concluded that the middle zinc finger is dispensable for binding to the AE-1 sequence. We therefore asked whether the mutation in the middle zinc finger has any affect on the repression function of AEBP2. We constructed an expression plasmid that expresses the mutant derivative of AEBP2, and analyzed the transcriptional repression function using the reporter plasmid paP2(3AE-1/−120)CAT. As shown in Fig. 5A, the repression activity of this mutant version of AEBP2 was significantly diminished, suggesting that the middle zinc finger may be critical for the repression function. To further characterize the transcriptional function of AEBP2, we used a AEBP2 fusion protein with an added DNA-binding specificity of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor as an effector, and the reporter plasmid pGALTKCAT, which contains five copies of the Gal4-binding sequence upstream of the TATA box of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter driving the CAT gene expression (9He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), in the transient transfection assay. After co-transfection with pGALTKCAT, a very low CAT activity was measured from the cells transfected with pG4-AEBP2, the Gal4-AEBP2 expression plasmid (Fig. 5B, lane 2), in comparison to the activity in the control cells transfected with the control plasmid pG4-AEBP2(−), in which the AEBP2 sequence is inserted in the opposite orientation in relation to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 5B, lane 1). No difference in the CAT activity was observed when pTKCAT, a reporter plasmid lacking a Gal4-binding site, was used (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, repression by AEBP2 requires localization to the promoter region, and the repression activity is specific and is not due to transcriptional “squelching” or to a general nonspecific shutdown of the RNA polymerase II machinery. Furthermore, these results suggest that the repression function of AEBP2 may be mediated by an active repression mechanism, rather than by a passive repression mechanism which usually involves by competition with a positive factor(s) in the binding to the common DNA site. As in the case of the homologous promoter assay, the mutation in the middle zinc finger of AEBP2 resulted in decreased repression activity when Gal4-AEBP2 was tested using a heterologous promoter with the Gal4-binding site (Fig. 5B, lane 3). To examine whether the wild-type and the mutant derivative of the Gal4-AEBP2 fusion proteins were equally expressed in the transfected cells, the fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-Gal4 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5C, both Gal4-AEBP2 (lane 1) and Gal4-AEBP2(HS/R) (lane 2) fusion proteins were equally detectable. The lack of repression function for the mutant derivative is not due to its failure to localize to the nucleus. Similar levels of wild-type and mutant derivative of the Gal4-AEBP2 fusion proteins were detected in the Western blot analysis of a nuclear fraction isolated from the transfected cells (data not shown). Moreover, this mutation did not affect the binding of the Gal4-AEBP2 fusion protein to the Gal4 binding sequence: both the wild-type and the mutant derivative were equally able to bind to the Gal4 binding sequence in the in vitro binding assay using the in vitro translated fusion proteins (Fig. 5D). These results further indicate that the middle zinc finger motif of AEBP2 is important for its repression function. In this report, we have characterized a novel transcriptional repressor (termed AEBP2) containing three copies of the Gli-Krüppel (Cys2-His2)-type zinc finger motif, and demonstrated that at least one of the zinc fingers is important for the repression function. The zinc finger structure, which was originally identified as DNA binding structure in the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIA (15Brown R.S. Sander C. Argos P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), is one of the well known common motifs among transcription factors. Zinc finger proteins can function as either activators or repressors, and most of these proteins, in addition to having the zinc finger motif whose transcriptional role is not clearly understood, contain other types of transcriptional domains. Some well defined activation motifs have been characterized by the presence of serine/threonine-rich, proline-rich, glutamine-rich, or acidic amino acid-rich domains (17Mitchell P.J. Tijian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). For repression, the alanine-rich domain in the Drosophila protein Krüppel has been shown to be responsible for its repression function (18Licht J.D. Grossel M.J. Figge J. Hansen U.M. Nature. 1990; 346: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Jaynes J.B. O'Farrell P.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Zuo P. Stanojevie D. Colgan J. Han K. Levine M. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain, an evolutionarily conserved Krüppel-associated box located in the N-terminal regions of more than one-third of all Krüppel-class zinc finger proteins, also has been characterized as a repression motif (21Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 22Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Other domains which have been implicated as repression motifs include a 34-amino acid element in the early growth response factor-1 transcription factor (23Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the SCAN box (the term derived from the first letters of the names of the four proteins initially found to contain a common motif:SRE-ZBP, CT-fin-51, AW-1,Number 18 cDNA; Ref. 24Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the POZ domain in the proto-oncogene product BCL-6 (25Seyfert V.L. Allman D. He Y. Staudt L.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar), a small C-terminal domain comprising the last 24 amino acids and containing several leucine-proline dipeptide repeats in the Mig1 protein (26Ostling J. Carlberg M. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and a glycine-rich region in the YY1 transcription factor (27Yang W.M. Inonye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A repression domain was also localized within the zinc finger region of YY1 (28Lee J.S. See R.H. Galvin K.M. Wang J. Shi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Unlike other zinc finger transcription factors, AEBP2 does not contain any of the repression motifs described above. Surprisingly, the repressing function of AEBP2 was totally abolished, without affecting its DNA binding ability, when the middle zinc finger was destroyed by mutating one of the conserved histidine residues. That a zinc finger motif is critical only for a transcription function has never been reported, although a functional domain which overlaps the DNA-binding domain has been localized in a zinc finger motif (28Lee J.S. See R.H. Galvin K.M. Wang J. Shi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The AEBP2 mutation in the middle zinc finger motif may alter the overall conformation of the AEBP2 protein, since the band shift of the Gal4-AEBP2·DNA complex was different between the wild-type and the mutant derivative (Fig. 5D). This apparent change in the conformation did not affect the DNA binding ability (Fig. 5D), but did severely affect the repression function of AEBP2 (Fig. 5, A andB). Three broad mechanisms of transcriptional repression function are hypothesized (29Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Repressors may directly compete with activators for binding to a common target DNA, repressors may bind simultaneously with activators but “quench” their functions, possibly by physically masking the activation domain, and the repressors may bind DNA and interact with the general transcription machinery itself, preventing the attainment of a transcriptionally competent state. For example, Krüppel-regulated transcription is in large part, through interactions with TFIIB and TFIIEβ, members of the general transcription machinery (30Sauer F. Fondell J.D. Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Jackle H. Nature. 1995; 375: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The repression by transcription enhancer factor-1 of human chorionic somatomammotropin promoter activity is thought to be mediated by direct interaction with the TATA-binding protein (31Jiang S.W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9510-9518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To interact with the general transcription machinery, this type of transcriptional repressor binds to specific sites in the promoter (30Sauer F. Fondell J.D. Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Jackle H. Nature. 1995; 375: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In some cases, the repressor may recruit a global regulator that functions as a co-repressor (27Yang W.M. Inonye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). AEBP2 may regulateaP2 gene expression similarly to one of those transcription factors that directly affect the general transcription machinery through an active repression mechanism. Alternatively, AEBP2 may recruit a co-repressor in the regulation of aP2 gene expression. The mutation in the middle zinc finger may cause an alteration of the overall conformation of the protein to prevent interaction with either the general transcription machinery or a co-repressor. Previous evidence indicates that members of the Cys2-His2 zinc finger class of transcription factors are involved in the transcriptional repression of growth factor gene expression (24Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and regulate cell differentiation, probably affecting the expression of the differentiation-specific genes (33Nguyen H.Q.

Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar; and AEBP2) transcription factors are involved in the regulation of aP2 gene expression through the AE-1 site. In contrast to AEBP2, which is expressed both in preadipocytes and adipocytes, 2G.-P. He and H.-S. Ro, unpublished data. C/EBPα is expressed only in the late stage of adipocyte differentiation (1Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

Muise, and H.-S. Ro, manuscript in preparation. Among these factors, specific interactions may take place to set the proper stage in the controlling of gene expression, by either competitively or synergistically, at different stage of physiological condition. In summary, the cloning and characterization of the structure, expression, transcriptional function, and DNA-binding property of the novel transcription factor AEBP2 have revealed that it is a new zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is able to bind specifically to the AE-1 site located in the proximal promoter region of theaP2 gene, and that the repression function, but not the DNA binding activity, requires an intact middle zinc finger motif. Two forms of AEBP2 mRNA are broadly expressed in various mouse tissues. AEBP2 may serve as a general transcriptional regulator since these transcripts were detected in both embryonic and adult tissues. We thank T. Hollenberg and R. A.

https://openalex.org/W2044408722,"Our recent studies on the process of immortalization of cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) have uncovered a previously undescribed, apparently epigenetic step, termed conversion. When first isolated, clonally derived HMEC lines of indefinite lifespan showed little or no telomerase activity or ability to maintain growth in the presence of TGFbeta. Cell populations whose mean terminal restriction fragment length had declined to <3 kb also exhibited slow heterogeneous growth, and contained many non-proliferative cells. With continued passage, these conditionally immortal cell populations very gradually converted to a fully immortal phenotype of good growth+/-TGFbeta, expression of high levels of telomerase activity, and stabilization of telomere length. We now show that exposure of the early passage conditionally immortal 184A1 HMEC line to the viral oncogenes human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-E6, -E7, or SV40T, results in either immediate (E6) or rapid (E7; SV40T) conversion of these telomerase negative, TGFbeta sensitive conditionally immortal cells to the fully immortal phenotype. Unlike conditional immortal 184A1, the HPV16-E7 and SV40T exposed cells were able to maintain growth in TGFbeta prior to expression of high levels of telomerase activity. A mutated HPV16-E6 oncogene, unable to inactivate p53, was still capable of rapidly converting conditional immortal 184A1. Our studies provide further evidence that the transforming potential of these viral oncogenes may involve activities beyond their inactivation of p53 and pRB functions. These additional activities may greatly accelerate a step in HMEC immortal transformation, conversion, that would be rate-limiting in the absence of viral oncogene exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2049210709,"A kinetic analysis of MspI DNA methyltransferase (M.MspI) is presented. The enzyme catalyzes methylation of λ-DNA, a 50-kilobase pair linear molecule with multiple M.MspI-specific sites, with a specificity constant (k cat/K M) of 0.9 × 108m−1s−1. But the values of the specificity constants for the smaller DNA substrates (121 and 1459 base pairs (bp)) with single methylation target or with multiple targets (sonicated λ-DNA) were less by an order of magnitude. Product inhibition of the M.MspI-catalyzed methylation reaction by methylated DNA is competitive with respect to DNA and noncompetitive with respect to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). TheS-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the methylation reaction is competitive with respect to AdoMet and uncompetitive with respect to DNA. The presteady state kinetic analysis showed a burst of product formation when AdoMet was added to the enzyme preincubated with the substrate DNA. The burst is followed by a constant rate of product formation (0.06 mol per mol of enzyme s−1) which is similar to catalytic constants (k cat = ∼0.056 s−1) measured under steady state conditions. The isotope exchange in chasing the labeled methyltransferase-DNA complex with unlabeled DNA and AdoMet leads to a reduced burst as compared with the one involving chase with labeled DNA and AdoMet. The enzyme is capable of exchanging tritium at C-5 of target cytosine in the substrate DNA in the absence of cofactor AdoMet. The kinetic data are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the M.MspI-catalyzed DNA methylation where DNA binds first. A kinetic analysis of MspI DNA methyltransferase (M.MspI) is presented.

TheS-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the methylation reaction is competitive with respect to AdoMet and uncompetitive with respect to DNA. The presteady state kinetic analysis showed a burst of product formation when AdoMet was added to the enzyme preincubated with the substrate DNA. The burst is followed by a constant rate of product formation (0.06 mol per mol of enzyme s−1) which is similar to catalytic constants (k cat = ∼0.056 s−1) measured under steady state conditions. The isotope exchange in chasing the labeled methyltransferase-DNA complex with unlabeled DNA and AdoMet leads to a reduced burst as compared with the one involving chase with labeled DNA and AdoMet. The enzyme is capable of exchanging tritium at C-5 of target cytosine in the substrate DNA in the absence of cofactor AdoMet. The kinetic data are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the M.MspI-catalyzed DNA methylation where DNA binds first. A class of DNA methyltransferases, referred to as m5C-DNA MTase, 1The abbreviations used are: Mtase, methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; bp, base pair; meDNA, methylated DNA. catalyzes transfer of a methyl group from the physiological methyl donor,S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), to C-5 of cytosine in the substrate DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In case of procaryotes, it primarily forms part of the restriction-modification system. But in higher organisms, it has been implicated to have a role in a variety of cellular functions such as developmental process (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), transposition (2Fedoroff N.V. Cell. 1989; 77: 473-476Google Scholar), recombination (3Engler P. Weng A. Storb U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), X-chromosome inactivation (4Gartler S.N. Riggs A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1983; 17: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and genomic imprinting (5Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 266: 362-365Crossref Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). All the m5C-DNA MTases, whether from virus, bacteria, or higher organisms, share a common architectural plan (6Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). They have six highly conserved and four not so well conserved motifs (7Kumar S. Chang X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although both adenine and cytosine DNA MTases show a degree of similarity in their architectural plan, there are important differences (8Timinskas A. Butkus V. Janulaitis A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Conservation of sequence is more prominent among members of the m5C-DNA MTase family than among those belonging to theN 6-adenine DNA MTase family (8Timinskas A. Butkus V. Janulaitis A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Kinetics of methyl transfer by M.HhaI (m5C-MTase) and M.EcoRI (N 6-adenine MTase) has been elucidated (9Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite both being bilobal and having a degree of similarity in structure, there are marked differences in the kinetic mechanism of these two methyltransferases. Both are known to be consistent with an ordered Bi Bi steady state mechanism. However, whereas the M.HhaI binds DNA first, the M.EcoRI binds AdoMet first (9Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic mechanism for m5C-DNA MTases is well understood, significant differences do exist among them from a kinetic standpoint. Two of the m5C-MTases, M.Dcm and M.BspRI, transfer the methyl group to themselves when incubated with AdoMet in the absence of DNA (11Hanck T. Schmidt S. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Szilak L. Finta C. Patthy A. Venetianer P. Kiss A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This unique feature of suicidal self-methylation has not been reported for any other enzyme of the m5C-DNA MTase family. The M.MspI displays many important features, which are uncommon to other m5C-MTases. For instance, it has the largest N-terminal sequence (107 bases) among the methylases of bacterial restriction/modification systems (7Kumar S. Chang X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), it induces a bend in the substrate DNA in a sequence-specific manner (13Dubey A.K. Bhattacharya S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2025-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and it has also been shown to possess a topoisomerase activity (14Matsuo K. Silke J. Gramatikoff K. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5354-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In view of these unique features of the M.MspI and the fact that it recognizes DNA substrates differently than its isoschizomer M.HpaII, we attempted to investigate its kinetic mechanism. In the present communication, we report the kinetic parameters for methylation and tritium exchange reactions of the M.MspI, and a kinetic analysis of product inhibition and presteady state kinetics. Escherichia coli K-12 strain ER 1727 [_(mcr BC−) hsdRMS− mrr)2::Tn 10,mcrA1272:: Tn 10, F′lacproABlacIq_(lacZ)−M15] was used for overexpression of the target gene which was placed downstream of the T7 promoter regulated by the lac operator in the expression vector pMSP (15Mi S. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4811-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The E. coli strain ER 1727 harboring recombinant plasmid pMSP was cultivated in Luria Broth containing 150 μg ml−1 ampicillin. The cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested as reported previously (13Dubey A.K. Bhattacharya S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2025-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The harvested cells (0.5 g) were suspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The cell suspension was sonicated for 3 min with burst and gap periods of 15 s at 14-μm amplitude in a Sonirep 150 (New Brunswick, Edison, NJ). The temperature during sonication was maintained at 5 ± 2 °C. The sonicated cell suspension was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 30 min. The cell-free extract, so recovered, was treated as a crude preparation from the MspI methylase. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity on the following ion-exchange columns: phosphocellulose, S-Sepharose, and Q-Sepharose as described previously (16Dubey A.K. Mollet B. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol for storage and further use. To determine the temperature where the M.MspI displayed optimum activity, methylation reactions were carried out at different temperatures in the range of 10–40 °C in NS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm EDTA; 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 20 min at the corresponding temperature in a heat block (VWR Scientific) prior to enzyme addition. For estimation of the optimum value of pH for the M.MspI activity, assay buffers with pH values in the range of 6.5–9.0 were used, and the methylase activity was determined at the corresponding reaction pH. Quantitative assay of the methyltransferase activity was performed by measuring the incorporation of [3H]methyl group into the substrate DNA according to the procedures described elsewhere (9Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dubey A.K. Mollet B. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, the following procedures were adopted for quantitative methyltransferase assay. For procedure a, the methylation reaction involving 50 nm32P-DNA (1459-bp BstXI fragment from φX174 DNA) and 200 nm [3H]AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol) was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol at 37 °C; 10-μl aliquots from a 30-μl reaction mixture were withdrawn at intervals of 1 min for a total period of 30 min and added to a 300-μl slurry of DE52 (50% v/v in H2O). Prior to addition of the reaction mixture, a 1 mm solution of AdoHcy was mixed with the slurry in 1:1 ratio to quench the MTase activity. The resin was washed with six 1-ml portions of 0.2m NH4HCO3, followed each time by a 2-min centrifugation at 1000 rpm. After a final wash with 1 ml of H2O, the adsorbed radioactivity was eluted from the resin by addition of 600 μl of acidified milli-Q water (550 μl of H2O + 50 μl of 1 n HCl). The supernatant was recovered following centrifugation at 1000 rpm, and radioactivities (3H and 32P) were counted. Determination of concentrations of 32P-DNA and [3H] methyl group was based on a correlation between the disintegrations/min and the molar concentration. For 32P-DNA this correlation was established by determining the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically and obtaining the disintegrations/min value from the scintillation counter. For [3H]AdoMet, the values of disintegrations/min were from the known concentration of [3H]AdoMet as provided by the supplier. According to these determinations 2200 dpm corresponded to 1 pmol of double-stranded DNA and 33,300 dpm of methyl- 3H corresponded to 1 pmol of AdoMet. For procedure b, another set of reactions for the assay of the M.MspI activity involved the use of unlabeled 1459-bpBstXI fragment of φX174 as substrate under the typical reaction conditions described above. The reactions were initiated by adding serially diluted M.MspI solutions (3 μl), and the reaction was incubated for 1 min. A 20-μl sample from a 30-μl reaction mixture was spotted on DE81 filter discs placed in a filter manifold. The filter discs were washed twice with 0.2 mNH4HCO3, twice with 80% EtOH in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and once with 90% EtOH in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The filters were dried under vacuum suction on the filter manifold and subsequently under a lamp prior to measurement of the radioactivity in 4 ml of scintillant (Supertron, Kontron). The amount of enzyme that transferred 1 pmol of [3H]methyl group to the substrate DNA was thus obtained. One unit of the M.MspI activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that incorporated 1 pmol of [3H]methyl group into the DNA at saturating concentration of the substrates (50 nm DNA, ∼200 nm AdoMet) in 1 min at 37 °C. The specific activity of M.MspI referred to units/mg protein, that is picomoles of [3H]methyl group/min/mg of protein. The procedure for determination of protein concentration was based on Bradford's principle (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and was performed by using the Bio-Rad Coomassie plus kit. Standard curves were established using bovine serum albumin. Electrophoretic analyses of protein samples were carried out in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using Laemlli buffer (18Zwieb C. Kim J. Adhaya S. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Studies of Protein-DNA Interactions. Birkhauser Verlag, Berlin1991: 245-257Crossref Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. SalI, EcoRI, andSalI-HindIII fragments (121 bp) containing a single M.MspI-specific site (5′-CCGG-3′), prepared from plasmid pBend2 (18Zwieb C. Kim J. Adhaya S. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Studies of Protein-DNA Interactions. Birkhauser Verlag, Berlin1991: 245-257Crossref Google Scholar), were used as DNA substrates. A third DNA substrate was prepared using XhoI digestion of pBend2 to produce a linear 121-bp fragment containing the 5′-CCGG-3′ sequence 19 bp from the 5′ end. This third substrate was different than the first two with regard to the position of the 5′-CCGG-3′ sequence along the molecule. Although the first two substrates had identical length as well as position of the 5′-CCGG-3′ along the molecule (70 bp from the 5′ end), they differed from one another with respect to bases flanking the canonical sequence. A larger substrate of 1459 bp was derived from φX174 DNA using BanI digestion (the 5′-CCGG-3′ sequence was 84 bp from the 5′ end). This substrate was cyclized (13Dubey A.K. Bhattacharya S.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2025-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and digested with BstXI to obtain the same length DNA fragment with the 5′-CCGG-3′ position being 702 bp from the 5′ end. The hemi-methylated DNA was generated as follows. A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-CCTAG-3′, was ligated to one strand of the double-stranded 1459-bp BanI fragment to create size difference between the strands. It was subsequently methylated using excess of AdoMet and M.MspI. The strands of the modified as well as the unmodified 1459-bp fragments were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 6 m urea. The complementary strands were mixed in equimolar ratio to obtain hemi-methylated DNA. All the DNA substrates were purified from native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by electroelution in a dialysis bag (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and reprecipitated. Their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (18Zwieb C. Kim J. Adhaya S. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Studies of Protein-DNA Interactions. Birkhauser Verlag, Berlin1991: 245-257Crossref Google Scholar) using aliquots after redissolving the precipitated DNA. The 1:1 annealing of the hemi-methylated substrate was confirmed by studying thermal denaturation/renaturation kinetics by determining the absorbance at 260 nm spectrophotometrically. Features of the various DNA substrates, obtained as above, are summarized in Table I.Table IFeatures of different fragments of DNA used as substrate for M.MspI in kinetic analysisOrigin/sourceSizeFragmentPosition of CCGG from the 5′ endbase pairspBend2121XhoI19pBend2121SalI–EcoRI70pBend2121SalI–HindIII70φX1741459BanI84φX1741459BstXI702φX1741459:1464; hemi-methylatedBstXI702In addition to the above defined substrate containing a single M.MspI-specific methylation site, 50-kilobase pair λ-DNA molecule was used as a much longer substrate for the enzyme with 328 sites per molecule.

Open table in a new tab In addition to the above defined substrate containing a single M.MspI-specific methylation site, 50-kilobase pair λ-DNA molecule was used as a much longer substrate for the enzyme with 328 sites per molecule. Both intact and the sonicated forms of the λ-DNA were used in evaluation of the kinetic parameters. The data from kinetic studies were analyzed as described by Wu and Santi (9Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the FORTRAN program of Cleland (20Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The statistical criteria of Cleland (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) were used in the current analysis. Kinetic studies were done using all of the DNA substrates that were prepared from plasmid pBend2 and φX174. The determination of initial velocity was made by performing the methyltransferase assay under conditions described earlier. In a series of identical reactions containing 0.03 nm M.MspI (specific activity ∼145 × 108 units mg−1) and 200 nm [3H]AdoMet, the concentration of the substrate DNA was varied in the range of 1–25 nm. A double-reciprocal plot of the initial velocity versus DNA concentration allowed the determination ofK MDNA and V max. Similarly, initial velocities were obtained by varying the concentration of [3H]AdoMet in the range of 5–50 nm while keeping the DNA concentration fixed at 50 nm and keeping other reaction conditions identical. The double-reciprocal plot of initial velocity versus[3H]AdoMet concentration allowed the determination ofK MAdoMet andV max. The catalytic constant (k cat) was calculated as the ratio ofV max (0.1 nm min−1) to the enzyme concentration used (0.03 nm), taking 49 kDa as the molecular mass of the M.MspI. The kinetic constants were also determined for intact and sonicated λ-DNA. While determining initial velocities, the product formation was measured under such conditions that overall inhibition of the reaction by AdoHcy (generated) was less than 5%. Thus the highest AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio allowed in the present experiments was ∼0.03. The 1459-bp BstXI fragment was used as the DNA substrate for the experiments pertaining to product inhibition kinetics. The methylated DNA (meDNA) fragments used for substrate inhibition studies were obtained by incubating 600 nm DNA with 1.2 mm[3H]AdoMet in a reaction volume of 30 μl for a period of 100 min using 0.03 nm enzyme. After being extracted twice with chloroform it was precipitated with ethanol, dried, and used. The product inhibition studies were performed under identical conditions as described for the quantitative MTase assay. Inhibition by AdoHcy was studied using 200 nm [3H]AdoMet (fixed concentration) while keeping the AdoHcy concentrations fixed (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 nm) and varying the concentration of substrate DNA from 1 to 25 nm for each of the fixed concentrations of AdoHcy. Similarly, another series of identical reactions included 50 nm substrate DNA (fixed concentration); AdoHcy concentrations fixed at 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 nm and [3H]AdoMet concentrations varied in the range of 5–50 nm for each of the fixed concentrations of AdoHcy. The double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocityversus DNA/[3H]AdoMet concentrations were obtained at each concentration of the AdoHcy. These plots were used to determine the values of K iAdoHcy for DNA and for [3H]AdoMet by following the procedure described elsewhere (22Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions: Theory and Practice. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). For inhibition by meDNA, the AdoMet concentration was kept constant at 200 nm and that of the DNA was varied in the range of 1–20 nm against each of the chosen concentrations of the meDNA as follows: 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.7 nm. Similarly, another series of identical reactions was carried out at the fixed concentration of DNA (50 nm) and different concentrations of [3H]AdoMet ranging from 5 to 100 nm against each of the fixed concentrations of the meDNA as follows: 0.0, 3.0, and 7.0 nm. The data from these experiments were used to generate double-reciprocal plots of initial velocityversus variable substrate to determine the values ofK imeDNA for DNA and for AdoMet. In a 50-μl reaction volume of 5 μg of 1459-bp BstXI, DNA was labeled with 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (5 × 106cpm/μmol, NEN Life Science Products) and 40 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was purified by passing through (twice) a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer. In a 20-μl volume, 2 μm M.MspI was preincubated with 2 μm radiolabeled DNA (1459-bp BstXI DNA) for 2 min at 37 °C. For reaction initiation, a 4-μl aliquot of this mixture was removed and brought to a final volume of 200 μl with MTase buffer that contained 2 μm labeled DNA and 0.5 μm [3H]AdoMet. This mixture (after addition of a 4-μl aliquot as above) was incubated for a total period of 30 s; 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn at intervals of 5 s for activity measurements. Another reaction was set up where 4-μl aliquots of preincubation mix of M.MspI (2 μm)-labeled DNA (2 μm) as above were made up to 200 μl with MTase buffer that contained 2 μmunlabeled DNA and 0.5 μm [3H]AdoMet. This mixture was incubated for 30 s as before, and 20-μl samples were withdrawn at 5-s intervals and analyzed as above. The moles of productmeDNA per mol of enzyme were calculated for all of these reactions. These data were used to obtain a plot of mole ofmeDNA per mol of enzyme versus time for further analysis. About 300 nm[methyl- 3H]DNA (1459-bp BstXI fragment) was incubated with 0.03 nm MspI methylase in the presence of 400 nm AdoHcy for a period of 30–100 min at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 30 μl prepared in the assay buffer described earlier. A 20-μl sample was withdrawn and analyzed for the MTase activity by the quantitative method (preparation b) mentioned above. The samples were spotted on DE81 filter discs and were counted for radioactivity using a scintillation counter to determine loss of radioactivity from the [methyl- 3H]DNA. A tritiated DNA was prepared by employing the forward reaction of the enzyme wherein 600 nm DNA (1459-bp BstXI fragment) was incubated in tritiated water (specific activity >6 × 105 dpm/mmol) with the M.MspI (1.5 nm) for about 100 min. The reaction was terminated by heating the reaction mixture at 70 °C for 5 min. The DNA was recovered by precipitation with absolute alcohol. The precipitation step was repeated twice; the precipitate was washed with 70% alcohol each time. The DNA preparations were digested with micrococcal nuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and with calf spleen phosphodiesterase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). The digestion products were subsequently analyzed on thin layer chromatography plates, which were phosphorimaged in a FUJI BAS2000 PhosphorImager using tritium-sensitive TR FUJI BAS2000 plates, to confirm the tritium incorporation into the cytosine. Release of tritium from [3H]DNA fragment, prepared above, was measured by a charcoal-binding assay. The exchange reaction was performed in a 30-μl reaction volume containing 0.5–2.5 nm [3H]DNA (specific activity 3 × 105 dpm/mmol) and 0.03 nm MspI methylase that was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples (10 μl) were withdrawn at an interval of 1 min for analysis. These samples were pipetted into a 0.99-ml suspension of Norit (charcoal, 7.5% w/v in 0.12 n HCl). The charcoal suspension was mixed with 490 μl of MilliQ water and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 2 min), and the resulting supernatant (500 μl) was recovered and filtered through glass wool in a double Eppendorf assembly, the upper one having a hole with glass wool. The filtrate (500 μl) so recovered was added to 4 ml of Supertron Scintillant (Kontron) for radioactivity measurement in a scintillation counter. The velocity of the M.MspI-catalyzed release of tritium from [3H]DNA per min was calculated. The effect of AdoHcy (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 nm) onV max of tritium release was determined using an identical assay. Furthermore, the effect of AdoMet at a level of 10 nm on the M.MspI-catalyzed tritium exchange was also observed. The M.MspI preparations purified to apparent homogeneity, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were used for the kinetic analysis. These preparations displayed optimal activity at a pH value of 7.5 and at the temperature of 36 ± 1 °C. An activation energy of 15.7 kJ mol was obtained for the enzyme from the Arrhenius plot (ln k/T versus 1/T; data not shown). The kinetics of methyl transfer on the C-5 of the target base (outer cytosine in the 5′-CCGG-3′ sequence) by the M.MspI has been investigated using a variety of substrates, which differed from one another with respect to (i) length in base pairs, (ii) position of the target sequence from the left end in the linear molecule, (iii) bases flanking the canonical sequence, and (iv) the methylation state of the strands. These variations in substrates allowed an examination of the kinetic parameters as affected by them and would further be helpful in elucidating the kinetic mechanism for the M.MspI. The progress of the M.MspI-catalyzed methylation of the 1459-bp fragment was determined in order to evaluate the period during which the rate of product formation remains linear. The progress curve was obtained by measuring the amount of product formed at different time intervals. A plot of the methylated DNA product versus time was obtained. The M.MspI-catalyzed methylation of the 1459-bp fragment by AdoMet progressively decreases as the reaction proceeds (Fig. 1A). The inhibition appears to be competitive with respect to AdoMet, and the nonlinear kinetics is consistent with competition by the AdoHcy generated in the reaction. I-catalyzed methylation reaction fits Equation 1, P/t=Vmax1−(KM/Ki)+KM(Ki+So)·1/tKM−Kiln SoSo−PEquation 1 which describes a reaction wherein the product, AdoHcy, shows competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate, AdoMet (23Orsi B.A. Tipton K.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 159-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).P is the amount of AdoHcy formed at time t, So is the initial AdoMet concentration, andK i is the dissociation constant of AdoHcy. The amount of AdoHcy formed corresponds to the amount of methylated DNA, the product which is measured in these experiments. Plots ofP/t versus (ln(So/(So −P))/t provide a series of lines with positive slopes (Fig. 1B) indicating that the K Mof AdoMet is much larger than K i. The kinetic parameters (K MDNA,K MAdoMet, andV max) were estimated from the double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration.

In the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena, in contrast to many eukaryotes, histone H1 of macronuclei is highly phosphorylated during interphase. Macronuclei divide amitotically without overt chromosome condensation in this organism, suggesting that requirements for phosphorylation of macronuclear H1 may be limited to transcriptional regulation. Here we report the major sites of phosphorylation of macronuclear H1 in Tetrahymena thermophila. Five phosphorylation sites, present in a single cluster, were identified by sequencing 32P-labeled peptides isolated from tryptic peptide maps. Phosphothreonine was detected within two TPVK motifs and one TPTK motif that resemble established p34cdc2 kinase consensus sequences. Phosphoserine was detected at two non-proline-directed sites that do not resemble known kinase consensus sequences. Phosphorylation at the two noncanonical sites appears to be hierarchical because it was observed only when a nearby p34cdc2 site was also phosphorylated. Cells expressing macronuclear H1 containing alanine substitutions at all five of these phosphorylation sites were viable even though macronuclear H1 phosphorylation was abolished. These data suggest that the five sites identified comprise the entire collection of sites utilized by Tetrahymena and demonstrate that phosphorylation of macronuclear H1, like the protein itself, is not essential for viability in Tetrahymena.

In eukaryotes, the association of DNA with histones in nucleosomes and the folding of nucleosomal filaments within chromatin can restrict the accessibility of DNA sequences to factors required for gene expression and DNA replication (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1989: 69-168Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1998: 17-157Google Scholar). Crystallographic analyses have led to detailed appreciation of the arrangement of core histones within nucleosomes and the histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions responsible for the stability of nucleosomal structure (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 4Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). Many aspects of nucleosome structure are expected to be common to all eukaryotes because core histones are among the most highly conserved proteins known (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1989: 69-168Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1998: 17-157Google Scholar). However, the structure and occurrence of proteins, collectively referred to as H1 or linker histones that bind the outer surface of nucleosomes and portions of the linker DNA extending between adjacent nucleosomes, are more variable (1van Holde K.E.

Data from recent biochemical and molecular genetic analyses have firmly established that chromatin structure plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression. Acetylation of conserved lysine residues within the amino termini of core histones, for example, is a major pathway for modulating transcriptional activity (7Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar, 8Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast, the function of linker histones and their various post-translational modifications in vivo remain unclear (5Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) are in contrast to evidence that linker histones can affect transcription positively or negatively in gene-specific fashionin vivo (12Shen X.

Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent observations suggest a role for H1 phosphorylation in transcriptional regulation (16Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Chadee D.N. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8113-8116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tetrahymena thermophila is a model organism that offers several advantages for investigations of the function and metabolism of linker histones. Like other ciliated protozoa, vegetativeTetrahymena contain two nuclei, a transcriptionally inactive, germ-line micronucleus, which divides mitotically, and a transcriptionally active, somatic macronucleus, which divides amitotically (18Gorovsky M.A. J. Protozool. 1973; 20: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Macronuclear H1 shares the overall amino acid composition and acid solubility characteristics of eukaryotic H1, in general, but lacks the central globular domain found in H1 of metazoans (6Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Gorovsky M.A. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the multiplicity of H1 genes found in most eukaryotes, the Tetrahymena haploid genome contains only one copy of the macronuclear H1 gene (20Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), facilitating methods of genetic transformation we have utilized previously to demonstrate that although macronuclear H1 is not required for viability, it is required for normal compaction of interphase chromatin (15Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and can function as a positive or negative regulator of expression in a gene-specific fashionin vivo (12Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Like H1 of multicellular eukaryotes, macronuclear H1 is a substrate for p34cdc2 in vitro, and we have presented evidence previously that suggests that this H1 is phosphorylated by a homolog of Cdc2 in vivo (21Roth S.Y. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Roth S.Y. Collini M.P. Draetta G. Beach D. Allis C.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, unlike many eukaryotes in which high levels of H1 phosphorylation occur mainly during mitosis, the majority of macronuclear H1 molecules are highly phosphorylated in unsynchronized, growing cultures of Tetrahymena (19Gorovsky M.A. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Roth S.Y. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J.

Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar). Given the absence of mitotic chromosome condensation in the amitotically dividing macronucleus (18Gorovsky M.A. J. Protozool. 1973; 20: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), these differences likely reflect the high percentage of the macronuclear genome that is transcribed (24Calzone F.J. Stathopoulos V.A. Grass D. Gorovsky M.A. Angerer R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6899-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inTetrahymena macronuclei, potential relationships between macronuclear H1 phosphorylation and chromatin transcription can be investigated apart from effects related to the hyperphosphorylation of linker histones at mitosis that occurs in other eukaryotes. In pursuit of this goal, we have mapped the major sites in macronuclear H1 that are phosphorylated in vivo in T. thermophila to enable a molecular genetic approach employing mutagenesis of sites to investigate the function of macronuclear H1 phosphorylation. T. thermophilastrains CU427 (Mpr/Mpr [6 mp-s VI]) and CU428 (Chx/Chx-[cy-S]VII) were grown in 1% enriched proteose peptone (SPP) as described previously (25Gorovsky M.A. Yao M.C. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 9: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The creation of strain Δ1–5 will be described in detail elsewhere. 1Y. Dou, C. A. Mizzen, C. D. Allis, and M. A. Gorovsky, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to convert the five phosphorylation sites to alanines in a construct containing theHHO1 gene coding region as well as 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, with a single copy of the neo2 cassette (26Gaertig J. Gu L. Hai B. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5391-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) containing the drug resistance marker neo inserted within the HHO1 gene 3′-flanking sequence. Complete replacement of the wild type HHO1 gene in polyploid macronuclei was obtained by homologous recombination following biolistic transformation and selection of transformants with paromomycin. Cultures were labeled continuously during growth overnight (14–16 h) in SPP containing 5–25 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Catalog No. 64014) and harvested at a density of 2.5–3.0 × 105 cells/ml. Incubation ofTetrahymena at 4 °C rapidly induces dephosphorylation of macronuclear H1. 2C. A. Mizzen and C. D. Allis, unpublished observations. Accordingly, except where noted, cells were collected by centrifugation at room temperature (1000 × g for 5 min) prior to disruption and extraction at 4 °C as described below. Macronuclei were isolated as described previously (27Sweet M.T. Carlson G. Cook R.G. Nelson D. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 916-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using 0.1 mm p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid in the homogenization and wash buffers to inhibit phosphatases (28Paulson J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Macronuclei were extracted with 0.2 mH2SO4, and crude macronuclear H1 was prepared by selective precipitation of other proteins with 5.4% (w/v final) perchloric acid (PCA). 3The abbreviations used are: PCA, perchloric acid; AU-PAGE, acetic acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Crude macronuclear H1 was recovered from the PCA-soluble fraction by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (20% w/v final), and these precipitates were washed once with acetone containing 0.1% (v/v) HCl and twice with acetone. Alternatively, crude macronuclear H1 was prepared by direct extraction of cells in 5.4% (w/v) PCA. Cells collected by centrifugation were washed twice at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, prior to sonication in 5 volumes of ice-cold 5.4% (w/v) PCA. Four to six 10-s bursts of sonication (Branson model 250 with semi-micro tip, output = 5, continuous duty) were required to disrupt the majority of cells. Sonicates were incubated in an ice water bath between bursts so that the temperature did not exceed 6 °C. Sonicates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and crude macronuclear H1 was recovered from the supernatant by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Purified macronuclear H1 was prepared from extracts of isolated macronuclei or whole cells by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a C8 column (Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm x 250 mm, Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and a gradient of acetonitrile (1% (v/v) per min) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Macronuclear H1 was recovered from RP-HPLC eluates by solvent evaporation. Proteins were analyzed in 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels (15 cm long) containing SDS (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar) or 15% (w/v) acrylamide gels (30 cm long) containing 6 m urea and 0.9n acetic acid (30Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled macronuclear H1 (1–10 mg/ml) in 50 mmNH4HCO3 was digested overnight (typically 14 h) at 37 °C with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma T-8642) using a 1:10 (w/w) trypsin:H1 ratio. The next morning, digests were supplemented with 50% more trypsin and incubated for 6 h. Excess NH4HCO3 was removed by repeated drying under vacuum, and digests were analyzed on 40% (w/v) acrylamide gels (resolving segment 10 cm long) at alkaline pH (31West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Gels were dried onto chromatography paper (Whatman No. 3MM) immediately following electrophoresis and exposed to autoradiographic film (Kodak X-Omat). Using autoradiograms as templates, phosphopeptide bands of interest were excised from the dried gels, and most of the backing paper was removed using a razor blade. Each phosphopeptide band was then cut into approximately 3 mm x 3 mm pieces, transferred to a 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube, and extracted with 5–10 volumes of distilled water for 4–6 h at 4 °C using a laboratory rotator. Following sedimentation of gel pieces by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the extraction was repeated overnight. The supernatants from both extractions were pooled and lyophilized or used directly for phosphopeptide purification by RP-HPLC. Phosphopeptides were recovered in salt-free form by RP-HPLC. Lyophilisates were dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and all samples were adjusted to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid prior to injection onto a C18 column (Vydac 218TP52, The Separations Group). After washing with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to return the base line to the preinjection level, the column was eluted with a shallow gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide elution was monitored at 214 nm and by liquid scintillation counting. Following solvent evaporation under vacuum, phosphopeptides were analyzed by amino-terminal sequencing. Macronuclear H1 or phosphopeptides were coupled to Immobilon-AA (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A system using standard techniques except that 90% (v/v) methanol containing 15 μl of 85% (w/v) phosphoric acid/100 ml was employed for residue extraction because this gave better recovery of phosphorylated derivatives. An in-line split diverted a portion of each sequencing cycle to a fraction collector to determine 32P content by liquid scintillation counting while the remaining portion was employed for residue identification by RP-HPLC. Macronuclear H1 prepared from Tetrahymena labeled with [32P]orthophosphate during vegetative growth was resolved into five distinct bands upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing acetic acid and urea (AU-PAGE) and in gels containing SDS (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1A). Essentially all the electrophoretic heterogeneity associated with macronuclear H1 in this species appears to be due to phosphorylation because it is abolished by incubating extracts with alkaline phosphatase prior to electrophoresis (19Gorovsky M.A. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Roth S.Y. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar, 32Glover C.V. Vavra K.J. Guttman S.D. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Careful alignment of gels and corresponding autoradiograms established that the fastest migrating species in each gel system represented nonphosphorylated macronuclear H1 (arrowheads, Fig. 1A). The observation that the AU-PAGE mobility of H1 proteins is inversely related to the degree of phosphorylation (33Balhorn R. Chalkley R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 40: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggests that the most slowly migrating form in AU-PAGE represented tetraphosphorylated macronuclear H1. Although 6 serine + threonine residues occur within the first 11 residues of this H1 (Fig. 3), phosphorylation was not detected between residues 1 and 12 when macronuclear H1 prepared from cultures grown overnight in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate was sequenced (data not shown). Due to the absence of potential sites between residues 12 and 30, we inferred that no phosphorylation occurs within the first 30 residues of this protein. We have shown previously that all phosphorylation in this species occurs in the amino-terminal fragment liberated upon CNBr cleavage of the methionine residue at position 692 (21Roth S.Y. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Together, these data suggest that all sites of phosphorylation can be localized to the segment extending from Thr-31 to Thr-68. Eleven potential sites of phosphorylation, comprising 2 serine and 9 threonine residues, together with numerous lysine residues are found within this 37-residue segment. To prepare phosphopeptides for microsequencing, 32P-labeled macronuclear H1 was digested extensively with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were resolved on polyacrylamide gels at alkaline pH (31West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following alignment of the autoradiograms and corresponding gels, bands of interest were excised from the dried gels and the phosphopeptides eluted by extracting excised gel pieces with water. Phosphopeptides were recovered from these eluates in salt-free form using RP-HPLC. This procedure enabled the recovery of eight phosphopeptides, purified to apparent homogeneity, representing all the major species and all but one of the minor species detected in the original digest (Fig. 1B). Single peaks of radioactivity were detected for all eight peptides when RP-HPLC eluates were monitored by liquid scintillation counting, suggesting that each band in the original gels was homogeneous (data not shown). Each of these eight phosphopeptides was analyzed by microsequencing. Plots of the 32P cpm released (y axis) against the major amino acid released in each sequencing cycle (xaxis) unequivocally identified 2 serine and 3 threonine residues as sites of phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Remarkably, the eight phosphopeptides represented only three peptide “families” in which either the same sequence was phosphorylated to different extents (e.g. phosphopeptides 1 and 7, phosphopeptides 3 and 6) or the same phosphorylation site was contained within both a limit tryptic peptide and a slightly longer peptide resulting from incomplete digestion (e.g. phosphopeptides 2 and 4, phosphopeptides 5 and 9, phosphopeptides 6 and 7). Three phosphorylation sites, Ser-42, Ser-44, and Thr-46, were identified during the sequencing of phosphopeptides 1, 3, 6, and 7, which are all related to the limit tryptic peptide spanning residues 40–49. Phosphorylation at Thr-34 was detected during sequencing of the peptides spanning residues 30–37 (phosphopeptide 4) and residues 29–39 (phosphopeptide 2). Phosphorylation at Thr-53 was detected during sequencing of the peptides spanning residues 51–56 (phosphopeptide 9) and residues 51–60 (phosphopeptide 5). These data are summarized and compared with findings for T. pyriformis(34Hayashi T. Hayashi H. Iwai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in Fig. 3. Although the analysis of macronuclear H1 phosphorylation in T. pyriformis did not provide unambiguous localization of phosphorylation to single residues in every instance, comparison of the two macronuclear H1 sequences suggests that three of the T. thermophila sites identified here, Thr-34, Ser-44, and Thr-46, are conserved as Thr-35, Ser-46, and Thr-48, respectively, in T. pyriformis (Fig. 3). Given these similarities, it is surprising that these species differ with regard to phosphorylation in their carboxyl-terminal domains. Based on microsequencing of 32P-labeled tryptic peptides, phosphorylation at five sites accounts for all of the major species resolved on the phosphopeptide maps, suggesting that these five sites comprise the entire collection of sites utilized in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed macronuclear H1 phosphorylation in aTetrahymena strain, Δ1–5, expressing macronuclear H1 in which alanine was substituted for Ser/Thr at the identified phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4A). A detailed description of the creation, molecular characterization, and phenotypic analysis of this strain will be given elsewhere.1 Initial analyses of macronuclear H1 from growing Δ1–5 cells on SDS gels revealed normal amounts of macronuclear H1 completely lacking the electrophoretic heterogeneity associated with macronuclear H1 from growing wild type cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of Δ1–5 macronuclear H1 did not occur in vivo or occurred at a limited number of sites in a manner that was not sufficient to retard migration of the protein in SDS gels. To determine whether Δ1–5 macronuclear H1 was phosphorylated to any extent in vivo, we labeled Δ1–5 and wild type cells in parallel with [32P]orthophosphate during growth overnight, prepared H1 from whole cell extracts, and analyzed it by autoradiography of SDS gels. Even though phosphorylation was readily detected in macronuclear H1 from wild type cells, phosphorylation was not detected when an equivalent amount of macronuclear H1 from Δ1–5 cells was analyzed in parallel, even after lengthy autoradiographic exposures (Fig. 4B). Because macronuclear H1 from the wild type cells (but not that from Δ1–5 cells) was prepared using a method that enriched less phosphorylated forms, we conclude that macronuclear H1 is not detectably phosphorylated in growing Δ1–5 cells under the conditions employed here. Taken together, these data suggest that the five sites identified by microsequencing represent the complete set of macronuclear H1 phosphorylation sites utilized by T. thermophila. Alternatively, a hierarchy of sites in macronuclear H1 may exist such that the abolition of phosphorylation (or possibly the alanine substitution itself) at one or more of the sites mutated in Δ1–5 macronuclear H1 precludes phosphorylation at unidentified secondary sites. It should be noted that our analyses of phosphopeptides 1, 3, 6, and 7 indicate that, in wild type cells, phosphorylation occurs hierarchically, first at Thr-46, then at Ser-42, and last at Ser-44,in vivo (Fig. 2). Whether this hierarchy extends to other sites is not known at present. Regardless of whether we have identified all of the sites of phosphorylation, it is clear that eliminating the 5 sites identified here results in cells completely lacking detectable phosphorylation of macronuclear H1. Our findings that macronuclear H1 phosphorylation is not essential and that Δ1–5 strain cells are viable without marked alterations in growth,1 suggest either that macronuclear H1 phosphorylation does not have major, global effects on transcription or that mechanisms exist that are capable of compensating for the absence of macronuclear H1 phosphorylation in Δ1–5 cells. Further analyses of the Δ1–5 strain, in comparison with wild type Tetrahymena and to strains constructed to mimic constitutive phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of all or some of the five sites identified here, should define the function of macronuclear H1 phosphorylation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2129097146,"Recently, we obtained x-ray crystallographic data showing the presence of a ZnS4 center in the structure of Escherichia coli-expressed bovine endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and rat neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS). The zinc atom is coordinated by two CXXXXC motifs, one motif being contributed by each NOS monomer (cysteine 326 through cysteine 331 in rat nNOS). Mutation of the nNOS cysteine 331 to alanine (C331A) results in the loss of NO⋅ synthetic activity and also results in an inability to bind zinc efficiently. Although prolonged incubation of the C331A mutant of nNOS with high concentrations ofl-arginine results in a catalytically active enzyme, zinc binding is not restored. In this study, we investigate the zinc stoichiometry in wild-type nNOS and eNOS, as well as in the C331A-mutated nNOS, using a chelation assay and electrothermal vaporization-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The data reveal an approximate 2:1 stoichiometry of heme to zinc in (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin-replete, wild-type nNOS and eNOS and show that the reactivated C331A mutant of nNOS has a limited ability to bind zinc. The present study substantiates that the zinc in NOS is structural rather than catalytic and is important for maintaining optimally functional, enzymatically active, constitutive NOSs.

All of the aforementioned cofactors are required for full enzymatic activity; thus cofactor binding would be expected to alter the enzyme function. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that cysteine 99 of human eNOS is involved in BH4 binding to that isoform (12Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and mutation of iNOS cysteine 109 leads to diminished BH4binding (13Ghosh D.K. Wu C.Q. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of the entire CXXXXC motif (Fig. 1) in bovine eNOS causes a dramatic loss of enzyme stability (14Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test the possibility of altered cofactor binding in nNOS, we mutated cysteine 331 (the homologous residue to cysteine 99 of human eNOS) to alanine and have shown that this mutation affectsl-arginine binding and reductase-to-heme electron transfer (15Miller R.T Martásek P.

Prolonged incubation of the nNOS C331A mutant with high concentrations of l-arginine is required for substrate binding to this mutant. However, once l-arginine binding is restored, BH4 can then bind, resulting in efficient flavoprotein-to-heme electron transfer. This reactivated mutant, with BH4 and l-arginine bound, possesses the same electron transfer properties and enzymatic activity as wild-type nNOS (16Martásek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman L.J. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S. Gross S.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 34799-34805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to cysteine 331, cysteine 326 of nNOS is also phylogenetically conserved (Fig. 1). Recently, we have obtained x-ray crystallographic data showing the presence of a tetrahedral tetrathiolate zinc (ZnS4) center in the trypsin-cleaved heme domain of eNOS (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and also nNOS, 2C. S. Raman, H. Li, T. L. Poulos, P. Martásek, and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observations. which is formed by the CXXXXC motifs from two NOS subunits. Because full enzymatic activity of the C331A mutant can be achieved by prolonged incubation with l-arginine (16Martásek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman L.J. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S.

Chem. 1998; 272: 34799-34805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we were interested in what role zinc plays in NOS structure/function. Therefore, considering that mutations within the CXXXXC motif should disrupt the ZnS4center, we have determined the amount of zinc bound to wild-type forms of nNOS and eNOS, as well as to various constructs of each and the C331A-mutated nNOS. Furthermore, we have investigated the time course required for l-arginine activation of the C331A-mutated nNOS. 4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol disodium salt (PAR), Trizma Base, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), EDTA, l-arginine, and 2-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Sigma. BH4 was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). Sodium chloride and glycerol were purchased from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Chelex® 100 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Yeast extract and tryptone were from Difco Labs (Detroit, MI). Zinc chloride was from Aldrich. Guanidine HCl was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). nNOS and the C331A-mutated nNOS were prepared as described by Roman et al. (18Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S.

Wild-type eNOS was prepared as described by Martásek et al.(19Martásek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Enzymes and constructs were purified by FPLC in Chelex® 100-treated buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mml-arginine, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.8. All labware used for handling samples for metal determination was soaked overnight in 4 m nitric acid and rinsed with Chelex®-treated water before use. Enzymes were purified by FPLC in EDTA-free Chelex®-treated buffer, concentrated, and subsequently passed over a 10-cm column of Chelex®-100 and reconcentrated. ETV-ICP-MS analysis was performed by Delony Langer and Dr. James Holcombe (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Austin). Standard deviations were calculated from the uncertainties in the slopes of the calibration curves. All results were derived from three replicates, plotted, and analyzed using a least squares fit. Metal concentrations were corrected for the metal contribution of the buffer, which, as a percentage of signal, was 29% for zinc and 18% for copper. Zinc content of the constitutive NOS isoforms and constructs was also measured by the PAR assay essentially as described by Crow et al. (20Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) with modifications. PAR has a low absorbance at 500 nm in the absence of Zn2+ (Fig. 2). However, in the presence of Zn2+, the absorbance at 500 nm increases dramatically as the PAR2Zn2+ complex is formed. Enzyme (1 nmol in a volume of 20 μl) was added to a rapidly stirred 3-ml cuvette containing 100 μm PAR in Chelex® 100-treated 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and, for some experiments, including Chelex® 100-treated 7 m guanidine HCl. In some assays, oxidants were added to facilitate Zn2+release. Assays were run at 23 °C in rapidly stirred cuvettes, and the total assay volume was 1.5 ml. Near the end of the assay, 1 mm NTA was added. Under these assay conditions, NTA selectively chelates Zn2+ from the PAR2Zn2+ complex and causes a decrease in absorbance at 500 nm, which is used to quantitate the amount of zinc that has been released from the protein. Following the NTA addition, 1 mm EDTA was added to confirm that no other metal was being chelated in addition to zinc. The extinction coefficient for PAR2Zn2+ was calculated, using a standard solution of ZnCl2, to be 87.7 mm−1cm−1 at pH 7.8. The results reported in Table I represent the means ± S.D. of three or four determinations except for those obtained with nNOS heme domain (nNOSwt-HD with BH4).Table IZinc release by constitutive NOS isoforms and constructs in response to denaturant and H2O2Zinc released%nNOS-wt holo (BH4+)90 ± 5nNOS-wt holo (BH4−)66 ± 9nNOS-wt HD (BH4+)89–92nNOS C331A Holo (BH4+)19 ± 1nNOS C331A Holo (BH4−)5 ± 2eNOS-wt Holo (BH4+)94 ± 7eNOS-wt Holo (BH4−)76 ± 1Assays were conducted in the presence of 7 m guanidine HCl.

NOS activity was measured using the hemoglobin capture assay in 50 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, pH 7.8. The rate of methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin was measured as the difference in absorbance change between 401 and 411 nm/min as described by Sheta et al. (6Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that an extinction coefficient of 60 mm−1 was used. All spectrophotometric assays were conducted on a Shimadzu 2101-PC dual-beam spectrophotometer. The protein concentration for the enzymes and constructs was determined on the basis of heme content by reduced CO difference spectra using an extinction coefficient of 100 mm−1 cm−1 for a Δε of 444–475 (21Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This method of protein determination probably underestimates the actual protein concentration because apoprotein (minus heme) exists in all preparations to some extent. However, the average heme content of the NOS preparations used in this laboratory is ∼80%. 3A.-L. Tsai, P. Martásek, L. J. Roman, and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observations. With nNOS-wt holoenzyme, 90% of the zinc (based on 1 zinc atom/2 hemes) was released in the presence of 7 m guanidine HCl and 1 mm H2O2 (TableI). Results of the chelation assay were corroborated by ETV-ICP-MS analysis (TableII) and confirmed that zinc and not copper was bound to nNOS. Likewise, the trypsin-cleaved, dimeric heme domain of nNOS-wt contained a similar zinc content (89–92%). The zinc content (89–92%) of the trypsin-cleaved heme domain of nNOS, derived from the full-length nNOS holoenzyme, contrasts sharply to the zinc content of the heme domain construct (residues 1–714) of nNOS (≈ 20%, data not shown) expressed in Escherichia coli. These observations are consistent with the results of Crane et al. (22Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), who crystallized the E. coli-expressed heme domain of iNOS (residues 66–498) and did not observe enzyme-bound zinc but rather identified a disulfide bond located in the analogous position where Raman et al. (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) found the ZnS4 center in the eNOS heme domain. When the zinc content of the BH4-free nNOS-wt holoenzyme was examined, a zinc content of only 66% was observed, suggesting that in the absence of bound BH4, disruption or destabilization of the ZnS4 center occurs. In contrast to the zinc contents observed with nNOS-wt holoenzyme and the trypsin-cleaved nNOS-wt heme domain, only 5 and 19% of the theoretical zinc content was obtained with the C331A nNOS holoenzyme mutant preincubated with l-arginine or preincubated withl-arginine and BH4, respectively. These data strongly suggest that mutation of cysteine 331 of nNOS results in disruption of the ZnS4 center and prevents stoichiometric zinc binding. However, because prolonged incubation of the nNOS C331A mutant as isolated with high concentrations of l-arginine is sufficient to restore enzymatic activity (16Martásek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman L.J. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S. Gross S.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 34799-34805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar), these findings strongly implicate zinc in a structural rather than a catalytic role. eNOS-wt holoenzyme behaved in a similar manner to nNOS with respect to zinc content. In the BH4-repleted state, eNOS was 94% replete with zinc versus only 76% repletion in the absence of bound BH4. Again, data from the ETV-ICP-MS analysis of eNOS-wt holoenzyme were used to confirm that zinc and not copper was present in eNOS (Table II). Additionally, x-ray crystallographic data of both the BH4-free and BH4-bound eNOS heme domain show the presence of zinc (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L.

The nNOS C331A mutant is inactive as isolated, but activity can be restored by prolonged incubation with l-arginine. Fig. 3 shows the time course for activation of the nNOS C331A mutant upon exposure to 10 mml-arginine. The mutant enzyme progressively became more active with time. However, maximal activity (255 nmol/min/mg) was not reached for 6–8 h following exposure to l-arginine. In contrast to the recent findings of Perry and Marletta (23Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which showed that copper is bound to E. coli-expressed nNOS-wt holoenzyme as isolated, we found no significant amount of copper in our preparations (copper to heme ratios: nNOS 0.01 and eNOS 0.03; Table II) and feel that zinc is the naturally occurring metal in the E. coli-expressed constitutive isoforms of NOS. This finding was confirmed by both the chelation assay performed in this laboratory, by x-ray crystallographic structure data (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar),2 and by ETV-ICP-MS analysis performed by an independent laboratory. Perry and Marletta (23Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) concluded that copper and zinc are the relevant metals in nNOS and iNOS, respectively. Our crystallographic work on eNOS (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and nNOS2 unambiguously establishes that a ZnS4center is present at the bottom of the dimer interface in both proteins. It has also been shown that zinc can be successfully incorporated into human iNOS. 4H. Li, manuscript submitted. Our biochemical characterization lends support to the x-ray crystallographic evidence for a structural zinc in all NOS isoforms. Our earlier work (24Persechini A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) has already provided evidence for a zinc-mediated inhibition of nNOS (K i = 30 μm). It is conceivable that a metal binding site in intact NOS, rather than the ZnS4site, may be responsible for this effect. The high affinity of zinc for the tetrathiolate ligands (K d = nanomolar range) further supports a view that the zinc-mediated inhibition previously observed (24Persechini A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) arose from a site different from that of the ZnS4 center. It is conceivable that the work by Perry and Marletta (23Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has also implicated a metal site different from the zinc site (ZnS4) discussed in the present study. Culture conditions are important and can play a critical role in which metal is incorporated into the protein. However, the quantity of copper present in the culture medium is not germane to this issue because copper cannot substitute for zinc and utilize a tetrathiolate liganding geometry. A survey of all the mononuclear copper sites in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank reveals that the preferred geometry for copper sites in proteins is tetragonal or trigonal (25Olsson M.H.M. Ryde U. Roos B.O. Pierloot K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 109-115Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Tetrahedral geometry at the copper site is very rare, and there is no report in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, involving CuS4, either in model compounds or in proteins. It should be noted that the only other metal that can substitute for zinc in the metal tetrathiolate is iron. Both physiological relevance and coordination geometry criteria would be satisfied if iron were to substitute for zinc. Having narrowed the number of metals to two, the issue of culture conditions that would favor one metal over the other can now be addressed. There are numerous examples in the literature addressing the problem of metal homeostasis and heterologous expression in E. coli. There are three examples worth noting. First is rubredoxin, containing a FeS4 center, which when expressed in E. coli leads to a mixture of 70% ZnS4 and 30% FeS4 containing protein (26Eidness M.K. O'Dell S.E. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Robson R.L. Scott R.A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). No zinc-containing rubredoxin is isolated from the original host, Clostridium pasteurianum. Crystal structures of both the natural FeS4 rubredoxin and the ZnS4 rubredoxin show the ability of the thiolates to coordinate either metal with similar geometry (27Blake P.R. Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Joshua-Tor L. Park J.B. Hare D.R. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1522-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second, expression of azurin, a copper protein inE. coli, leads to a mixture of copper-azurin and zinc-azurin (28Nar H. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Filippou A.C. Barth M. Jaquinod M. van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this protein, however, the native copper is coordinatedvia two histidines and a methionine. Zinc is able to substitute for copper in a trigonal geometry. Once again, crystal structures of both copper- and zinc-azurin reveal the possible need for a copper chaperone in vivo for maintaining metal homeostasis. Third, ribonucleotide reductase R2 subunit, when expressed in E. coli, is produced as an apoprotein and exogenous Fe2+ needs to be added to obtain a catalytically active protein (29Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that NOS, when expressed inE. coli, incorporates zinc, whereas the endogenous source may contain iron. We can, however, narrow down the possibility to two metals, zinc or iron (see above). Also, as has been established for metallothionein, there remains the possibility that the ZnS4 site in NOS may be thermodynamically stable but kinetically labile, thus facilitating exchange with iron. However, in our crystallographic experiments, we did not find any evidence for the ability of iron to displace zinc (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not feel that iron is the endogenous metal in E. coli-expressed NOS. We are currently investigating the identity of the metal bound to NOS expressed in mammalian cells. The C331A-mutated nNOS is inactive (as isolated), and its lack of activity is reflected in its inability to bind cofactors efficiently and stabilize an active conformation. l-Arginine activation of C331A nNOS is an interesting observation, but it is just that.

Therefore, it is clear that zinc-mediated stabilization of the bottom of the dimer interface is key for catalytic activity, albeit an indirect effect. The comparison of other ZnS4 proteins with the NOS isoforms suggests that the ZnS4 center facilitates protein-protein interaction(s). In NOS, the ZnS4 center stabilizes the dimer interface and/or the flavoprotein-heme domain interface (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Zinc is not needed for folding because l-arginine is sufficient to restore enzymatically active protein. If zinc were only essential for folding, then the enzyme should function perfectly in its absence. Without preincubation in the presence of high concentrations ofl-arginine, this is definitely not the case. Preincubation with l-arginine must stabilize an active conformation. However, it does not restore zinc binding. Therefore, zinc facilitates but is not absolutely required for activity. The present study substantiates that zinc content is influenced profoundly by pterin and confirms a structural, rather than catalytic, role for zinc in maintaining enzymatically active constitutive nitric-oxide synthases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the one zinc/two heme stoichiometry in the dimers of the constitutive NOS isoforms isolated from E. coli expression systems. In support of our finding of zinc in theE. coli-expressed nitric-oxide synthases, Fischmann and colleagues (30Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J.

The interaction of Tvl-1 with Raf-1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with Tvl-1 and Raf-1 expression constructs as well as by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins from CV-1 and NB2 cells. Tvl-1 interacts with Raf-1 via its carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat domain. The same domain also mediates Tvl-1 homodimerization. Tvl-1 was detected by immunofluorescence in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus suggesting that in addition to Raf-1 it may also interact with nuclear proteins. Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates Tvl-1 both in vitro andin vivo. In baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, Tvl-1 potentiates the activation of Raf-1 by Src and Ras while in COS-1 cells it potentiates the activation of Raf-1 by EGF. These data suggest that Tvl-1 is both a target as well as a regulator of Raf-1. The human homologue of Tvl-1 maps to chromosome 19p12, upstream ofMEF2B with the two genes in a head to head arrangement.

The human homologue of Tvl-1 maps to chromosome 19p12, upstream ofMEF2B with the two genes in a head to head arrangement. Following stimulation of membrane receptors, the Raf-1 kinase is activated and transduces signals to several signaling pathways (1Rapp U.R.

Trends Biochem. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of Raf-1 activation is not well understood but appears to be under the control of a host of Raf-1-interacting macromolecules including both proteins and phospholipids (2Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which interacting macromolecules regulate the activity of Raf-1 is phosphorylation. Mitogenic stimulation leads to an increase in Raf-1 phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and in some cases, tyrosine residues (5Kyriakis J.M. Force T.L. Rapp U.R. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using overexpression systems have demonstrated that Raf-1 can be activated both by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by members of the Src kinase family (7Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K.

Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In contrast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (10Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and an unidentified G-protein-coupled tyrosine phosphatase down-regulate the activity of Raf-1 (11Dent P. Reardon D.B. Wood S.L.

The significance of these kinases/phosphatases in regulating Raf-1 activation under physiological conditions is still inconclusive. However, it was recently shown that the Raf-1 activating phosphorylation at Tyr340, which is mediated by members of the Src kinase family, is triggered by CD4 cross-linking in T cells (12Popik W. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by FcγRI cross-linking in myeloid cells (13Park R.K. Liu Y. Durden D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13342-13348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may be the final outcome of the interaction of Raf-1 with other macromolecules. However, the range of the effects of these interactions is quite diverse. Thus, it has been suggested that the interaction of Raf-1 with 14-3-3 (14Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F.

Moreover, the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras may be responsible for the translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (24Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 25Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) while the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras or 14-3-3 may promote its oligomerization (26Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Farrar M.A. Alberol I. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these interacting macromolecules regulate the activation of Raf-1 are overlapping and interdependent, as exemplified by the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras. The GTP-charged form of Ras binds directly to the amino-terminal conserved region 1 which includes the Ras-binding domain and the cysteine-rich domain of Raf-1 (28Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L.

This interaction causes translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where Raf-1 activation takes place (24Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 25Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The nature of the membrane events and the macromolecules involved in Raf-1 activation have not been well defined to date. One such mechanism, however, may involve binding of Raf-1 to the oligomer forming adaptor protein 14-3-3 (32Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Binding to this protein may induce oligomerization and activation of Raf-1 via auto- or trans-phosphorylation. To study the role of Raf-1 in the transduction of downstream signals we need not only to understand its regulation but also to know its targets. Despite intensive efforts, the only known physiological substrate of Raf-1 to date is MEK (33Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 34Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that Raf-1 also phosphorylates the phosphatase Cdc25A, a cell cycle regulator, and that phosphorylation enhances the Cdc25A phosphatase activity in vitro (36Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, Raf-1 was found to phosphorylate Bad, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and may inhibit Bad-induced apoptosis (37Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, whether Cdc25A and Bad can function as physiological downstream effectors of Raf-1 remains to be determined. The purpose of the work presented here was to identify novel Raf-1 interacting proteins and to determine their role in Raf-1 regulation and signaling. Screening a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from mouse thymus RNA, for such proteins led to the isolation of a novel ankyrin repeat protein, Tvl-1 (from the Greek word touvlo which means brick). Tvl-1 interacts with Raf-1 through its carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat domain. Similar to 14-3-3, Tvl-1 also forms oligomers. However, in contrast to 14-3-3, Tvl-1 is phosphorylated by Raf-1. Co-expression of Raf-1, Src, and Ras with Tvl-1 in Sf9 cells reproducibly enhanced Raf-1 activity by 3–4-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of Tvl-1 in COS-1 cells enhanced the EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.-induced Raf-1 activation. These findings suggest that Tvl-1 may contribute to the regulation of Raf-1 activation as well as to the transduction of Raf-1 signals. The open reading frame of humanRaf-1 (from D. Morrison) was inserted into the pNLex vector so as to be expressed as a fusion with the DNA-binding domain of LexA, a bacterial transcriptional repressor (38Brent R. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A murine CD4+ T cell cDNA library (from Stratagene) was subcloned into the expression vector pJG4-5, which utilizes the galactose-inducibleGAL-1 promoter to express library clones as fusions to a nuclear localization sequence, a portable transcriptional activation domain (the “acid blob”, B42), and a hemagglutinin epitope tag (39Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Bait and library plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48/pSH18-34, in which the upstream regulatory elements of the chromosomal LEU2 gene have been replaced by three copies of the LexA operator and which carries the reporter plasmid SH18-34 containing the LacZ gene also under the control ofLexA operators. Library clones encoding proteins interacting with Raf-1 were identified based on their ability to activate the LEU2 and LacZ reporters, thus enabling yeast cells to grow and form blue colonies in leucine-free, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside containing medium. To determine the specificity of the interaction between Tvl-1 and Raf-1, we carried out yeast interaction mating assays as described (40Golemis E.A. Khazak V. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar,41Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, EGY48 (MAT α) haploid cells harboring the plasmid expressing the acid blob-Tvl-1 chimera were mated with a panel of haploid RFY206 (MAT a) cells harboring constructs encoding LexA fusion proteins. Besides LexA-Raf-1, the LexA fusions included the constitutively active Raf-1 mutant, Raf-1 Y340D, the amino-terminal 330 amino acids of Raf-1, and 27 other proteins that function in pathways regulating cell proliferation. As in the original screen, the interaction of Tvl-1 with these proteins was determined on the activation of the LEU2 and LacZ reporter genes. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the method of Chomczynski and Sacci (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62889) Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized with the partial Tvl-1 cDNA probe cloned from the interaction trap library. The same probe was used to screen a murine CD4+ T cell cDNA library (Stratagene, CA) and a cDNA library constructed by us from rat spleen mRNA. The rat spleen cDNA library was constructed using the Stratagene cDNA cloning kit according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. COS-1 and CV1 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) (PSK). NIH 3T3 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and PSK. NB2, a prolactin-dependent rat T cell lymphoma line was provided by P. Gout (University of British Columbia). NB2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and PSK. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (43Patriotis C. Makris A. Chernoff J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9755-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A Tvl-1 expression construct was generated by subcloning the full-length Tvl-1 cDNA insert into the pCMV5 expression vector (44Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged Tvl-1 (FLAG-Tvl-1) and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Tvl-1 (HA-Tvl-1) constructs were generated by inserting the Tvl-1 coding sequence in-frame with the FLAG or the HA epitope tag into the pCMV-5 expression vector. A series of truncated Tvl-1 expression constructs were generated by cloning cDNA fragments of truncated Tvl-1, epitope tagged at their amino terminus with FLAG, into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). CMV-Raf-1 expression constructs were generated by inserting the wild type or constitutively active Raf-1(Y340D) mutant cDNA (7Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) into the pCMV5 vector. To generate plasmids expressing GST fusion proteins of Raf-1 and its truncated mutants, the cDNA inserts of the full-length Raf-1, its NH2-terminal domain (1–323 amino acids) and its COOH-terminal catalytic domain (305–648 amino acids) were, respectively, subcloned into the pEBG expression vector which encodes glutathione S-tranaferase driven by EF1α promoter (20Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,32Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses expressing Tvl-1, the constitutively active Raf-1 mutant Y340D, and the kinase-negative Raf-1 mutant K375M were generated by ligating the appropriate inserts into the transfer vector pVL1393 (PharMingen). The resulting constructs were transfected into Sf9 cells using the Baculogold Transfection Kit (PharMingen). Baculoviruses expressing Raf-1, v-Src, and v-Ha-Ras were provided by Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Rabbits were inoculated with (His)6-tagged Tvl-1 protein purified from Escherichia coli strain M15 (Qiagen) transformed with the construct pQE30-Tvl-1. pQE30-Tvl-1 was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of the full-length Tvl-1 cDNA into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). E. coli transformed with this construct were grown at 37 °C in the presence of ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) to OD600 = 0.7. Protein expression was induced by growing cells in 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 5 h. Bacteria were collected, resuspended in 10 mmTris (pH 7.6), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonication on ice. His-tagged Tvl-1 was collected by incubating the clarified lysate with Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen). The resin beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted from the resin by incubation with 100 mm imidazole. His-tagged Tvl-1 isolated by this procedure was shown to be at least 85% pure as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the eluted proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Tvl-1 protein was excised from the gel and inoculated into rabbits. A second rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a Tvl-1-derived multiple antigen peptide (amino acids 100–113) (synthesized by Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL) according to standard protocols. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of Raf-1 (C12) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. An anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody (R19120) was purchased from Transduction Labs. The M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Kodak IBI. Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was purchased from Babco. Cultured cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupetin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 ×g and were precleared by a 30-min incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating these lysates with the appropriate antibodies for 3 h. The resulting antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three to four times with cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer prior to their analysis by SDS-PAGE. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates or of total cell lysates were carried out using Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). NIH 3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG-Tvl-1 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. To block nonspecific antibody binding, the cells were incubated in 10% goat serum in PBS for 60 min at room temperature, prior to being incubated for 60 min with the M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody or the rabbit anti-Tvl-1 antiserum (1:400 dilution in 5% goat serum). Following washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma, dilution at 1:400) plus 1 μg/ml bisbenzimid (Hoechst 33258, Sigma). At the end, the coverslips were washed twice in PBS and mounted on glass slides with anti-fade medium (90% glycerol with 1 mg/ml paraphenylene diamine). Fluorescence was recorded by confocal microscopy. Raf-1 kinase assays were performed using standard procedures (45Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 Sf9 cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were infected with the desired combination of baculoviruses. After 48 h, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for Raf/Tvl-1 co-immunoprecipitation or in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotin/leupeptin, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium vanadate). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-Raf-1 antibody (C12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to collect the antigen-antibody complexes. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffers and twice with kinase buffer containing 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Kinase reactions were carried out by incubating the immune complexes for 20 min at 25 °C in 40 μl of Raf-1 kinase buffer containing 10 μm unlabeled ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), and 0.2 μg of purified recombinant His-tagged Tvl-1 (His-Tvl-1) or His-tagged kinase inactive MEK (His-MEK (K−)). His-MEK (K−) was induced and purified as described by Gardner et al. (46Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17896-17901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays using Raf-1 and co-immunoprecipitated Tvl-1 were carried out without added exogenous Tvl-1. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding 3× SDS sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). The products of the kinase reactions were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and visualized by autoradiography. Raf-1 kinase assays in COS-1 cells were performed as described previously (20Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with a pEBG-Raf-1 expression construct (20Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A.

Twenty-four hours later, cells were serum-starved for 20 h, and then treated with EGF (50 ng/ml, R & D) for 20 min. Cells were lysed using the Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors). GST-Raf was pulled down by incubating the lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl, and twice with kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The Raf kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the pulled down Raf-1 in 60 μl of the kinase reaction buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 ng of recombinant kinase-dead His-MEK1. Incubations were carried out at 25 °C for 30 min. The products of the kinase reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis was carried out as described by Boyle et al. (47Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with the CMV-Tvl-1 expression construct alone or in combination with the CMV-Raf-1 (Y340D) expression construct. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium. Sixteen hours later, cells were cultured for 4 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mCi/ml ortho[32P]phosphate (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Thirty minutes prior to lysis, half of the cells transfected only with the Tvl-1 expression construct were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. 32P-Tvl-1 was immunoprecipitated from the metabolically labeled cells using rabbit anti-Tvl-1 antiserum and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The Tvl-1 protein band excised from the membrane was digested with trypsin. The resulting phosphopeptides were separated using a Hunter thin layer peptide mapping electrophoresis apparatus (CBS Scientific Company, Inc., Del Mar, CA) and visualized by autoradiography. To identify novel proteins that interact with Raf-1 we screened a CD4+ murine T cell cDNA library using the interaction trap two-hybrid system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as described by Gyuris et al. (39Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Out of 50 isolated clones, 15 were sequenced and found to be derived from a single gene, Tvl-1 (data not shown). The specificity of interaction of the B42-Tvl-1 fusion with Raf-1 was confirmed by the experiment in Fig. 1 which shows that growth is galactose and therefore B42-Tvl-1-dependent and that a full-length Raf-1 interacts with B42-Tvl-1 but not with the B42 domain alone. The same figure shows that Tvl-1 also interacts with the amino-terminal domain of Raf-1 (amino acids 1–330) although with lower efficiency. To determine whether Tvl-1 interacts with other signaling proteins we carried out interaction mating experiments (40Golemis E.A. Khazak V. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar, 41Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) between EGY48 MAT α haploid cells harboring the construct encoding the fusion protein B42·Tvl-1 and a panel of 26 RFY206 MAT α haploid cells harboring constructs encoding LexA fusion proteins. The results showed that Tvl-1 does not interact with cdc2 (cdk1), cdk2, c-Ha-Ras, c-Ha-Ras/C186A, Rb, ftz, SSN6, CDI1, daughterless, goosecoid, CDK3, CDI7, CDI11, DMcdc2, LAR, cyclin C, cyclin E, CLN3, hairy, MYC, MAX, Mxi-1, p53, thyroid hormone receptor, bicoid, and a synthetic polyglutamine peptide (data not shown). These results indicated that the interaction of Tvl-1 with Raf-1 is specific. Hybridization of a Tvl-1-specific cDNA probe to a Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA from normal adult mouse tissues revealed that Tvl-1 mRNA is widely expressed (Fig. 2A). Western blots of lysates from normal adult mouse tissues probed with a Tvl-1-specific antibody raised against bacterially expressed Tvl-1 protein (Fig. 2B, “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that Tvl-1 is expressed primarily in thymus, lung, and testes. The levels ofTvl-1 mRNA and protein in different tissues correlate only partially, suggesting that protein expression of Tvl-1 may be regulated in part at the post-transcriptional level. Sequencing of full-length cDNA clones obtained by screening a murine CD4+ T cell cDNA library revealed thatTvl-1 encodes a novel 269-amino acid protein containing four ankyrin repeats (48Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 49Chan W. Kordeli E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 123: 1463-1473Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) at its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2, Cand D). Some of the cDNA clones contain a small internal deletion. These clones represent a differentially spliced mRNA species tha"

Studies of these proteins have been complicated by their size and by their ability to bind human plasma proteins other than IgA. Here, we describe a synthetic 50-residue peptide, derived from streptococcal protein Sir22, that binds human IgA but not any of the other plasma proteins known to bind to Sir22. The peptide binds serum IgA and secretory IgA and binds IgA of both subclasses. Evidence is presented that the peptide folds correctly both in solution and when it is immobilized and that it readily renatures after denaturation. Together, these data indicate that the peptide corresponds to a protein domain that binds IgA with high specificity. This is the first report of an IgA-binding domain that retains its properties in isolated form.

Together, these data indicate that the peptide corresponds to a protein domain that binds IgA with high specificity. This is the first report of an IgA-binding domain that retains its properties in isolated form. An important property of human IgA is the ability of the Fc part to interact with different receptors. Binding to one of these receptors, CD89, is believed to be essential for the effector functions of serum IgA (1Morton H.C. van Egmond M. van de Winkel J.G. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 423-440PubMed Google Scholar, 2Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas binding to the poly-Ig receptor on mucosal epithelial cells is required for secretion of dimeric IgA (3Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 181-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The Fc part of human IgA also binds to surface proteins expressed by some pathogenic streptococci (4Schalén C. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. C. 1980; 88: 271-274PubMed Google Scholar, 5Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These proteins are of interest for analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms in bacterial infections and are also of potential value as model systems and analytical tools for studies of IgA. The most extensively studied of these bacterial IgA-binding proteins are those expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), a major human pathogen. IgA-binding proteins expressed by this bacterium are members of the M protein family (6Frithz E. Hedén L.-O. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Bessen D.E. Fischetti V.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 124-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Johnsson E. Andersson G. Lindahl G. Hedén L.-O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3557-3564PubMed Google Scholar), a family of coiled-coil proteins that are important for virulence. However, characterization of several of the IgA-binding proteins of S. pyogenes has shown that they not only bind IgA but also bind other human plasma proteins (9Lindahl G. Åkerström B. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol.

This property is of interest with regard to pathogenetic mechanisms but has complicated studies of the IgA binding property of the proteins. For structural analysis, it would also be desirable to have access to an IgA-binding molecule of smaller size. In this study, we explored the possibility of studying the IgA-binding region of an S. pyogenes protein in isolated form. We show that a 50-residue synthetic peptide, derived from streptococcal protein Sir22, 1In an alternative nomenclature (14Thern A. Wästfelt M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar), Sir22 is designated Emm22. 1In an alternative nomenclature (14Thern A. Wästfelt M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar), Sir22 is designated Emm22. binds IgA but not any of the other plasma proteins that bind to Sir22. The properties of this peptide indicate that it corresponds to a protein domain that binds IgA with high specificity. The 50-residue synthetic peptide (see Fig. 1A) was purchased from the Department of Clinical Chemistry (Malmö General Hospital, Sweden). It corresponds to amino acid residues 35–83 of protein Sir22 (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and includes a C-terminal cysteine residue not present in Sir22. The peptide was ≥95% pure. Recombinant Sir22 was purified as described (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified human C4BP 2The abbreviations used are: C4BP, C4b-binding protein; S-IgA, secretory IgA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. was the kind gift of Dr. B. Dahlbäck (Malmö General Hospital). All immunoglobulins were of human origin. Polyclonal serum IgA was from Cappel-Organon Teknika (Turnhout, Belgium). S-IgA was purified from colostrum (12Mestecky J. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Monoclonal IgA proteins were isolated from serum of patients with IgA multiple myeloma (12Mestecky J. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Three of the monoclonal IgA proteins and all monoclonal IgG proteins were kindly provided by Dr. F. Skvaril (Bern, Switzerland). Monoclonal IgM and IgD were from The Binding Site (Birmingham, United Kingdom), and IgE was the gift of Dr. I. Olsson (Lund University). Polyclonal IgG was from Kabi (Stockholm, Sweden). Fab and Fc fragments of an IgA1 protein were purified after cleavage with IgA protease from Haemophilus influenzae (12Mestecky J. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Serum from an IgA-deficient individual was kindly provided by Dr. A. Sjöholm (Lund University). Binding of radiolabeled human proteins was analyzed after immobilization of peptide or Sir22 in microtiter wells. The wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of a solution of peptide or Sir22 (100 μg/ml in PBS). After washing and blocking with PBSAT (PBS with 0.02% sodium azide and 0.05% Tween 20), radiolabeled ligand (∼25,000 cpm) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBSAT, the radioactivity associated with each well was determined. Nonspecific binding (<0.7%) was determined for wells coated only with PBSAT. The Igs used were polyclonal. For inhibition tests, wells of microtiter plates were coated with the peptide (5 μg/ml for tests with serum IgA and 50 μg/ml for tests with S-IgA). After blocking, radiolabeled serum IgA or S-IgA (∼25,000 cpm) was added together with inhibitor as indicated. The final concentration of radiolabeled IgA was ∼0.3 nm. Binding was analyzed as described above. Nonspecific binding was <0.25%. Western blot and dot-blot analysis on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were performed as described (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the MicroBCA kit from Pierce using BSA as a reference. Radiolabeling of peptides and proteins with 125I was performed with the chloramine-T method. Previous studies of the S. pyogenesprotein Arp4 demonstrated that the IgA-binding region of this protein is localized in a 29-residue region in the N-terminal part of the molecule (8Johnsson E. Andersson G. Lindahl G. Hedén L.-O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3557-3564PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bessen D.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An attempt was made to demonstrate IgA binding for a 33-residue synthetic peptide including this region from Arp4, but no binding was observed (data not shown). A longer peptide was therefore tested as described below. This new peptide was derived from the Sir22 protein, which is closely related to Arp4 (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed by a bacterial strain that is suitable for analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms (14Thern A. Wästfelt M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Sir22 is a dimeric coiled-coil molecule that binds at least three different human plasma proteins, IgA, IgG, and C4BP (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cedervall T. Åkesson P. Stenberg L. Herrmann A. Åkerström B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The regions in Sir22 that bind these ligands have been partly identified. The 29-residue IgA-binding region (defined by homology with Arp4) overlaps with an upstream region that includes a C4BP-binding site (16Johnsson E. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. Hedén L.-O. Wikström M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3021-3029PubMed Google Scholar). Because IgA and C4BP do not compete for binding to Sir22 (11Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar), these ligands may bind to separate domains. The IgA-binding region also overlaps with a downstream region including an IgG-binding site (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnsson E. Berggård K. Kotarsky H. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Sjöbring U. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4894-4901PubMed Google Scholar). The bindings of IgA and IgG to Sir22 are mutually exclusive, indicating shared or contiguous binding sites (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these ligands, serum albumin may bind to the central C repeat region of Sir22 (18Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Cooney J. Sjöbring U. Schmidt K.H. Gomi H. Hattori S. Tagawa C. Kishimoto F. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The design of an IgA-binding peptide was based on the hypothesis that C4BP, IgA, and IgG bind to separate domains in Sir22 and that the inhibition of IgA binding by IgG (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was due to steric hindrance not shared binding sites. The synthetic 50-residue peptide covers the predicted IgA-binding region of Sir22 and also includes 10 residues on either side, added to enhance the probability for correct folding. Because the Sir22 protein must form a coiled-coil dimer to bind IgA (15Cedervall T. Åkesson P. Stenberg L. Herrmann A. Åkerström B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Åkerström B. Lindahl G. Björck L. Lindqvist A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3238-3243PubMed Google Scholar), a C-terminal cysteine residue was included to ensure that dimerization could occur. However, it also seemed possible that the peptide would be able to form a coiled-coil by itself (20Su J.Y. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15501-15510Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Wells of microtiter plates were coated with the peptide or with Sir22 and analyzed for the ability to bind radiolabeled ligands (Fig. 1B). As expected, immobilized Sir22 bound all four ligands. For unknown reasons, the binding of IgG was lower than for serum IgA in this test, although Sir22 has similar affinity for these two ligands (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immobilized peptide bound serum IgA and S-IgA, but not C4BP or IgG, indicating that it specifically binds IgA. The binding of serum IgA and S-IgA to the immobilized peptide could be completely inhibited by unlabeled IgA but not by BSA, confirming that the binding of IgA was specific and showing that the binding was not due to the radiolabeling (Fig. 1C). Moreover, binding of serum IgA or S-IgA to immobilized peptide could be inhibited by free peptide, indicating that the ability to bind IgA was not due to a conformational change in the peptide upon immobilization (Fig. 1C). Finally, the binding of serum IgA and S-IgA to immobilized peptide could be inhibited by a purified monoclonal IgA1 protein, showing that the binding of IgA was independent of the antigen-binding site (data not shown). The binding properties of the peptide were further studied by Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A). Radiolabeled peptide, used as the probe, bound to serum IgA but not to IgG. Thus, the peptide in solution retains its binding ability after radiolabeling. Striking evidence for the specificity of the peptide came from analysis of whole normal serum and serum from an IgA-deficient individual. The peptide lacked reactivity with any of the many proteins present in IgA-deficient serum, but bound to IgA present in normal serum. Similar results were obtained in a dot-blot analysis (Fig. 2B). In saliva, the peptide recognized a high molecular weight protein with the mobility of S-IgA and also detected some monomeric IgA (Fig. 2A), giving further support for the specificity of the binding. The peptide even recognized separated α chains, as shown by Western blot analysis of IgA under reducing conditions (Fig. 2C). As expected, the peptide binds to the Fc part of IgA (Fig. 3A). To analyze whether the peptide binds IgA of both subclasses, a dot-blot analysis was performed with purified monoclonal proteins (Fig. 3B). The analysis also included analysis of monoclonal IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE proteins, and the binding properties of the peptide were compared with those of the parental Sir22 molecule. In agreement with previous results (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Sir22 was found to bind most of the IgA and IgG proteins. The peptide only bound IgA proteins, and binding was observed for 8 of 9 IgA1 proteins and for 10 of 11 IgA2 proteins. However, this semi-quantitative analysis indicated that the affinity varied considerably for different IgA proteins. Possible reasons for this variation are differences in glycosylation and loss of binding ability during purification of monoclonal proteins. The ability of the peptide to bind different IgA proteins was similar to that of protein Sir22, supporting the hypothesis that the peptide corresponds to an IgA-binding domain in Sir22. Western blot analysis of the peptide under nonreducing conditions showed that it bound radiolabeled IgA (Fig. 4A). This analysis included an initial step, in which the peptide was boiled in SDS-containing buffer, a step that most likely caused denaturation. Thus, these results suggest that at least some peptide molecules renatured during the analysis. The peptide, probably a dimer, moved more slowly than expected, a common property in streptococcal surface proteins (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, when the peptide migrated as a monomer, it also bound IgA after blotting. In this regard, the peptide behaved like protein Sir22, which also binds IgA in Western blot analysis, after having migrated as a monomer (10Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Sir22 must form a coiled-coil dimer to bind IgA (15Cedervall T. Åkesson P. Stenberg L. Herrmann A. Åkerström B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Åkerström B. Lindahl G. Björck L. Lindqvist A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3238-3243PubMed Google Scholar), it seems likely that dimerization of Sir22 can occur on the blotting membrane, allowing binding of IgA. Similarly, the ability of the peptide to bind IgA in Western blot analysis during reducing conditions might have been due to formation of coiled-coil dimers on the blotting membrane. Thus, the results of this analysis cannot be taken as evidence that a monomeric form of the peptide binds IgA. Structural analysis of the peptide will now be of considerable interest and will show whether it has a coiled-coil structure, as suggested by the available data (15Cedervall T. Åkesson P. Stenberg L. Herrmann A. Åkerström B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Johnsson E. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. Hedén L.-O. Wikström M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3021-3029PubMed Google Scholar, 19Åkerström B. Lindahl G. Björck L. Lindqvist A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3238-3243PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal part of the peptide includes a sequence (LEEKEKNLEKK) that is similar to a consensus “trigger” sequence implicated in the formation of coiled-coils (21Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ability of the peptide to bind IgA after heating was further analyzed in an inhibition test (Fig. 4B). In this test, the ability of radiolabeled IgA to bind to immobilized peptide was inhibited by free peptide. Boiling of the peptide for 5 min, which most likely caused denaturation, had no effect on the ability of the peptide to subsequently inhibit binding, implying that most peptide molecules refolded into the native form after denaturation. Taken together, the data in Fig. 4 indicate that the peptide is a very stable molecule. The radiolabeled form of the peptide was also stable, because it could be kept frozen for 4 months without loosing the ability to specifically bind IgA (data not shown). The properties of the peptide studied here indicate that it corresponds to an IgA-binding domain that binds human IgA-Fc with high specificity. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of an IgA-binding domain that retains its binding properties in isolated form. Importantly, the peptide binds human IgA of both subclasses and binds both serum IgA and S-IgA, suggesting that it may become a useful tool for studies of human IgA. With regard to applications, it is of interest that the peptide showed specificity for IgA both when it was immobilized and when it was present in soluble form. Previous studies of Sir22 and other IgA-binding streptococcal proteins suggest that the peptide may have lower affinity for S-IgA than for serum IgA, due to the presence of secretory component in S-IgA (10Stenberg L.

Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the peptide could readily detect S-IgA in Western blot analysis, implying that it may become valuable also for studies of this form of IgA. A bacterial IgA-Fc-binding protein unrelated to Sir22 has been described in group B streptococcus (5Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp.

Valentin Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2787-2793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct comparison of this 73-residue sequence with the peptide described here did not disclose any similarity. The group B streptococcus protein has little or no ability to bind S-IgA, which may limit its use as an immunological tool (26Lindahl G. Åkerström B. Vaerman J.P. Stenberg L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but structural comparisons of the different IgA-binding regions would be of interest. The size and stability of the peptide described here suggest that it may be amenable to structural analysis and could become a useful model for studies of human IgA receptors. An interesting parallel has already been identified, because human CD89 was found to bind to a site on IgA-Fc analogous to the site on IgG-Fc that is recognized by staphylococcal protein A (2Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), stressing the value of bacterial proteins as model systems. Further characterization of the peptide will also be of interest for analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms in S. pyogenes infections."

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Ins (1,4,5)P33-kinase occupies a crucial position in this signal transduction cascade, inasmuch as it catalyzes a rapid production ofd-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins (1,3,4,5)P4) and generates a metabolic pathway for many highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates.d-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate displays a second messenger function by selectively blocking epithelial Ca2+-activated chloride channels (2Vajanaphanich M.

The production of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 in response to receptor activation has been observed in various cell types, i.e. in rat brain cortical slices (5Batty I.R. Nahorski S.R. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Due in large part to the efforts of Irvine and colleagues, there is experimental evidence for a possible second messenger function of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis at least in certain cell types (9Changya L. Gallacher D.V. Irvine R.F. Potter B.V.L. Petersen O.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Irvine R.F. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, Ca2+-dependent K+ and Cl− channels have been shown to be activated by the non-metabolizabled-myo-inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate and Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 in primary cultures of mouse lacrimal acinar cells (11Smith P.M. Irvine R.F. J. Physiol. 1998; 509P: 145PGoogle Scholar). Its high affinity and high isomeric specificity of binding to a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (Ras-GAP1IP4BPisolated from pig platelets) have been reported (12Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). An increase ind-myo-inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in the presence of Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 has been reported in permeabilized L-1210 cells. This effect probably involves the participation of GAP1IP4BP acting together with an activated monomeric G-protein (13Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Walker C.D. Bottomley J.R. Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F.

Molecular heterogeneity has been demonstrated for Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase; cloning of cDNAs encoding rat and human Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A (14Choi K.Y. Kim H.K. Lee S.Y. Moon K.H. Sim S.S. Kim J.W.

J. 1995; 306: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has been reported. In brain, isoform A is highly expressed in neuronal cells of the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in both rat and human (20Mailleux P. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Vanderhaeghen J.-J. Brain Res. 1991; 539: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Mailleux P. Takazawa K. Albala N. Erneux C. Vanderhaeghen J.-J. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 137: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Isoform A is mainly expressed in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 cells, and several reports suggested a second messenger role for Ins (1,3,4,5)P4 in neuronal cells, e.g. Ins (1,3,4,5)P4-mediated Ca2+ entry in CA1 cells, with the suggestion it may contribute to ischemia-induced neuronal death (22Tsubokawa H. Oguro K. Robinson H.P.C. Masuzawa T. Kawai N. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The distribution of mRNA corresponding to rat Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase B has been shown to be more general as compared with isoform A (19Vanweyenberg V. Communi D. D'Santos C.S. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In human brain, in situhybridization data indicated that mRNA corresponding to isoenzyme B was mostly present in astrocytic cells, in contrast to the neuronal isoenzyme A (21Mailleux P. Takazawa K. Albala N. Erneux C. Vanderhaeghen J.-J. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 137: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, this last point has never been established at the protein level. Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase purified from a large number of cell types appeared to be sensitive to the Ca2+·CaM complex,i.e. 2-fold in rat and human brain (isoform A) (15Takazawa K. Vandekerckhove J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Takazawa K. Perret J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1994; 298: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primary structures of rat and human Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinases A and B reveal the presence of various potential phosphorylation sites based on consensus phosphorylation site sequences for Ca2+·CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), protein kinase C (PKC), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (15Takazawa K. Vandekerckhove J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Takazawa K. Perret J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinases A (25Sim S.S. Kim J.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10367-10372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and B (26Woodring P.J. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30447-30454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are substrates for PKC- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A is the target of a regulatory mechanism involving CaM kinase II-mediated phosphorylation bothin vitro and in intact cells (27Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat brain cortical slices with carbachol provoked an increase in the phosphorylation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A and a corresponding increase in enzymic activity (3–5-fold) and in CaM affinity (25-fold). An activation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase has also been observed in rat brainstem slices in response to serotonin through the CaM kinase II pathway. This effect was also sensitive to okadaic acid (28Collin T. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 254: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the existence of multiple isoforms of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase has not yet been pointed out experimentally in intact cells, especially concerning specific cellular and subcellular protein distributions and concerning distinct regulatory mechanisms with variable functional consequences. Data in the present report revealed for the first time at the protein level that the astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase corresponds to isoform B. We have shown that the activation mechanism of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A can be generalized to Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase B in astrocytes. It nevertheless involves other mediators with distinct functional consequences. Activation of this isoform was provoked by PKC and CaM kinase II-mediated phosphorylation in vitro and in intact cells. In this study, direct evidence is provided for a novel regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation by both PKC and CaM kinase II, activation and redistribution of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase B in intact astrocytes. An immune serum recognizing a 20-amino acid peptide (i.e.SGLNNLVDILTEMSQDAPLA) corresponding to the last 20 amino acids of human isoenzyme B has been generated. The peptide has been coupled to hemocyanin in the presence of glutaraldehyde and injected to rabbits. The antibodies (dilution 1:1000) immunodetected recombinant isoform B but not isoform A after Western blotting. 2V. Dewaste, unpublished data. Another antiserum (dilution 1:500) raised against a 15-amino acid peptide (i.e. CPPGDRVGVQPGNSR) in the N-terminal region of human isoform B has been described before (24Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For competition studies, 5 μg of the corresponding peptides were added for 1 h to the diluted serum before immunodetection. Primary cultures of rat cerebral cortex astrocytes were established using dissociated rat cerebral tissue at 2 or 3 days after birth, according to methods previously described (29McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected cortical tissue was washed and then dissociated by gentle repeated pipetting in modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% fungizone. Cells were decanted by gravity for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was dissociated again, and the supernatant was added to the first one. Cells were diluted in complemented cell medium and plated in 9-cm diameter or 24 × 24-cm2 dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO2. When astrocytes were adherent, dishes were vigorously agitated overnight and the medium was changed after two washes. Astrocytes reached confluence after 7 days in culture and could be trypsinized three to four times. Human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells were grown in the same complemented medium. Cell culture medium, dishes, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. When the astrocytic cells were ∼80% subconfluent (7–8 × 106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium), they were washed twice with 2 ml of prewarmed KRH medium (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.45 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4). A 2-ml aliquot of the same prewarmed medium containing the agent(s) was pipetted onto each culture dish. Cell incubations were terminated by aspirating the incubation medium prior to rinsing rapidly the cells twice with KRH medium. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, 5 μm leupeptin, and 15 μg/ml calpain inhibitors I and II). Final cell lysates were obtained by three successive cycles of freeze/thaw. Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity was measured at 5 μm Ins (1,4,5)P3 (30Takazawa K. Passareiro H. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).K m values for Ins (1,4,5)P3 were estimated by measuring initial velocities in the presence of 0–50 μm Ins (1,4,5)P3 and by using a nonlinear least-squares curve fitting of substrate-velocity relationships (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm). Sensitivity of the enzyme for CaM was measured by assaying enzymic activity at 5 μm Ins (1,4,5)P3, 10 μm free Ca2+, and increasing concentrations of CaM (0–2 μm). Okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, NaF, ATP, UTP, carbachol, histamine, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), Nonidet P-40, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Pefabloc was from Pentapharm. Calpain inhibitors I and II were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. KN-93, KN-62, calphostin C, and forskolin were from Calbiochem. [3H]Ins (1,4,5)P3 (15–30 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and immunodetection were performed as described previously (23Takazawa K. Lemos M. Delvaux A. Lejeune C. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When cells were ∼80% subconfluent in 6-cm diameter culture dishes, they were washed two times and incubated for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's pyrophosphate-free medium supplemented with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml). The cells were subsequently washed in prewarmed KRH medium, and a 2-ml aliquot of this medium containing the agent(s) was pipetted onto each culture dish for an incubation with agonist. Cell extracts were prepared as described above. Astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was isolated after each incubation by CaM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (27Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 200-μl cell extract (∼1.9 mg of total protein) was applied in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 to a column containing 200 μl of CaM-Sepharose eluted by gravity at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, 5 μmleupeptin, and 15 μg/ml calpain inhibitors I and II) containing no Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The column was washed in the same buffer with 0.5 mm EGTA and no Triton X-100. Specific elution of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was performed in the presence of 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, as well as phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described before (24Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two most active fractions (total volume of 400 μl) were concentrated to 50 μl using Strataclean resin (Stratagene), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using a Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposed for 24 h. For immunodetection and in vitro phosphorylation experiments, primary cultures of cortical astrocytes and 1321N1 cell line were cultured in monolayers in square cell culture dishes (24 cm × 24 cm). The cell crude extracts were applied in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 onto 40 ml of CaM-Sepharose. Purified astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was eluted in the presence of 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, together with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Fractions presenting the highest Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity (3 fractions, 25 ml) were concentrated by Amicon Centricon-10 to obtain a final 50-μl sample (∼3 μg of purified enzyme, with a specific activity of 1.4 ± 0.2 μmol/min × mg as determined at 5 μm Ins (1,4,5)P3 in the absence of the Ca2+·CaM complex). Homogenates prepared from rat cortical astrocytes or 1321N1 cells (7–8 × 106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium per incubation condition) were prepared by three successive cycles of freeze/thaw in the lysis buffer without detergent. After 10 passages in a 26-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe, cell homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (cytosol fraction) was saved; the pellet (particulate fraction; ∼30 μl) was washed three times and recovered in an equal final volume of the same lysis buffer before assay of enzymic activity. For Western blot studies, the same procedure was followed to separate the soluble and particulate fractions from homogenates prepared from 2.3 × 108 1321N1 cells (per incubation condition). Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity was solubilized from the particulate fraction under strong agitation in the lysis buffer (1 ml) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Enzyme activity assay showed that solubilization of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase from the particulate fraction was efficient at approximately 80–85% as compared with the total particulate activity (Fig. 7A). The soluble (12 mg of protein) and the solubilized particulate (75 mg of protein) fractions (1 ml each) were adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 50 ml and purified separately by CaM-Sepharose as described above. The active fractions were concentrated by Amicon Ultrafree-15 and applied for SDS-PAGE. Western blotting and immunodetections were performed as described above. Phosphorylation of purified astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (100 ng) by rat brain CaM kinase II (2 ng; Calbiochem) and/or rat brain PKC (2 ng) was performed as described before (27Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation samples were stopped at 4 °C and directly diluted in ice-cold enzyme dilution buffer (1000–10,000-fold) before assay of enzymic activity. In case of radioactive phosphorylation, reactions were carried out in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (final activity ∼50 μCi/ml) instead of 1 mm ATP and stopped in SDS sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In order to measure CaM kinase II and/or PKC-mediated 32P incorporation into astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, enzyme (0.5 μg) was phosphorylated in the presence of 40 μm[γ-32P]ATP (final activity ∼500 μCi/ml) for various times (0–10 min) in the presence of CaM kinase II (10 ng), 2 μm CaM, and 10 μm free Ca2+ or in the presence of PKC (10 ng), 0.25 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol. After incubation, each sample was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose (Whatman), precipitated, and washed in the presence of 75 mm phosphoric acid before counting the radioactivity (31Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Since native Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A activity could be regenerated after SDS-PAGE (see, e.g., Ref. 23Takazawa K. Lemos M. Delvaux A. Lejeune C. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we performed similar experiments with rat astrocytes as starting material. A major 85–90-kDa gel band associated with Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity from rat astrocytes was detected after SDS-PAGE and regeneration of enzymic activity (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when using enzyme purified from 1321N1 cells or homogenates of rat cortical astrocytes and 1321N1 cells (data not shown). Two distinct antibodies were raised against two peptides chosen in the N- and C-terminal sequence regions of human Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase B. Western blot analysis showed a unique 88-kDa band in purified preparation for both sera (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). Immunodetected signals were greatly reduced when the sera were used in the presence of the corresponding antigenic peptides (shown for 1321N1 cells) (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). No signal could be observed with the corresponding preimmune sera (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–10). No recognition could be seen with antibodies raised against isoform A (23Takazawa K. Lemos M. Delvaux A. Lejeune C. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Silver staining of purified astrocytic enzyme from 1321N1 cells revealed a major band with an approximate molecular weight of 88,000 (Fig. 1C). Carbachol is a well known agonist for muscarinic cholinoreceptor in rat brain cortical astrocytes and in 1321N1 cells, where it mediates an enhancement of PLC activity, the production of Ins (1,4,5)P3, Ins (1,3,4,5)P4, and intracellular calcium mobilization (7Nakahata N. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Oliva A.M. Bas N. Garcia A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The same events were observed in cortical astrocytes in response to purinoreceptors P2Y and P2U activation with ATP and UTP (32King B.F. Neary J.T. Zhu Q. Wang S. Norenberg M.D. Burnstock G. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this last response was not observed in 1321N1 cells since this cell line lacks the P2Y receptors (33Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Incubation of rat brain cortical astrocytes or 1321N1 cells with carbachol provoked a transient increase in Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity,i.e. 6–8-fold as compared with basal activity after 15–30 s of incubation with the agonist (Fig. 2). Maximal enzyme activation was achieved at 10 μm carbachol (TableI). Activation with UTP provoked in rat cortical astrocytes the same rapid increase in Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2A) with maximal effect at 10 μm agonist (Table I). No effect of UTP was observed in 1321N1 cells (Fig. 2B and Table I). Histamine was much less potent (1.3–1.6-fold stimulation) (Fig. 2). There was no effect of thrombin (data not shown). Preincubation with okadaic acid of cortical astrocytes or 1321N1 cells before receptor activation provided a maximal and more rapid activation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (i.e. 10-fold) (Fig. 2). TPA also provoked stimulation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity, i.e. 2–2.5-fold, in cortical astrocytes and 1321N1 cells, whereas forskolin did not provoke any change in enzymic activity (Table I). In both cell systems, activation of Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was related to an increase inV max with no change in the apparentK m value for Ins (1,4,5)P3(K m = 1.5 ± 0.4 μm) (data not shown).Table IEffect of Ca 2+-raising agonists, TPA and forskolin on Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity in rat brain cortex astrocytes and 1321N1 cellsIncubation conditionsIns(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activityRat brain cortex astrocytes1321N1 cells%No agent100 ± 8100 ± 5Carbachol0.1 μm (20 s)163 ± 10149 ± 81 μm265 ± 9270 ± 115 μm484 ± 19459 ± 1010 μm823 ± 36799 ± 2150 μm790 ± 22716 ± 21UTP0.1 μm (20 s)158 ± 5107 ± 131 μm258 ± 9105 ± 155 μm459 ± 1694 ± 510 μm813 ± 28113 ± 950 μm740 ± 1299 ± 12TPA0 s (400 nm)95 ± 5104 ± 830 s121 ± 1191 ± 81 min206 ± 1192 ± 62 min240 ± 18229 ± 145 min126 ± 18109 ± 20Forskolin30 s (10 μm)102 ± 897 ± 31 min93 ± 1397 ± 193 min99 ± 4108 ± 85 min105 ± 11102 ± 415 min100 ± 395 ± 12Enzyme activity was assayed at 5 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3. 100% enzyme activity corresponds to 4.8 and 5.2 nmol/min × mg in rat cortex astrocytes and 1321N1 cells, respectively.

Each value is the mean of duplicates ± S.D. The results are from one representative experiment out of six. We investigated the effect of specific membrane-permeable PKC and CaM kinase II inhibitors on the activation of astrocytic Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase in intact cells. Preincubation in the presence of increasing concentrations (up to 500 nm) of calphostin C (potent inhibitor of PKC) before agonist stimulation partially prevented (up to 40%) activation induced by cell stimulation by carbachol (Fig. 3). Additionally, preincubation of both cell types with increasing concentrations (up to 2 μm) of two potent CaM kinase II inhibitors, i.e. KN-93 and KN-62, prevented agonist-mediated activation of Ins (1,4,5)P33-kinase up to 85% (Fig. 3). The same results were obtained in UTP (10 μm)-stimulated rat cortical astrocytes (data not shown). Direct enzyme phosphorylation was evidenced in rat cortical astrocytes prelabeled with [32P] orthophosphate and incubated with an agonist (carbachol or UTP) to stimulate Ins (1,4,5)P33-kinase activity (Fig. 4). Ins (1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was purified by CaM-Sepharose specifically eluted in the presence of Triton X-100 and EGTA, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme activation coincided with phosphate incorporation into a 88-kDa protein band (Fig. 4). Maximal32P incorporation occurred after incubation of astrocytes with 10 μm carbachol for 30 s or with 10 μm UTP for 30 s (Fig. 4). Similar results were observed after stimulation of 1321N1 cells by carbachol but UTP did not present any effect (data not shown). Preincubation with okadaic acid (75 nm) before receptor activation potentiated the phosphate incorporation into the 88-kDa enzyme in both cell systems (Fig. 4). 32P incorporation was also observed after incubation of both cell types with TPA for at least 3 min (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W2107631554,"The transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters which share structural organization and use energy provided by ATP to translocate a large variety of solutes across cellular membranes. TAP is thought to hydrolyze ATP in order to deliver peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum where they can assemble with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. However, initial binding of peptide substrates to TAP has been suggested to be ATP-independent. In this study, the effect of temperature, energetic nucleotides, and peptide on conformation and functional capacity of TAP proteins was examined. Incubation of insect cell microsomes overexpressing human TAP complexes or of human B cell microsomes at 37 °C induced a rapid and irreversible structural change that reduced dramatically TAP reactivity with antibodies to transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains and abolished peptide binding and transport by TAP. These alterations were inhibited almost completely by di- or trinucleotides, and partially by high affinity peptides, suggesting that complete nucleotide dissociation inactivates TAP complexes. Experiments with isolated TAP subunits and fragments suggested that TAP complex stabilization by nucleotides may depend on their binding to the TAP1 subunit. Thus, the cellular level of functional TAP complexes may be regulated by nucleotide concentrations. It is speculated that this regulation may serve to prevent induction of autoimmunity by stressed cells with low energy levels.

Thus, the cellular level of functional TAP complexes may be regulated by nucleotide concentrations. It is speculated that this regulation may serve to prevent induction of autoimmunity by stressed cells with low energy levels. ABC transporters constitute a large protein family whose members use energy provided by ATP to transport a large array of solutes across cellular membranes or, in a few cases, to regulate opening of membrane channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are composed of four domains, two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; ABC, ATP binding cassette; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ATPγS, adenosine 5′- (thiotriphosphate). and two hydrophobic domains each comprising six or more transmembrane segments. These domains can be encoded by between one and four separate genes. While the hydrophobic transmembrane domains of individual ABC proteins share little primary sequence homology, the nucleotide-binding domains comprise several highly conserved sequence motifs (Walker A and B) found in many ATPases and involved in binding of MgATP, and an additional “signature” sequence typical for members of the ABC family (reviewed in Ref. 2Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although numerous studies of ABC transporters have provided strong evidence for an essential role of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis for solute transport, it remains unclear how transporter interaction with nucleotides is coupled to substrate translocation. Nucleotide binding to the hydrophilic domains has been demonstrated directly for many ABC transporters. ATP hydrolysis, although more difficult to study, has also been reported for several ABC transporters, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the multiple drug resistance or P-glycoprotein, two ABC transporters with substantial medical importance (3Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol.

Mutations affecting ATP hydrolysis by these and other ABC transporters impair or abolish their function (5Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J.

J. 1997; 323: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Studies of mutant ABC transporters, in combination with nucleotide trapping experiments using vanadate or beryllium fluoride, have given rise to several models of transporter function linking ATP binding and hydrolysis to substrate binding and release (8Bliss J.M. Garon C.F. Silver R.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). At least in the case of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, evidence for distinct functions of the two NBD has also been obtained (5Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The concept of transmembrane transport driven by ATP hydrolysis implies that transporter molecules associated with distinct nucleotide derivatives or devoid of nucleotides should display different conformations and different affinities for substrate. Evidence for the former assumption has been obtained in various systems. For example, binding of MgATP to P-glycoprotein alters its tertiary structure (10Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), while ATP depletion or mutational inactivation of one or both of its NBD increases reactivity with a mAb also known to inhibit its function (11Mechetner E.B. Schott B. Morse B.S. Stein W.D. Druley T. Davis K.A. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Altered conformation resulting from nucleotide binding has also been reported for several bacterial ABC transporters or their isolated NBD fragments (12Koronakis V. Hughes C. Koronakis E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ATP affects the conformation of the NBD of the bacterial maltose transporter and modulates its interaction with the hydrophobic transmembrane domains (encoded in this case by a separate gene) (14Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the role of nucleotides for the most “prominent” mammalian ABC transporters cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and multiple drug resistance protein has been studied in some detail, little is known about their role for the transporters associated with antigen processing, a heterodimeric complex encoded by the TAP1 and TAP2 genes in the major histocompatibility complex class II region each coding for one hydrophobic domain and one carboxyl-terminal NBD (reviewed in Ref. 15Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAP complexes transport short peptides with a length of 8 to 16 residues from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum where these peptides can assemble with newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TAP function is essential for antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, since deficiency in one or both TAP subunits results in severely reduced major histocompatibility complex class I expression and function. As peptide transport by TAP in permeabilized cells requires ATP and is inhibited by non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues (16Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), TAP is thought to be an ATPase, although in experiments with isolated recombinant TAP NBD fragments, or with TAP dimers reconstituted in membranes, it has so far not been possible to provide direct evidence for this hypothesis (17Müller K.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14032-14037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang K. Früh K. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated directly; contradictory results have been reported with respect to the ATP binding capacity of the TAP2 NBD (17Müller K.M. Ebensperger C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14032-14037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang K. Früh K. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TAP function involves an initial step of peptide interaction with a binding site probably composed of TAP1 and TAP2 moieties which can be monitored in human cells using photoreactive peptides (22Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), or in a simple binding assay taking advantage of the substantial overexpression of TAP complexes in microsomes of insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses (23Van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the latter system, radiolabeled peptides bind to TAP dimers with high efficiency at low temperature. Thus, in the case of TAP, solute binding to, and translocation by, the transporters can be monitored separately, providing an opportunity to study the role of nucleotides and other factors for each of these steps. Previous observations that, different from peptide transport, peptide binding to TAP does not require addition of ATP to microsomes or permeabilized cells suggested that nucleotides may not play a role for the initial substrate binding step (22Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, since microsomal TAP complexes may remain ATP-associated during fractionation of subcellular compartments, and since even after depletion of cellular ATP levels the same may apply to TAP complexes in permeabilized cells, the issue of the role of nucleotides for peptide binding to TAP remains unresolved. This study was motivated by previous observations that had suggested temperature-induced conformational changes in the TAP proteins (21Russ G. Esquivel F. Yewdell J.W. Cresswell P. Spies T. Bennink J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21312-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and a role of nucleotides for peptide binding to TAP. Specifically, we had observed inefficient binding of peptide to TAP complexes incubated at 37 °C (23Van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O.

Moreover, we had previously found peptide dissociation from TAP complexes incubated with trinucleotides, consistent with a role for ATP in substrate binding to, and release from, TAP (23Van Endert P.M.

Peptides were labeled by the chloramine-T method (1 or 2 mg/ml) and separated from free125I by chromatography through Sephadex G-10. ATP (>99% pure) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, while ADP, ATPγS, CTP, GTP, AMP, and cAMP were all purchased in the highest available purity (generally >98% or 99%) from Sigma. Nucleotide stocks were prepared at 100 mm in PBS and in most cases used freshly, or otherwise used for no more than 4 weeks after storage at −20 °C. MAb 148.3 used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot detection of TAP1, mAb 435.3 used for immunoprecipitation of TAP2, and mAb 429.3 used for Western blot detection of TAP2 have been described previously (23Van Endert P.M.

Recovered microsomes were washed, resuspended in cavitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.5 mm CaOAc) with protease inhibitors, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until immediately before use. Peptide binding to human TAP complexes was measured as described (24Van Endert P.M. Riganelli D. Greco G. Fleischhauer K. Sidney J. Sette A. Bach J.-F. J. Exp.

In peptide transport assays, 15 μl of microsome suspension was incubated in a total volume of 170 μl of assay buffer (PBS with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiotreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2) with 250 nm peptide 125I-R-10-T and 2 mm ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. Vesicles were solubilized by addition of 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet-P40, pH 7.4), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g and 4 °C for 5 min. Glycosylated peptide was recovered by incubation of clarified lysates for 30 min at 4 °C with 50 μl of concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), which were finally washed four times in lysis buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and counted. In preincubation experiments, 15 μl of microsome suspension was added to 150 μl of assay buffer (with 2 mm MgCl2for peptide binding experiments, and with 5 mmMgCl2 for transport experiments) and preincubated as appropriate. Then 850 μl of cold assay buffer was added and vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C and 20,000 ×g. Washed vesicles were resuspended in 150 μl of assay buffer, and peptide binding or transport experiments were performed as described above. In a standard immunoprecipitation experiment, 30 μl of microsome suspension was added to 300 μl of binding assay buffer (see above) and incubated under appropriate conditions (4 °C or 37 °C, with or without 2 mm ATP) for 10–15 min. Vesicles were then lysed by addition of an equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) with 2% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 0.4 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 2 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 10 μm leupeptin (Alexis, Laufelfingen, Switzerland), and 20 μm pepstatin (Alexis). For immunoprecipitations by rabbit sera specific for TAP peptides, 0.5% deoxycholate was added to the lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated 10 min at 4 °C, then clarified by centrifugation and precleared by a 30-min incubation with a 15-μl pellet of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Gamma-Bind PlusTM, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) on a rotating wheel. Precleared lysate was then added to antibodies (5–10 μg of mAb 148.3 specific for TAP1, or mAb 435.3 specific for TAP2, or 2.5 μl of rabbit antiserum) which had been preabsorbed on Protein G-Sepharose beads; after an incubation with antibodies for 30–40 min (mAb 148.3), or for 2 h (mAb 435.3, rabbit sera) at 4 °C, precipitated TAP proteins were pelleted, washed three times with precipitation buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and recovered by boiling for 10 min in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 10 μl of immunoprecipitated TAP proteins were loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE minigels and separated at 100 V for 2–3 h in a standard Tris/glycine/SDS buffer. Proteins were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham) at 80 V for 1 h in 48 mm Tris, 390 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in TBS buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 5% bovine serum albumin or 2% dry non-fat milk. To detect immunoprecipitated proteins, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (148.3 or 429.3, diluted to 50–100 ng/ml in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T)) for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times for 10 min in TBS-T, then incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-coupled goat Abs to mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:50,000 in TBS-T, and finally washed four times for 15 min with TBS-T. Bound secondary Ab was revealed using a commercial enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (Super SignalTM, Pierce) and exposures of 15 s to 3 min on Hyperfilm ECLTM (Amersham). We had previously observed that peptide binding to insect cell-expressed human TAP dimers is less efficient when binding experiments are performed at 37 °C (23Van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In view of the observation by Russ and associates (21Russ G. Esquivel F. Yewdell J.W. Cresswell P. Spies T. Bennink J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21312-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that efficiency of TAP immunoprecipitation is reduced after incubation of detergent lysates at 37 °C, I wondered whether temperature might affect the conformation or assembly of TAP dimers expressed in microsomes, thereby affecting the functional state of TAP complexes. When microsomes expressing TAP1/TAP2 dimers were incubated under conditions employed in binding assays for 15 min at 37 °C before lysis, the amount of TAP1 protein and associated TAP2 protein precipitated by the TAP1-specific mAb 148.3 was greatly reduced (Fig. 1). TAP degradation was not responsible for lower TAP recovery, since presence of a potent mixture of protease inhibitors during preincubations did not prevent loss of precipitated TAP protein, and TAP fragments possibly resulting from degradation were not visible in Western blots (not shown). Lower TAP recovery was partly due to reduced efficiency of TAP solubilization since unseparated clarified lysates of pretreated microsomes contained smaller amounts of TAP1 and TAP2 (not shown). TAP precipitation by several antisera (especially 1p3, 1p4, and 2p4) recognizing epitopes in or between predicted TAP1 or TAP2 transmembrane domains was also diminished. However, TAP reactivity with other sera (2p1 and 2p3) was not affected by preincubation at 37 °C, and one TAP2-specific serum (2p2) precipitated exclusively heat-treated TAP dimers, albeit with low efficiency (Fig. 1). Thus, incubation of microsomes at 37 °C increased the amount of TAP proteins that could not be solubilized by a combination of Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate, presumably due to aggregation, but also induced an altered TAP conformation that was recognized by serum 2p2 but not with mAb 148.3 and 435.3 (not shown) and several other sera reacting with TAP1 and TAP2 transmembrane domain epitopes. Loss of immunoprecipitable TAP complexes expressed in insect cell microsomes after incubation at (for human TAP) physiological temperature may be interpreted in several ways. First, the TAP conformation recognized by mAb 148.3 and 435.3 may be typical for non-functional TAP complexes that are intrinsically unstable at 37 °C, an unlikely hypothesis since these mAb precipitate TAP complexes expressed physiologically in human cells. Second, loss of immunoprecipitable TAP complexes may be due to TAP destabilization in insect cell membranes for which 37 °C represents an unphysiologically high temperature. Finally, TAP complexes may normally be stabilized by factors absent from insect cell microsomes, such as HLA class I heavy and/or light chains or tapasin which associate directly with TAP (reviewed in Ref. 26Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), but also soluble cytosolic compounds, such as energetic nucleotides binding to the ATP-binding cassettes of one or both TAP proteins. To test these hypotheses, peptide binding and transport assays with insect cell and human microsomes were performed. Preincubation of insect cell microsomes expressing human TAP dimers at 37 °C under the conditions used in immunoprecipitation experiments led to a dramatic decrease of TAP peptide binding capacity, while incubation at 27 °C (the physiological temperature for Sf9 insect cells) had no effect on peptide binding (Fig. 2A). A decrease in peptide binding capacity was observed after 1 min of incubation at 37 °C and was essentially complete after 8 min. However, when 2 mmATP was present during preincubations, loss of peptide binding capacity was strongly inhibited, with 50% of binding capacity (versus less than 3% in the absence of ATP) preserved after 16 min; addition of ATP during preincubation at 27 °C had no effect on subsequent peptide binding. Addition of ATP after preincubation had no effect and did not restore binding capacity, suggesting irreversible loss of binding capacity (not shown). Presence of protease inhibitors during preincubations did not prevent loss of peptide binding, arguing against TAP degradation as the reason for reduced peptide binding (not shown). Parallel observations were made in peptide transport experiments with insect cell microsomes preincubated at 37 °C (Fig. 2B); peptide transport capacity decreased over time, but was partly preserved by 2 mm ATP present in preincubations. Loss of peptide transport capacity was less dramatic than loss of peptide binding capacity. This may reflect the fact that, due to the strong TAP overexpression in insect cell microsomes relative to the glycosylation machinery, even a relatively small residual percentage of functionally competent TAP complexes may be sufficient to cause significant accumulation of peptide in the vesicles. In contrast, the level of peptide binding is likely to correspond directly to the number of functionally competent TAP complexes. Leakiness of microsomes prepared from baculovirus-infected cells may also contribute to a smaller effect of TAP loss in transport assays. To test whether the observed effect of incubation at 37 °C was due to the lipid composition of insect cell membranes or to absence of human ER cofactors with a role in antigen processing, analogous peptide transport experiments were carried out with human microsomes (Fig. 2C). TAP-deficient T2 microsomes accumulated only small amounts of glycosylated peptide under all conditions. Microsomes prepared from Jesthom B cells which express all components of HLA class I peptide loading complexes showed the same effects of temperature and ATP as insect cell vesicles, i.e. rapid loss of peptide transport capacity which was strongly inhibited by ATP. Both the effect of incubation at 37 °C and that of ATP were more dramatic in human than in insect cell microsomes; this may be due to lower TAP expression by, and leakiness of human vesicles, as discussed above. Taken together, these results suggested that loss of function of physiologically expressed as well as recombinant human TAP complexes was not due to absence of an endoplasmic reticulum-resident human co-factor, but rather to low levels of energetic nucleotides during preincubations. TAP proteins (21Russ G. Esquivel F. Yewdell J.W. Cresswell P. Spies T. Bennink J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21312-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and their cytosolic ATP binding cassettes (17Müller K.M. Ebensperger C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14032-14037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang K. Früh K. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), bind di- and trinucleotides and are thought to hydrolyze ATP during peptide transport, although direct evidence for ATP hydrolysis by TAP or its fragments has so far not been obtained. Various nucleotides were therefore tested for their capacity to prevent loss of TAP function. As shown in Fig. 3A, both trinucleotides (ATP, GTP, and CTP) and a dinucleotide (ADP) prevented loss of peptide binding capacity of TAP complexes. A non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (ATPγS) also prevented loss of TAP function, while addition of AMP or cAMP during preincubations had no effect. In a dose-response experiment (Fig. 3B), both ATP and ADP had no significant effect on binding at 4 °C. At 37 °C, ATP and ADP inhibited loss of TAP function with equal efficiency; an effect was detectable at <10 μm, and preservation of 50% TAP binding capacity required 200 μm nucleotide. These results suggest that a site on TAP or a TAP-associated protein binds di- and trinucleotides (but not mononucleotides) with similar efficiency and stabilizes thereby functional TAP dimers.

In one pathway, RNase HI removes most of the RNA, leaving a single ribonucleotide adjacent to the DNA. FEN1 removes this ribonucleotide exonucleolytically. In the other pathway, FEN1 removes the entire primer endonucleolytically after displacement of the 5′-end region of the Okazaki fragment. Cleavage would occur beyond the RNA, a short distance into the DNA. The initiator RNA and an adjacent short region of DNA are synthesized by DNA polymerase α/primase. Because the fidelity of DNA polymerase α is lower than that of the DNA polymerases that complete DNA extension, mismatches occur relatively frequently near the 5′-ends of Okazaki fragments. We have examined the ability of FEN1 to repair such errors. Results show that mismatched bases up to 15 nucleotides from the 5′-end of an annealed DNA strand change the pattern of FEN1 cleavage. Instead of removing terminal nucleotides sequentially, FEN1 appears to cleave a portion of the mismatched strand endonucleolytically. We propose that a mismatch destabilizes the helical structure over a nearby area. This allows FEN1 to cleave more efficiently, facilitating removal of the mismatch. If mismatches were not introduced during synthesis of the Okazaki fragment, helical disruption would not occur, nor would unnecessary degradation of the 5′-end of the fragment.

Mammalian DNA replication proceeds by two distinct processes occurring at replication forks (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The leading strand is made as a large continuous segment, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized as a series of discontinuous segments called Okazaki fragments. Each segment is individually initiated by a RNA primer. Later, these primers are removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments are joined into one continuous strand. DNA polymerase α/primase synthesizes every RNA primer (2Wang T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 3Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and the adjacent 10–20 nucleotides of DNA (4Nethanel T. Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6634-6640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is then replaced by either DNA polymerase δ or ε via a process called polymerase switching (5Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Because DNA polymerase α has no mechanism to remove erroneously inserted nucleotides, it can continue synthesis only by mismatch extension. DNA polymerase α incorporates an incorrect nucleotide at a rate of approximately 1 in every 10,000 nucleotides, whereas the error rate of polymerases δ and ε is at most 1 in 50,000–200,000 nucleotides (8Kunkel T.A. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Initiator RNA removal is accomplished by a eukaryotic 5′ to 3′ exonuclease/endonuclease before Okazaki fragment joining (9Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol.

Most frequently called flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1), 1The abbreviations used are: FEN1, flap endonuclease-1. 1The abbreviations used are: FEN1, flap endonuclease-1. this enzyme is also known as RAD2 homologue nuclease (10Murante R.S.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one proposed pathway, RNase HI-directed cleavage removes almost the entire RNA primer but leaves a single RNA residue. FEN1 exonucleolytically removes this last ribonucleotide (16Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, genetic evidence suggests that alternative pathways exist. Yeast cells are still viable after deletion of the gene that accounts for 75% of RNase H activity (17Frank P. Reiter C.B. Wintersberger U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In a second proposed pathway, FEN1 alone removes the initiator RNA (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). FEN1 endonucleolytic cleavage requires that the substrate has a downstream primer with an unannealed 5′-tail, or flap. FEN1 appears to recognize the 5′-end, slide over the entire length of the tail, and cleave near the junction of the tail with the template. This releases the tail as an intact segment (10Murante R.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Sometimes, the presence of an upstream primer is also required for FEN1 activity. In fact, for both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic substrates, the upstream primer is often stimulatory (10Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9266-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For endonucleolytic removal, the RNA must be within a displaced tail. An upstream primer may or may not be present, as appropriate for the particular cleavage site. Displacement of the RNA may be accomplished by a DNA helicase with or without DNA polymerase-directed displacement synthesis from an upstream fragment (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J.

Depending on how far the tail is displaced, FEN1 can cleave within the RNA, at the RNA-DNA junction, or within the DNA beyond the RNA (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FEN1 may also participate in DNA repair. It is a member of the RAD2 family of repair nucleases (24Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This family includes XPG in mammals, RAD2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and RAD13 inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. These homologous nucleases are important components of the nucleotide excision repair pathway and are responsible for the incision 3′ to the damage site (24Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). FEN1 is homologous to the family members called RAD27 or RAD2 homologue inS. cerevisiae and RAD2 in S. pombe. These family members are smaller than the XPG nucleases and are believed to function in other repair processes (24Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A third class of members includes exonuclease I of S. pombe, for which genetic studies suggest a role in mismatch repair (24Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The FEN1 class enzymes are believed to participate in base excision repair because the null mutant in yeast is sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate (14Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, FEN1 can remove abasic sites (25DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and can function in reconstitutions of base excision repair using purified enzymes (26Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 27Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27492-27498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). FEN1 can also remove a more diverse group of flap adducts such as cisplatin derivatives (29Barnes C.J. Wahl A.F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29624-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, it may also participate in the removal of monoribonucleotides embedded in chromosomal DNA (30Rumbaugh J.A. Murante R.S. Shi S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22591-22599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, FEN1 has been implicated as a part of the mismatch repair pathway (31Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the current report, we provide evidence that FEN1 participates in the repair of mismatches produced during the priming and synthesis of Okazaki fragments. We show that a single mismatch in an otherwise fully annealed DNA primer changes the pattern of FEN1 cleavage. Typically, on a fully annealed substrate, FEN1 will exonucleolytically cleave the 5′ most nucleotide. We find that a single nucleotide mismatch up to 15 nucleotides in from the 5′-end promotes endonucleolytic cleavages. This constitutes a 5′ proofreading process in which the mismatch promotes the nuclease action that leads to its removal. Unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 or 6,000 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (3,000 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). T4 polynucleotide kinase and SequenaseTM version 2.0 were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. RNase inhibitor and snake venom phosphodiesterase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. Recombinant human FEN1 was purified as described previously (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The final preparation was >95% pure as determined by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final specific activity was 65,000 units/mg, with 1 unit defined as the amount of nuclease required to exonucleolytically cleave 4,000 fmol in 30 min at 37 °C of a standard exonucleolytic test substrate consisting of a downstream primer (5′-TTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA-3′) annealed to a template (3′-GAGTGATTTCCCTTGTTTTCGAACGTACGGACGTCCAGCTGAGATCTCCTAGGGGCCCATT-5′). The sequences of the primers and the structures of the substrates used in this study are described in Table I and in the figure legends. TableI depicts template T1 and the downstream primers used in this study. The primers are divided into four groups, depending on the location of the 5′ most nucleotide; the 5′-end of all primers in a given group is located at the same place on the template. The first digit of the primer name indicates the group: 1, 2, 3, or 4. To generate a mismatch, each primer has a single base change that forms a single mismatch with the template, T1. The remaining digits in the name indicate the distance of this mismatch in nucleotides from the 5′-end of the primer. For all experiments, the substrate name reflects the use of a specific downstream primer. For example, substrate 2.11 indicates that a primer from group 2 was annealed to the template to create a mismatch at position 11. Control substrates 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 have no mismatch. Mismatches were made so that nucleotides were paired with themselves (e.g. G was paired with G). The 5′-end of the template extends beyond the downstream primer to permit 3′-end labeling. In substrates 1.T and 1.A, the mismatch is not internal but is, in fact, the 5′ most nucleotide, which is mispaired as T-T or A-A, respectively. Substrate 3.6 uses a primer that lacks the three 5′ most nucleotides of the primer in substrate 2.9. Thus, both the location of the 5′-end and the position of mismatch relative to the 5′-end have changed. Substrates made from primers in group 4 are similar to those made from primers in group 2, except that 25 nucleotides were added to the 5′-end to form an unannealed 5′-tail, the sequence of which is shown in TableI.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesDownstream primers (5′-3′)1.0(35-mer)ATCCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA1.2aUnderlined nucleotides indicate the position of a mismatched base pair.(35-mer)AACCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA1.3(35-mer)ATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA1.TbSubstrate 1.A uses primer 1.0 with template T2 (which differs from T1) so that the 5′ most nucleotide of the primer forms an A-A mismatch.(35-mer)TTCCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA2.0(39-mer)TTGCATCCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA2.9(38-mer)TTGCATCCGTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGT2.11(38-mer)TTGCATCCCTCCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGT2.13(38-mer)TTGCATCCCTGCTGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGT2.15(38-mer)TTGCATCCCTGCAGCTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGT3.6(36-mer)CATCCGTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA4.Xc25 nucleotides added to the 5′-end to substrates 2.0, 2.7, and 2.9 to generate primers 4.0, 4.7, and 4.9, respectively, are shown.CGTACGGACGTAGAGCTGTTTCCAAUpstream primer (5′-3′)UP(25-mer)TAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTTGCATCCCTemplate (3′-5′)T1dThe underlined nucleotide in the template sequence is the annealing position of the 5′ nucleotide of primers in group 1; the boldfaced nucleotide is the annealing position of the 5′ nucleotide of primers in group 2.(61-mer)GAGTGATTTCCCTTGTTTTCGAACGTAGGGACGTCCAGCTGAGATCTCCTAGGGGCCCATTa Underlined nucleotides indicate the position of a mismatched base pair.b Substrate 1.A uses primer 1.0 with template T2 (which differs from T1) so that the 5′ most nucleotide of the primer forms an A-A mismatch.c 25 nucleotides added to the 5′-end to substrates 2.0, 2.7, and 2.9 to generate primers 4.0, 4.7, and 4.9, respectively, are shown.d The underlined nucleotide in the template sequence is the annealing position of the 5′ nucleotide of primers in group 1; the boldfaced nucleotide is the annealing position of the 5′ nucleotide of primers in group 2. Open table in a new tab For 5′-end labeling, downstream primers were incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's protocol and then annealed to the template in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For 3′-end-labeled substrates, downstream primers were first phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP. Then, after annealing to template T1, they were extended by addition to the 3′ terminus using [α-32P]dATP and SequenaseTMversion 2.0. Substrates were isolated via 12% native gel electrophoresis (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), eluted from the gel using elution buffer (0.5m ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mmEDTA), precipitated in ethanol, and resuspended in annealing buffer or TE, pH 8.0. Assays to monitor cleavage by FEN1 were performed in FEN1 buffer containing 60 mm BisTris (pH 7.0), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 fmol of substrate/reaction in a volume of 25 μl/reaction. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 15 ng (340 fmol) of FEN1/reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 25 μl of 2× formamide loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.01% (w/v) each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Controls lacking enzyme were also assayed. Products were separated on either 12% or 18% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel electrophoresis (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. DNA size markers were generated by digesting 5′-end-labeled primers with snake venom phosphodiesterase. Any adjustments to the above are noted in the figure legends. We hypothesized that FEN1 participates in a 5′ proofreading reaction linked to DNA replication. In this reaction, FEN1 would remove mismatches generated by DNA polymerase α in the region of DNA just beyond the initiator RNA. On a fully annealed DNA primer, the action of FEN1 is exonucleolytic, whereas on a flap, it is endonucleolytic. Our initial experiments were designed to determine whether the presence of a mismatch would destabilize a primer so that it would appear as a flap to the nuclease. If so, we wanted to measure the distance over which the mismatch could influence cleavage activity. We first compared the cleavage of a fully annealed control substrate (substrate 1.0) to that of substrates containing a single mismatch either two or three nucleotides from the 5′-end (substrates 1.2 and 1.3, respectively) (Fig. 1A). For this and all other experiments in this study, control substrates were identical to the mismatch substrates, except that they were without a mismatch. As expected, on these 5′-end-labeled substrates, FEN1 cleavage in the absence of mismatch resulted in the release of a single nucleotide (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Cleavage of fully annealed substrates most often results in exonucleolytic cleavage (10Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21Turchi J.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although with some sequences, additional products from cleavage at internal sites are observed. Apparently, FEN1 has the capacity to invade a small proportion of fully annealed substrates to perform endonucleolytic cleavage. Such minor internal cleavage products were seen with substrate 1.0. When a mismatch was present at the second or third nucleotide, the proportion of products resulting from endonucleolytic cleavage (trimers and pentamers) was greatly enhanced (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and4). The mechanism of FEN1 was shifted from predominantly exonucleolytic cleavage to predominantly endonucleolytic cleavage simply by the presence of a single mismatched base pair. For consistency, mismatched substrates were produced by pairing nucleotides with themselves (i.e. G with G). However, we have noticed that the sequence of the mismatch affects the distribution of internal cleavages, as shown in Fig. 1B. Lane 1 shows the cleavage of control substrate 1.0, as in Fig. 1A. For lane 2, the sequence of the primer was modified to generate a T-T mispair with the template at the 5′-end of the primer (substrate 1.T). For lane 3, the template sequence was modified so that the 5′-end nucleotide of the original primer formed an A-A mismatch with the new template (substrate 1.A). In comparing lanes 2 and 3, the identity of the mismatch clearly alters the ratio of the three major products. There is a higher percentage of pentamer released with the A-A mismatch. These results suggest that the specific nucleotides of the mismatch affect the internal cleavage capacity of FEN1, perhaps by altering the exact amount of primer destabilization or the shape of helical distortion. On the other hand, the pattern of products is similar to those generated when the mismatch was at position 2 or 3 from the 5′-end (Fig. 1, compare A with B). This suggests that the mismatch alters the structure of the substrate around it to favor endonucleolytic cleavage but does not define the position of cleavage. Instead, the nuclease appears to cleave at sites that it favors, irrespective of the exact location of the mismatch. As the mismatch was moved further into the strand, the effect on the distribution of 5′ products decreased. Mismatches at 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 nucleotides from the 5′-end produced a product distribution that differed little from the distribution seen with no mismatch (data not shown). A primer template in which the primer has an unannealed 5′-tail is the preferred substrate of FEN1 (10Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether a mismatch in the annealed region downstream of an unannealed 5′-tail would alter the pattern of cleavage. We thought the mismatch might effectively lengthen the tail, enabling FEN1 to cleave further internally than it otherwise would. FEN1 can remove initiator RNA endonucleolytically when it has been displaced into a tail (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The helical disruption caused by a mismatch might allow FEN1 to remove the initiator RNA and a mismatch simultaneously, with an appropriately placed endonucleolytic cut. Fig. 2 clearly shows no difference in cleavage on endonucleolytic substrates with no mismatch (lane 1), a mismatch seven nucleotides into the annealed region (lane 2), and a mismatch nine nucleotides into the annealed region (lane 3). Cleavage of each substrate results in the production of two major products of ∼26 and 10 nucleotides. The expected product is ∼26 nucleotides, given that the unannealed 5′-tail is 25 nucleotides. The smaller product is the result of cleavage within the tail. This might occur from either transient annealing between the tail and the upstream portion of the template or the secondary structure within the unannealed tail. The presence of the tail might have facilitated the binding of FEN1 and movement of the nuclease to the site of the mismatch to make an initial cleavage. However, these data provide no evidence that the two features collaborate to favor an altered position of cleavage. Presumably, after the tail has been removed, the mismatch will promote further internal cleavages as suggested by the results shown below. To perform effective 5′ proofreading, FEN1 must cleave beyond the mismatch. It would appear that if the mismatch is sufficiently far from the 5′-end, it cannot be removed by a single cut. However, because the primers examined to this point had been 5′-end-labeled, only the first cleavage event could be observed. A mismatch that is initially deep within a primer becomes increasingly close to the 5′-end as FEN1 cleaves the substrate. As this occurs, the mismatch would be expected to have an increasingly greater influence on the cleavage events. Although the mismatch is not removed in a single cut, FEN1 may do so through a series of cleavage events. In Fig. 3, substrate 2.9 has a mismatched base pair at position 9. Lane 1 demonstrates that FEN1 can release a monomer, trimer, or hexamer on this substrate. In each event, the mismatch is not removed in a single cut. After FEN1 removes the first three nucleotides, the mismatched base pair at position 9 is now at position 6. We used a second substrate, 3.6, to model this intermediate and examine FEN1 activity. Using substrate 3.6, we can observe the results of subsequent cuts. Cleavage of substrate 3.6 released monomers, dimers, and tetramers (Fig. 3, lane 2). The mobilities of products in lanes 2 and 3 differ from those in lane 1 because of the sequence difference between substrates 2.9 and 3.6. In particular, released monomer dC migrates farther in lane 2than does monomer dT in lane 1. To verify the exact lengths of the products from both substrates, we made molecular weight ladders of each primer by digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase. Because substrate 3.6 already has three nucleotides removed compared with substrate 2.9, the release of a monomer, dimer, etc. in lane 2 is equivalent to cleavage beyond the fourth, fifth, etc. nucleotide in lane 1. Removal of the original mismatch nine nucleotides into the substrate requires the release of a hexamer inlanes 2 and 3. The monomers, dimers, and tetramers released in lane 2 correspond to a second cut 3′ of the fourth, fifth, and seventh nucleotides of the original substrate 2.9. Even this second cut falls short of the goal of mismatch removal. However, the process has now placed the mismatch as little as two nucleotides from the 5′-end. The fact that cleavage did not reach the mismatch was surprising. In substrate 3.6, the mismatch is only six nucleotides from the 5′-end, a distance reached on substrate 2.9 (lane 1). One reason we failed to observe cleavage beyond the mismatch could be because of its distance from the 5′-end. Alternatively, failure to cleave beyond the mismatch may reflect the influence of specific sequences. In many sequence contexts, FEN1 requires an upstream primer for stimulation of cleavage (10Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

This reaction occurs at a catalytic site containing four manganese atoms and cycling among five oxidation states, the Sn states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. Biochemical and spectroscopic techniques have been used previously to conclude that aspartate 170 in the D1 subunit influences the structure and function of the PSII active site (Boerner, R. J., Nguyen, A. P., Barry, B. A., and Debus, R. J. (1992)Biochemistry 31, 6660–6672). Substitution of glutamate for aspartate 170 resulted in an assembled manganese cluster, which was capable of enzymatic turnover, but at lower steady-state oxygen evolution rates. Here, we obtained the difference (light-minus-dark) Fourier transform IR spectrum associated with the S2Q−-minus-S1Q transition by illumination of oxygen-evolving wild-type and DE170D1 PSII preparations at 200 K. These spectra are known to be dominated by contributions from carboxylic acid and carboxylate residues that are close to or ligating the manganese cluster. Substitution of glutamate for aspartate 170 results in alterations in the S2Q−-minus-S1Q spectrum; the alterations are consistent with a change in carboxylate coordination to manganese or calcium. In particular, the spectra are consistent with a shift from bridging/bidentate carboxylates in wild-type PSII to unidentate carboxylate ligation in DE170D1 PSII.

The catalytic site contains a tetranuclear manganese cluster, and the catalytic cycle of water oxidation has been proposed to consist of five oxidation states (Sn) called the Joliot-Kok S states. The subscript nrefers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored at the active site. Absorption of four photons and four corresponding charge separations are necessary to complete one catalytic cycle. Each cycle results in the oxidation of two water molecules to form one molecule of molecular oxygen and four protons. Calcium is required for oxygen evolution and may be bound in proximity to the manganese cluster (reviewed in Refs. 1Yocum C.F. Pecoraro V.L. Manganese Redox Enzymes.

The S1-to-S2 transition is associated with oxidation of manganese, probably from Mn3+ to Mn4+ (reviewed in Ref. 10Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Britt R.D. Klein M.P. Pecoraro V.L. Manganese Redox Enzymes.

A structural model for the manganese cluster in the S1state has been suggested; this model is based on x-ray absorption studies of the manganese cluster (reviewed in Ref. 10Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Britt R.D. Klein M.P. Pecoraro V.L. Manganese Redox Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992: 141-175Google Scholar). According to this model, the manganese cluster has been proposed to contain four manganese atoms arranged in two bis-μ-oxo-bridged dimers. These dimers are linked by two carboxylato bridges and one bis-μ-oxo bridge to form a C-shaped tetranuclear metal center. Because each manganese atom must be five- or six-coordinate (15Pecoraro V.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 249-264Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), amino acids must provide ligation to the metal atoms. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that some of these ligands are provided by aspartate and glutamate residues in the lumeral regions of the D1 and D2 polypeptides (reviewed in Ref.16Pakrasi H.B. Vermaas W.F.J. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 231-258Crossref Google Scholar). Chemical modification experiments support this conclusion (17Ghirardi M.L. Lutton T.W. Seibert M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (and references therein): 13559-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ligation by carboxylate groups would have the effect of stabilizing high oxidation states of the manganese ions (15Pecoraro V.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 249-264Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mutations have been made in carboxylate residues in the D1 polypeptide, with multiple substitutions generated at each site (for reviews, see Refs. 16Pakrasi H.B. Vermaas W.F.J. Barber J.

The effect of mutations on oxygen evolution activity, photoautotrophic growth, and the variable fluorescence yield was assessed. From this work, likely metal ligands have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 16Pakrasi H.B. Vermaas W.F.J. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology.

The most thoroughly characterized mutations in this group were those introduced at aspartate 170 of the D1 polypeptide (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Eleven different amino acids were substituted for aspartate 170. All mutations, except glutamate and histidine, abolished photoautotrophic growth (21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Most mutations resulted in dramatic decreases in oxygen evolution activity (21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), although residual low levels of oxygen evolution were detected in the DC170D1, DW170D1, DR170D1, DY170D1, and DM170D1 mutants (21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). PSII particles containing the DN170D1 mutation had no detectable activity and showed electron transfer kinetics that were consistent with the absence of a functional manganese cluster (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The manganese content of the DN170D1 mutant was reduced dramatically compared with manganese content in wild-type PSII (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an aspartate-to-glutamate mutation did not abolish oxygen evolution, but the mutation resulted in a 2–3-fold decrease in the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution activity (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic characterization showed that a functional manganese cluster was assembled in this mutant (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J.

Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The manganese content of the DE170D1 mutant was similar to the manganese content of wild-type PSII (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J.

Characterization of DE170D1 cells showed that oxygen evolution exhibited a period 4 oscillation with flash number; this oscillation was similar to the pattern observed in wild-type cells (21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The lifetime and oxidation kinetics of the S2 state were perturbed (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), giving a slightly more stable S2state in the mutant. From the studies described above (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it was concluded that aspartate 170 influences the assembly and/or activity of the active site (see also Ref. 17Ghirardi M.L. Lutton T.W. Seibert M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (and references therein): 13559-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which aspartate 170 exerts its influence on the PSII catalytic site, we have employed vibrational spectroscopy. Use of oxygen-evolving PSII particles from the DE170D1 mutant provides an opportunity to obtain information about the catalytic site in a perturbed but active form. We report here the difference FT-IR spectrum associated with the S1-to-S2 transition in wild-type PSII and in PSII isolated from the DE170D1 mutant. Our data provide evidence for shifts in carboxylate coordination of manganese or calcium when wild-type and DE170D1 PSII are compared. These spectra provide new information about the catalytic site of this enzyme. Chlorophyll and oxygen evolution assays were performed (22Barry B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spinach PSII complexes were isolated (23MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The steady oxygen evolution rates (22Barry B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) of this preparation were ≥1000 μmol of O2 (mg of chl-h)−1. Construction of a wild-type kanamycin-resistant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the DE170D1 mutant has been described (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial PSII particles were purified (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J.

Boerner R.J. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells had average oxygen rates of 480 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl-h)−1; DE170D1 mutant cells had average oxygen rates of 270 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl-h)−1. Wild-type PSII particles, employed for FT-IR experiments, exhibited rates of oxygen evolution of ∼2000 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl-h)−1, and DE170D1 PSII particles, employed for FT-IR studies, exhibited rates of ∼500 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl-h)−1. These steady-state oxygen evolution rates are in the range of values previously obtained (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the chlorophyll antenna sizes of the wild-type and DE170D1 PSII preparations are similar (20Boerner R.J. Nguyen A.P. Barry B.A. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31 (and references therein): 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine treatment of spinach and cyanobacterial PSII was performed (25Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1589-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For infrared and EPR spectroscopy, each sample contained 1 molar eq of potassium ferricyanide. The chlorophyll antenna sizes of spinach and cyanobacterial PSII, used to calculate the molarity from the measured chlorophyll concentration, have been reported (26Patzlaff J.S. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 60-SXR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT-B detector (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1997; 101 (and references therein): 6652-6660Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sample temperature was controlled to ±0.3 K with a High-Tran liquid nitrogen cryostat (R. G. Hansen & Associates, Santa Barbara, CA) and a temperature control unit (Model 9620, Scientific Instruments, West Palm Beach, FL). The temperature was continuously monitored during data acquisition. The liquid nitrogen cryostat was equipped with TnSe (see Fig. 1) or CaF2 windows (see Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Illumination was provided with a Dolan-Jenner fiber optic annular illuminator equipped with a red filter and a heat filter. Spectral resolution was 8 cm−1 in Fig. 1 and 4 cm−1 in Figs. 2, 3, and 5. A Happ-Genzel apodization function was used; two (Fig. 1) or three levels (Figs. 2, 3, and 5) of zero filling were employed; double-sided interferograms were collected; and the mirror velocity was 1.57 cm/s.Figure 2Light-minus-dark difference FT-IR spectra obtained from spinach PSII complexes. In A, the PSII preparation was oxygen-evolving; the temperature was 200 K; and the spectrum corresponds to S2QA−-minus-S1QA. In B, the PSII preparation was depleted of manganese with hydroxylamine and EDTA; the temperature was 200 K; and the spectrum corresponds to Chl+QA−-minus-ChlQA. In C, the PSII preparation was oxygen-evolving, but the temperature was 80 K, so the spectrum corresponds to Chl+QA−-minus-ChlQA. Finally, an oxygen-evolving PSII preparation was illuminated at 200 K, yielding an S2QA−-minus-S1QAspectrum as shown in A, and then this illuminated sample was incubated at 200 K for 1 h in the dark.

The resulting difference spectra were then averaged. The length of the scans was 5 min in Fig. 1 and 7.5 min in Figs. 2, 3, and 5. The absorbance of the amide I band at 1655 cm−1 was <0.9 absorbance units. Spectra were normalized to an amide II absorbance of 0.5 absorbance units. Such a normalization is equivalent to a correction for protein concentration and path length (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys.

Acta. 1998; 1366: 330-354Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with a temperature-controlled Wilmad flow-through Dewar inserts. A stream of cold nitrogen was used to maintain the EPR sample temperature at 80 K; the sample temperature was continuously monitored (22Barry B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PSII samples containing 1 eq of potassium ferricyanide were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and EPR spectra, corresponding to a dark scan, were recorded. PSII samples were then illuminated at 200 K with red- and heat-filtered light for 7.5 min and re-equilibrated in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra, corresponding to the light scan, were then recorded. Spectra were obtained with the following instrument settings: microwave frequency, 9.383 GHz; microwave power, 1 milliwatt; modulation amplitude, 3.2 G; and time constant, 1.3 s. Twelve scans of 83 s were recorded and averaged. EPR spectra were integrated and analyzed through the use of the program IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Our previous work has shown that the difference FT-IR spectrum, S2QA−-minus-S1QA, can be acquired by 7.5 min of continuous illumination at 200 K (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101 (and references therein): 6652-6660Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102 (and references therein): 4-8Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we present such S2QA−-minus-S1QAFT-IR spectra, and accompanying negative controls, obtained from spinach PSII complexes. To show that illumination for 7.5 min with red- and heat-filtered illumination has no deleterious effects on the sample, Fig. 1 presents an experiment conducted with shorter, 5-min illumination times. Fig. 1A presents the dark-minus-dark negative control experiment, which, as expected, gives a flat base line. The first light-minus-dark difference spectrum (Fig. 1B) was acquired with 5 min of illumination. These data are similar to difference spectra obtained with 7.5 min of illumination from spinach PSII (Fig. 2A). Illumination for an additional 5 min (Fig. 1C) generates a difference spectrum indistinguishable from data obtained during the first 5 min of illumination (Fig. 1B). The light-minus-light spectrum (Fig. 1D), which gives a flat base line, confirms that there are no accumulating, deleterious effects due to a 10-min illumination of the sample. The base lines shown are typical of base lines obtained for both spinach and cyanobacterial PSII samples. Because illumination of PSII complexes at this temperature is associated with the production of multiline and Fe2+QA− EPR signals (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101 (and references therein): 6652-6660Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the spectra shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. 2A were assigned to S2QA−-minus-S1QA. Positive features in the difference spectrum are due to S2QA−, and negative features are due to S1QA. This conclusion is verified by the 200 K difference spectrum shown in Fig. 2B, which was obtained from non-oxygen-evolving spinach PSII. In generating this spectrum, PSII samples treated with hydroxylamine and the metal chelator EDTA were employed. Hydroxylamine treatment of PSII, under these conditions, inactivates water oxidation and causes the release of bound manganese from the enzyme (14Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102 (and references therein): 4-8Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). EDTA treatment chelates remaining bound manganese (14Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102 (and references therein): 4-8Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the absence of manganese, Chl is the electron donor to P680+ (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When the data in Fig. 2B are compared with spectra obtained from oxygen-evolving PSII (Fig. 2A), intensity and amplitude changes are observed in the 1770 to 1700 cm−1 and 1500 to 1200 cm−1 regions. This result is consistent with the assignment of Fig. 2A to an S2QA−-minus-S1QAspectrum. Furthermore, Fig. 2B resembles the spectrum obtained through 80 K illumination of oxygen-evolving spinach PSII (Fig. 2C). At this temperature, oxidation of S1is blocked, and Chl is oxidized instead of the manganese cluster (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8114-8120Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also presents the result of a second illumination of PSII at 200 K. The sample was preilluminated, generating an S2QA−-minus-S1QAspectrum (as shown in Fig. 2A), and then the sample was incubated in the dark for 1 h at 200 K. Another round of data acquisition (i.e. dark scan, dark scan, light scan, light scan) generated the light-minus-dark difference spectrum shown in Fig. 2D. This spectrum, shown on the same scale as Fig. 2(A–C), has no well defined vibrational features. This result is consistent with the conclusions that a second, full charge separation cannot occur in this sample at 200 K and that there are no deleterious effects due to the use of continuous illumination. Our previous experiments, in which spectra were obtained as a function of illumination temperature, have led to the conclusion that the S2QA−-minus-S1QAspectra are dominated by contributions from the donor side (12Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (and references therein): 11927-11932Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Steenhuis J.J. Barry B.A. J. Phys.

Chem. 1998; 102 (and references therein): 4-8Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached on the basis of alterations in the electron donor, changes in the temperature of illumination, and manganese removal (see Fig. 2, for example). We have recently identified QA− and QA contributions to the spectrum through the use of isotopic labeling and confirmed that these vibrational lines are small in amplitude compared with the overall intensity of the spectrum. 3M.

To analyze the topology of the bradykinin B2 receptor, we raised site-directed antibodies to peptides corresponding to the loop regions and the amino and car- boxyl terminus of this receptor. We found that a segment with predicted intracellular orientation according to the rhodopsin model, the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II of the bradykinin B2 receptor, was accessible to site-directed antibodies on intact fibroblasts, A431 cells, or COS cells expressing human B2 receptors. Extracellular orientation of this loop was further confirmed by the substituted cysteine accessibility method which showed that exchange of cysteine 94 for serine on this loop by point mutagenesis suppressed the effect of thiol modification by a membrane impermeant maleimide. In addition, this segment seemed to be involved in B2 receptor activation, since (i) thiol modification of cysteine 94 partially suppressed B2receptor activation, and (ii) site-directed antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II were agonists. The agonistic activity of the antibodies was suppressed by the B2 antagonist HOE140 confirming the B2specificity of the antibody-generated signal. The extracellular orientation of the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II suggests a topology of the B2 receptor different from rhodopsin, consisting of five (instead of seven) transmembrane domains and two hydrophobic segments with both ends facing the extracellular side.

The seven hydrophobic segments of G-protein-coupled receptors are supposed to form seven transmembrane-spanning α-helices in analogy to the three- and two-dimensional crystal structures of bacteriorhodopsin (1Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin (2Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). For the β-adrenergic receptor and the vasopressin V2 receptor the rhodopsin-like topology has been confirmed by site-directed antibodies (3Wang H. Lipfert L. Malbon C.C. Bahout S. J. Biol.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane spanning stretches generally have a net positive charge on the cytoplasmic side and few arginine or lysine residues in extracellular domains (5von Heijne G.

Thus, for the bradykinin B2 receptor the seven transmembrane domain topology is in conflict with the “positive inside” rule (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined the orientation of this loop on the intact receptor. We chose an approach which did not alter the receptor's primary sequence since insertion of additional reporter sequences may disturb the correct orientation and/or membrane insertion of the protein (10Lacatena R.M.

To this end antibodies to a peptide corresponding to the connecting loop region between membrane domains I and II were raised.

Adherent COS cells on gelatin-coated (0.1% in phosphate-buffered saline) 12-well plates were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml, specific activity 17 Ci/mmol) for 12 h in inositol-free RPMI medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Prior to the experiment, cells were washed twice with incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.2) and stored for 5 min in incubation buffer with 10 mm LiCl. Then the cells were placed to 37 °C and the experiment was started by the addition of ligand or buffer as indicated. After 20 min total inositol phosphates were extracted (15Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For thiol modification, cells were preincubated with 100 μm of the membrane impermeant thiol-specific reagent stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature. Bradykinin- or antibody-induced changes in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i of adherent HF-15 or COS cells seeded on glass coverslips was determined on cells loaded with 2 μmfura-2/AM as described previously (16Quitterer U. Schröder C. Müller-Esterl W. Rehm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1992-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+]i are given as the the ratio between 340/380 nm. Production of domain-specific antisera to the putative intracellular domains of the bradykinin B2 receptor was performed as described previously (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides derived from the rat B2 receptor sequence (see Fig. 1A) were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl) or thet-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry. Peptides purified by high performance liquid chromatography were routinely analyzed by Edman degradation and electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptides were covalently coupled to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin by maleimidocaproyl N-hydroxysuccinimide (peptides I-II and III-IV,) or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (peptides V-VI and CTer) (Fig. 1A). Antisera to a peptide derived from the connecting loop between membrane domains III and IV and to the carboxyl terminus (CTer) have been described previously (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized with the conjugates, and the antisera were tested for cross-reactivity with the respective human or rat peptides by the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoselection of the antibodies was routinely performed as described (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride sheets using semidry blotting (17Kyhse-Anderson J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The blotting membrane was treated with 50 mm Tris, 0.2m NaCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A), containing 5% (w/v) of nonfat dry milk and 0.1% (w/v) of Tween 20 for 1 h. Antisera were diluted 1:1000 in buffer A containing 2% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin. After 30 min, the blotting membranes were washed five times for 15 min each with buffer A and incubated for another 30 min with peroxidase-labeled F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). After extensive washing, bound antibody was visualized with a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham). Enrichment of the B2 receptor from HF-15 cells was performed as described previously (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HF-15, A431, or COS cells (90% confluency) were detached by 0.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and washed twice with ice-cold RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 20 mmNa+-HEPES, pH 7.4 (incubation medium). Cells (1 × 106) were suspended in the incubation medium containing the immuno-selected antibodies (1 × 10−7m) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (diluted 1:80) was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 1 h on ice, washed, fixed by 2% (v/v) formaldehyde, and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using the LYSIS program. Confluent HF-15 cells, A431 cells, or transfected COS cells on 24-well plates were washed twice with incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mmNa+-HEPES, pH 7.2). Then 0.5 ml of incubation buffer was added to each well. Cells were incubated with 1 × 10−8m immuno-selected anti-I-II antibodies in the presence or absence of 1 × 10−5mbradykinin, kallidin, or HOE140. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 × 10−5m of the cognate peptide and was usually less than 5% of total binding. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with ice-cold incubation buffer and 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (specific activity 0.02 Ci/mg) were added. After another incubation step (1 h, 4 °C) and washing, cells were dissolved in 1% (w/v) NaOH and radioactivity was determined. Previous results with site-directed antibodies to the B2 receptor showed that the putatative extracellular B2 receptor regions according to the rhodopsin model were indeed accessible to site-directed antibodies on intact cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further analyze the topology of this receptor, we raised site-directed antibodies to the putative intracellular loop regions of the B2 receptor (Fig. 1A). Peptides corresponding to the respective receptor loops (Fig. 1A) were covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunization in rabbits. The anti-peptide antisera strongly reacted with their respective antigens as determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown). B2 receptor cross-reactivity was analyzed by immunoblotting using primary human fibroblasts or COS cells expressing native or recombinant B2 receptors, respectively. Similarly to previous results (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the site-directed antibodies to the connecting loops between membrane domains I-II, III-IV, V-VI, and to the carboxyl terminus (CTer) cross-reacted with B2 receptors of HF-15 cells and stained a protein of 69 ± 3 kDa of HF-15 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). The presence of the immunizing peptide (20 μm) extinguished the specific signal of the antibodies in Western blotting as exemplified for antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II (Fig. 1B, lane 5). As a positive control, the B2 receptor was visualized by affinity cross-linking of HOE140 to the B2 receptor and detected with anti-HOE140 antibodies (18Abd Alla S. Buschko J. Quitterer U. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Breipohl G. Knolle J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17277-17285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lane 6). To further control the B2 receptor specificity of the antisera, B2 receptors were recombinantly expressed in COS cells. The antisera also cross-reacted with B2 receptors recombinantly expressed in COS cells. As exemplified for antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II, the antibodies identified a protein of 60 ± 5 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 7). This finding is in agreement with previous results (13Abd Alla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27382-27387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There was no significant cross-reactivity with proteins of mock-transfected COS cells under the conditions applied, further confirming the B2 receptor specificity of the site-directed antibodies (Fig. 1B, lane 8). The cross-reactivity with a slowly migrating band in B2 receptor-transfected and in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8) may reflect low level expression of endogenous B2 receptors of COS cells as detected previously (15Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since the positive inside rule (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) predicted the extracellular orientation of the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II, we attempted to stain B2 receptors on intact cells with antibodies to this loop. To this end intact HF-15 cells which express high amounts of endogenous B2 receptors, were incubated with immuno-selected site-directed antibodies and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed. Antibodies to the connecting loop between transmembrane domains I-II bound to B2 receptors on intact cells as demonstrated by a 100-fold increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A, panel 1). A similar increase in fluorescence intensity was observed with antibodies to the extracellular domains of the receptor as exemplified for antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains II-III (Fig. 2A, panel 2). By contrast, site-directed antibodies to the residual putative intracellular loops of the B2receptor, i.e. the connecting loop between membrane domains III-IV, V-VI, and to the carboxyl terminus (CTer) failed to stain B2 receptors on intact cells (Fig. 2A, panels 3–5), although all the antisera cross-reacted with similar intensity with B2 receptors in Western blotting (cf. Fig. 1B). The staining of intact cells by anti-I-II antibodies was suppressed by the presence of 20 μm of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 2A, panel 6). Thus, the epitope recognized by the antibodies raised against the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II was accessible from the extracellular side, whereas the epitopes recognized by the antibodies raised against the connecting loops III-IV, V-VI, and the carboxyl terminus were not accessible on intact cells. We further analyzed the orientation of the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II on two different B2 receptor expressing cells: A431 cells and B2receptor-transfected COS cells (Fig. 2B). In addition to HF-15 cells, intact A431 cells were stained by antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II (Fig. 2B, panel 2) suggesting that the B2 receptor topology was similar on fibroblasts and on epithelial cells. Relative fluorescence intensity of A431 cells was increased only 10-fold above control compared with a 100-fold increase on HF-15 cells (Fig. 2B, panels 1 and 2). This finding may indicate that the amount of B2 receptors/cell of A431 cells is much lower than that of HF-15 cells, a conclusion which is in agreement with the 75-fold increased EC50 value for the bradykinin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i of A431 cells compared with HF-15 cells (6 × 10−9m for A431 and 0.08 × 10−9m for HF-15 cells) (not shown). The antibody staining was reduced to control levels on cells where B2 receptors had been internalized by pretreatment with 1 μm bradykinin at 37 °C (Fig. 2B, panels 1and 2) confirming that the site-directed antibodies stained B2 receptors on the surface of intact cells. On COS cells which were transfected by B2 receptors with a transfection efficiency of 30–40% as determined by β-galactosidase assay, fluorescence intensity of transfected cells increased 10-fold (Fig. 2B, panel 3). Again, pretreatment with 1 μmbradykinin suppressed the staining of the B2 receptor expressing COS cells by anti-I-II antibodies (Fig. 2B, panel 4). Together these experiments showed that the antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II specifically stained B2 receptors on transfected cells, and that the epitope(s) recognized by these antibodies is (are) similarly accessible from the extracellular side of cells expressing recombinant or native B2 receptors. Besides site-directed antibodies, cysteine modification by membrane impermeable thiol-modifying reagents is another means to determine the topology of polytopic membrane proteins (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1996; 17: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) without modifying the receptor's primary sequence. The connecting loop between membrane domains I-II of the B2 receptor contains two cysteines at position 88 and 94 (Fig. 1A). Cysteine modification often alters the function of membrane proteins (20Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1996; 17: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore we asked whether the B2 receptor contains a free thiol group on its surface which is important for receptor function. We treated intact COS cells expressing the wild-type rat B2receptor with the membrane-impermeant thiol-specific probe, stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and measured B2 receptor activation. In the presence of 100 μm stilbenedisulfonate maleimide, the bradykinin-induced increase of inositol phosphate levels was reduced by 30 ± 6% (Fig. 3A). The concentration of bradykinin necessary to produce half-maximal activation decreased from 1.4 ± 0.2 × 10−9m to 9 ± 3 × 10−9m in the presence of stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (Fig. 3A). These data suggest the importance of an extracellularly accessible cysteine(s) for B2 receptor activation. Most cysteines within the extracellular side of the B2 receptor are supposed to be linked in disulfide bridges (8McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore we next asked whether a cysteine(s) in the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II had been modified by stilbenedisulfonate maleimide. To this end three different B2 receptor mutants were created by point mutation of cysteine(s) to serine(s) at positions 88, 94, and 88/94. All three B2 receptor mutants were not different from the wild-type B2 receptor in their affinity for [3H]bradykinin (K D = 0.6 ± 0.2 × 10−9m) and their EC50values for the bradykinin-induced rise in inositol phosphate levels (1.5 ± 0.3 × 10−9m) determined after transient expression in COS cells. Next, the bradykinin-induced rise in inositol phosphate levels was determined in the absence or presence of stilbenedisulfonate maleimide. Similarly as on the wild-type B2 receptor expressing cells, stilbenedisulfonate maleimide decreased the bradykinin-induced rise in inositol phosphate levels on cells expressing the B2 receptor mutant where cysteine 88 was replaced by serine (Fig. 3B). By contrast, on cells expressing mutants B2–94Ser and B2–88/94Ser, stilbenedisulfonate maleimide did not significantly decrease inositol phosphate levels after bradykinin stimulation (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that cysteine 94 within the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II was accessible to thiol modification on intact cells, and modification of this cysteine suppressed B2 receptor activation (Fig. 3B). Thus, cysteine 94 of the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II is accessible to the membrane impermeant thiol modifying agent stilbenedisulfonate maleimide on intact cells. Similar results were obtained with 10 μm biotin maleimide (3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin), another membrane impermeant thiol modifying agent (not shown). These findings extend the data obtained with the site-directed antibodies: (i) the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II is accessible from the extracellular side and (ii) the extracellular orientation of this receptor loop seems to be involved in B2 receptor activation. To further analyze the potential involvement of the connecting loop I-II in B2 receptor activation, the effect of the anti-I-II antibodies on B2 receptor activation was determined. Immuno-selected anti-I-II antibodies (100 nm) activated B2 receptors of transfected COS cells and of HF-15 cells (Fig. 4, panels 1 and3) as determined by the transient rise in [Ca2+]i of fura-2 labeled cells. No significant signal was obtained with mock-transfected COS cells (Fig. 4,panel 2) under the conditions applied, or after application of unrelated antibodies (Fig. 4, panel 5). The signal was suppressed when the cells had been pretreated for 5 min with a 100-fold molar excess of the B2 antagonist HOE140 thereby confirming the B2 specificity of the signal (Fig. 4, panels 4 and 6). Thus, anti-I-II antibodies are capable to (partially) activate the B2 receptor and therefore are agonists. We previously demonstrated that antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains IV-V (Fig. 1A) also activated the B2receptor (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These antibodies were directed to the bradykinin-binding site (13Abd Alla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27382-27387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore we asked whether antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II (anti-I-II) also affected agonist or antagonist binding. The binding of 1 nm125I-labeled HPP-HOE140 or of [125I-Tyr0]bradykinin to HF-15 cells was not altered by the presence of 250 nm immuno-selected anti-I-II antibodies (not shown). Furthermore, the presence of the B2agonists bradykinin or kallidin did not reduce the binding of anti-I-II antibodies to adherent HF-15 cells, A431 cells, or B2receptor-transfected COS cells (Fig. 5) indicating that the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II is not involved in the binding of agonists to the B2 receptor. By contrast, the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of B2antagonists as demonstrated for HOE140, suppressed the binding of anti-I-II antibodies to HF-15, A431, or B2receptor-transfected COS cells (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with NPC 17773, another B2-specific antagonist (not shown). Topological modeling of G-protein-coupled receptors relies on the assumption that the seven hydrophobic segments form seven membrane-spanning α-helices according to the structures of rhodopsin (2Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) or bacteriorhodopsin (1Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Since this assumption was in conflict with the positive inside rule (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the connecting loop between membrane domains I-II of the bradykinin B2 receptor (8McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 9Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine the orientation of this loop. Two different approaches were applied: (i) accessibility to site-directed antibodies and (ii) the substituted cysteine accessibility method which combines thiol modification by a membrane impermeant thiol-specific reagent with point mutagenesis. With both methods we found that the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II of the B2 receptor faces the extracellular side. Since the B2 receptor's amino terminus, the connecting loop regions between membrane domains II-III, IV-V, and VI-VII were accessible to site-directed antibodies on intact cells (12Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the loop regions between membrane domains III-IV, V-VI, and the carboxyl terminus were not accessible on intact cells (cf. Fig. 2A), we suggest a topological model for the bradykinin receptor which is different from rhodopsin consisting of five membrane spanning and two re-entrant membrane segments (Fig. 1A). A receptor model with two re-entrant membrane segments is reminiscent of the glutamate GluR3 receptor model (22Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The initially proposed topology of this receptor consisting of four membrane-spanning segments had to be abandoned for a model consisting of three transmembrane domains and one re-entrant membrane segment (22Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 (23Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) revealed how a re-entrant membrane segment can anchor a protein to the membrane by monotopic insertion (24Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) into the membrane. This study gives strong evidence that the B2 receptor is the first G-protein-coupled receptor with a seven hydrophobic segment structure different from the well established rhodopsin topology. The extracellular localization of the connecting loop between transmembrane domains I and II is in accordance with the positive inside rule governing membrane protein topology (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of several other G-protein-coupled receptors also lack a net positive charge in the connecting loop between transmembrane domains I-II (25Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar, 26Raming K. Krieger J. Strotmann J. Boekhoff I. Kubick S. Baumstark C. Breer H. Nature. 1993; 361: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a distinct class of G-protein-coupled receptors with B2 receptor-like topology. The extracellular orientation of the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II of the B2 receptor seems to have functional consequences on B2 receptor activation. Thiol modification by a membrane-impermeant maleimide of cysteine 94 within the I-II region partially suppressed B2 receptor activation. In addition, antibodies to the connecting loop between membrane domains I and II were capable of activating the receptor. Thus, extracellular localization of the “intact” connecting loop I-II seems to be a prerequisite for B2 receptor activation. However, this region is not involved in forming the agonist-binding site, since we did not detect any effect of the anti-I-II antibodies on binding of the classical B2 agonists, bradykinin or kallidin to the B2 receptor. Chemical cross-linking studies (27Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20591-20598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (28Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Storman T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggest that the agonist- and antagonist-binding sites to the B2 receptor are not identical and may be only partially overlapping. When we tested the effect of a 1000-fold molar excess of the B2 antagonist HOE140 on the binding of anti-I-II antibodies to the B2receptor, we found that in contrast to B2 agonists, HOE140 almost completely suppressed antibody binding. However, the binding of iodine-labeled HOE140 was not affected by the presence of the antibodies. There are two possible explanations for these findings: either (i) the connecting loop I-II forms a contact site of HOE140 to the B2 receptor which is different from the agonist-binding site, or (ii) the B2 antagonist induces or stabilizes a receptor conformation which is not accessible for the anti-I-II antibodies. Future studies applying site-directed mutagenesis and/or ligand cross-linking will have to determine which of these two possibilities is true thereby shedding more light on the question of how the atypical topology of the B2 receptor may affect receptor functioning.

Here, we report the effects of zinc and copper ions on the endocytic and ligand binding activity of asialoglycoprotein receptors on isolated rat hepatocytes. Treatment of cells at 37 °C for 2 h with ZnCl2 (0–220 μm) or CuCl2 (0–225 μm) reversibly blocked sustained endocytosis of 125I-asialoorosomucoid by up to 93% (t 1/2 = 62 min) and 99% (t 1/2 = 54 min), respectively. Cells remained viable during such treatments. Zinc- and copper-treated cells lost ∼50% of their surface asialoglycoprotein receptor ligand binding activity; zinc-treated cells accumulated inactive asialoglycoprotein receptors intracellularly, whereas copper-treated cells accumulated inactive receptors on their surfaces. Cells treated at 4 °C with metal did not lose surface asialoglycoprotein receptor activity. Exposure of cells to copper ions, but not to zinc ions, blocked internalization of prebound 125I-asialoorosomucoid, but degradation of internalized ligand and pinocytosis of the fluid-phase marker Lucifer Yellow were not blocked by metal treatment. Zinc ions reduced diferric transferrin binding and endocytosis on hepatocytes by ∼33%; copper ions had no inhibitory effects. These findings are the first demonstration of a specific inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis by non-iron transition metals.

Cells treated at 4 °C with metal did not lose surface asialoglycoprotein receptor activity. Exposure of cells to copper ions, but not to zinc ions, blocked internalization of prebound 125I-asialoorosomucoid, but degradation of internalized ligand and pinocytosis of the fluid-phase marker Lucifer Yellow were not blocked by metal treatment. Zinc ions reduced diferric transferrin binding and endocytosis on hepatocytes by ∼33%; copper ions had no inhibitory effects. These findings are the first demonstration of a specific inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis by non-iron transition metals. Cells require transition metals for a variety of crucial cellular processes, but unregulated accumulation of these metals, such as iron and copper ions, promotes damage to membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (1Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 2Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). As a result, eukaryotic cells acquire nutrient metal ions by highly regulated mechanisms that also guard against overaccumulation of these metals, sequester metal ions when they are present in overabundance, and ameliorate the toxic effects of metals on cellular macromolecules (for reviews, see Refs. 3De Silva D.M.

We have been studying the hepatic metabolism of the iron-binding protein lactoferrin and have found that rat hepatocytes take up lactoferrin via the rat hepatic lectin (RHL) 1The abbreviations used are: RHL, rat hepatic lectin; ASGP, asialoglycoprotein; ASOR, asialoorosomucoid; BME, basal medium Eagle's; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline. 1 subunit of the ASGP receptor. Unlike other characterized ligands for the ASGP receptor, lactoferrin binds at or near RHL1's carbohydrate recognition domain, yet in a carbohydrate-independent manner (6Bennatt D.J. McAbee D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8359-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Bennatt D.J. Ling Y.Y. McAbee D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8367-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have also found that the iron status of hepatocytes alters the manner in which hepatocytes bind and internalize lactoferrin. Iron loading of hepatocytes by incubation of cells with ferric ammonium citrate increases lactoferrin binding and endocytosis. This iron ion-dependent increase in lactoferrin accumulation, however, is accomplished by non-RHL1 binding sites that are reversibly expressed on cells in an iron-dependent manner reminiscent of iron-dependent regulation of ferritin (8McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. Stich C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, the endocytic activity of the ASGP receptor is dramatically inhibited by hepatocyte iron loading (8McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. Stich C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, iron-replete hepatocytes accumulate up to half of their ASGP receptors in an inactive form, and these various effects correspond to the appearance of cystinyl-linked ASGP receptor RHL1 subunits (9McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. Stich C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings represent a heretofore-unrecognized relationship between the ASGP receptor system and the iron status of hepatocytes. Iron belongs to the borderline class of transition metals, which also includes Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ (10Mason A.Z. Jenkins K.D. Tessier A. Turner D.R. Metal Speciation and Bioavailability. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 479-608Google Scholar). In general, borderline transition metals interact readily with organic ligands and are required by cells in trace amounts to carry out structural, catalytic, or redox activities. Because iron ion treatment of hepatocytes promoted formation of disulfide-bonded oligomers of RHL1 (9McAbee D.D. Ling Y.Y. Stich C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we speculated that the iron-dependent inhibition of ASGP receptor function was related to the redox properties of iron ions. To address this matter, we initiated a study to examine the effects of other borderline transition metals (Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) with various redox capacities on ASGP receptor endocytic activity. Like iron ions, both manganese and copper ions can mediate intracellular redox reactions whereas zinc ions are not redox active. Here, we report that copper and zinc ions, but not manganese ions, dramatically block ASGP receptor-mediated endocytosis and receptor ligand binding activity. Moreover, zinc, but not copper, partially blocked internalization of transferrin by hepatocytes, but neither metal blocked intracellular processing of internalized ligand nor pinocytosis. Our findings are the first demonstration of a specific inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis by non-iron transition metals. Human orosomucoid, human holotransferrin, neuraminidase (Clostridium perfringens), Lucifer Yellow (dipotassium salt), and BSA (fraction V) were purchased from Sigma. IODOGEN, IgG purification kit, and BCA protein assay reagent were obtained from Pierce). Collagenase (type D) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Digitonin was obtained from Eastman Kodak. Na125I (17 Ci/mg of iodine) was from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from Fisher Biochemicals (Itasca, IL or Tustin, CA) or Sigma. BME was obtained from Sigma and supplemented with 2.4 g/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.22 g/liter NaHCO3. BME-BSA is BME containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. HBS contains 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Buffer A contained HBS supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2. Buffer B contains HBS supplemented with 5 mm EGTA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–350 g, Harlan Sprague, San Diego, CA) were fed standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. The copper and zinc content of the chow (Purina Rodent Laboratory Chow, formula 5001) were 13 and 70 ppm, respectively, as assayed by the manufacturer. Hepatocytes were prepared by a modification of a collagenase perfusion procedure (11Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) as described previously (12McAbee D.D. Esbensen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23624-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were kept at approximately 30 °C during the filtration and differential centrifugation steps. Final cell pellets suspended in ice-cold BME-BSA were ≥85% viable and single cells. Before experiments, cell suspensions (2–4 × 106 cells/ml in BME-BSA, 10% of the flask volume) were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to allow recovery from the isolation procedure. Cell viability was determined microscopically by trypan blue exclusion. For some experiments, isolated hepatocytes were plated on unmodified tissue culture plates at a density of ∼1000 cells/mm2 in William's E medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.48 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μmdexamethasone, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight prior to use. Human holotransferrin and human orosomucoid (α1-acid glycoprotein) were obtained commercially. Human orosomucoid was desialylated with neuraminidase as described previously (13Schachter H. Jabbal I. Hudgin R.L. Pinteric L. McGuire E.J. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1090-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and removal of terminalN-acetylneuraminyl groups was confirmed by lectin blotting of neuraminidase-treated orosomucoid with Sambucus nigraagglutinin-digoxigenin conjugate (DIG glycan differentiation kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as reported elsewhere (7Bennatt D.J. Ling Y.Y. McAbee D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8367-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).125I-Transferrin and 125I-ASOR, prepared by the IODOGEN method (14Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar), had specific activities of 90–130 dpm/fmol. Homogeneity and structural integrity of 125I-transferrin and 125I-ASOR were confirmed by denaturing electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. For 125I-ASOR binding assays, 2–4 × 106 cells/ml were routinely incubated with125I-ASOR (1–2 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min in either BME-BSA or Buffer A. Cells incubated with 125I-ASOR were washed free of unbound ligand by centrifugation in excess Buffer A (two 5-min washes, 4 °C). Washed cells were resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of Buffer A, transferred to clean plastic tubes, and assayed for radioactivity and protein. In some cases, hepatocytes were permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin prior to addition of125I-ASOR in order to measure the surface and intracellular pools of receptor activity on cells (15Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To measure hepatocyte endocytosis of 125I-ASOR, cells in BME-BSA were incubated with 125I-ASOR at 37 °C for 45–60 min. Uptake was stopped rapidly by diluting the cells into a 5–10-fold excess volume of ice-cold Buffer A. To assay total cell-associated (surface and intracellular) 125I-ASOR, cells were washed by centrifugation twice in 2–4 ml of cold Buffer A. To assay internalized125I-ASOR only, cells were washed by centrifugation twice, 5 min each wash, in 2–4 ml of Buffer B at 4 °C; EGTA present in Buffer B chelates Ca2+ required for ASOR binding to ASGP receptors, thereby dissociating cell surface receptor-ligand complexes. After washing, cells were resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of Buffer A, transferred to clean plastic tubes, and assayed for radioactivity and protein. In some experiments, we determined the extent of125I-ligand degradation by cells by measuring the amount of acid-soluble radioactivity released into conditioned medium at 37 °C, as reported previously (16McAbee D.D. Nowatzke W. Oehler C. Sitaram M. Sbaschnig E. Opferman J.T. Carr J. Esbensen K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13749-13760Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium from cells incubated with 125I-ASOR were collected and clarified by centrifugation (400 × g, 2 min, 4 °C).125I-Polypeptides in the conditioned media were precipitated by the addition of two volumes of cold 10% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid in 2 n HCl. After incubation for 15 min on ice, precipitated material was sedimented (4 °C, 4 min, 1000 × g); acid-precipitated pellets and acid-soluble supernatants were assayed for radioactivity. Anti-RHL1 sera were generated and analyzed as described elsewhere (6Bennatt D.J. McAbee D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8359-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Bennatt D.J. Ling Y.Y. McAbee D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8367-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The whole Ig fraction from sera (immune and nonimmune) was isolated by chromatography on Protein A-agarose (Pierce) and iodinated with Na125I (14Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) to a final specific activity of 70–110 dpm/fmol. Hepatocytes in BME-BSA were incubated with or without CuCl2 (75 μm) or ZnCl2(225 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C, then chilled on ice. The cells were washed free of metals by centrifugation in cold excess BME, then incubated with 125I-anti-RHL1 Ig or125I-Ig (nonimmune) for 90 min at 4 °C with or without a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled anti-RHL1 Ig or nonimmune Ig. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with excess cold Buffer A, then assayed for cell-associated radioactivity. Control, CuCl2-treated, and ZnCl2-treated hepatocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of metals with BME-BSA supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Lucifer Yellow for up to 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were chilled on ice, washed twice with excess cold BME-BSA, 10 min/wash, then solubilized at 4 °C for 20 min in 0.05% Triton X-100 containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Insoluble debris was sedimented by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were assayed for Lucifer Yellow fluorescence (excitation at 430 nm, emission at 540 nm) using a Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon Spex, Instruments S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ). Adult rat hepatocytes were plated on unmodified tissue culture plates and incubated overnight as described above. Prior to experiments, cells were incubated in BME-BSA (no serum present) with or without CuCl2 or ZnCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. To determine surface binding of 125I-transferrin by hepatocytes, cells were chilled on ice and incubated 2 h with125I-transferrin (2 μg/ml) in BME at 4 °C. The radioactive mixture was removed, and the cells were rinsed four times with cold Buffer A. The cell-bound radioactivity was solubilized by incubating the cells in 2 ml of Buffer A containing 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 2 h. Detergent-released125I-radioactivity was transferred to clean tubes and assayed by γ spectroscopy. To determine 125I-transferrin endocytosis by hepatocytes, cells in BME-BSA were supplemented with125I-transferrin (2 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, after which the cells were chilled on ice. Radioactive media were removed, and the cells were assayed for total bound125I-transferrin as described above. To determine the amount of internal 125I-transferrin, rinsed cells at 4 °C were stripped of surface-bound 125I-transferrin by a 30-s exposure to 0.25 m acetic acid, 0.5 mNaCl, after which an equal volume of ice-cold 0.5 mNa2HPO4 was added to bring the pH to 7.5. Acid-released radioactivity was aspirated off the cells, and the cells were rinsed an additional three times with cold Buffer A. Acid-resistant radioactivity, deemed intracellular, was assayed following Triton X-100 solubilization as described above. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay procedure using BSA as standard (Pierce). Centrifugation of cell suspensions was at 400 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C using a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge equipped with a GH-3.8 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). 125I radioactivity was determined using a Packard Cobra Auto-Gamma counting system (model 5002; Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL). Spectroscopic measurements were done using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). In the first series of experiments, we examined the effects of MnCl2, ZnCl2, or CuCl2on sustained endocytosis (binding and internalization) of125I-ASOR by hepatocytes. Cells exposed to MnCl2 (0–220 μm) exhibited no alteration in sustained endocytosis of 125I-ASOR (data not shown). In contrast, continuous internalization of 125I-ASOR by cells incubated with 0–220 μm ZnCl2 (Fig. 1A) or 0–225 μmCuCl2 (Fig. 1B) diminished up to at least 94%. Half-maximal inhibition of endocytosis (Fig. 1B,inset) was observed at 39 μm CuCl2and 53 μm ZnCl2 although significant inhibition exerted by ZnCl2 occurred only at concentrations >20 μm. Inhibition of continuous 125I-ASOR endocytosis by ZnCl2 (220 μm) or CuCl2 (75 μm) was time-dependent (Fig. 2). The first-order half-time rates for loss of 125I-ASOR internalization were 62 min for zinc ions and 54 min for copper ions (Fig. 2, A and B,insets). Overall, the loss of 125I-ASOR binding and uptake followed similar dose-response curves (Fig. 1) and kinetics (Fig. 2). Regardless of the treatment, cell viability was not altered, as determined by trypan blue exclusion by control and metal-treated cells (data not shown). We also found that the effects of copper and zinc ions on continuous uptake of 125I-ASOR were additive (Fig. 3). Binding and internalization of125I-ASOR were more greatly inhibited when cells were treated with a combination of ZnCl2 (220 μm) and CuCl2 (75 μm) (91% and 95% for zinc and copper, respectively) than when treated with either metal alone. We also found that the effects of zinc and copper ions on ASOR endocytosis were not ameliorated by co-incubation with the general reductant ascorbate (Table I). Notably, ascorbate (0.1 mm) enhanced the copper-dependent inhibition of ASOR binding and internalization compared with cells treated with copper ions alone.Figure 2Kinetics of endocytosis inhibition.Hepatocytes (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in BME-BSA with and without 225 μm ZnCl2(A) or 75 μm CuCl2 (B) for the indicated times at 37 °C.

Cells were chilled at 4 °C, washed twice in BME-BSA to remove excess metal, then prebound with125I-ASOR at 4 °C for 1 h. After cells were washed free of unbound 125I-ASOR, cells were resuspended in fresh BME-BSA with or without ZnCl2, CuCl2, or ascorbate (similar to that during the original 2-h incubation) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min.

Open table in a new tab Hepatocytes (2 × 106 cells/ml) in BME-BSA were incubated with or without the designated amounts of ZnCl2, CuCl2, or ascorbate for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were chilled at 4 °C, washed twice in BME-BSA to remove excess metal, then prebound with125I-ASOR at 4 °C for 1 h. After cells were washed free of unbound 125I-ASOR, cells were resuspended in fresh BME-BSA with or without ZnCl2, CuCl2, or ascorbate (similar to that during the original 2-h incubation) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min.

Values as a function of a percentage of untreated control cells are included in parentheses. The inhibition of ASGP receptor-dependent endocytosis by metal treatment was reversible. Cells treated with ZnCl2 or CuCl2 exhibited >60% loss in total (surface and intracellular) bound (Fig. 4A) and internalized (Fig. 4B) 125I-ASOR. When cells were washed free of metals and incubated in the absence of exogenous zinc and copper ions, they recovered their ability to bind and take up125I-ASOR. These results indicate that the metal-sensitive sites required for endocytosis were either not irreversibly blocked by metal treatment or were readily replaced following de novosynthesis. In either case, these data support the conclusion that the block in endocytosis was not due to a loss of cell viability. In each of the preceding experiments, zinc- or copper-treated hepatocytes were examined for their ability to take up125I-ASOR continuously during a 1-h assay period following a 2-h metal treatment period. As a result, inhibition of continuous endocytosis could reflect a block in one or more events including internalization of receptor-ligand complexes at the cell surface, intracellular processing of receptor-ligand complexes, or recycling of ASGP receptors. To determine if zinc or copper ions blocked internalization of receptor-ligand complexes at the cell surface, we examined the ability of metal-treated hepatocytes to internalize125I-ASOR prebound on the cell surface (Fig. 5). We found that the amount of125I-ASOR bound to the cells following zinc and copper treatment was reduced by 56% and 35%, respectively, reflecting a loss in the number of active ASGP receptors on the surfaces of metal-treated cells. Zinc-treated cells internalized progressively less125I-ASOR as a function of ZnCl2 concentration but the percentage of bound 125I-ASOR that was internalized remained the same (∼30%) regardless of the ZnCl2concentration (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the percentage of prebound 125I-ASOR internalized by cells was reduced from 33% on control cells to <8% on cells treated with 75 μm CuCl2 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that, although both metals reduced the number of active surface ASGP receptors, copper ions, but not zinc ions, blocked the ability of cells to internalize receptor-ligand complexes at the cell surface. These data also suggest that at least some of the sites sensitive to these two metals are different. The previous experiments (Fig. 5, Table I) showed that copper- and zinc-treated hepatocytes reduced the number of active ASGP receptors on their surfaces. To address this issue more directly, we examined the ligand binding activity of surface and intracellular populations of ASGP receptors on metal-treated hepatocytes. Surface ASGP receptor activity was assayed on intact cells, whereas both surface and intracellular ASGP receptor activity was assayed on digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes (15Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17McAbee D.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1942-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with ZnCl2 or CuCl2 reduced surface binding of125I-ASOR by up to 44% (Fig. 6A) and 48% (Fig. 6B), respectively. Permeable metal-treated cells also bound progressively less 125I-ASOR than did nontreated control cells. Notably, the absolute molar reduction of 125I-ASOR binding to permeable cells was similar to that observed for intact cells, such that the calculated number of active intracellular ASGP receptors was not altered by metal treatment (Fig. 6, A andB, closed circles). Thus, both copper and zinc ions induced a loss of surface ASGP receptor activity with no net change in the amount of intracellular receptor activity. The loss of receptor-ligand binding activity observed in the previous experiment does not necessarily reflect the loss of receptor protein from the cell surface. Thus, we examined the surfaces of metal-treated cells for the presence of immunodetectable ASGP receptor protein by assaying their ability to bind 125I-anti-RHL1 Ig. As expected, CuCl2 (75 μm) and ZnCl2(225 μm) reduced 125I-ASOR bound to cells by 40% and 70%, respectively (Fig. 6C). Accordingly, zinc-treated cells bound ∼50% less 125I-anti-RHL1 Ig than did control cells indicating that RHL1 protein was lost from the cell surface. In contrast, copper-treated cells exhibited no loss of125I-anti-RHL1 Ig binding (Fig. 6D). Treatment of cells with zinc or copper ions at 4 °C either before or during the 125I-anti-RHL1 Ig binding assay did not alter125I-anti-RHL1 Ig binding to the cells, 2D. D. McAbee and X. Jiang, unpublished observations. indicating that copper and zinc ions per se did not interfere with antibody binding to the receptor. Taken together, these data indicate that copper-treated cells accumulated inactive ASGP receptors at the cell surface with no significant change in the distribution of RHL1 subunits between the cell surface and cell interior. Because zinc ion-treated cells lost surface ASGP receptor activity and protein without an increase in intracellular ASGP receptor activity (Fig. 6A), we conclude that zinc-treated cells accumulated inactive ASGP receptors intracellularly. In other experiments, we found that the metal-induced reduction of surface ASGP receptor activity was temperature-dependent. Cells treated with various concentrations of zinc or copper ions at 4 °C showed no loss of surface binding of 125I-ASOR (Fig. 7A) compared with cells pretreated at 37 °C with either CuCl2 or ZnCl2 alone or in combination (Fig. 7B). These data indicated that metal-induced losses of surface receptor activity results from perturbations in one or more cellular processes rather than direct interference of metals on the ability of ASGP receptors to bind ligand per se. Notably, significant metal-dependent reductions of surface 125I-ASOR binding were evident only when cells were exposed to metal ions at or above 22 °C (Fig. 7C), and 125I-ASOR binding was actually higher on samples treated with different levels of CuCl2 than on control cells. In other experiments, we found that the ASGP receptor binding of ASOR was partially reduced for zinc-treated 125I-ASOR (TableII). When cells were incubated with125I-ASOR and zinc or copper ions simultaneously at 4 °C, binding of 125I-ASOR was the same as control cells. If, however, 125I-ASOR was mixed with ZnCl2 at 22 °C for 1 h prior to addition to untreated hepatocytes at 4 °C, cells bound 28% less125I-ASOR compared with non-pretreated125I-ASOR (Table II).

The inhibitory effects of zinc ions on125I-ASOR were reversed if zinc-treated125I-ASOR was dialyzed free of zinc ions prior to addition to hepatocytes. These data suggest that zinc ions bind reversibly to ASOR, possibly in a temperature-dependent manner, and reduce at least partially its ability to bind ASGP receptors.Table IIEffect of Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ on ASGP receptor ligand-binding activityExperimentTreatment125I-ASOR boundCells125I-ASORfmol/sample % control1NoneNone274 ± 11 (100)Z"
https://openalex.org/W2058215272,"The contact of natural killer (NK) cells with foreign cells and with certain virus-infected or tumor cells triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells. This triggering leads to exocytosis of the cytotoxic NK cell granules. The oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are not well understood. In a model where foreign cells (rat fibroblasts) were cocultured with human IL-2 activated NK cells, we observed that NK cells were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene c-Myc or E1A. Both the parental and the oncogene expressing fibroblasts similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells, demonstrating that NK cells were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts. The cell death was independent of wild-type p53 and was not inhibited by an anti-apoptotic protein EIB19K. These results provided evidence that c-Myc and E1A activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction. In consistence, the c-Myc and E1A overexpressing fibroblasts were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than parental cells. The data indicate that oncogenes activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules. This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of NK cells towards the virus-infected and cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111395849,"The most profound scientific revolutions are those that provide an entirely new way of viewing and studying a field. These are the ones that provoke new questions and question old answers and in the end give us a new understanding of what we thought we understood. Often, they are occasioned by the invention of novel instruments or techniques; the telescope, the microscope, and x-ray diffraction come to mind. It may be that such a revolution is occurring in biochemistry today through the development of methods that allow us to investigate the dynamics of single macromolecules in real time. For the entire history of our science, we (like all chemists) have had to be content to study the average behavior of enormous assemblages of molecules. Much has been learned in this way, and we have been assured by statistical mechanicians that it was meaningful; by following the ensemble-average of a very large number of particles, we could learn the time-average behavior of a typical particle. However, it has always been obvious that if we could watchone molecule go through a chemical or physical process, or interact with another molecule, we might observe nuances and complexities of behavior that are simply smoothed out and lost in the average behavior of the mass. Until very recently, it was impossible to observe the dynamics of individual molecules, even macromolecules. To be sure, we have been able for decades to visualize macromolecules (via electron microscopy or x-ray diffraction, for example) but only in a static state. No techniques existed that would allow us to study the actions and interactions of individual protein or nucleic acid molecules in solution. In the past decade a series of new methods has emerged (scanning microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and optical tweezers, to name a few) that allow us to not only observe and follow the behavior of individual macromolecules in an aqueous environment but in some cases to manipulate them as well. This field of single-molecule biochemistry is in its infancy, but the things that can already be accomplished are quite amazing. We can watch a polymerase move along a template and observe directly details of its motion that could only be guessed at from macroscopic studies. We can measure the force generated by an individual molecular motor, under varying load and varying constraints, and measure the displacement corresponding to one ATP expenditure. We can measure the force of interaction between two macromolecules as they are allowed to approach one another along defined trajectories. We can watch an individual enzyme molecule in action and monitor its conformational changes as it accepts substrate and releases product. Even at this early stage, it seems that the information obtainable from single-molecule studies will yield results not anticipated on the basis of ensemble-averaged methods. For example, it appears that the interactions between enzymes and their substrates may be much more complex than we would have expected from macroscopic kinetic studies. Individual protein molecules appear to undergo conformational fluctuations that modify their ability, at any instant, to bind or process substrate molecules. Furthermore, there is evidence for unexpected “memory” effects in reactions involving biological macromolecules. We should be prepared for many surprises. The following series of minireviews is intended to provide a sampling of current experimentation using single-molecule techniques and the application of these methods to a range of biochemical problems. The series begins with an overview, by Amit Mehta, Matthias Rief, and James A. Spudich, of studies of motor proteins by these techniques. This is appropriate, for it is in this field that some of the earliest single-molecule studies were carried out and where the techniques have been developed to a high level of sophistication. We then turn to studies of one-dimensional diffusion on DNA in a paper by Nobuo Shimamoto. Here a very simple technique is used to raise fundamental questions about processes at the molecular level. The third paper, by X. Sunney Xie and H. Peter Lu, will extend the focus to enzymology, with some surprising results. Finally, the series will conclude with a paper, by Carlos Bustamante, Martin Guthold, Xingshu Zhu, and Guoliang Yang, describing how different possible modes of protein motion on DNA can be analyzed and distinguished using scanning force microscopy. The reader will find that the scope of some of these reviews is rather narrow; this is because these areas are so new that few investigators are yet working in each. Furthermore, the series is not intended to be inclusive or even fully representative. Rather, it is my hope that these short papers, by illustrating the kinds of things that can be done, will inspire the application of these methods to other problems. The technology involved is neither terribly difficult nor unreasonably expensive, and the range of possibilities seems limited only by the ingenuity of its practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W2142006840,"Intramolecular aromatic interactions in aqueous solution often lead to stacked conformation for model organic molecules. This designing principle was used to develop stacked and folded uridine nucleotide analogs that showed highly quenched fluoroscence in aqueous solution by attaching the fluorophore 1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate (AmNS) to the terminal phosphate via a phosphoramidate bond. Severalfold enhancement of fluorescence could be observed by destacking the molecules in organic solvents, such as isopropanol and dimethylsulfoxide or by enzymatic cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond. Stacking and destacking were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>-H NMR spectroscopy. The extent of quenching of the uridine derivatives correlated very well with the extent of stacking. Taking 5-H as the monitor, temperature-variable NMR studies demonstrated the presence of a rapid interconversionary equilibrium between the stacked and open forms for uridine-5′-diphosphoro-β-1-(5-sulfonic acid) naphthylamidate (UDPAmNS) in aqueous solution. ΔH was calculated to be −2.3 Kcal/mol, with 43–50% of the population in stacked conformation. Fluorescence lifetime for UDPAmNS in water was determined to be 2.5 ns as against 11 ns in dimethyl sulfoxide or 15 ns for the pyrophosphate adduct of AmNS in water. Such a greatly reduced lifetime for UDPAmNS in water suggests collisional interaction between the pyrimidine and thefluorophore moieties to be responsible for quenching. The potential usefulness of such stacked and quenched nucleotide fluorophores as probes for protein-ligand interaction studies has been briefly discussed."

In parallel, a series of growth inhibitory mechanisms critically restrict cell population sizes.

Here, we characterize a small, heat-stable growth inhibitor secreted by a rat T lymphoma line when cultured at high cell density.

These extracellular regulators influence a series of positive and negative intracellular signaling pathways that translate into a net cellular response. Several mechanisms for growth suppression coexist in normal cells.

Although some of these physiological mechanisms may become dysfunctional and thus contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression, many remain operative in transformed cells.

We now demonstrate that short term incubation of Nb2 cells at high cell density selectively blocked PRL stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK and transcription factors Stat1 and Stat3 but did not affect PRL activation of Stat5 or Jak2 tyrosine kinase. This response to cell crowding was reversible and was mimicked at low cell density by short term exposure to conditioned high density medium, staurosporine or genistein. A low molecular weight, heat-stable, and proteinase K-resistant factor with these characteristics was recovered from conditioned high density medium. Of particular importance, the partially purified factor also inhibited cell growth in a saturable dose-dependent fashion, suggesting operation through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Ovine PRL (NIDDK-oPRL-19, AFP-9221A) was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, the NICHD, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Polyclonal rabbit antisera specific to peptides corresponding to the unique COOH termini of Stat1α, Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat5b were generated as described previously (17Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G.

Each antiserum was useful for detection of rat Stat proteins by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and polyclonal rabbit antiserum to Jak2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog numbers 05-321 and 06-255, respectively). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to active MAPK were purchased from Promega (catalog number V667A). The Nb2 cell line (7Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar) was originally developed by Dr. Peter Gout (Vancouver, Canada), the Nb2-SP clone used in this study was generously provided by Dr. Henry Friesen (Manitoba, Canada). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, catalog number 15-040-LM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen, catalog number 1020-90), 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Before use in PRL stimulation experiments, Nb2 cells at a density of 1–1.5 × 106/ml were incubated for 20–24 h in PRL/lactogen-free medium consisting of RPMI 1640, which instead of 10% fetal calf serum contained 1% gelded horse serum (Sigma, catalog number H-1895), hereafter referred to as starvation medium. At the beginning of each experiment, cells were concentrated to the desired density and incubated for the various periods as indicated in the presence or absence of 100 nm ovine PRL during the final 15 min. Cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Frozen pellets from 1 × 108 Nb2 cells were thawed on ice and solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 60 min, and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Depending on the experiment, clarified lysates were incubated rotating end over end for 3 h at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit antisera (3 μl/ml) to individual Jak2 and Stat proteins as specified. Antibodies were captured by incubation for 60 min with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog number 17-0780-01), and proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (17Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol.

Nb2 cells that had been cultured in PRL-free starvation medium for 20–24 h at a density of 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml were brought to a high cell density of 4.0 × 108 cells/ml and incubated for 1 h in the same culture medium at 37 °C. The cells were discarded after centrifugation at 3,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the conditioned medium was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and used fresh unless indicated otherwise. For some experiments, conditioned HDM was boiled for 10 min, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min with subsequent clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated proteins. For dialysis experiments, dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa (Schleicher & Schuell, catalog number 25310) were used, and the dialysis medium was either 100 volumes of starvation medium for removal of low molecular weight material or four volumes of water for recovery of the low molecular weight fraction. Nb2 cells were dispensed into 96-well microtiter plates at 1 × 105 cells/100 μl and exposed for 48 h to either control medium or conditioned HDM in some experiments or in dose-response experiments to various dilutions of the reconstituted low molecular weight material derived from boiled and clarified HDM. The number of viable cells were measured metabolically by the Promega cell proliferation assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (25DaSilva L. Howard O.M.Z. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Colorimetric analysis was performed using a semiautomatic plate reader from Dynatech Laboratories (MR 600) at absorbance 590 nm. To examine the effect of cell crowding on PRL-induced signal transduction, Nb2 cells were incubated at increasing concentrations (range 0.25–4.0 × 108 cells/ml) for 45 min, with or without prolactin (100 nm) added during the final 15 min. Cells were maintained in suspension by manual agitation every 5 min during the entire incubation period. PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 was subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from detergent cell lysates. Parallel samples of whole cell lysates were also immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies to detect activated ERK1 and ERK2. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-phospho-specific MAPK antibodies showed that PRL-inducible activation of Stat1, Stat3, and ERK1/2 was significantly inhibited by increasing cell density, particularly at 2–4 × 108cells/ml (Fig. 1, lanes g–j,panels 3, 5, and 7 as numbered from the top). In contrast, PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and Stat5 remained unaffected by cell density (Fig. 1, lanes a and b versus i and j, panels 1 and 9). In parallel, basal levels of ERK1/2 activation were also significantly suppressed under high cell density conditions (Fig. 1). Reblotting of the same or duplicate samples for protein levels did not reveal any systematic changes in protein levels during the 45-min experiment period that could explain the marked reductions in signals by either Stat1, Stat3, or MAPK. Previously, we had established by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that PRL-activated Stat5 and Stat1 from Nb2 cells form distinguishable complexes with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the rat β-casein promoter, whereas PRL-activated Stat3 does not bind to this DNA sequence (17Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol.

Parallel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses of Stat1 and Stat5 binding to this β-casein promoter probe showed a corresponding selective inhibition by cell crowding of PRL-inducible Stat1 activation. 2H. Yamashita, J. Xu, and H. Rui, unpublished data. Having demonstrated that a selective uncoupling of certain PRL-induced signals occurred at high cell density, we examined how rapidly this inhibition of PRL-inducible Stat1 and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred, and whether the inhibitory effect could be reversed by dilution of the cells. Incubation of cells at high density (4.0 × 108cells/ml) for varying times up to 75 min, with or without PRL added during the final 15 min of each period, showed that whereas PRL-inducible Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation was unaffected by cell crowding over the entire period, PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat1 and Stat3 was significantly inhibited after 30 min and completely after 75 min (Fig. 2A). We also investigated whether this inhibition of discrete PRL signals was reversible upon dilution of cells. Nb2 cells were preincubated at high density (4.0 × 108 cells/ml) for 30 min, followed by either continued incubation at high cell density or dilution to low cell density (0.5 × 108 cells/ml) for 15 min in the presence or absence of PRL. Parallel control cells were also incubated at low cell density for the entire 45-min period with or without PRL during the final 15 min (Fig. 2B, lanes a and b). PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 and ERK1/2 activation, but not Jak2 and Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation, was significantly inhibited as observed previously when incubated at high density for 45 min (Fig. 2B,panels 1–5, lanes a–d). However, this selective inhibition of PRL-inducible Stat1, Stat3, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was completely reversed by dilution for 15 min to low density after preincubation for 30 min at high cell density (Fig. 2B,panels 2–4, lanes e and f). Reblotting of samples for protein expression levels were consistent with the previous data shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating that density-induced inhibition of Stat1, Stat3, and ERK1/2 signals could not be explained by systematic reductions in protein levels (data not shown). Based on these experiments, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of cell crowding on discrete PRL signals was rapid and reversible. Because of the rapid reversal of signal suppression upon dilution to low cell density, and the short time at high cell density needed for establishing the inhibitory effect, we favored a direct mechanism that exclusively involved cell-cell contact. However, it remained possible that the effect of cell crowding also included the release of a soluble suppressor substance. To directly test whether a soluble mediator could account for the observed effects, we analyzed the effect of conditioned HDM on PRL signals in cells incubated at low density (0.5 × 108 cells/ml). HDM was generated by incubating parallel cultures of Nb2 cells at high density (4.0 × 108 cells/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C followed by removal of cells by centrifugation. Contrary to our expectation, short term incubation of cells at low cell density in freshly generated HDM also led to selective suppression of PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and not of PRL-inducible Jak2 activation (Fig. 3A, lanes a–f). These observations suggested that a soluble factor was indeed present in freshly generated HDM that could mediate the suppression caused by cell crowding and showed that increased cell-cell contact per se was not required to achieve the inhibitory effect. Furthermore, these experiments showed that the soluble inhibitory activity was stable, because the activity persisted in HDM that had been stored for 24 h at 4 °C (Fig. 3A, lanes g andh) and in HDM that had been boiled for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min (Fig. 3A, lanes i and j). On the other hand, the soluble inhibitory activity was lost upon dialysis of boiled and clarified HDM against 100 volumes of starvation medium at 4 °C for 12 h using a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes k and l). Collectively, these results indicated that a heat-stable low molecular weight factor present in HDM could mediate the inhibition of discrete PRL signals induced by cell crowding. We then tested whether this small heat-stable factor could be recovered from the dialysis medium. Conditioned HDM was boiled, clarified, and dialyzed against 4 volumes of water overnight at 4 °C using a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa. The dialysate was discarded, and the resulting dialysis fluid containing low molecular weight material was lyophilized and restored with water to a stock concentration corresponding to 10 × HDM. This concentrated low molecular weight fraction of HDM was diluted 1:10 in cell culture medium and specifically tested for its ability to affect PRL activation of Jak2, Stat1, and ERK1/2. In control samples, incubation at high cell density was associated with inhibition of PRL-inducible Stat1 and ERK1/2 but not Jak2 signals (Fig. 3B, lanes a–d). Likewise, cells incubated at low cell density in medium containing the reconstituted low molecular weight fraction of HDM also showed selective inhibition of PRL-inducible phosphorylation of Stat1 and ERK1/2 without affecting Jak2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B,lanes e and f). In addition, this reconstituted dialysis medium inhibited basal activity of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3B,panel 3, lane e), thus also mimicking this particular effect of cell crowding. On the other hand, no inhibition was seen in cells incubated in control medium containing the low molecular weight fraction from low density starvation medium, which had also been boiled, clarified, dialyzed, and reconstituted correspondingly (Fig. 3B, lanes g andh). We conclude that a small heat-stable activity that specifically mimicked the effect of cell crowding could be recovered by dialysis of HDM that had been boiled and clarified. To address whether the inhibitory factor present in boiled and clarified HDM was a peptide, we tested its sensitivity to proteinase K, a general endoprotease that cleaves nonselectively after any hydrophobic, aliphatic, or aromatic amino acid (28Forschung B. Darmstadt E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). For these experiments, boiled and clarified HDM or corresponding control medium (pH 7.3) were incubated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by reboiling for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. Consistent with the previous data, preincubation of cells with boiled and clarified HDM suppressed the PRL-inducible Stat1 signal (Fig. 3C, lanes e and f) when compared with pretreatment with control medium from low density cultures that had been boiled only, or boiled and treated with proteinase K (Fig. 3C, lanes a–d). However, treatment of boiled and clarified HDM with proteinase K did not neutralize the endogenous inhibitor (Fig. 3C, lanes g and h). As a positive control to verify that the proteinase K used was enzymatically active in this biochemical setting, conditioned low density medium was spiked with prolactin (10 nm) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of proteinase K. As shown in Fig. 3D, PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was abolished after proteinase K treatment (lane c versus lane d). Because proteinase K cleaves peptide bonds after more than half of the natural amino acids (28Forschung B. Darmstadt E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), these observations suggested that the low molecular weight factor may not be a peptide. However, further physicochemical analysis and purification is needed to determine the structure of this factor. We addressed the potential mechanism of action of the high cell density-associated inhibitor by screening a series of pharmacological agents for modulatory effects on PRL-inducible Jak2, Stat1, and Stat3 signals in Nb2 cells. Cells were maintained at low density and were preincubated with pharmacologically active concentrations of each agent for 30 min before PRL was added for another 15 min. The results of these studies are presented in Fig. 4, A and B, and showed that the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (500 nm), specifically mimicked the effect of cell crowding by inhibiting PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3, while having little or no effect on Jak2 activation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the more specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bis-indolelyl-maleimide (500 μm), did not affect PRL signals, suggesting that the effect of staurosporine is not mediated by inhibition of PKC. On the other hand, genistein (200 μm), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also inhibited PRL-induced Stat1 and Stat3, albeit not as markedly as staurosporine (Fig. 4B). No effect was observed after pretreatment with any of the other agents, which included the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm), 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm), the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μm), and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm). Furthermore, the mimicry of cell crowding by staurosporine and genistein also included resistance of PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b (Fig. 4C), as well as sensitivity of basal and PRL-inducible ERK1/2 activation as recently reported by us and others (29Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Carey G.B. Liberti J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, staurosporine and to some extent genistein mimicked cell crowding modulation of PRL signals, whereas a series of other agents had no effect. It is therefore possible that the soluble inhibitor acts by a mechanism shared by staurosporine and genistein to regulate PRL signals. Because staurosporine inhibits Nb2 cell growth and survival (26Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Carey G.B. Liberti J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we tested whether the factor released during cell crowding also inhibited growth of Nb2 lymphoma cells. We first determined whether complete conditioned HDM inhibited the growth of Nb2 cells. Nb2 cells were cultured at a density of 106 cells/ml in control medium or in conditioned HDM for 48 h. At that point, the number of metabolically active and viable cells were assessed using the MTT cell proliferation assay (25DaSilva L. Howard O.M.Z. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, HDM significantly inhibited cell growth by approximately 60–65% (n = 3;p < 0.0001; Fig. 5A). Based on these observations, we specifically tested the partially purified factor obtained after dialysis of boiled HDM for its growth inhibitory activity. It was of particular importance to establish whether this partially purified activity exerted a saturable concentration-dependent effect and was not simply cytotoxic. For these experiments, three independently obtained stock solutions containing the partially purified factor at a concentration corresponding to 10× HDM were tested separately. The solutions were diluted in culture medium to achieve concentrations corresponding to a range of 0.25–2× HDM. Nb2 cells were then incubated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of the reconstituted low molecular weight material derived from either conditioned HDM or from low density control medium, and cell growth rate was assayed by the MTT method. As shown in Fig. 5B, the inhibitory effect of the soluble extract displayed a sigmoidal growth inhibition curve reaching a plateau at approximately 65%. These observations therefore strongly suggested that the inhibitory activity released during cell crowding operated through a saturable process. This study describes a small heat-stable growth inhibitor secreted by a rat T lymphoma line when cultured at high cell density. The data also suggested that this inhibitor selectively and reversibly suppressed some, but not all, signaling pathways downstream of PRL receptors. Specifically, short term incubation of Nb2 lymphoma cells at high density blocked PRL stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and transcription factors Stat1 and Stat3 but did not affect PRL activation of Stat5 or the tyrosine kinase Jak2. These effects of cell crowding were reversible and could be imitated by incubation of cells in conditioned high density culture medium at low cell density. A heat-stable and proteinase K-resistant low molecular weight factor (<10 kDa) with these characteristics was recovered from the conditioned high density medium. This factor suppressed basal and PRL-induced MAPK activation and inhibited cell growth with a sigmoidal concentration response consistent with a saturable mode of action. The discriminating suppression of PRL signals by the growth inhibitor present in conditioned high density medium could under low density culture conditions be specifically mimicked by the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. Short term (30 min) pretreatment of cells with staurosporine was associated with selective inhibition of PRL-inducible Stat1, Stat3, and ERK1/2 signals, with little or no effect on PRL-inducible Stat5 and Jak2 signals. A lesser but similar selective inhibition of PRL signals was induced by the more specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. In contrast, PRL signals were not modulated by pretreatment of cells with the PKC inhibitor bis-indoleylmaleimide, the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the calcium ionophore A23187, or several cyclic nucleotide mimetics. Collectively, these pharmacological data raise the possibility that cell crowding, staurosporine, and possibly genistein modulate PRL signals through a common and PKC-independent mechanism. One simple model would involve inhibition by staurosporine, genistein, and cell crowding of a tyrosine kinase that acts downstream of Jak2 and is required for PRL-inducible activation of Stat1, Stat3, and MAPK. Such a role may be played by one or more Src tyrosine kinases. Both staurosporine and genistein inhibit tyrosine kinases of the Src family (30Carey G.B. Liberti J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Tamaoki T. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and Fyn and possibly Lck is activated by PRL in Nb2 cells (21Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel studies of Shc, an adaptor protein that we have shown to couple PRL-receptors to the Grb2-Sos-Ras-MAPK pathway in Nb2 cells (19Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supported this notion. PRL-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was also inhibited after pretreatment with high cell density, staurosporine, or genistein. 3H. Yamashita and H. Rui, unpublished data. We are currently testing the possibility that Fyn or other Src tyrosine kinases represent common targets for cell crowding, genistein, and staurosporine in Nb2 cells. A tyrosine kinase acting downstream of Jak2 might critically mediate PRL-induced activation of Stat1/3 and the Shc-Ras-MAPK pathway by two alternative mechanisms. On the one hand, Stat1, Stat3, and Shc could be direct substrates for a density-regulated tyrosine kinase. Alternatively, this putative kinase could phosphorylate tyrosyl docking sites within the receptor complex that are critical for bringing Stat1/3 and/or Shc within reach of the catalytic domain of the Jak2 kinase. Future examination of the sensitivity of specific phosphorylation sites within the prolactin receptor to inhibition by high cell density, staurosporine, and genistein may therefore be highly informative. Another question that we have addressed is whether density-associated inhibition of MAPK in Nb2 cells may selectively suppress tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 but not Stat5. We recently demonstrated that the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059, blocked prolactin-induced MAPK activation in Nb2 lymphocytes without affecting inducible Stat5a and Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation (29Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, further investigation showed that PD98059 did not inhibit prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of either Stat1, Stat3, or Stat5, despite effectively inhibiting MAPK activation.3These experiments therefore did not suggest any causal link between MAPK inhibition and the selective inhibition of Stat1/3 tyrosine phosphorylation at high cell density but rather indicated that the two inhibitory events occur in parallel. A final mechanistic matter relates to the observed lack of sensitivity of PRL-induced Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation to kinase inhibitors. The specific resistance of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation to both staurosporine and genistein in Nb2 lymphocytes may suggest that Jak2per se is not sensitive to these inhibitors. To our knowledge, the sensitivity of Jak2 to staurosporine or genistein has not been analyzed under stringent conditions in cell-free Jak2 kinase assays. The observation that staurosporine may inhibit cytokine-induced Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation in some cellular models, e.g.growth hormone-induced Jak2 phosphorylation in fibroblasts (32Gong T.W. Meyer D.J. Liao J. Hodge C.L. Campbell G.S. Wang X. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), could reflect inhibition of one or more secondary tyrosine kinases that in certain cell lines contribute significantly to Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple sites. The extracelluar matrix is an important external modulator of cell fate (1Lin C.Q. Bissell M.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and is known to influence PRL signaling. Specifically, for PRL to activate Stat5 and induce lactogenic differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, a laminin-containing extracellular matrix was required that suppressed a prolactin receptor-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase (33Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Edwards G.M. Wilford F.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Djiane J. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9495-9500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The current observations on Nb2 lymphoma cells extends this phenomenon by describing a discriminative pattern of external regulation of individual signal transduction pathways downstream of PRL receptors. Provided that the observed changes in signaling repertoire have biological consequences for Nb2 cells, the modulated pathways may be viewed as sensors of the degree of cell crowding. The fact that significant quantitative changes occurred in some, but not all, PRL signals at different cell densities may also be directly linked to the associated growth inhibition. Although such a causal relationship remains to be proven, the observed suppression of MAPK activities may represent the most critical growth inhibitory component. Furthermore, the rapid uncoupling or heterologous desensitization of discrete PRL signals by an autocrine factor during cell crowding may reflect only one of many commonly operating mechanisms of external modulation of particular transduction pathways. Increased awareness of context-sensitive signaling pathways should also caution against simplistic interpretations of signaling data. The observed resistance of Jak2 and Stat5 to inhibition at high cell density solidifies the Jak2-Stat5 axis as a distinct pathway as proposed by Groner and colleagues (35Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 36Barahmand-Pour F. Meinke A. Groner B. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that selective stimulation of Jak2 in Nb2 cells by the anti-apoptotic drug, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), exclusively led to activation of Stat5a and Stat5b, but not of Stat1 and Stat3 (26Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, in this study, staurosporine treatment affected PRL-inducible activation of Stat1 and Stat3 but not Jak2 and Stat5. Therefore, accumulating evidence suggests that PRL activation of Jak2-Stat5 can be physiologically and pharmacologically dissociated from PRL activation of Stat1 and Stat3 in Nb2 cells. However, a clearer understanding of the biological roles of each of these pathways is needed to shed light on their involvement in disease progression and to establish a more specific pharmacological basis for their manipulation. Thus far, the majority of growth inhibitory factors isolated from cultured cells have been thermolabile polypeptides, including transforming growth factor-β, interferons, glial maturation factor-β, and mammastatin (for review, see Ref. 37Johnson T.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 62: 247-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have described the partial purification of a heat-stable low molecular weight inhibitory activity from conditioned high cell density culture medium. The activity was also resistant to extended treatment with the nonselective endoprotease, proteinase K. It is therefore possible that the factor is not a peptide. Proteinase K is active over a wide pH range, is insensitive to metal ions, and cleaves peptide bonds nonselectively after nonpolar or aromatic amino acids (28Forschung B. Darmstadt E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), which account for more than half of the natural amino acids. It will now be important to determine whether the endogenous inhibitor is indeed of nonpeptidyl nature, or whether it is a peptide without proteinase K-cleavable amide bonds. If the factor were not to be a peptide, membrane lipid derivatives such as prostaglandins or leukotrienes represent one candidate class of molecules, because eicosanoids can inhibit cell growth (38Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5575-5589PubMed Google Scholar), are quickly released, and activate specific receptors (39Smith W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 400B: 989-1011PubMed Google Scholar). Further chemical analysis and purification of this factor is being pursued. Could identification of this soluble inhibitor from Nb2 lymphoma cells cultured at high density lead to new drugs against cancer? The success of antiproliferative interferons as adjuvant treatment for several types of malignancies has demonstrated the usefulness of natural growth inhibitors in cancer therapy (40Einhorn S. Strander H. Med. Oncol. Tumor Pharmacother. 1993; 10: 25-29PubMed Google Scholar). The observations that the endogenous inhibitor suppressed MAPK activities and may operate through a mechanism shared by staurosporine are encouraging. MAPKs are hyperactive in a large number of tumors (41Sivaraman V.S. Wang H.-Y. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and at least two staurosporine analogues, 7-hydroxystaurosporine andN-benzoylstaurosporine, are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment (42Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar, 43van Gijn R. van Tellingen O. de Clippeleir J.J. Hillebrand M.J. Boven E.

Because staurosporine inhibits a variety of protein kinases and induces apoptosis in many cell types (44Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 45Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), more selective analogues may have fewer adverse effects and be less toxic. It will therefore also be important to establish to what extent the endogenous inhibitory activity described here will mimic all of the effects of staurosporine. A possible antiproliferative effect on cells of lymphoid origin would also be of direct relevance for pharmacologic immunosuppression."

UDPAmNS was found to be a powerful competitive inhibitor (K i = 0.2 mm) for UDP-glucose-4-epimerase from Escherichia coli. This active site-directed fluorophore assumed a stretched conformation on the enzyme surface, as was evidenced by full enhancement of fluorescence in saturating enzyme concentration. Complete displacement of the fluorophore by UDP suggested it to bind to the substrate binding site of the active site. Analysis of inactivation kinetics in presence of α,β-diones such as phenylglyoxal, cyclohaxanedione, and 2,3-butadione suggested involvement of the essential arginine residue in the overall catalytic process. From spectral analysis, loss of activity could also be directly correlated with modification of only one arginine residue. Protection experiments with UDP showed the arginine residue to be located in the uridyl phosphate binding subsite. Unlike the native enzyme, the modified enzyme failed to show any enhancement of fluorescence with UDPAmNS clearly demonstrating the role of the essential arginine residue in stretching and binding of the substrate. The potential usefulness of such stacked and quenched nucleotide fluorophores has been discussed.

UDP-glucose-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2, henceforth called epimerase) catalyzes a freely reversible reaction between UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. This enzyme of the galactose metabolic pathway is essential for the biosynthesis of numerous galactoconjugates in all cell types studied so far. This epimerase has emerged as the prototype of a new class of oxidoreductases in which the coenzyme NAD, noncovalently but firmly bound to the apoenzyme, acts as a true cofactor and not as a cosubstrate as in the case of classical dehydrogenases. Several apparently unrelated enzymes such asS-adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1), dTDPglucose oxidoreductase (EC 4.1.1.46), and UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase (EC4.1.1.35) mechanistically belong to this new class of oxidoreductases. In each case catalysis is initiated by reduction of enzyme-bound NAD. The oxidized substrate then undergoes chemical transformation, if necessary, on the enzyme surface before the hydride is stereospecifically returned back and the product is released (1Gabriel O. Kalckar H.M. Darrow R.A. Ebner K.S. Subunit Enzymes: Biochemistry and Fuction. Marcel Dekker, New York1975: 85-133Google Scholar, 2Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avromovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Cenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. 2B. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 462-467Google Scholar). In case of the epimerase, UDP-4-ketohexose and NADH have been unambiguously demonstrated to be the reaction intermediates on the enzyme surface. Stereospecific return of the hydride from NADH to the opposite face of the oxidized hexose moiety completes the catalytic process (1Gabriel O. Kalckar H.M. Darrow R.A. Ebner K.S.

Most of the studies on mechanism, quaternary structure, and active site have been carried out with the Kluyveromyces fragilis and Escherichia coli enzymes. Extensive chemical modification studies with the yeast enzyme revealed the requirement of one essential thiol (8Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10782-10786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) one histidine (10Mukherji S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the overall catalytic process. The primary sequence and the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme are not known. The homodimeric 79-kDa E. coli holoenzyme, on the other hand, has recently been cloned, expressed, and crystallized in various catalytically inactive forms (12Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M.

Although no modification work has been reported with the enzyme, a reasonably clear picture of the active site has emerged at 1.8× resolution (13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The substrate analog UDP-benzene seems to be in a stretched conformation, and amino acid residues involved in various binding interactions can be tentatively identified. It is imperative that modification studies be carried out with the E. coli enzyme to specify and confirm the tentative roles of these amino acid residues residing at the active site. In the previous paper we demonstrated that uridine5′-diphosphoro-β-1-(5-sulfonic acid) naphthylamidate (UDPAmNS) 1The abbreviations used are: UDPAmNS, uridine-5′-diphosphoro-β-1-(5-sulfonic acid) naphthylamidate. 1The abbreviations used are: UDPAmNS, uridine-5′-diphosphoro-β-1-(5-sulfonic acid) naphthylamidate. in aqueous solution behaves as a quenched fluorophore because of its predominantly stacked conformation. Quenching is fully released when complete destacking takes place (15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility of whether such designed fluorophores can be used to probe conformational transitions of a putative ligand as it interacts with its target protein, we used UDPAmNS as the probe and the E. coli epimerase as the model target enzyme for this purpose. We first show that UDPAmNS is indeed a substrate site-directed probe for this enzyme. Furthermore, the probe assumes a fully stretched conformation on the enzyme surface, as is evidenced by total dequenching of fluorescence on interaction with the enzyme. Finally, we demonstrate the essential requirement of at least one arginine residue in this binding process. The reliability of these results is confirmed from the available x-ray data. All biochemicals unless otherwise stated were purchased from Sigma. [1-14C]Phenylglyoxal (2.17 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Bhaba Atomic Research Center. Common chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck. Absorption measurements were done in a Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence measurements were done in a Hitachi F-4010 spectrofluorimeter. Highly purified and essentially homogenous UDP-glucose-4-epimerase was prepared from E. coliaccording to the method of Wilson and Hogness (3Wilson D.B. Hogness D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2469-2481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzyme was 150–160 units/mg of protein, where 1 unit of enzyme could convert 1 μmol of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose in 1 min. Epimerase activity was routinely determined by the use of the coupled assay system of Wilson and Hogness (3Wilson D.B. Hogness D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2469-2481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, UDP-glucose, the product of epimerization, is immediately converted to UDP-glucuronic acid by coupling the reaction with UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and NAD. The assay mixture consisted of 0.1 mglycylglycine buffer, pH 8.8, 0.25 mm NAD, 0.16 units of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, and the requisite amount of epimerase. The reaction was initiated by addition of UDP-galactose, and increase in absorbance attributable to formation of NADH was measured at 340 nm for second and fifth minutes. Because the synthetic fluorophore itself had a significant absorbance at 340 nm, a two-step assay system was used whenever necessary. This assay has been described in detail earlier (17Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4373-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in a total volume of 200 μl containing 0.2m glycylglycine buffer, pH 8.8, and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin, the requisite amount of epimerase was taken, and reaction was initiated with UDP-galactose. The reaction was terminated after 5 min by rapid addition of chloroform and vigorous shaking. The mixture was then centrifuged. In the second stage, an appropriate aliquot from the top aqueous layer was taken out to estimate the amount of UDP-glucose formed by adding it in a medium containing UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and NAD and observing the change in absorbance at 340 nm. A control blank without epimerase was parallely run. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all stoichiometric calculations, the molecular weight for the epimerase was assumed to be 79,000 (12Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). UDPAmNS and other AmNS derivatives were synthesized and purified according the methods described in our preceeding paper (15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Wherever necessary, excess ligands and reagents were removed from reaction mixtures by Sephadex G-50 spin column centrifugation as described by Maniatis et al. (19Maniatis J. Fristsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 466-467Google Scholar). Modification with phenyglyoxal was carried out in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The reagent was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, which had no effect on the stability of the enzyme. Modification with 1,2-cyclohexanedione and 2,3-butanedione was carried out in 0.05 m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.8. Borate had no inhibitory effect on the enzyme. All experiments, unless otherwise stated were carried out at 28 °C. All kinetics of inactivation were followed by measurement of residual activities of reaction mixtures, withdrawn at intervals and suitably diluted. The modifying reagents at the concentrations used in the assay medium did not have any effect on UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, the coupling enzyme of the coupled assay procedure. In reactivation experiments the inactivated epimerase was treated with neutralized 0.5m hydroxylamine, which on dilution during assay had no effect on the activity of the control enzyme. [1-14C] Phenylglyoxal incorporation studies were performed to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction of phenylglyoxal with arginine residues of the epimerase. The enzyme (0.6 mg/ml) in 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was incubated with 2.5 mm[1-14C] phenylglyoxal (1.2 × 106cpm/μmol) for 45 min. Excess reagent and ligand were removed by spin column centrifugation, and the eluates were measured for enzyme activity, protein concentration, and radioactivity. This was done according the procedure of Mas and Colman (20Mas M.T. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 24: 1634-1646Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using the following equation: 1/(F/F 0 − 1) =K d/Q·n·P + 1/Q, where F 0 and Frepresent the fluorescence intensity of UDPAmNS in the absence and in presence of the E. coli epimerase after subtracting that attributable to epimerase, and P is the epimerase concentration. The intercept of the plot of 1/(F/F 0 − 1) versus1/P gives 1/Q, where Q is the quantum enhancement or the enhancement that would occur when all the fluorophore is bound to the protein. We first investigated whether UDPAmNS can be used as a probe for the active site of the E. coli enzyme. Both theK. fragilis and the E. coli enzymes are known to be competitively inhibited by UMP and UDP (21Pal D.K. Bhaduri A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Wong S.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 18: 3551-3556Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). UDPAmNS was also found to be a strict competitive inhibitor for the epimerase (Fig. 1) and hence a probe for the active site of the enzyme. Clearly, substitution of the hexose moiety by the bulky AmNS did not present any major steric problem for specific interaction of this ligand to the substrate-binding site of the enzyme. This is consistent with the reaction mechanism that assumes free rotation of the ketohexose moiety during catalysis (2Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avromovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Cenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. 2B. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 462-467Google Scholar). Furthermore, earlier observations had shown that considerable modification of the hexose moiety or its substitution by other moieties can be effected without hampering the binding property of the substrate (23Flentke G.R. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2430-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Wong Y.-H. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5337-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Wong S.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TheK i for UDPAmNS was calculated to be 0.20 mm, which compares very well with the K iobtained with other such similar aromatic analogs of UDP such asp-bromoacetamidophenyluridyl pyrophosphate (0.21 mm) and p-nitrophenyluridyl pyrophosphate (0.21 mm) (24Wong Y.-H. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5337-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Wong S.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the fluorescence spectra of UDPAmNS (9.3 μm) as the concentration of epimerase was progressively increased in the cuvette. Quite evidently, the stacked and quenched fluorophore assumes a stretched conformation on interaction with the enzyme and hence is relieved of its quenching (15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A, inset, shows that extrapolation at infinite enzyme concentration when all the fluorophores have interacted with the enzyme results in a 8-fold increase in fluorescence, a value that agrees excellently with the value obtained for the fully unstacked fluorophore in isopropanol and dimethylsulfoxide or after phosphodiesterase bond cleavage (previous paper, Fig. 1; Ref. 15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows complete displacement of UDPAmNS from the enzyme surface by UDP. This is additional evidence to show that the fluorophore is interacting with the enzyme exclusively at the substrate binding site. The native E. coli holoenzyme displays a weak intrinsic fluorescence (λem = 453 nm) when excited at 360 nm. This is probably attributable to the varying amounts of NADH that are known to be bound to the dimeric apoenzyme when purified from overexpressed E. coli (26Vanhooke J.L. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31496-31504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We shall now show that by using this fluorophore one can uncover very conveniently amino acid residues that are essential for the binding of the substrate. Because the substrate for epimerase is negatively charged at the cellular pH, we decided to explore the possible involvement of cationic arginine residue(s) in the binding of the substrate. We had earlier shown the presence of an essential arginine residue at the substrate binding site of the K. fragilis enzyme (11Mukherji S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of epimerase with phenylglyoxal led to a progressive loss of enzyme activity. The inactivation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics. A plot of logK versus log of reagent concentration (27Levy H.M. Leber P.A. Ryan I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3654-3659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a straight line with a slope close to unity (Fig. 3A), indicating that at least 1 mol of phenylglyoxal/mol of enzyme was required to produce inactivation. Because phenylglyoxal has occasionally been shown to react with residues other than arginine (28Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two highly selective arginine-modifying reagents, cyclohexanedione (29Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and butanedione (30Rioidan J.F. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3915-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), were also used to modify the enzyme. In both cases phosphate buffer was replaced by borate to stabilize the adducts (28Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With cyclohexanedione also, epimerase was completely inactivated following a pseudo-first order kinetics, and a reaction order of 1 was obtained (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with 2,3-butanedione (data not shown). Notwithstanding some limitations in this kinetic method (31Hayman S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4161-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), because the kinetic order of inactivation was close to 1 in all cases, the minimal number of arginine residue(s) that were involved in the inactivation process could be taken to be 1. A specific test for modification of essential arginine residue(s) is the regeneration of activity in presence of hydroxylamine (29Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme modified by cyclohexanedione and inactivated to <10% of its original activity could be completely reactivated when the inactivated enzyme was diluted 20-fold in 0.5 m neutralized hydroxylamine in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (data not shown). In contrast, when the enzyme was inactivated with phenylglyoxal, it could not be significantly reactivated. Such irreversible modification is indicative of the formation of a stable diphenylglyoxal derivative (32Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To establish the stoichiometry of phenylglyoxal to arginine also as the number of arginine residues that are modified during the process of inactivation, both spectrophotometric analysis and radiolabeling with [1-14C]phenylglyoxal were carried out. For this purpose, epimerase (0.8 mg/ml) was incubated with phenylglyoxal (2.5 mm) in 0.05 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, for 45 min at 28 °C. The inactivated enzyme (>95%) was freed of excess reagent in a spin column and a differential spectrum was obtained with the untreated enzyme as the control. The differential spectrum with λmax at 250 nm was characteristic of a diphenylglyoxal derivative (data not shown). Using a molar absorption coefficient of 11,000 m/cm for the diderivative (32Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), 3.1 arginine residues were found to be modified in the process. In a parallel experiment with [1-14C]phenylglyoxal, 5.8 mol of phenylglyoxal was found to be incorporated per mole of the enzyme under identical conditions, confirming the stoichiometry of phenylglyoxal to arginine to be 2:1. The spectral signal at 250 nm for the formation of the diphenylglyoxal derivative provided a handle to directly relate the extent of arginine modification with loss of activity. Fig. 4 shows that although all the three arginine residues are reactive, the loss of activity versusnumber of arginine residues modified extrapolates to 1 at zero activity of the enzyme. The excellent correspondence between this direct method and the kinetic method leaves little doubt that at least 1 arginine residue is intimately associated with the overall catalytic process. The usefulness of such a combination of methods was first demonstrated by Hayman and Coleman (31Hayman S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4161-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for isocitrate dehydrogenase. Protection experiments with UMP or UDP convincingly demonstrated that the essential arginine residue is indeed located in the substrate binding region of the active site. Fig. 5 shows that the rate of inactivation of phenylglyoxal is progressively decreased as the concentration of UMP is increased. A plot oft 1/2 of inactivation against the concentration of 5′-UMP was linear (Fig. 5, inset). The intercept on the abscissa of such a plot gives the dissociation constant (K d) of the enzyme-protecting agent complex (27Levy H.M. Leber P.A. Ryan I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3654-3659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K d of the epimerase-UMP complex was calculated to be 1.9 mm, which is in excellent agreement with theK d for UMP (1.9 mm) obtained kinetically (22Wong S.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 18: 3551-3556Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The experiment with UDP also gave strong protection. Based on this protection experiment, the essential arginine residue was placed in the binding subsite for the nucleotide phosphates. To ascertain the specific role of the essential arginine residue located at the uridylphosphoryl binding subsite, the enzyme inactivated with phenylglyoxal (>95%) was allowed to interact with UDPAmNS. Fig. 6 shows that the quenched fluorophore failed to show significant enhancement of fluorescence with the modified enzyme. Clearly, in this case, the stacked fluorophore failed to bind and undergo transition to a stretched conformation on the enzyme surface. In contrast, interaction with the native enzyme that served as the control resulted in severalfold enhancement of fluorescence of UDPAmNS. Furthermore, UDPAmNS could be completely displaced from the enzyme surface by UDP (Fig. 6, trace e), confirming its specific interaction at the substrate binding site of the enzyme. The essential arginine residue is, therefore, critically involved not only in the binding but also in the destacking or stretching of this substrate analog on the enzyme surface. The conformational change that the ligand underwent on the enzyme surface could be monitored quite conveniently only because this transition was accompanied by significant enhancement of fluorescence attributable to release of stacking and consequential absence of collisional quenching. In the previous paper we had shown that when a uridine nucleotide is derivatized with a suitable aromatic fluorophore such as AmNS via a phosphoramidate bond through the terminal phosphate, it takes a stacked conformation in aqueous solution that is in rapid equilibrium with its extended form (15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The dynamic collisional quenching of fluorescence in the stacked form should make such strongly quenched fluorophores eminently suitable as probes for protein or enzyme studies provided such designed molecules satisfy the following conditions. First, the derivatized probe must be true structural analogs of the desired ligand so that specificity is retained, and second, the probe on interaction with the target protein should take a destacked conformation so that the resultant enhancement of fluorescence can be a direct monitor of the conformational transition of the probe and hence of its interaction with the protein. Our present work shows that UDPAmNS satisfies both the conditions when E. coli epimerase is used as the enzyme target. Although the competitive nature of inhibition (Fig. 1) suggests it to be an active site-directed analog, maximum enhancement of fluorescence when all the molecules of the fluorophores are bound to the enzyme (Fig. 2A) clearly demonstrates a destacked or stretched conformation of the substrate analog on the enzyme surface. These results agree very well with the published x-ray data of the holoenzyme as it is co-crystallized with UDP-phenol or with other abortive forms of the enzyme (12Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because the destacking energy was calculated to be 2.3 Kcal/mol for UDPAmNS (previous paper; Ref.15Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the binding energy for the UDP moiety of the substrate may be assumed to have a minimal value of that order. Kinetic analysis with α, β-dicarbonyl reagents (Fig. 3), followed by estimation of arginine residues that can be directly correlated with total loss of activity (Fig. 4), clearly shows that one arginine residue is essential for the overall catalytic activity. Complete regeneration of activity of 1,2-cyclohexanedione-inactivated enzyme by hydroxylamine and of 2,3-butanedione-inactivated enzyme on removal of borate by dilution (see text) is also consistent with modification of an essential arginine residue on the enzyme surface. Nearly complete protections provided both by UMP and by UDP against modification by phenylglyoxal (Fig. 5) strongly suggest that the essential arginine residue is located in the uridylphosphoryl binding subsite of the active site and is probably involved in the productive binding of the substrate with the enzyme. Using UDPAmNS as the active site-directed designed probe, we could at this stage convincingly demonstrate that the essential arginine residue is critically needed both for binding and for stretching of the substrate (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 provides a schematic representation of the overall process. The stacked and quenched fluorophore in the buffered aqueous solution assumes a stretched conformation on the enzyme surface that leads to dequenching of fluorescence. The essential arginine residue is obligatorily needed in this binding process. These results fit exceedingly well with the published x-ray and sequence homology data (13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Resolution at ×2.0 of the holoenzyme co-crystallized with UDP had earlier shown that apart from four molecules of water, Asn-179, Leu-200, Ala-216, and Arg-292 are in a bonding distance of UDP. More importantly, the oxyanion of α-phosphate of UDP has a potential bonding interaction with the guanidino nitrogen of Arg-292. This, most likely, is the essential arginine residue uncovered by our modification studies. Interestingly, this arginine residue is conserved across the phylogenetic scale for epimerase, which includes clones from several organisms such as bacteria, yeast, and mammals (14Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our present study with UDPAmNS as a representative compound for stacked and quenched fluorophores shows that such designed nucleotide fluorophores can possibly be of considerable use in following ligand-protein interactions in several classes of proteins of great biological interest. Several ATPases, kinases, and G-proteins in general show that nucleotides take a stretched conformation on the protein surface (16Helmriech E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In principle, the conformational transition of such a quenched fluorophore as it interacts with its target protein can thus be used to study many aspects of the structure-function relationship of these enzymes or proteins. An anticipated advantage in terms of ligand specificity for such synthetic fluorophores may be attributable to the fact that both the base and the ribose moieties are left unaltered during the derivatization process. Like other extrinsic fluorophores, such fluorophores can also be used for energy transfer studies, because the tryptophan emission spectrum overlaps the absorption spectrum of these potential fluorophores. These fluorophores can also be uniquely useful as sensors for the formation of substrate binding or ligand binding sites in protein-folding studies. Finally, search for lead compounds for drug development may be facilitated by rapid fluorimetric monitoring of the displacement of stretched fluorophores from the binding site of target proteins, e.g.G-proteins, by an array of synthetic molecules generated by combinatorial methods or extracts from plant sources."
