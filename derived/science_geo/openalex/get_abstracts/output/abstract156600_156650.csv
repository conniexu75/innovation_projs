https://openalex.org/W2021736277,"Cisplatin activates multiple signal transduction pathways involved in coordinating cellular responses to stress. Here we demonstrate a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family in mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis of human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Cisplatin treatment resulted in dose- and time- dependent activation of ERK. That elevated ERK activity contributed to cell death by cisplatin was supported by several observations: 1) PD98059 and U0126, chemical inhibitors of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, prevented apoptosis; 2) pretreatment of cells with TPA, an activator of the ERK pathway, enhanced their sensitivity to cisplatin; 3) suramin, a growth factor receptor antagonist that greatly suppressed ERK activation, likewise inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis; and, finally, 4) HeLa cell variants selected for cisplatin resistance showed reduced activation of ERK following cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was associated with cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-3 activation, both of which could be prevented by treatment with the MEK inhibitors. However, the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone protected HeLa cells against apoptosis without affecting ERK activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that ERK activation plays an active role in mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells and functions upstream of caspase activation to initiate the apoptotic signal.

However, a major limitation of CDDP chemotherapy is serious drug resistance. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in the development of CDDP resistance including reduced accumulation of the drug, increased levels of glutathione (GSH), enhanced expression of metallothionein, enhanced DNA repair, increased levels of Bcl-2-related anti-apoptotic genes, and alterations in signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis (1Timmer-Bosscha H.

Apoptosis induced by CDDP is generally considered to be the result of its ability to damage DNA (4Eastman A. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanisms by which such DNA damage triggers cell death remain unclear. Understanding the molecular basis of CDDP-mediated apoptosis could lead to strategies resulting in improved therapeutic benefits. Proteins comprising the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family constitute important mediators of signal transduction processes that serve to coordinate the cellular response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Three major mammalian MAPK subfamilies have been described: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK, also called stress-activated protein kinase), and the p38 kinases. Each MAPK is activated through a specific phosphorylation cascade. The ERK pathway plays a major role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, being highly induced in response to growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters (5Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R.

It is also activated by some conditions of stress, particularly oxidant injury, and in such circumstances is believed to confer a survival advantage to cells (8Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q.

J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK and p38 are generally only weakly activated by growth factors, but are highly activated in response to a variety of stress signals including tumor necrosis factor, ionizing and short wave length ultraviolet irradiation (UVC), and hyperosmotic stress. Their activation is most frequently associated with induction of apoptosis (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem.

Many studies have demonstrated an activation of JNK in response to CDDP treatment, but how it influences cell survival is unclear. Although most of the reports published thus far have suggested a role for JNK in the induction of apoptosis by CDDP, several studies have suggested that JNK signaling plays a role in enhancing survival of CDDP-treated cells (15Zanke B.W.

There is also mixed evidence for the role of ERK in influencing cell survival of CDDP-treated cells. For example, two recent studies have suggested that ERK activation is associated with enhanced survival of CDDP-treated cells (19Hayakawa J. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Ikegami H. Kimura A. Matsuoka T.

Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar). However, elevated expression of Ras, an upstream component of the ERK signaling pathway, has been connected with enhanced sensitivity to CDDP (21Gao X.S. Asaumi J. Kawasaki S. Nishikawa K. Kuroda M. Takeda Y. Hiraki Y. Ihara M. Ohnishi T. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1911-1914PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fokstuen T. Rabo Y.B. Zhou J.N. Karlson J. Platz A. Shoshan M.C. Hansson J. Linder S. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 2347-2352PubMed Google Scholar). The present study sought to examine the roles of the MAPK signaling pathways in regulating CDDP-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Although ERK, JNK, and p38 were all found to be activated in response to CDDP treatment, only ERK activity appears to be involved in regulating cell survival. Using a variety of strategies to manipulate ERK activity, we provide evidence that ERK is important in mediating CDDP-induced apoptosis through a cytochrome crelease-dependent mechanism. Cisplatin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), hydrogen peroxide, etoposide, doxorubicin, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, the p38 inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580), suramin, and N-acetylcysteine were all obtained from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). The monoclonal anti-PARP and anti-cytochrome c antibodies were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); U0126 and the anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-JNK rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-phospho-p38 and anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and the anti-caspase-3 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The cisplatin-resistant cell lines, HeLa-R1 and HeLa-R3, and parental control line HeLa-C were kindly provided by Dr. Gilbert Chu (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) (23Chu G. Chang E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3324-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HeLa and A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts Inc., Calabasas, CA), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. They were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2. For the induction of apoptosis, cells were plated in 60-mm dishes 1 day prior to cisplatin treatment. DAPI staining was performed as described previously (24Wang X. Gorospe M. Huang Y. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In brief, prior to staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, then washed with PBS. DAPI was added to the fixed cells for 30 min, after which they were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei. Percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells counted × 100. A minimum of 400 cells were counted for each treatment. For immunoblot analysis, cells were harvested in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm NaF). The resulting lysates were resolved on a 4–12% NuPAGE gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) (30 μg/lane) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk and then hybridized with different antibodies. Proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the pellets collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 5 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) containing 250 mm sucrose, and homogenized 25 strokes on ice with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants centrifuged again at 14,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. Equal amounts of lysate were separated by NuPAGE gel (4–12%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subsequently probed with anti-cytochromec. JNK activity was measured by an immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmPMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmNaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein samples were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with 5 μl of anti-JNK1 antibody with the addition of 35 μl of 50% slurry protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times each in lysis buffer and kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). JNK kinase assays were performed using GST-c-Jun-(1–135) as a substrate. ERK and p38 MAPK activations were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies. CDDP treatment results in apoptosis of many different cell types. To examine the ability of CDDP to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells, cultures were treated with various doses of the agent for 24 h, after which they were stained with DAPI and examined microscopically. As shown in Fig. 1 A (left panel), CDDP caused apoptosis of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a concentration of 30 μm CDDP resulting in death of greater than 90% of the cell population by 24 h of treatment. The kinetics of CDDP-induced apoptosis were examined using a 30 μm concentration (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Morphological alterations characteristic of apoptosis were apparent within 14 h of treatment, as was cleavage of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP), a biochemical feature of apoptosis that can be detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). The ERK signaling pathway has been shown to be activated in response to certain cellular stresses. To investigate whether CDDP treatment led to ERK activation, lysates obtained at various times from CDDP-treated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-ERK antibody to detect phosphorylated (and therefore activated) ERK (Fig. 2 A). The same blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognizes ERK2 to verify equal amounts of the protein in the various samples. As shown in the upper panel, 20 and 30 μm CDDP, both of which resulted in significant apoptosis, led to strong activation of ERK. Activation became apparent at about 6 h following treatment with 30 μmCDDP and was sustained over the following 14-h period (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Importantly, we did not detect any acute activation of ERK (within the first hour of treatment), which frequently occurs with growth factor stimulation or treatment with oxidants (8Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). MEK1/2, the kinases lying directly upstream of ERK, and which are responsible for ERK activation, were also phosphorylated by CDDP treatment over the same time frame as seen for ERK (Fig. 2 B). Two specific inhibitors of MEK1/2, PD98059 and U0126, have been developed, which are highly selective in their inhibition of the ERK pathway (25Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

These were used, therefore, to evaluate whether ERK activation is required for CDDP-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were pretreated with various doses of PD98059 or U0126 for 30 min prior to addition of 30 μm CDDP. The morphology of cells treated with CDDP ± the MEK inhibitors is shown in Fig. 3 A. Cells treated with CDDP alone displayed typical features of apoptosis; shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and condensation of nuclei (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with either PD98059 or U0126 markedly suppressed these morphologic changes induced by CDDP (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). Staining of the cells with DAPI further confirmed these morphological findings (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). Quantitation of apoptotic cells, summarized in Fig. 3 B, demonstrated that the protective influence of the MEK inhibitors was dose-dependent and occurred with doses expected to suppress ERK activation. That PD98059 and U0126 do indeed prevent activation of ERK in response to CDDP treatment is shown in Fig. 3 C. CDDP induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types. To determine if the anti-apoptotic effect of MEK1/2 inhibitors against CDDP in HeLa cells also occurs in other cell types, A549 lung carcinoma cells were examined for their responsiveness to CDDP treatment. As seen with HeLa cells, CDDP treatment resulted in apoptosis of A549 cells (Fig. 4 A). Pretreatment of these cells with U0126 significantly reduced CDDP-induced apoptosis, although the inhibitory effect was not as great as that seen in HeLa cells (Fig. 4 A). To evaluate the role of the ERK pathway in the induction of apoptosis following other stresses, HeLa cells were pretreated with the 60 μm PD98059 prior to their exposure to several stimuli including UVC (30 J/m2), hydrogen peroxide (600 μm), etoposide (VP16; 50 μm), and doxorubicin (DOX; 2 μm). We found no inhibitory effect of PD98059 on apoptosis occurring in response to any of these treatments (Fig. 4 B). In fact, PD98059 pretreatment enhanced both H2O2- and DOX-induced apoptosis. That ERK was indeed activated in response to UVC, VP16, and DOX treatment and could be inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor is shown in thebottom panel. We have previously reported such findings for H2O2 (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our previous studies supporting a pro-survival role for ERK during oxidant injury (8Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the ERK pathway participates in the induction of apoptosis by CDDP, but not that occurring with other stresses. JNK and p38 activities increase upon CDDP treatment in other cell types. Accordingly, we examined their activities in HeLa cells following exposure to CDDP for various lengths of time. JNK activation was assessed both by measuring its kinase activity using an immunocomplex kinase assay with GST-c-Jun-(1–135) fusion protein as a substrate, and by examining its degree of phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-JNK1/2 polyclonal antibody. The activation state of p38 was likewise determined based on its degree of phosphorylation. Total JNK and p38 protein levels were monitored using antibodies capable of recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 A, both JNK and p38 were activated in response to CDDP treatment. Although p38 activation occurred over the same time frame seen for ERK, activation of JNK was somewhat delayed. To investigate the functional consequences of JNK activation, we examined the CDDP responsiveness of HeLa cells stably expressing a dominant negative mutant form of SEK1 (SEK1-DN), a kinase that contributes largely to JNK activation during conditions of stress. We have previously shown that these SEK1-DN-expressing cells show attenuated JNK activation and reduced apoptosis in response to H2O2 treatment (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, SEK1-DN-expressing HeLa cell lines did not differ from vector control HeLa cells in their sensitivity to CDDP. To investigate the influence of p38 activation on survival of CDDP-treated cells, we utilized the pharmacologic agents SB202190 and SB203580, which act as specific inhibitors of p38 activity. We have demonstrated that the concentrations of SB202190 and SB203580 used in the present study result in complete inhibition of p38 kinase activity in HeLa cells (10Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, treatment of HeLa cells with these agents during exposure to CDDP did not alter the outcome. Taken together, these results indicate that neither JNK nor p38 plays a role in regulating CDDP-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. If the activation of ERK plays an important role in mediating apoptosis of CDDP-treated cells, then agents capable of stimulating ERK activity, when combined with CDDP treatment, should potentiate apoptosis. To address this possibility, cells were treated with CDDP in the presence of the phorbol ester TPA. Numerous studies have indicated that TPA is a strong activator of the ERK signaling pathway (7He H.

Cells were pre-incubated with or without 50 nm TPA for 1 h, followed by addition of 20 μm CDDP. The cells were evaluated for apoptosis 12 and 24 h later. When administered alone, TPA was not toxic for HeLa cells (Fig. 6 A). However, TPA-pretreated cells were much more sensitive to CDDP. This effect was attenuated by co-treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126. To confirm that the apoptosis-enhancing effect of TPA was related to its ability to activate ERK, Western blot analysis was used to assess ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). TPA treatment alone significantly increased the level of phosphorylated ERK, with near maximum ERK activation achieved with 6 h of TPA treatment. Addition of CDDP did not appreciably alter this level. Furthermore, Fig. 6 Bshows that significant PARP cleavage was observed at 12 h of CDDP treatment when cells were sensitized with TPA, earlier than observed for CDDP alone (Fig. 1 B). However, as seen for CDDP-treated cells, TPA-induced ERK activation and PARP cleavage was significantly inhibited by the presence of U0126. These results suggest that the ability of TPA to enhance CDDP-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells is mediated through activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Previous findings from our laboratory and others have provided evidence that growth factor receptors (GFR) are important in initiating the activation of the ERK signaling pathway in response to certain stresses (33Zanella C.L. Posada J. Tritton T.R. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5334-5338PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that growth factor receptors are involved in mediating CDDP-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, we examined the ability of the broad spectrum growth factor receptor inhibitor suramin to prevent ERK activation and inhibit apoptosis of CDDP-treated cells. As shown, suramin markedly reduced the level of ERK phosphorylation occurring in response to CDDP treatment (Fig. 7 A) and significantly inhibited CDDP-induced apoptosis as assessed both by DAPI staining (Fig. 7 B) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 7 C). Given that a variety of oxidants have been found to activate ERK through growth factor signaling pathways, and the finding above that growth factor receptor signaling pathways appear to participate in ERK activation by CDDP, we investigated whether oxidative stress contributes to the apoptotic effects of CDDP. The influence of two antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and dimethyl sulfoximide (Me2SO), were tested. Treatment of cells with 1 mm NAC completely protected cells against CDDP-induced apoptosis. Me2SO likewise inhibited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A). It is important to note that Me2SO is a commonly employed solvent and indeed was used for preparation of our stock MEK1/2 inhibitor solutions. However, the concentrations used in MEK1/2 inhibitor solutions (0.1%) are lower than those shown here to inhibit ERK activation. In keeping with the ability of NAC to prevent apoptosis as assessed by DAPI staining, the antioxidant markedly inhibited ERK activation and completely prevented PARP cleavage (Fig. 8 B). Recent studies have indicated that cytochrome c participates in activating the cell death program (36Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Cytochrome c normally resides in mitochondria, but is released into the cytoplasm following exposure of cells to certain stresses. In the cytoplasm it binds to Apaf-1, resulting in the activation of caspase-9 and downstream caspases such as caspase-3 (39Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Therefore, we sought to investigate whether cytochrome c release occurred in response to CDDP treatment, and if so, to determine whether it was dependent on ERK activation. Cells were treated with CDDP for different times in the presence or absence of PD98059 (60 μm) or U0126 (20 μm), after which cytosolic extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cytochromec protein levels were measured by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 9, cytochrome c levels in the cytoplasm increased in response to CDDP treatment, and this was correlated with cleavage of both caspase-3 and PARP. These processes were all markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitors, particularly U0126, as was ERK activation (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that ERK acts"
https://openalex.org/W1981122961,"Gα-interacting protein (GAIP) is a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) that accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the α-subunit of the trimeric Gi3 protein. Both proteins are part of a signaling pathway that controls lysosomal-autophagic catabolism in human colon cancer HT-29 cells. Here we show that GAIP is phosphorylated by an extracellular signal-regulated (Erk1/2) MAP kinase-dependent pathway sensitive to amino acids, MEK1/2 (PD098059), and protein kinase C (GF109203X) inhibitors. An in vitro phosphorylation assay demonstrates that Erk2-dependent phosphorylation of GAIP stimulates its GTPase-activating protein activity toward the Gαi3 protein (k = 0.187 ± 0.001 s−1, EC50 = 1.12 ± 0.10 μm) when compared with unphosphorylated recombinant GAIP (k = 0.145 ± 0.003 s−1, EC50 = 3.16 ± 0.12 μm) or to GAIP phosphorylated by other Ser/Thr protein kinases (protein kinase C, casein kinase II). This stimulation and the phosphorylation of GAIP by Erk2 were abrogated when serine at position 151 in the RGS domain was substituted by an alanine residue using site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, the lysosomal-autophagic pathway was not stimulated in S151A-GAIP mutant-expressing cells when compared with wild-type GAIP-expressing cells. These results demonstrate that the GTPase-activating protein activity of GAIP is stimulated by Erk2 phosphorylation. They also suggested that Erk1/2 and GAIP are engaged in the signaling control of a major catabolic pathway in intestinal derived cells.

More than 20 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified generally by reference to a conserved domain of about 115 amino acid residues known as the RGS box (5Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are involved in modulating a variety of cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation, response to neurotransmitters, membrane trafficking, and embryonic development (4De Vries L.

RGS act as negative regulators of several G proteins by accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Gα proteins, thereby promoting their association with the βγ dimer (7Watson N. Linder M.E.

This GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity is engaged in the desensitization of signaling by the trimeric G proteins, but it can also speed up the transmission of signals in some cases (10Doupnik C.A.

Recently, the key role of RGS in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling has been demonstrated in vivo (12Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence supports the notion that RGS proteins may be engaged in functions distinct from the regulation of G protein-activity (14De Vries L. Gist Farquhar M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). GAIP (Gα-interacting protein) is an RGS protein, which is known to interact with Gαi3 protein (15De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). GAIP has been located to the Golgi apparatus membrane and newly budding Golgi vesicles (16Wylie F. Heimann K. Le T.L. Brown D.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting its potential role in vesicular transport. Recently, it has been demonstrated that posttranslational modifications of RGS can modulate their properties. Palmitoylation of conserved cysteines in RGS boxes has been shown to modify the GAP activity of RGS4 and RGS10 (19Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation has been reported to influence the stability and the membrane association of the yeast RGS Sst2 and human GAIP, respectively (20Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M.

In the present work, we show that the phosphorylation of GAIP is in part dependent upon the activation of the Erk1/2 MAP kinases in the human intestinal HT-29 cells, and both of these events were sensitive to PKC inhibitors and amino acids. Using a panel of Ser/Thr protein kinases in an in vitro assay, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of GAIP by a recombinant Erk2 stimulated its GAP activity toward the Gαi3 protein when compared with the activity of unphosphorylated GAIP. This stimulation was abolished when serine at position 151 in the RGS domain was replaced by an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. Previously, we have shown that GAIP and the Gαi3 protein are engaged in a signaling pathway that controls the lysosomal-autophagic route in HT-29 cells (22Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J.

A hallmark of autophagy in many mammalian cells is its sensitivity to extracellular amino acid levels, which reduce the formation of autophagic vacuoles containing cytoplasmic material destined to lysosomal degradation (25Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Meijer A.J. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Mortimore G.E. Miotto G. Venerando R. Kadowaki M. Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenium Publishing Corp., New York1996: 93-136Google Scholar). The inhibition of autophagy by the addition of amino acids was correlated with the inhibition of the Erk1/2 MAP kinases and a low level of GAIP phosphorylation in HT-29 cells. By contrast to cells expressing the wild-type GAIP, those expressing the S151A mutant were unable to increase their rate of autophagy in response to amino acid deprivation and Erk1/2 activation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that an Erk1/2 MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation stimulates the GAP activity of GAIP and they also identify GAIP as a target for amino acid-regulated catabolism in intestinal cells. cDNA were synthesized from mRNA isolated from HT-29 cells by reverse transcription and were used to amplify by PCR full-length cDNA encoding the wild-type GAIP (24Ogier-Denis E. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24599-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Full-length GAIP mutant S151A was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the following mismatched oligonucleotide: 5′-GTATCCATCCTGGCCCCCAAGGAGGTG-3′. Identification of the mutation was obtained by direct DNA sequencing. Inserts encoding wild-type GAIP and S151A mutant were subcloned into the eucaryote expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at the BamHI/XbaI sites. Wild-type and S151A mutant cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CGCAAGCTTATGCCCACCCCGCATGAG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCCAAGGCCTCGGAGGAGGA-3′. PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/c-Myc/His-tagged vector (Invitrogen) at the HindIII/BamHI sites. Recombinant proteins were obtained as described previously (24Ogier-Denis E. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24599-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were cultured as described previously (22Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol.

His-tagged wild-type GAIP and S151A mutant were introduced into exponentially growing HT-29 cells by the Effectene™ kit according to the supplier's conditions (Qiagen). Cells were used 72 h after cell transfection. All experiments were carried out in nutrient-free HBSS medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA, and when appropriate amino acids or drugs were added. The final concentrations of amino acids in the mixture were multiples (4×) of the normal plasma concentrations and were as follows (in μm): asparagine, 60; isoleucine, 100; leucine, 250; lysine, 300; methionine, 40; phenylalanine, 50; proline, 100; threonine, 180; tryptophan, 70; valine, 180; alanine, 400; aspartate, 30; glutamate, 100; glutamine, 350; glycine, 300; cysteine, 60; histidine, 60; serine, 200; tyrosine, 75; ornithine, 100. Metabolic labeling of HT-29 cells with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out for 3 h in nutrient-free medium (HBSS), in complete medium, or in the absence or in the presence of amino acids. When used, protein kinase inhibitors (100 μm H-89 (Calbiochem), 5 μm GF103209X (Calbiochem), 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem), 50 μm PD098059 (Calbiochem), 100 μm DRB (Alexis Biochemicals)) were added in the same time. Cells were then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors). 32P-Labeled cell extracts were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C. The anti-GAIP antibody (1/200) (17Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the anti-His antibody (1/500; Invitrogen) was bound to protein A-Sepharose under agitation at 4 °C. 32P-Labeled lysates were incubated with the anti-GAIP/protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) complex for 16 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were sequentially washed with buffer A, three times with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1% SDS), three times with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA), and once with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 16 h at −80 °C. The same blots were used to perform immunoblotting experiments with anti-GAIP and developed using the ECL kit. Phosphoamino acid analysis of GAIP was performed using one-dimensional analysis by the method of Boyle et al. (27Boyle D.M. van der Walt L.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 30: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled GAIP band was located by autoradiography, excised, and then hydrolyzed in 0.25 ml of 5.7 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The sample was dried using a Speed-Vac concentrator and then resuspended in 10 μl of 10/1/189 (v/v/v) acetic acid/pyridine/water. The sample was spotted on a cellulose-coated thin layer electrophoresis plate and subjected to electrophoresis at 1100 V for 45 min with water cooling. Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (1 mg/ml) were used as markers. The plate was dried, sprayed with ninhydrin to localize the phosphoamino acid standards, and then subjected to autoradiography. In all cases, kinetics were done with each kinase to determine the optimum reaction time. Recombinant PKC, PKA, casein kinase II, p38 MAP kinase, and Erk2 were used for in vitro phosphorylation assays according the supplier's instructions. Erk2, p38 MAP kinase, and PKA were used in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35). PKC was used in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml diacylglycerol, and 18.6 μg/ml phosphatidylserine), and casein kinase II was used in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. PKC (0.03 units; Promega), PKA (215 picomolar units; Sigma), casein kinase II (500 units; New England Biolabs), p38 MAP kinase (0.2 units; Upstate Biotechnology), or Erk2 (100 units; New England Biolabs) was incubated with 5 μg of recombinant GAIP in the appropriate reaction buffer and 0.5 mm ATP containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE and submitted to nitrocellulose transfer and autoradiography. The same membranes were used for immunoblotting with the GAIP antibody. The activity of each kinase was monitored using 10 μg of histones or 10 μg of MBP as control substrates (Sigma). The calculation of the stoichiometry of GAIP phosphorylation by Erk2 was based on the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP, the radioactivity incorporated in GAIP determined by Cerenkov counting of the GAIP band excised from a Coomassie Blue SDS-PAGE, and the amount of GAIP estimated by comparison to bovine serum albumin used as a standard. HT-29 cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C in HBSS with or without amino acids, 5 μmGF109203X, or 50 μm PD098059. Cells were scrapped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 5 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm levamisole, 1 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, 1 mg/ml DNase I) and after sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Hundred-μg aliquots of proteins were submitted to 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk. Antibodies phospho-Erk1/2 (1/4000; New England Biolabs) and phospho-p38 MAP kinase (1/2000; New England Biolabs) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer supplemented with 1% BSA. After washing in blocking buffer, membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL). The same membranes were then used with anti-Erk1 (1/1000; Santa Cruz) and anti-Erk2 (1/1000; Santa Cruz) or with anti-p38 MAP kinase (1/1000; Santa Cruz) to detect the complete pool of each MAP kinase. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) was linked to alkaline phosphatase. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out as follows; 250 nm recombinant Gαi3 were loaded with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Lubrol PX, and reactions were next chilled at 4 °C. Free nucleotides were removed by size exclusion chromatography on microspin Sephadex G50. All hydrolysis experiments were done in solution at 4 °C under single turnover conditions. Reactions were started by addition of GAIP mix containing 15 mm MgSO4, 300 μm unlabeled GTP, and 30 nm to 30 μm recombinant proteins (WT GAIP or S151A mutant) when used. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at different times, and reactions were stopped by addition of 750 μm 5% Norit activated charcoal in 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 3.0. Charcoal was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and 400 μl of free phosphate-containing supernatants were counted to determine the amount of Pi released per reaction. Zero time point was obtained by adding 30 μl of [γ -32P]GTP in Norit activated charcoal. No GAP activity could be detected by using boiled GAIP. The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: % GTP hydrolyzed = 100(1 − e −kt ), wherek is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. Measurement of the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long-lived proteins and LDH sequestration were monitored as reported previously (23Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, degradation was measured by an extrapolation of the difference between soluble radioactivity and incorporated radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. To measure the sequestration of cytosolic LDH, we isolated autophagic vacuoles and determined the included LDH activity in sedimentable materials. Metabolic labeling of HT-29 cells with [32P]orthophosphoric acid followed by immunoprecipitation using an anti-GAIP antibody and SDS-PAGE showed that GAIP was a phosphoprotein (Fig. 1 a). Acid hydrolysis of32P-labeled GAIP and thin layer electrophoresis revealed only the presence of phosphoserine residues (Fig. 1 b). After a 3-h period of nutrient starvation in HBSS, the phosphorylation of GAIP was increased 1.5 times when compared with that observed in cells kept in complete medium. Addition of a mix amino acid to HBSS reduced by 60% the phosphorylation of GAIP, suggesting that an amino acid-dependent signaling pathway is involved in the control of the phosphorylation of GAIP.Figure 1GAIP is phosphorylated on serine residues. a, upper part, HT-29 cells were radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 3 h in complete medium, HBSS, or HBSS supplemented with amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The phosphorylation of GAIP was inhibited by 60% and 70% when bisindolylmaleimide (GF109203X), a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor, and PD098059, an inhibitor of the Erk1/2 pathway, were used, respectively. Inhibitors of casein kinase II (DRB) and p38 MAP kinase (SB203580) have only moderate inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of GAIP (10% and 25%, respectively), whereas H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, has no effect. From the above results, we reasoned that the signaling pathway responsible for the phosphorylation of GAIP is controlled by Erk1/2 and/or PKC. Using antibodies directed against the activated forms of Erk1/2, we showed that amino acids and PD098059 were able to reduce the activation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 3 a). By contrast, these products have no effect on the activity of the closely related p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 3 b). These results are in agreement with the inhibition of GAIP phosphorylation stimulated by either amino acids or PD098059. It is well known that PKCs can stimulate the Erk1/2 pathway in different cell types (28Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

According to these data, GF109203X greatly impaired the activation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 3 a) but has only a moderate effect on p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 3 b). This result would explain the inhibitory effect of GF109203X on the phosphorylation of GAIP without totally excluding the possibility that GAIP could be a PKC substrate (see below). In order to examine whether the GAP activity of GAIP is influenced by its phosphorylation, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay using recombinant GAIP and a panel of Ser/Thr protein kinases (corresponding to the inhibitors used in Fig. 2). We then tested the GAP activity of each recombinant phosphorylated GAIP toward the recombinant Gαi3 protein. Incubation of GAIP with purified kinases in the presence of [γ -32P]ATP revealed labeling by PKC, casein kinase II, and Erk2 but not by PKA and the p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 4 a). In parallel control experiments were conducted on histones and myelin basic protein whose substrate characteristics with respect to the different kinases used are well known (see Fig. 4 b and “Experimetnal Procedures”). The ability of recombinant GAIP incubated with PKC, casein kinase II, or Erk2 to accelerate the GTPase activity of Gαi3 protein was determined during a single round of [γ -32P]GTP hydrolysis experiment. At each concentration of GAIP used (from 30 nm to 30 μm), the rate of GTP hydrolysis (k), corresponding to the Pi liberation as a function of time, was calculated. These values were plotted as a function of GAIP concentration (Fig. 4 c). In all assays the Gαi3 protein was present at a concentration of 250 nm. The intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαi3 was 0.022 ± 0.001 s−1. Addition of 30 μm GAIP resulted in acceleration of the GTPase activity by more than 6.5 times (k = 0.145 ± 0.003 s−1) with an EC50 value of 3.16 ± 0.12 μm. This stimulating effect was abolished when boiled GAIP was used. The casein kinase II- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GAIP did not change the rate of GTP hydrolysis when compared with that of the recombinant GAIP (k = 0.146 ± 0.002 s−1, EC50 = 3.15 ± 0.11 μm andk = 0.158 ± 0.002 s−1, EC50 = 3.09 ± 0.12 μm, respectively). However, an increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis and a 3-fold reduction of EC50 for GAIP were observed when was phosphorylation was effectuated by Erk2 (k = 0.187 ± 0.01 s−1, EC50 = 1.12 ± 0.1 μm) as compared with the unphosphorylated recombinant GAIP. The calculation of the estimated stoichiometry of in vitro Erk2 phosphorylation of GAIP indicates an average incorporation of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, suggesting the presence of a single Erk1/2 phosphorylation site. The primary sequence of GAIP contains two consensus sites for PKC and seven consensus sites for casein kinase II (15De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, several SP motifs that are potential phosphorylation sites for MAP kinases are also present. Among them, serine 151 in the RGS domain appears to be the most appropriate consensus site for Erk1/2 (ILSP) (30Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This sequence is highly conserved among the GAIP subfamily (GAIP, Ret-RGS1, and RGSZ1) and absent among the five other RGS subfamilies (5Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 a). For this reason we performed site-directed mutagenesis on Ser151 in order to generate a recombinant S151A GAIP mutant. Both GAIP and the S151A GAIP mutant were then examined in an in vitrophosphorylation assay. The absence of phosphorylation of S151A GAIP mutant by Erk2, shown in Fig. 5 b, is not a consequence of gross modifications of the protein structure because: (i) the GAIP activity of the S151A GAIP protein is close to that of the wild-type GAIP (k = 0.119 ± 0.002 s−1, EC50 = 4.17 ± 0.09 μm versus k= 0.145 ± 0.003 s−1, EC50 = 3.16 ± 0.12 μm), (ii) PKC phosphorylates both the S151A GAIP mutant and wild-type GAIP in a similar manner (Fig. 5 b), and (iii) the heat-denatured S151A GAIP mutant is not a substrate for Erk2 (data not shown). After incubation with PKC or Erk2, the rate of GTP hydrolysis observed in the presence of S151A GAIP mutant was reduced compared with that observed with phosphorylated wild-type GAIP (Fig. 5 c). These data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of serine 151 residue by Erk2 is required for the increase of the GAP activity of GAIP. We have reported that the autophagic pathway is dependent upon the activity of the Gαi3protein and GAIP in HT-29 cells. To study the relationship between GAIP phosphorylation and macroautophagy, we have measured the autophagic sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme LDH in sedimentable material (Table I) and the degradation of long-lived [14C]valine-labeled proteins (Fig. 6) in HT-29 cells transfected with His-tagged expression vectors containing either the wild-type GAIP cDNA or the S151A GAIP mutant cDNA. According to our previous studies (24Ogier-Denis E. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24599-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the overexpression of wild-type GAIP stimulates both autophagic parameters in HT-29 cells (Fig. 6 and Table I). These parameters were greatly reduced when amino acids or PD098059 were added (Fig. 6 and Table I). These results are in line with those shown in Figs. 1 and 2 on the effect of amino acids and PD098059 on both the phosphorylation of GAIP and Erk1/2 activation.Table IEffect of the S151A mutation of GAIP and Erk1/2 activity on autophagic sequestration of LDH in HT-29 cellsHis-tagged vectorGAIP expression 1-aThe ratio of overexpressed GAIP (WT or S151A mutant)/endogenous GAIP was calculated after scanning of a Western blot using an antibody directed against GAIP.

Open table in a new tab By contrast to the stimulatory effect of wild-type GAIP on autophagy, S151A GAIP failed to increase the rate of autophagy in the absence of amino acids under conditions where Erk1/2 MAP kinases were activated in S151 GAIP-expressing cells (data not shown) and the same level of transfected proteins were expressed (Table I). Several studies have shown that the activity of RGS is controlled at the transcriptional level (4De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of RGS (including palmitoylation and phosphorylation) have been reported to be involved in their cellular localization and stability (19Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence thatin vitro phosphorylation of GAIP by the Erk2 MAP kinase increases its GAP activity toward the Gαi3 protein. Substitution of Ser151 by Ala abrogates this stimulation. The GAP activity of S151A GAIP is comparable to that observed with unphosphorylated wild-type GAIP. This result strongly suggests that this GAIP mutant is still functional and able to interact with the Gαi3 protein. Ser151 is located in a loop connecting helices V and VI of GAIP in its RGS domain (32de Alba E. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data have shown that this loop is involved in the interaction of RGS4 and the Gαi1 protein (33Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A critical residue in this loop is RGS4-Asn128. A serine residue (Ser156) in GAIP occupies this position. This characteristic defines a subfamily of RGS proteins, which includes GAIP, RET1-RGS, and RGSZ1 (5Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The sequence upstream of Ser156 is also conserved in this subfamily149Ileu-Leu-Ser-Pro152, whereas in other RGS subfamilies this tetrapeptide is not conserved. The determination of the soluble structure of GAIP by NMR techniques has suggested that, upon binding to Gαi, conformational rearrangements of the loop V-VI may facilitate the formation of electrostatic interactions that stabilize the RGS protein structure (32de Alba E. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylation of Ser151 could directly interfere with the residues of Gαi actively involved in GTP hydrolysis or stabilize GAIP structure to optimize its GAP activity remains to be elucidated by structural studies. According to the presence of potential phosphorylation sites in its sequence, GAIP was in vitro phosphorylated by casein kinase II and PKC but not by PKA and p38 MAP kinase. These results are in good agreement with the inhibition profile of GAIP phosphorylation observedin vivo. Recently it has been reported that the casein kinase II-dependent phosphorylation of GAIP on Ser24 (outside of RGS domain) could regulate its membrane association (21Fischer T. Elenko E. Wan L. Thomas G. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although Ser151 is a potential phosphorylation site for PKC, it is not likely to be a substrate for this kinase in vitro because the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the S151A GAIP mutant was similar to that of the wild-type GAIP. However, it is interesting to note that a PKC site is located in the C-terminal part of GAIP (Thr201) in the vicinity of a GIPC, a PDZ domain-containing protein, interacting site (34De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These data suggest that depending on the acting Ser/Thr protein kinase, the occupancy of different phosphorylation sites regulates different functional properties of GAIP. Following up the above reported results, we have shown that GAIP is phosphorylated in a Erk1/2-dependent manner in a cellular environment. This adds a novel mammalian non-nuclear substrate for Erk1/2 MAP kinases (35Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). The list of non-nuclear MAP kinase substrates includes several proteins involved in the interruption of G protein signaling pathways (members of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins (20Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggests that MAP kinases can act as feedback regulators of trimeric G protein signaling. The recent demonstration of this feedback control of MAP kinases on G protein signaling via RGS in yeast emphasizes the importance of this regulation loop, which has been conserved during evolution (20Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, our work concerns the signal control of the macroautophagic pathway. Previously, we have demonstrated that GAIP is a regulator of the Gi3 protein-dependent macroautophagic pathway in intestinal derived HT-29 cells (24Ogier-Denis E. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24599-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A hallmark of macroautophagy in many mammalian cells including HT-29 cells is to be inhibited by amino acids (26Mortimore G.E. Miotto G. Venerando R. Kadowaki M. Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenium Publishing Corp., New York1996: 93-136Google Scholar). This inhibition has been demonstrated to be dependent upon the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein by the activation p70S6 kinase in rat hepatocytes (37Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is also operative in HT-29 cells. 2E. Ogier-Denis, S. Pattingre, J. El Benna, and P. Codogno, unpublished results. Here we report that amino acids can control autophagy by inhibiting Erk1/2-dependent GAIP phosphorylation. This control is dependent upon the presence of Ser151 in GAIP suggesting that the Erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser151 accelerates the GTP hydrolysis by the Gαi3 protein. This would be in line with our previous data showing that the GDP-bound form of the Gαi3 protein increases the rate of autophagy (23Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In HT-29 cells amino acids have a coordinated inhibitory effect on autophagy by activating the p70S6 kinase and inhibiting the Erk1/2 pathway. The mechanism by which amino acids control the Erk1/2 pathway in this cell line remains to be investigated. The control of macroautophagy by the p38 MAP kinase has been reported in rat hepatocytes in response to change in cell volume (38Haussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. Vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although care must be taken in extrapolating data from different experimental models, a role for the MAP kinase family in the control of the signaling of a major catabolic pathway could be a new function for these kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2079527824,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is required for the production of mature red blood cells. The requirement for Epo and its receptor (EpoR) for normal heart development and the response of vascular endothelium and cells of neural origin to Epo provide evidence that the function of Epo as a growth factor or cytokine to protect cells from apoptosis extends beyond the hematopoietic lineage. We now report that the EpoR is expressed on myoblasts and can mediate a biological response of these cells to treatment with Epo. Primary murine satellite cells and myoblast C2C12 cells, both of which express endogenous EpoR, exhibit a proliferative response to Epo and a marked decrease in terminal differentiation to form myotubes. We also observed that Epo stimulation activates Jak2/Stat5 signal transduction and increases cytoplasmic calcium, which is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. In erythroid progenitor cells, Epo stimulates induction of transcription factor GATA-1 and EpoR; in C2C12 cells, GATA-3 and EpoR expression are induced. The decrease in differentiation of C2C12 cells is concomitant with an increase in Myf-5 and MyoD expression and inhibition of myogenin induction during differentiation, altering the pattern of expression of the MyoD family of transcription factors during muscle differentiation. These data suggest that, rather than acting in an instructive or specific mode for differentiation, Epo can stimulate proliferation of myoblasts to expand the progenitor population during differentiation and may have a potential role in muscle development or repair."

We have recently discovered that CCAAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) induces gene transcription through a novel IFN response element called the γ-IFN-activated transcriptional element (Roy, S. K., Wachira, S. J., Weihua, X., Hu, J., and Kalvakolanu, D. V. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 12626–12632. Here, we describe a new IFN-γ-stimulated pathway that operates C/EBP-β-regulated gene expression independent of JAK1. We show that ERKs are activated by IFN-γ to stimulate C/EBP-β-dependent expression. Sustained ERK activation directly correlated with C/EBP-βdependent gene expression in response to IFN-γ. Mutant MKK1, its inhibitors, and mutant ERK suppressed IFN-γ-stimulated gene induction through the γ-IFN-activated transcriptional element. Ras and Raf activation was not required for this process. Furthermore, Raf-1 phosphorylation negatively correlated with its activity. Interestingly, C/EBP-β-induced gene expression required STAT1, but not JAK1. A C/EBP-β mutant lacking the ERK phosphorylation site failed to promote IFN-stimulated gene expression. Thus, our data link C/EBP-β to IFN-γ signaling through ERKs.

Induction of ISGs occurs primarily due to the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Type I (IFN-α/β) and type II (IFN-γ) IFNs bind to distinct cell-surface receptors and activate the signals that up-regulate the expression of ISGs (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Upon binding to their receptor, IFN-α/β induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of receptor using the JAKs Tyk2 and JAK1. JAKs undergo tyrosyl phosphorylation prior to inducing the receptor phosphorylation. Activated JAKs phosphorylate the STAT2 and STAT1 proteins at critical tyrosines. The STAT2-STAT1 dimer dissociates from the receptor and forms a heteromeric complex with a DNA-binding protein, p48 or IFN regulatory factor-9 or ISGF3γ (3Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This complex, known as ISGF3, binds to the IFN-stimulated response element of the ISGs and induces gene expression (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Ligand-activated IFN-γ receptor recruits the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2, which selectively stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT1 (4Bach E.A. Tanner J.W. Marsters S. Ashkenazi A. Aguet M. Shaw A.S. Schreiber R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). STAT1 dimers then rapidly migrate to the nucleus and induce the expression of ISGs that contain a γ-IFN-activated site (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). STAT activation does not require new protein synthesis and is short-lived, lasting no longer than 30 min after ligand/receptor engagement. It does not persist over longer periods of time, despite the presence of IFN in the extracellular environment (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The SOCS-1 (suppressor ofcytokine signaling-1) protein has been shown to be critical for inhibiting IFN-γ responses in vivo(8Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Induction of ISGs by IFN-γ is far more complex than that of IFN-α/β, largely due to the facts that the temporal control of these genes is variable and that, in some cases, blockade of protein synthesis prevents their expression (9Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These data suggest that IFN-γ may activate different transactivating factors in a JAK-STAT-dependent or -independent manner. Evidence for these pathways is only beginning to accumulate. For example, the repression of the c-myc gene by IFN-γ occurs via both STAT1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (10Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N. Chernov M. Nguyen H. Goh K.C. Williams B.R.

IFN-γ augments IFN-α/β-induced gene expression by up-regulating the gene encoding the p48 subunit of ISGF3 (16Bandyopadhyay S.K. Kalvakolanu D.V. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell.

Certain oncogenic viruses down-regulate p48 expression to evade the action of IFNs (18Kalvakolanu D.V. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 166-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and its activity is inhibited in some human tumor cell lines (19Petricoin E.R. David M. Fang H. Grimley P. Larner A.C. Vande Pol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IFN-γ-induced expression of the p48 gene is rather slow (12–18 h) and is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (16Bandyopadhyay S.K. Kalvakolanu D.V. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of a novel regulatory element and its cognate factors. Promoter analysis revealed that the p48 gene promoter has no γ-IFN-activated site, but instead contains a unique IFN-γ response element termed GATE (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although GATE is partially homologous to the IFN-stimulated response element, factors that bind to the IFN-stimulated response element do not bind to GATE. The activity of GATE-binding factors is modulated by IFN-γ and is inhibited by cycloheximide and staurosporine (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that IFN-γ regulates not only the synthesis of GATE-binding factors, but also their post-translational modifications. We have recently identified one of these as the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) (21Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a regulator of acute-phase responses and cell differentiation (22Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv.

Although overexpression of C/EBP-β alone elevates basal gene expression, treatment with IFN-γ further augments gene expression through GATE (21Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our recent study demonstrated for the first time a role for C/EBP-β in IFN-γ-regulated gene expression. Since the JAK-STAT pathway is rapidly activated and deactivated after IFN-γ treatment (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar), it was unclear which kinases could regulate the function of C/EBP-β under these conditions. C/EBP-β binds to the consensus sequence TTNNGNAAT (14Chin K.C. Mao C. Skinner C. Riley J.L. Wright K.L. Moreno C.S. Stark G.R. Boss J.M. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 687-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Brickey W.J. Wright K.L. Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6622-6630PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of GATE is as following: 5′-CCCGAGGAGAATTGAAACTTAGGG-3′. Six of the nine nucleotides in this region of GATE are homologous to the consensus C/EBP-β-binding site. Mutation of the AAACTT nucleotides of wild-type GATE resulted in a loss of C/EBP-β binding. In addition, a shorter GATE (GAGGAGGAATTGAAACTT) that encompassed the C/EBP-β-binding site (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or the C/EBP-binding site of GATE alone did not support gene induction by IFN-γ (data not shown). Furthermore, the majority (80%) of the IFN-γ-induced response was lost upon mutation of the C/EBP-β-binding site. Thus, a full-length GATE including the C/EBP-β-binding site is critical for IFN-γ induction. In addition, a C/EBP-β mutant lacking the transactivation domain blunted GATE-dependent gene expression (21Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These data together indicate that C/EBP-β is an important component of GATE-dependent gene expression. In this investigation, we show that IFN-γ stimulates the transcriptional activity of C/EBP-β through activation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs, but independently of c-Raf and c-Ras. Pharmacological and gene-specific dominant-negative inhibitors of MKK1, ERK1, and ERK2 block gene expression. Surprisingly, STAT1, but not JAK1, is required to activate the C/EBP-β-dependent IFN-γ response. Together, our study identifies a new IFN-γ signaling pathway that couples the ERKs (MAPKs) to C/EBP-β-dependent gene regulation. Recombinant murine IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); human IFN-γ (Pestka Biomedical Labs); IL-6 (Genzyme Corp.); staurosporine (Sigma); PD98059, SB202190, and SB202474 (Calbiochem); and U0126 (Promega) were used in this study. Antibodies specific for phospho-ERK1/2 (Sigma) and ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, p38, Raf-1, C/EBP-β, tubulin, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as recommended by the manufacturers. The RAW murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.

These cell lines express human chromosome 21, which provides the accessory factor of the receptor, and permit human IFN-γ-induced actions in the mouse background. The murine ISGF3γ (p48) promoter construct P4 has been described in our previous study (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this construct, a 74-base pair element of the murine p48 gene promoter encompassing GATE was cloned upstream of the SV40 early promoter. This construct, like the wild-type full-length promoter, consistently responds to IFN-γ and C/EBP-β (21Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol.

Catalytically inactive dominant-negative mutants of ERK1 (K71R) and ERK2 (K52R) cloned into the pCEP4 vector (33Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

The wild-type, constitutively active, and kinase-inactive MKK1 cDNAs cloned into pCMV were described previously (32Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol.

Kinase-inactive MKK1 has a K97M mutation, and the constitutively active MKK1 mutant has a deletion in the N-terminal region from amino acids 44 to 51 and serines 218 and 222 mutated to glutamate and aspartate, respectively (32Shapiro P.S.

Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Constitutively active c-Raf (Raf-BXB) and dominant-negative c-Raf were described previously (37Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The authenticity of these mutants has been confirmed using a luciferase reporter gene driven by the AP-1 response element (AP-1RE). The AP-1RE-Luc plasmid was provided by Robert Freund (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). In this construct, two copies of the consensus AP-1RE were inserted upstream of the SV40 early promoter in the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). Northern and Western blot analyses, transfection, β-galactosidase and luciferase assays, and SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described in our earlier work (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA (1.5 μg) was kept constant by adding pBluescript SK DNA where required. In general, 0.4 μg of luciferase and 0.1 μg of C/EBP-β expression vector were used. A β-actin promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter (0.2 μg) was used as an internal control for normalizing variations in transfection efficiency as described in our previous study (20Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transfection assays were repeated at least three times. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were essentially similar to those described in common laboratory manuals (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). After stimulation with the indicated reagents, cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described (32Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ERK2-, JNK1-, p38-, or Raf-1-specific antibodies (0.4 μg) conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to immunoprecipitate the cognate proteins from ∼200 μg of total cell protein at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. ERK2, JNK1, p38, and Raf-1 kinase activities were determined using 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase-Jun-(1–79), glutathione S-transferase-activating transcription factor-2, and wild-type MKK1 coupled to kinase-inactive ERK2, respectively. Kinase reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins in the kinase reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted, and substrate phosphorylation was determined by PhosphorImager analysis. For analyzing active ERK1/2, cell lysates were prepared as described above, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using the phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody. Total ERK was determined in these samples by using antibodies specific for ERK2 or ERK1. Intensity of the activated ERK bands was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. Data from at least three independent samples are presented in the bar graphs. To understand the role of protein kinases in IFN-γ-stimulated gene expression through GATE, we studied the influence of staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor. The RAW macrophage cell line was transfected with the P4 reporter gene, in which a 74-base pair element from the p48 promoter drives the expression of the luciferase gene. Cells were treated with IFN-γ in the presence or absence of staurosporine. Although IFN-γ alone strongly up-regulated GATE-dependent gene expression, it was strongly blocked by staurosporine (Fig.1 A). Since C/EBP-β binds to GATE and induces gene expression (21Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we examined whether staurosporine also blocks C/EBP-β-regulated gene expression. As expected, C/EBP-β strongly induced luciferase gene expression upon cotransfection with the P4 reporter compared with the vector-transfected cells (compare the scales of Fig. 1, Aand B). Treatment of cells with IFN-γ further enhanced C/EBP-induced expression. Staurosporine treatment not only inhibited IFN-γ-augmented gene expression, but also yielded lower luciferase activity than that obtained with C/EBP-β alone. These data suggest that C/EBP-β undergoes phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ treatment. Since staurosporine is a general protein kinase inhibitor and recent reports indicated that MAPKs are activated during IFN treatment (39Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar,40Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of different inhibitors of the MAPK pathways on IFN-γ-induced gene expression through GATE. Three inhibitors, PD98059 (an MKK1-specific inhibitor), SB202474 (a negative control inhibitor for MKK1), and SB202190 (a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor), were used in this study. RAW cells were transfected with the P4 reporter gene and then treated with a 25 μmconcentration of each inhibitor prepared in Me2SO prior to IFN-γ treatment. PD98059, but not the negative control inhibitor SB202474, strongly blocked gene expression (Fig. 1 C). SB202190 was marginally inhibitory at this dose, but this low-level inhibition is probably not specific since p38 MAPK is not activated under these conditions (see below). PD98059 inhibits activation of MKK1 and suppresses the phosphorylation of ERKs (41Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). We also studied the effect of a synthetic compound, U0126 (42Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), that specifically blocks the activated MKK1 function (i.e. ERK activation) on IFN-γ-induced gene expression. U0126 inhibited IFN-γ-induced gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 D). Treatment with Me2SO (vehicle) had no effect on gene induction by IFN-γ. Thus, MKK1 activation appears to be necessary for IFN-γ-induced gene expression. The effect of MKK1 inhibitors on endogenous p48 (ISGF3γ) gene expression was also studied. RAW cells were treated with IFN-γ in the presence or absence of either SB202190 or PD98059 for 16 h. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted, Northern-blotted, and probed with p48 cDNA (Fig. 2 A). IFN-γ strongly induced the expression of p48 mRNA (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, PD98059, but not SB202190, strongly inhibited IFN-γ-induced gene expression (compare lanes 3 and 4). A 6–8-fold reduction of p48 mRNA expression occurred. Neither inhibitor alone significantly altered p48 mRNA levels (lanes 5 and 6). Although the blot shows a marginal increase in the p48 mRNA signal with the inhibitors alone, this is not a reproducible effect. A reprobing of these blots with 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA revealed the presence of a comparable amount of RNA in all lanes (Fig. 2 B). Thus, a reporter driven by p48 promoter elements and endogenous p48 behave in similar manner in the presence of the MKK inhibitor PD98059. Based on above results, we next examined the effect of MKK1 inhibitors on C/EBP-β-dependent gene expression. Cells were transfected with the P4 reporter and C/EBP-β expression vector and then treated with IFN-γ in the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitors. C/EBP-β itself induced gene expression, and IFN-γ, as expected, stimulated it very strongly (Fig. 1 E). PD98059, but not SB202474, strongly inhibited C/EBP-β-dependent gene expression stimulated by IFN-γ. To ascertain the specificity of such inhibition, a similar experiment was performed using U0126. As expected, U0126 inhibited IFN-γ-stimulated expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 F). To directly demonstrate the role of MKK1 (MEK1), the effect of MKK1 coexpression on GATE-dependent gene expression was determined. Three different MKK1 expression vectors that carry the wild-type, constitutively active, or non-catalytic mutant MKK1 cDNA were employed in these experiments. A control transfection with the pCMV4 vector was also performed. Overexpression of the wild-type MKK1 cDNA alone slightly induced the luciferase gene compared with the vector control (Fig.3 A). Treatment with IFN-γ further stimulated the activity. The constitutively active MKK1 mutant elevated basal expression and augmented IFN-γ-induced expression to significantly higher levels compared with the wild-type MKK1 control. Thus, MKK1 may drive gene expres"
https://openalex.org/W2070139659,"The Forkhead family transcription factor FKHRL1, a mammalian homolog of DAF16 in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, is an inducer of apoptosis in its unphosphorylated form and was recently reported as a substrate of Akt kinases. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is a potent stimulant of Akt kinase, leading to inhibition of the apoptotic pathway. In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 in PC12 cells and various neuronal cell types and examined the potential role of Akt in this regard. IGF-1 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin (0.25–2 μm) and LY294002 (12.5–100 μm), but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) or the p70 S6 kinase pathway inhibitor rapamycin (50 nm), suggesting that the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway. As observed for IGF-1, an in vitro kinase assay with purified active Akt kinase demonstrated that the kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at Thr32 and Ser253, leading to inhibition of its pro-apoptotic properties. Moreover, transient expression of constitutively active Akt (MS-Akt, where MS is a myristylation signal) increased the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, whereas the expression of kinase-dead Akt (M179A Akt) attenuated the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 in PC12 cells. Interestingly, FKHRL1 co-immunoprecipitated with Akt in PC12 cells, indicating that these two proteins can associate in these cells. As IGF-1 also induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in primary cortical and cerebellar neuronal cultures, these data, taken together, demonstrate that IGF-1, acting via the PI3K/Akt kinase pathway, can regulate the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, leading to inhibition of this apoptotic transcription factor in neuronal cells.

Akt, a key target of PI3K, is the cellular homolog of v-Akt and an important serine/threonine protein kinase mediating cell survival induced by many survival factors, including IGF-1 (7Dudek H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Akt can phosphorylate Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315 of FKHRL1 in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Thr32 and Ser253 by Akt inhibits the stimulatory effect of FKHRL1 on the transcription of genes that encode death-activating proteins such as the Fas ligand, leading to the survival of target cells. However, very little information is currently available on the effect of IGF-1 and Akt on the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in neuronal cells. Accordingly, the major aim of this study was to investigate if IGF-1, acting via the PI3K/Akt kinase pathway, was able to induce the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in neuronal cells, possibly leading to enhanced cell survival. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were used in addition to primary rat cortical and cerebellar neuronal cultures. IGF-1 was found to be a potent stimulant of FKHRL1 phosphorylation in these cells. Human recombinant IGF-1 was obtained as a gift from Genentech Inc. (San Francisco, CA). LY294002, PD98059, rapamycin, and GO6983 were purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany), and wortmannin, leupeptin, aprotinin, sodium vanadate, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Sigma. U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-FKHRL1(Ser253), anti-FKHRL1, and anti-Akt antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake placid, NY), and anti-FKHRL1(Thr32) antibody was a gift from this company. Anti-FKHRL1 antibody detects FKHRL1 or closely related proteins, whereas anti-FKHRL1(Thr32) and anti-FKHRL1(Ser253) antibodies recognize phosphorylated FKHRL1 Thr32 and phosphorylated FKHRL1 Ser253, respectively. The full selectivity of these antibodies to distinguish between the various Forkhead family transcription factors remains to be established. Anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-GSK3α/β antibodies and GSK3α fusion proteins were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) and anti-GSK3α/β is also a gift from Dr. A. Nelsbach in the same company. Anti-ERK and anti-hemagglutinin A (HA) antibodies and all secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell culture reagents and LipofectAMINETM 2000 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and all other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. The CMV6, CMV6-PH-Akt-HA, and CMV6-M179A-Akt-HA plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. Sandeep S. R. Datta and M. E. Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and HA-PKB-CAAX (where PKB is protein kinase B and A is aliphatic amino acid) was given to us by Dr. B. M. Burgering (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands) (34Van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

The β-galactosidase staining kit containing the CMV-LacZ control vector was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Gordon Guroff (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and cultured as described before (35Zheng W.H. Fink Jr., D.W. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1868-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13377-13385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cells, human kidney 293 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Dumont, Douglas Hospital Research Center), and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (for NIH 3T3 and 293 cells with 5% fetal bovine serum). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The stock culture was routinely subcultured at a 1:5 ratio at 1-week intervals. Transient transfections of PC12 cells with Akt were performed as suggested by Life Technologies, Inc. with LipofectAMINE 2000. Briefly, PC12 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum without antibiotics. On the following day, 0.8 μg of DNA in 50 μl of Opti-MEM® reduced serum medium was mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 prediluted in 50 μl of the same medium for each well. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min to allow DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 complexes to form, 100 μl of mixture was added to each well. Then, the plate was shaken gently, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24–48 h before the assay was performed. Transfection efficiency was determined by cotransfection with a CMV-LacZ control vector at a 1:10 control vector/DNA ratio, followed by in situ staining with the β-galactosidase staining kit as suggested by Invitrogen. The expression of Akt in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Cortical and cerebellar cultured neurons were prepared from fetuses (embryonic day 19) obtained from pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) and cultured as described previously (37Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Animal care was according to protocols and guidelines approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Neurons were plated at density of 5–8 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates (coated with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine) under serum-free conditions in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.). On the third day of plating, the medium was replaced with neurobasal supplemented with N2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the experimental treatment was performed on the seventh day of plating. Before each experiment, cells were detached using 5 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced buffer and seeded in 12- or 6-well plates (coated with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine) at a density of 4–8 ×105 cells/well in 2% serum medium for 24 h. The culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for primary cultures, the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium) 2 h before the desired reagents were added. To study the effect of IGF-1 on the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and Akt, cells were treated with 10 nm (100 nmfor primary cultures) IGF-1 for 10 min. Alternatively, cells were pretreated with wortmannin (0.5 μm, 20 min), LY294002 (50 μm, 20 min), rapamycin (50 nm, 20 min), GO6983 (0.5 μm, 20 min), and PD98059 (50 μm, 40 min), followed by stimulation with 10 nm IGF-1. For the experiments with protein kinase C, 400 nm PMA was added to cells 2.5 min prior to IGF-1 stimulation. To evaluate the effect of peroxovanadate, 50 μm peroxovanadate for 10 min was used. Peroxovanadate was prepared fresh by incubating 12 mm sodium vanadate and 12 mm H2O2 in 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 25 °C prior to use as described (38Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Rahn T. Resjo S.

Western blotting was performed as described earlier with some modifications (35Zheng W.H. Fink Jr., D.W. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1868-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol.

Briefly, treated cells from different experimental conditions were rinsed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced buffer and lysed in either sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 1% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) or RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples with equal amounts of protein were then separated by 4–20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resolved proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were then washed twice with TBST and probed with the corresponding secondary antibodies (anti-rat/mouse/rabbit/goat) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were finally washed several times with TBST to remove unbound secondary antibodies and visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). A part of the SDS gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure the use of equal amounts of protein. The respective phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK, and FKHRL1 was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK, or a mixture of anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Thr32) and anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Ser253) antibodies, respectively. To establish the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 at Thr32 or Ser253, anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Thr32) or anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Ser253) antibody used, respectively. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt or anti-ERK antibodies to ensure that equal amounts of Akt were present. In the case of FKHRL1, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody as a control. In some experiments, two parallel running gels loaded with identical samples were used. One of them was used to evaluate the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, whereas the other was used to determine FKHRL1 levels in cell extracts. The effect of IGF-1 was determined by comparing the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and the FKHRL1 level in cell extracts determined as described above. Quantification of the blots was performed using the MCID image analysis system (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario). The levels of phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and Akt were normalized to the amount of β-actin or Akt present in each band, and IGF-1-stimulated FKHRL1/Akt phosphorylation was calculated as the level of FKHRL1/Akt phosphorylation seen in IGF-1-stimulated cellsversus untreated cells. PC12 cells pretreated with 0.5 μm wortmannin were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in pre-cooled RIPA buffer and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were then pelleted at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the concentration of protein in each sample (supernatant) was determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding method with bovine serum as a standard. The supernatant (with an equal amount of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FKHRL1 antibody. Formed immunocomplexes were isolated by protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with RIPA buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmMgCl2). Next, an in vitro kinase reaction was carried out in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing precipitated FKHRL1 with or without 0.2 μg of purified active Aktα and 200 μm ATP. In the positive control tubes, precipitated FKHRL1 was replaced by 0.2 μg of GSK3α fusion protein as substrate. Following a 30-min incubation at 33 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 5× reduced SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylation of FKHRL1 at Thr32 and Ser253was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Thr32) and anti-FKHRL1(Ser253) antibodies, respectively. Akt activity was determined by Western blotting by measuring the phosphorylation of the GSK3α fusion protein with anti-phospho-GSK3α/β antibody. PC12 cells treated with or without 10 nm IGF-1 for 10 min were lysed in pre-cooled RIPA buffer, and Akt was isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-Akt antibody as described above. Precipitated Akt was separated by 4–20% SDS gel electrophoresis, and then the association with FKHRL1 was determined by Western blotting. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt antibody to ensure the presence of equal amounts of Akt proteins. Quantification of the blots was performed as described above, and the amount of FKHRL1 associated with Akt was normalized to total Akt present in each lane. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance with the Newman-Keul test was used to establish statistical significance set at p < 0.05. PC12 cells were treated with 10 nm IGF-1 for different times (0–40 min), and the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, Akt, and MAPK/ERK kinase was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), IGF-1 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and Akt in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of both FKHRL1 and Akt was evident at 5 min and peaked at about the same time to remain stable for at least 40 min. IGF-1 also induced the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase. However, the activation of MAPK was transient, peaking at 5 min to decrease thereafter. Additionally, Fig. 1 (B and D) demonstrates that the effect of IGF-1 on the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 was concentration-dependent, with a significant effect observed at 0.11 nm, reaching a maximal level at ∼1 nm IGF-1. Having established that IGF-1 can induce the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, we studied the signaling pathways mediating the action of IGF-1. Fig. 2 A(lane 5 versus lane 1) demonstrates that 10 nm IGF-1 caused a 3–6-fold increase in the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and Akt.

UT-A1, UT-A3, and UT-A4 are transcribed from a single initiation site at the 5′-end of the gene; a distinct internal initiation site is used for UT-A2 transcription. We cloned 1.3 kilobases (kb) of the 5′-flanking region upstream of the transcription start site of UT-A1, UT-A3, and UT-A4. This region contains three CCAAT sequences but lacks a TATA motif. A tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE) was identified at −377bp. The 1.3-kb full fragment subcloned into pGL3 vector induced luciferase activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells in isotonic medium. Luciferase activity was increased significantly in hypertonic medium, whereas deletion or mutation of the TonE sequence abolished this response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the 5′ UT-A TonE sequence as DNA probe showed formation of a specific DNA-protein complex with nuclear extracts from cells exposed to hypertonic medium and was weakly detectable in isotonic controls. A supershift in the mobility of the DNA-protein complex was observed with antiserum targeted to the TonE-binding protein (TonEBP). Co-transfection with dominant-negative TonEBP abolished the luciferase activity induced by the UT-A 1.3-kb construct under hypertonic and isotonic conditions. These data suggest that the TonE/TonEBP pathway mediates tonicity-responsive transcriptional regulation of UT-A1, UT-A3, and UT-A4 expression."

The integrin protein family is directly involved in most cell-matrix contacts and cell adhesion events. Many pathologic events, including tumor progression, angiogenesis, and vascular disease, also involve integrins (3Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar, 4Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 5Coller B.S. Anderson K. Weisman H.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In most cases cell adhesion is stringently regulated, both spatially and temporally. Spatial regulation is achieved by the expression patterns of the integrins and their various ligands. Temporal regulation of adhesion is conferred by a process called integrin “activation.” Activation unshields the integrin ligand binding site, increasing its ligand binding affinity. The activation, and de-activation, of integrins is crucial to events like morphogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and platelet aggregation (6Martin-Bermudo M.D. Dunin-Borkowski O.M. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

The subject of this study is platelet integrin αIIbβ3, an excellent paradigm of the integrin protein family. Integrin αIIbβ3 is a particularly relevant model for the study of integrin activation because its function on the platelet requires physiologic activation (9Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Integrin αIIbβ3 is maintained in a resting state on circulating platelets. However, agonists like ADP or thrombin induce activation of the integrin. This activation facilitates the binding of soluble fibrinogen, leading to the formation of a platelet aggregate, or thrombus, that halts the loss of blood. Consequently, activation of αIIbβ3 is key for normal hemostasis. Importantly, though, improper activation of αIIbβ3 can have lethal consequences. Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques can cause activation of αIIbβ3 on platelets and can lead to myocardial infarct (10Jang Y. Lincoff A.M. Plow E.F. Topol E.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1994; 24: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which integrins are activated and de-activated is still not completely understood. A significant body of work has focused on how alterations to integrin cytoplasmic domains control activation. In one well supported model, changes in the conformation of the cytoplasmic tails are thought to release a conformational constraint, or open an “integrin hinge” (11Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The release of this hinge is believed to translate into conformational rearrangements in the extracellular face of the integrin that expose the ligand binding site. The physical association of the integrin cytoplasmic domain with regulatory proteins (12Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), like those controlled by Ha-Ras and R-Ras (15Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), also strongly support the idea that activation can be controlled from the cytoplasm. Activation of integrins by events in the cytoplasm has been termed “inside-out” signaling (for reviews, see Refs. 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 17Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 Suppl. 11: S91-S95Google Scholar, and 18Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The physical size of the integrin extracellular domains far exceeds the size of the cytoplasmic domains, and suggests ample opportunity for regulation at the extracellular face. We recently compared the resting and active forms of αIIbβ3 by high resolution peptide mapping, and identified a difference in their conformation at a disulfide-bonded knot in the extracellular domain of β3 (19Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This knot comprises the cysteine-rich domain of β3 and a small segment of the amino terminus. The two are connected by a single long range disulfide bond (20Beer J. Coller B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17564-17573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). No information is available to suggest a mechanism by which the conformational changes to this domain in the ectodomain are enacted during activation. Does the extracellular domain simply respond to conformational modulation initiated within the cytoplasm, or can activation be controlled at this site in the ectodomain independent of factors in the cytoplasm? Over the last decade, there has been an increased appreciation for the role of redox chemistry in the regulation of biological systems. For example, the vasoactivity of hemoglobin, the function of the NMDA receptor, and the regulation of transcription by OxyR, are all regulated by redox modulation at specific cysteine residues (22Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 23Kim W.K. Choi Y.B. Rayudu P.V. Das P. Asaad W. Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Could integrin function be modulated in an analogous manner by redox rearrangements within the cysteine-rich domain? Hints of this possibility come from some of the earliest studies on nitric oxide (NO). For example, NO can block platelet adhesive events that are known to involve integrin αIIbβ3 (25Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Lancet. 1987; 2: 1057-1058Abstract PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 26Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc.

Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little consideration has been given to the possibility that redox agents like NO could regulate cell adhesion by direct action on integrins. There has been no indication that redox modulation within an integrin was even possible, particularly given the belief that all of the cysteine residues within integrins are disulfide-bonded. Here we show that αIIbβ3 contains a small number of free cysteines, and that the redox status of these residues can directly influence activation state. These findings provide the first direct link between redox biology and cell-matrix interactions, and have important implications for the mechanisms underlying nitrosative and oxidative stress. The two forms of integrin αIIbβ3, activation state-1 (AS-1)1 and AS-2 were purified according to previously published procedures (28Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Haering P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fitzgerald L.A. Leung B. Phillips D.R. Anal.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of αIIbβ3, the peptide KYGRGDS was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications. To analyze the depth of the integrins' ligand binding pocket, affinity resins were constructed in which the KYGRGDS peptide was coupled to the resin with an extended spacer. This was accomplished using procedures we have reported previously (31Yan B. Ma L. Zou H. Meng Q. Yan G. Huang Z., Yu, J. Cheng Y. Chin. Biochem. J. 1992; 8: 755-758Google Scholar). Limited digestion of HPDP-modified αIIbβ3 was accomplished with V8 protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade) in the presence of 2 mm KYGRGDS. V8 was added to purified αIIbβ3 (1 mg/ml) of 100 μg in 100 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protease was added in a ratio of 1:200 (weight to weight) and incubated with integrin at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by heating to 65 °C. After cooling, the sample was applied to avidin-Sepharose (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 18 h. Then, the beads were washed with buffer A extensively, the bound peptides were eluted with dithiothreitol (DTT), and the peptides were visualized on 10–20% SDS-PAGE. Peptide mass fingerprinting (32Cottrell J.S. Peptide Res. 1994; 7: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pappin D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 64: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar) was used to define the composition of the cysteine-containing fragments of β3. The procedures for this analysis essentially paralleled those of our prior reports (19Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS spectra were obtained with a Voyager DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse). Spectra were collected in reflector mode. Blood was drawn from healthy human donors into 0.15 volume of acid-citrate/dextrose solution supplemented with 1 μm prostaglandin E1 and 1 unit/ml apyrase. Platelets were purified from platelet-rich plasma on an albumin cushion as described (35Timmons S. Hawiger J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation experiments were performed with 450 μl of purified platelets at 37 °C with constant stirring in an optical aggregometer (Chronolog). Modification of free cysteine residues was performed with biotin-BMCC and biotin-HPDP according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) specifications. Briefly, αIIbβ3 was reacted with 0.1 mmamounts of these reagents at ambient temperature for 30 min. Unbound reagent was removed by exhaustive dialysis, and the modified integrin was subjected to further analysis as described under “Results.” To quantity the free cysteines, αIIbβ3 was alkylated with [14C]iodoacetamide. Integrin was denatured by 6 m guanidine chloride, treated with 0.2 mEDTA, and labeled with [14C]iodoacetamide (1:500 molar ratio). The alkylated integrin was quantitatively precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was washed several times with Tyrode's buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 10% SDS at 50 °C, and then subjected to scintillation counting to determine the incorporation of isotope into integrin. Purified platelets were labeled with biotin-BMCC, pelleted by centrifugation, lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and then αIIbβ3 was enriched by an affinity step with concanavalin A-Sepharose. The concanavalin A eluate, containing enriched αIIbβ3, was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA. This material was subjected to immunoprecipitation with control pre-immune antisera, or antisera T545, which binds to β3 (36Smith J.W. Vestal D.J. Irwin S.V. Burke T.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS-buffer and Laemmli buffer, and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Samples were transferred to PVDF membranes, which were probed with HRP-conjugated avidin (Sigma) and then developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. AS-1 was activatedin vitro by treatment with 3 mm DTT on ice for 5 min, followed by dialysis to remove excess of DTT. This treatment was found to quantitatively activate all of the treated AS-1 as assessed by the ability of the integrin to bind to RGD-Sepharose. The effect of chemical modification of free cysteines on this activation procedure was measured by first treating AS-1 with 0.1 mmbiotin-BMCC, followed by dialysis overnight. The sample was then treated with DTT (3 mm) for 5 min on ice and dialyzed again to remove DTT. The ligand binding function of each sample was assessed with RGD affinity resins comprising either short or long chemical spacers. AS-2 was converted to a resting conformation by incubation with a mixture of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and reduced glutathione (GSH). SNP and GSH were added simultaneously. Briefly, 3 mmglutathione and 1 mm SNP were added to 20 μg of AS-2 in Buffer A. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at ambient temperature. Treated samples were then assessed for ligand binding function by measuring their ability to bind to RGD affinity columns in which the RGD is linked to the beads directly (short spacer) or through an extended chemical spacer (see above). Although all integrins contain a large number of cysteines in their extracellular domains, these are all generally believed to be disulfide-bonded. This belief is largely based on disulfide mapping studies carried out on β3 (21Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Despite the rigor of that study, the bond status of many cysteines within the β3 subunit could not be ascertained because they are closely spaced within a single domain. Here, we re-examined the status of cysteine residues within integrin using two sulfhydryl modifying agents, biotin-BMCC and biotin-HPDP. Both agents conjugate a biotin to free sulfhydryls. Modification with biotin-HPDP has additional utility because it can be released from the tagged sulfhydryl by reduction. The resting (AS-1) and active (AS-2) conformers of αIIbβ3, and a series of control proteins, were modified with biotin-BMCC. Blots of these proteins were probed with HRP-avidin to assess for incorporation of biotin. Biotin-BMCC failed to label α-chymotrypsinogen, which lacks free sulfhydryls (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), but it did modify BSA and protein-disulfide isomerase, both of which contain free cysteines (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2 and 3). Biotin-BMCC also strongly labeled both AS-1 and AS-2, primarily on the β3subunit (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and5). In the absence of modification with biotin-BMCC, no labeling of integrin was detected on blots (lanes 6 and 7). Biotin-HPDP, the reversible modification agent, also modified β3 integrin. Modification by this probe could be reversed by treatment with reducing agent (Fig. 1 B). These observations are the first to indicate that any integrin contains free cysteine residues. In all cases, the αIIb subunit was modified to a substantially lower degree. AS-1 and AS-2 were consistently labeled with the sulfhydryl modification reagents. However, the possibility existed that only a small fraction of the protein, perhaps a small component that was artifactually denatured during purification, actually contained free cysteines. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine what fraction of the purified integrin contains unpaired cysteine residues (Fig. 2). This was accomplished by modifying AS-1 (lanes 1–3) and AS-2 (lanes 4–6) with biotin-BMCC, and then subjecting the modified integrin to precipitation with an avidin affinity resin (Soft-Link™). After labeling, both forms of the integrin could be quantitatively removed from solution by the avidin affinity resin. This finding indicates that virtually all of the purified integrin contains unpaired cysteines. To exclude the possibility that the free cysteines in integrin were an artifact of purification, we used biotin-BMCC to probe αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface. Platelets were isolated from freshly drawn blood on cushions of BSA (35Timmons S. Hawiger J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and then exposed to biotin-BMCC. Following modification, free BMCC was removed by six gentle washes, and the platelets were lysed with detergent. A vast excess of oxidized glutathione and iodoacetamide were included in the lysis buffer to ensure that disulfide bonds were not artifactually reduced as a consequence of lysis. Platelet integrin αIIbβ3 was then immunoprecipitated, and blots of this material were probed with avidin-HRP to visualize biotinylated bands. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (lanes 3 and5), platelet β3 was modified with biotin-BMCC. In experiments that included 12 separate blood donors, platelet β3 was always labeled with the modification reagent. Modifications to the αIIb subunit on the platelet surface were not detected. No modification was detected in the precipitates from pre-immune antisera or in immunoprecipitates from non-modified platelets (data not shown). To map the location of the free cysteine residues within αIIbβ3, the integrin was modified with biotin-HPDP and then digested with V8 protease. To limit the extent of digestion, proteolysis was performed in the presence of 2 mm KYGRGDS, which partially stabilizes integrin to proteolysis (19Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Haering P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide fragments of integrin containing biotin-HPDP were purified on avidin-Sepharose. The column was eluted with DTT, which breaks a bond in HPDP, releasing bound protein. Two protein bands were eluted in this manner (Fig. 4 A). The fragment at 14 kDa corresponds to an avidin monomer that is nonspecifically eluted from the column. The ∼30-kDa band was excised and further digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting tryptic peptides were then analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Spectra from two independent experiments are shown (Fig. 4,B and C). Peaks corresponding to peptide fragments from β3 are labeled with asterisks(iodoacetamide adducts) and arrows (acrylamide adducts). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that all of these peptides, eight from the first labeling experiment and six from the second experiment, corresponded to fragments from the cysteine-rich domain of β3. The position of each of the detected peptides within β3 is shown in Fig. 4 D (bold anditalics). Based on these analyses, we conclude that the ∼30-kDa fragment comprises a domain that spans residues 400–650 of β3. These observations localize the free cysteine residues of the integrin to the same disulfide-bonded knot that exhibits conformational differences in resting versus active integrin (19Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R.

Experiments were conducted to determine if AS-1 and AS-2 exhibit a difference in the number of unpaired cysteine residues. This was accomplished by alkylation of integrin with [14C]iodoacetamide. These studies were performed in denaturing detergent to maximally expose free cysteines. Following alkylation, the integrin was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and the amount of [14C]iodoacetamide incorporated into the protein was determined by scintillation counting. As shown in Table I, the extent of labeling was remarkably consistent among different batches of integrin, and from experiment to experiment. The measurements show that AS-1 contains between 2 and 3 free cysteines, and that AS-2 contains between 4 and 5 free cysteines. Importantly, in each of six side-by-side comparisons, AS-2 was always found to have two additional free sulfhydryl residues, a value that corresponds to one reduced disulfide bond.Table INumber of free cysteines in αIIbβ3AS-1AS-2Repetition 12.54.4Repetition 22.94.8Repetition 32.54.4Repetition 42.33.9Repetition 52.03.8Repetition 63.25.22.6 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab We and others have previously found that mild reduction of resting αIIbβ3 (AS-1) with DTT can convert it to an active state (19Yan B.

This activation could arise from the reduction of a single disulfide bond, or from bond re-shuffling between the free cysteines and existing disulfides. In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the effects of modifying the free cysteines within AS-1 on activation. Activation of the integrin was assessed by its ability to bind to two different RGD affinity resins. The RGD binding site within the resting form of αIIbβ3 is buried, and this conformer can only bind to affinity columns when the RGD peptide is extended from the resin by a long chemical spacer. In contrast, activated αIIbβ3 has a shallow RGD binding site and it can bind to affinity resins where the RGD peptide is linked directly to the resin (19Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Haering P. Steiner B. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5, purified AS-1 is unable to bind to KYGRGDS-Sepharose until activated with DTT (comparelanes 1 and 3). Interestingly, however, prior modification of the free cysteines within AS-1 with biotin-BMCC prevented its activation by DTT (lane 4). Such modification with biotin-BMCC blocked the activation of more than 90% of the integrin, as only about 10% of the AS-1 could be stimulated to bind to RGD-Sepharose following activation with DTT. The effects of biotin-BMCC were not due to an inactivation of the RGD binding site on the integrin by biotin-BMCC because modified AS-1 is still able to bind to RGD columns in which the peptide is linked to the resin via a long chemical spacer (lane 5). Furthermore, modification of the free cysteine residues within AS-2 by biotin-BMCC had no effect on its RGD binding function (lane 6). These studies show that chemical modification of the free sulfhydryls in AS-1 can prevent its activation without directly affecting its RGD binding site. These observations strongly indicate that disulfide bond rearrangement is involved in the activation process. This analysis was extended to determine if modification of the free cysteine residues of αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface could prevent activation. In this case, we used platelet aggregation as a physiologically relevant readout of activation of αIIbβ3. Platelets were separated from the constituents of plasma, and then the free cysteine residues on the platelet were modified by a brief treatment with biotin-BMCC as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the first series of studies, DTT was used as an agonist (Fig. 6 A). As others have reported (39Peerschke E.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Zucker M.B. Masiello N.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), DTT induced aggregation of platelets (trace 1), although the rate of aggregation and the size of the aggregates was smaller than when platelets are stimulated by physiologic agonists. Modification of platelets with biotin-BMCC prior to exposure of the platelets to DTT blocked DTT-induced aggregation (trace 2). Similar experiments were conducted with ADP, a physiologic platelet agonist. Modification of platelets with biotin-BMCC also prevented ADP-induced aggregation of platelets (Fig. 6 B, trace 2). We cannot exclude the possibility that biotin-BMCC also modifies sulfhydryls on other platelet proteins, and that these could be involved in the activation process. Nevertheless, the coherence between the results obtained with purified integrin, and on the platelet surface, strongly indicates a mechanistic link between the free cysteine residues in β3and activation. A series of studies were conducted to explore the converse hypothesis, namely that modification of the free cysteines within AS-2 could convert it to a resting integrin. Because NO and NO donors exhibit potent anti-platelet activity, we reasoned that exposure of AS-2 to nitrosylating conditions may be able to convert it to AS-1. Therefore, we exposed AS-2 to nitrosylating agents and tested its activation state by measuring its ability to bind RGD affinity resins with short and long spacing groups. Two types of modification were tested: direct modification with NO, using nitroprusside as donor, and modification with a mixture of nitroprusside and reduced glutathione (GSH). As shown in Fig. 7 A, exposure of AS-2 to nitroprusside had no effect on the integrins ability to bind to RGD columns lacking a spacer (lane 2). In contrast, inclusion of glutathione during exposure to the NO donor eliminated the ability of the integrin to bind to the RGD column (lane 3). It is important to emphasize that the modification of AS-2 by NO/GSH is not simply denaturation of the integrin because its ligand binding function is retained. It is still able to bind to RGD columns in which the peptide is extended from the resin by a long chemical spacer (lanes 4–6). Rather, such modification induces a conformational change that buries the RGD binding site. In a second series of experiments, we tested the ability of mild reduction to re-activate the de-activated AS-2. AS-2 was de-activated with NO/GSH, di"

Inhibition of GLUT1 expression either by high glucose conditions or with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides significantly lowers protein expression and function of GLUT1 and as a result induces a high rate of apoptosis at the blastocyst stage. Similar to wild-type mice, embryos from streptozotocin-induced diabetic Bax −/− mice experienced a significant decrease in glucose transport compared with embryos from non-diabetic Bax −/− mice. However, despite this decrease, these blastocysts demonstrate significantly fewer apoptotic nuclei as compared with blastocysts from hyperglycemic wild-type mice. This decrease in preimplantation apoptosis correlates with a decrease in resorptions and malformations among the infants of the hyperglycemicBax −/− mice versus the Bax +/+ and +/− mice. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia by decreasing glucose transport acts as a cell death signal to trigger a BAX-dependent apoptotic cascade in the murine blastocyst. This work also supports the hypothesis that increased apoptosis at a blastocyst stage because of maternal hyperglycemia may result in loss of key progenitor cells and manifest as a resorption or malformation, two adverse pregnancy outcomes more common in diabetic women.

Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). Culturing two-cell embryos for 72 h in high concentrations of glucose (30 or 52 mm) likewise causes a decrease in the expression of these facilitative transporters at the mRNA and protein levels. This decrease in transporter expression leads to a significant drop in intraembryonic free glucose levels in blastocysts obtained from mice made hyperglycemic by streptozotocin injection or after culturing two-cell embryos from normal mice in high glucose. Blastocysts cultured under similar conditions also experience a 6-fold increase in expression of the proapoptotic protein BAX, as compared with controls and undergo increased apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Approximately 40% of all nuclei from embryos from hyperglycemic mothers showed evidence of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling or TUNEL-positive staining compared with less than 10% among controls. This apoptotic event requires BAX expression because blastocysts recovered from diabetic Bax−/− mice are resistant to the hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. Similarly, the hyperglycemia-induced event is inhibited partially with either the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-FMK), or the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, strongly suggesting that these apoptosis-associated pathways are involved. Apoptosis at this developmental stage may manifest later in pregnancy as a malformation or, if a significant cell loss occurs, as a miscarriage. Both these adverse pregnancy outcomes occur more frequently in infants of diabetic women (3Greene M.F. Hare J.W. Cloherty J.P. Benacerraf B.R. Soeldner J.S. Teratology. 1989; 39: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research GroupAm. J. Obstet.

BMJ. 1997; 315: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and thus hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis at this preimplantation stage may explain the increased incidence of these pregnancy complications.In these experiments, we hypothesize that the hyperglycemia-induced decrease in glucose transport is responsible for triggering apoptosis. This phenomenon has been described in other cell systems (6Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Bialik S. Cryns V.L.

Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of presumed upstream and downstream components. First, we examined whether blocking GLUT1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides at the blastocyst stage leads to apoptosis. This would suggest that decreased intracellular glucose and not hyperglycemia per se triggers the death cascade. Second, we examined whether BAX expression is downstream of glucose transport using a Bax null model. In agreement with our initial hypothesis, we would predict that BAX expression is downstream of glucose transport and thus maternal hyperglycemia would have the same effect of decreasing transport in embryos fromBax −/− mice as seen in embryos from Bax +/+ mice. However, these embryos because of BAX deficiency would not undergo apoptosis.We also hypothesize that a glucose-induced increase in apoptosis at this developmental stage may manifest later in pregnancy as a malformation or, if a significant cell loss occurs, as a miscarriage. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of maternal diabetes in the Bax-deficient mice on fetal malformations and pregnancy resorptions. We know from previous work that lack of BAX expression protects the blastocyst from glucose-induced apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, if this preimplantation event manifests later in pregnancy as a miscarriage or malformation, these Bax null mice should experience fewer reproductive complications of maternal hyperglycemia.DISCUSSIONThese experiments demonstrate that decreased expression of GLUT1 in the mouse blastocyst caused by exposure to GLUT1 antisense oligonucleotide probes results in decreased glucose transport and an increase in apoptosis. In addition, hyperglycemia in the Bax−/− mother causes a decrease in embryonic glucose transport at the blastocyst stage as is seen in wild-type Bax +/+ mice. The embryos lacking BAX expression, however, fail to undergo apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that this apoptotic event experienced in conditions of hyperglycemia is triggered by a decrease in glucose transporter expression. Previously, we have shown in two separate reports that hyperglycemia leads to apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and concurrently to decreased transporter expression (1Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). These findings clarify that the two events are not unrelated parallel responses to hyperglycemia and reveal that the decrease in glucose transport caused by hyperglycemia directly triggers a downstream BAX-dependent apoptotic event. This conclusion is significant because the majority of studies reported, which relate diabetes and hyperglycemia to apoptosis, assume that the high glucose triggers programmed cell death by accumulation of intracellular glucose levels or glucotoxicity (16Di Wu Q. Wang J.H. Fennessy F. Redmond H.P. Bouchier-Hayes D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1229-C1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baumgartner-Parzer S.M. Wagner L. Pettermann M. Grillari J. Gessl A.

Several studies in a number of different cell types have shown, in accordance with our findings, that decreased transport and metabolism of glucose modify programmed cell death (Refs. 6Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. McCoy K.D. Kansara M. Rudert F. J.

Three cell death paradigms exist that link a decrease in glucose transport to apoptosis. These include 1) glucose deprivation-induced ATP depletion and stimulation of the mitochondrial death pathway cascade (7Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A.

Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E.

Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar).In this embryonic model, it is possible that low levels of ATP because of decreased glucose utilization may be responsible for triggering apoptosis. At a blastocyst stage embryonic energy metabolism changes from the use of pyruvate via the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to the use of glucose via glycolysis to generate lactate (30Brison D.R. Leese H.J. Zygote. 1994; 2: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Martin K.L. Leese H.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Brinster R.L. Thomson J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1966; 42: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This switch is believed to be because of anaerobic conditions that occur at this time of implantation and result in less efficient production of ATP (33Leese H.J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1995; 1: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34Wales R.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1986; 76: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Leese H.J. Wiley L.M. Heyner S. Early Embryo Development and Paracrine Relationships. UCLA Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology. Wiley-Liss, NY1991: 117Google Scholar). This physiologic decrease in ATP production coupled with the hyperglycemia-induced decrease in glucose transport and thus glucose utilization seen in embryos exposed to hyperglycemia may act to trigger apoptosis via this paradigm.Altered embryonic redox state may also play a role in high glucose-induced embryonic apoptosis. In postimplantation models of diabetes-induced malformations, it has been shown that antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (36Wentzel P. Eriksson U.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), butylated hydroxytoluene (37Eriksson U.J. Siman C.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and vitamins C (38Siman C.M. Eriksson U.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and E (15Siman C.M. Eriksson U.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) reduce the incidence of anomalies by decreasing oxygen-free radicals during organogenesis. Two factors are different in the blastocyst model. First, we are looking at a preimplantation event, prior to organogenesis. Second, postimplantation models support intracellular hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia as the cause of increased oxygen-free radicals. Similar to our blastocyst model, hyperglycemia also has been shown to induce a down-regulation of glucose transporters leading to glucose deprivation in retinal capillary pericytes (39Mandarino L.J. Finlayson J. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 964-972PubMed Google Scholar). High initial intracellular glucose levels in this condition lead to accelerated elimination of reactive oxygen species generated by glucose auto-oxidation and by the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio (9Liu X. He Z. Yanoff M. Jian B. Ye X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular glucose levels then drop rapidly as glucose transporter expression decreases in response to the hyperglycemia. As a result of these rapid changes, reduced glutathione levels are depleted, and expression of GSH peroxidase is increased. These data indicate that the increased susceptibility of pericytes to oxidative stress is determined by the exacerbated imbalance between pro-oxidant factors and those factors that scavenge them in response to hyperglycemia (9Liu X. He Z. Yanoff M. Jian B. Ye X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of this oxidative stress, expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 decreases while BAX expression increases, and DNA fragmentation occurs, thus linking oxidative stress to apoptosis in this system. These events were reversed by antioxidants and did not occur in retinal endothelial cells. It is possible that the same mechanisms are at work in the blastocyst model, and experiments are needed to determine whether these apoptotic events are reversible by antioxidants.Finally, expression of HIF-1α in response to intracellular hypoglycemia may play a role at this stage of development. In embryonic stem cells, Carmeiliet et al. (28Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar) have shown that hypoglycemia or hypoxia-induced expression or HIF-1α result in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis (28Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). This adaptation is not seen in ES cells deficient in HIF-1α expression; however, apoptosis is induced by other agents such as cytokines. Other studies have shown that in response to hypoxia or hypoglycemia, HIF-1α accumulates and directly associates with and stabilizes active wild-type p53 (29An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). It is possible then that this increase in p53 protein is responsible for the apoptosis demonstrated in our blastocyst model. We have preliminary data to suggest that p53 may be involved in hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis in the blastocyst as p53 −/− blastocysts fail to demonstrate increased TUNEL-positive nuclei in response to hyperglycemia. 2K. H. Moley, unpublished results.Further studies are needed to determine whether this is related to HIF-1α effects.These studies also strongly suggest that this glucose-triggered apoptosis is responsible in part for diabetes-associated malformations and late resorptions because the diabetic Bax −/− mouse failed to demonstrate the adverse pregnancy outcomes seen in theBax +/+ and +/− mice. One emerging hypothesis for the etiology of some diabetes-associated malformations is hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. In models of both pre- and postimplantation diabetic anomalies, apoptosis has been detected in the tissues destined to show evidence of malformations (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 40Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Homma S. Yaginuma H. Oppenheim R.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 345: 377-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms are not identical for these two different time points in development, the theme is the same; hyperglycemia of maternal diabetes triggers exaggerated programmed cell death in the developing murine embryo resulting in congenital malformations in the postimplantation models. It appears that elevated glucose levels disturb expression of regulatory genes in embryonic development and cell cycle progression resulting in premature cell death of progenitor cells and subsequently defective morphogenesis. In the postimplantation diabetic models, alterations in apoptotic pathway-related gene expression, specifically the transcription factor Pax-3, directly result in neural tube, musculoskeletal, and cardiac defects (40Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two downstream targets of Pax-3, cdc46, and Dep-1, have been determined (42Hill A.L. Phelan S.A. Loeken M.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Cai J. Phelan S.A. Hill A.L. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, the upstream regulators of Pax-3 expression by hyperglycemia are not yet clear. The mechanisms clarifying apoptosis-induced malformations in these models have yet to be determined.This is the first time preimplantation apoptotic events have been linked to malformations and late resorptions. Although this BAX dependent effect may in part be because of postimplantation anti-apoptotic events, we predict that these pregnancy outcomes are in large part because of the drastic preimplantation differences seen between the genotypes. This work supports our hypothesis that the increased programmed cell death at this stage of development results in loss of key progenitor cells in the embryo and in turn this event manifests later in pregnancy as a pregnancy loss or congenital malformation. Both these pregnancy outcomes are more common in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and these findings may provide one possible explanation for this increased incidence. In prior studies, it has been shown that maternal hyperglycemia results in down-regulation of the embryonic facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT),1 GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT3, at the blastocyst stage of mouse development (1Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). Culturing two-cell embryos for 72 h in high concentrations of glucose (30 or 52 mm) likewise causes a decrease in the expression of these facilitative transporters at the mRNA and protein levels. This decrease in transporter expression leads to a significant drop in intraembryonic free glucose levels in blastocysts obtained from mice made hyperglycemic by streptozotocin injection or after culturing two-cell embryos from normal mice in high glucose. Blastocysts cultured under similar conditions also experience a 6-fold increase in expression of the proapoptotic protein BAX, as compared with controls and undergo increased apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Approximately 40% of all nuclei from embryos from hyperglycemic mothers showed evidence of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling or TUNEL-positive staining compared with less than 10% among controls. This apoptotic event requires BAX expression because blastocysts recovered from diabetic Bax−/− mice are resistant to the hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. Similarly, the hyperglycemia-induced event is inhibited partially with either the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-FMK), or the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, strongly suggesting that these apoptosis-associated pathways are involved. Apoptosis at this developmental stage may manifest later in pregnancy as a malformation or, if a significant cell loss occurs, as a miscarriage. Both these adverse pregnancy outcomes occur more frequently in infants of diabetic women (3Greene M.F. Hare J.W. Cloherty J.P. Benacerraf B.R. Soeldner J.S. Teratology. 1989; 39: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research GroupAm. J. Obstet.

BMJ. 1997; 315: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and thus hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis at this preimplantation stage may explain the increased incidence of these pregnancy complications. In these experiments, we hypothesize that the hyperglycemia-induced decrease in glucose transport is responsible for triggering apoptosis. This phenomenon has been described in other cell systems (6Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8Deckwerth T.L. Easton R.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 152: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Liu X. He Z. Yanoff M. Jian B. Ye X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of presumed upstream and downstream components. First, we examined whether blocking GLUT1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides at the blastocyst stage leads to apoptosis. This would suggest that decreased intracellular glucose and not hyperglycemia per se triggers the death cascade. Second, we examined whether BAX expression is downstream of glucose transport using a Bax null model. In agreement with our initial hypothesis, we would predict that BAX expression is downstream of glucose transport and thus maternal hyperglycemia would have the same effect of decreasing transport in embryos fromBax −/− mice as seen in embryos from Bax +/+ mice. However, these embryos because of BAX deficiency would not undergo apoptosis. We also hypothesize that a glucose-induced increase in apoptosis at this developmental stage may manifest later in pregnancy as a malformation or, if a significant cell loss occurs, as a miscarriage. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of maternal diabetes in the Bax-deficient mice on fetal malformations and pregnancy resorptions. We know from previous work that lack of BAX expression protects the blastocyst from glucose-induced apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, if this preimplantation event manifests later in pregnancy as a miscarriage or malformation, these Bax null mice should experience fewer reproductive complications of maternal hyperglycemia. DISCUSSIONThese experiments demonstrate that decreased expression of GLUT1 in the mouse blastocyst caused by exposure to GLUT1 antisense oligonucleotide probes results in decreased glucose transport and an increase in apoptosis. In addition, hyperglycemia in the Bax−/− mother causes a decrease in embryonic glucose transport at the blastocyst stage as is seen in wild-type Bax +/+ mice. The embryos lacking BAX expression, however, fail to undergo apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that this apoptotic event experienced in conditions of hyperglycemia is triggered by a decrease in glucose transporter expression. Previously, we have shown in two separate reports that hyperglycemia leads to apoptosis (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and concurrently to decreased transporter expression (1Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). These findings clarify that the two events are not unrelated parallel responses to hyperglycemia and reveal that the decrease in glucose transport caused by hyperglycemia directly triggers a downstream BAX-dependent apoptotic event. This conclusion is significant because the majority of studies reported, which relate diabetes and hyperglycemia to apoptosis, assume that the high glucose triggers programmed cell death by accumulation of intracellular glucose levels or glucotoxicity (16Di Wu Q. Wang J.H. Fennessy F. Redmond H.P. Bouchier-Hayes D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1229-C1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baumgartner-Parzer S.M. Wagner L. Pettermann M. Grillari J. Gessl A.

Several studies in a number of different cell types have shown, in accordance with our findings, that decreased transport and metabolism of glucose modify programmed cell death (Refs. 6Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. McCoy K.D. Kansara M. Rudert F. J.

Three cell death paradigms exist that link a decrease in glucose transport to apoptosis. These include 1) glucose deprivation-induced ATP depletion and stimulation of the mitochondrial death pathway cascade (7Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A.

Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E.

Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar).In this embryonic model, it is possible that low levels of ATP because of decreased glucose utilization may be responsible for triggering apoptosis. At a blastocyst stage embryonic energy metabolism changes from the use of pyruvate via the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to the use of glucose via glycolysis to generate lactate (30Brison D.R. Leese H.J. Zygote. 1994; 2: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Martin K.L. Leese H.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Brinster R.L. Thomson J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1966; 42: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This switch is believed to be because of anaerobic conditions that occur at this time of implantation and result in less efficient production of ATP (33Leese H.J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1995; 1: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34Wales R.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1986; 76: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Leese H.J. Wiley L.M. Heyner S. Early Embryo Development and Paracrine Relationships. UCLA Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology. Wiley-Liss, NY1991: 117Google Scholar). This physiologic decrease in ATP production coupled with the hyperglycemia-induced decrease in glucose transport and thus glucose utilization seen in embryos exposed to hyperglycemia may act to trigger apoptosis via this paradigm.Altered embryonic redox state may also play a role in high glucose-induced embryonic apoptosis. In postimplantation models of diabetes-induced malformations, it has been shown that antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (36Wentzel P. Eriksson U.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), butylated hydroxytoluene (37Eriksson U.J. Siman C.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and vitamins C (38Siman C.M. Eriksson U.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and E (15Siman C.M. Eriksson U.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) reduce the incidence of anomalies by decreasing oxygen-free radicals during organogenesis. Two factors are different in the blastocyst model. First, we are looking at a preimplantation event, prior to organogenesis. Second, postimplantation models support intracellular hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia as the cause of increased oxygen-free radicals. Similar to our blastocyst model, hyperglycemia also has been shown to induce a down-regulation of glucose transporters leading to glucose deprivation in retinal capillary pericytes (39Mandarino L.J. Finlayson J. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 964-972PubMed Google Scholar). High initial intracellular glucose levels in this condition lead to accelerated elimination of reactive oxygen species generated by glucose auto-oxidation and by the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio (9Liu X. He Z. Yanoff M. Jian B. Ye X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular glucose levels then drop rapidly as glucose transporter expression decreases in response to the hyperglycemia. As a result of these rapid changes, reduced glutathione levels are depleted, and expression of GSH peroxidase is increased. These data indicate that the increased susceptibility of pericytes to oxidative stress is determined by the exacerbated imbalance between pro-oxidant factors and those factors that scavenge them in response to hyperglycemia (9Liu X. He Z. Yanoff M. Jian B. Ye X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of this oxidative stress, expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 decreases while BAX expression increases, and DNA fragmentation occurs, thus linking oxidative stress to apoptosis in this system. These events were reversed by antioxidants and did not occur in retinal endothelial cells. It is possible that the same mechanisms are at work in the blastocyst model, and experiments are needed to determine whether these apoptotic events are reversible by antioxidants.Finally, expression of HIF-1α in response to intracellular hypoglycemia may play a role at this stage of development. In embryonic stem cells, Carmeiliet et al. (28Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar) have shown that hypoglycemia or hypoxia-induced expression or HIF-1α result in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis (28Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). This adaptation is not seen in ES cells deficient in HIF-1α expression; however, apoptosis is induced by other agents such as cytokines. Other studies have shown that in response to hypoxia or hypoglycemia, HIF-1α accumulates and directly associates with and stabilizes active wild-type p53 (29An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). It is possible then that this increase in p53 protein is responsible for the apoptosis demonstrated in our blastocyst model. We have preliminary data to suggest that p53 may be involved in hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis in the blastocyst as p53 −/− blastocysts fail to demonstrate increased TUNEL-positive nuclei in response to hyperglycemia. 2K. H. Moley, unpublished results.Further studies are needed to determine whether this is related to HIF-1α effects.These studies also strongly suggest that this glucose-triggered apoptosis is responsible in part for diabetes-associated malformations and late resorptions because the diabetic Bax −/− mouse failed to demonstrate the adverse pregnancy outcomes seen in theBax +/+ and +/− mice. One emerging hypothesis for the etiology of some diabetes-associated malformations is hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. In models of both pre- and postimplantation diabetic anomalies, apoptosis has been detected in the tissues destined to show evidence of malformations (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 40Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Homma S. Yaginuma H. Oppenheim R.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 345: 377-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms are not identical for these two different time points in development, the theme is the same; hyperglycemia of maternal diabetes triggers exaggerated programmed cell death in the developing murine embryo resulting in congenital malformations in the postimplantation models. It appears that elevated glucose levels disturb expression of regulatory genes in embryonic development and cell cycle progression resulting in premature cell death of progenitor cells and subsequently defective morphogenesis. In the postimplantation diabetic models, alterations in apoptotic pathway-related gene expression, specifically the transcription factor Pax-3, directly result in neural tube, musculoskeletal, and cardiac defects (40Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two downstream targets of Pax-3, cdc46, and Dep-1, have been determined (42Hill A.L. Phelan S.A. Loeken M.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Cai J. Phelan S.A. Hill A.L. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, the upstream regulators of Pax-3 expression by hyperglycemia are not yet clear. The mechanisms clarifying apoptosis-induced malformations in these models have yet to be determined.This is the first time preimplantation apoptotic events have been linked to malformations and late resorptions. Although this BAX dependent effect may in part be because of postimplantation anti-apoptotic events, we predict that these pregnancy outcomes are in large part because of the drastic preimplantation differences seen between the genotypes. This work supports our hypothesis that the increased programmed cell death at this stage of development results in loss of key progenitor cells in the embryo and in turn this event manifests later in pregnancy as a pregnancy loss or congenital malformation. Both these pregnancy outcomes are more common in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and these findings may provide one possible explanation for this increased incidence. These experiments demonstrate that decreased expression of GLUT1 in the mouse blastocyst caused by exposure to GLUT1 antisense oligonucleotide probes results in decreased glucose transport and an increase in apoptosis. In addition, hyperglycemia in the Bax−/− mother causes a decrease in embryonic glucose transport at the blastocyst stage as is seen in wild-type Bax +/+ mice.

These studies also strongly suggest that this glucose-triggered apoptosis is responsible in part for diabetes-associated malformations and late resorptions because the diabetic Bax −/− mouse failed to demonstrate the adverse pregnancy outcomes seen in theBax +/+ and +/− mice. One emerging hypothesis for the etiology of some diabetes-associated malformations is hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. In models of both pre- and postimplantation diabetic anomalies, apoptosis has been detected in the tissues destined to show evidence of malformations (2Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M.

Although the mechanisms are not identical for these two different time points in development, the theme is the same; hyperglycemia of maternal diabetes triggers exaggerated programmed cell death in the developing murine embryo resulting in congenital malformations in the postimplantation models. It appears that elevated glucose levels disturb expression of regulatory genes in embryonic development and cell cycle progression resulting in premature cell death of progenitor cells and subsequently defective morphogenesis. In the postimplantation diabetic models, alterations in apoptotic pathway-related gene expression, specifically the transcription factor Pax-3, directly result in neural tube, musculoskeletal, and cardiac defects (40Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two downstream targets of Pax-3, cdc46, and Dep-1, have been determined (42Hill A.L. Phelan S.A. Loeken M.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Cai J. Phelan S.A. Hill A.L. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, the upstream regulators of Pax-3 expression by hyperglycemia are not yet clear. The mechanisms clarifying apoptosis-induced malformations in these models have yet to be determined. This is the first time preimplantation apoptotic events have been linked to malformations and late resorptions. Although this BAX dependent effect may in part be because of postimplantation anti-apoptotic events, we predict that these pregnancy outcomes are in large part because of the drastic preimplantation differences seen between the genotypes. This work supports our hypothesis that the increased programmed cell death at this stage of development results in loss of key progenitor cells in the embryo and in turn this event manifests later in pregnancy as a pregnancy loss or congenital malformation. Both these pregnancy outcomes are more common in women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and these findings may provide one possible explanation for this increased incidence."

Since cardiac and neuronal L-type (α1C) voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are not modulated in this way, they are presumed to lack interaction with Gβγ. However, here we demonstrate that both Gβγ and calmodulin directly bind to cytosolic N and C termini of the α1C subunit. Coexpression of Gβγ reduces the current via the L-type channels. The inhibition depends on the presence of calmodulin, occurs at basal cellular levels of Ca2+, and is eliminated by EGTA. The N and C termini of α1C appear to serve as partially independent but interacting inhibitory gates. Deletion of the N terminus or of the distal half of the C terminus eliminates the inhibitory effect of Gβγ. Deletion of the N terminus profoundly impairs the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland1992Google Scholar). Mammalian VDCCs fall into several families distinguished by pharmacological and biophysical properties (L, N, P/Q, T, and R type) and the molecular identity of the main, pore−forming subunit, α1 (2Snutch T.P.

The neuronal N- and P/Q-type channels, based on α1B and α1A, respectively, are crucial for neurotransmitter release (3Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). L-type Ca2+ channels containing the “cardiac-type” α1C subunit regulate contraction of cardiac and smooth muscle, and excitability and gene expression in the brain (2Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Reuter H. Nature. 1983; 301: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 6Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The α1 subunits contain four homologous membrane domains numbered I−IV and 5 large intracellular segments: N terminus (NT), C terminus (CT), and linkers between the domains (often called loops L1, L2, and L3). There is also a large number of short intracellular linkers between transmembrane segments within each domain. Activation in all voltage-dependent channels is initiated by a voltage-driven shift in charged transmembrane elements (7Armstrong C.M. Hille B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the parts of the channel and the auxiliary subunits which are not exposed to the membrane electrical field may substantially modulate the gating (for reviews related to Ca2+ channels, see Ref. 3Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In particular, VDCCs are strongly and specifically modulated by neurotransmitters acting via heterotrimeric G proteins, via actions on the cytosolic parts of the channel. Some of the modulations are mediated by G protein-triggered second messenger cascades, often via protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC, respectively), others by a direct interaction with G protein subunits (1Hille B.

The latter is fast, membrane−delimited, mediated by Gβγ, and occurs in α1A (P/Q), α1B (N), and α1E (11Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Curr. Opin.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 131-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hallmark of this modulation is relief of inhibition and acceleration of current activation by depolarization (voltage-dependent facilitation), which reflects a decrease in the affinity of the channel to Gβγ (24Patil P.G. de Leon M.

A major part of inactivation of L-type VDCCs is triggered by the entry of Ca2+ (33Eckert R. Chad J.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 215-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM) has been recently identified as the Ca2+ sensor indispensable for the Ca2+-dependent inactivation in L (α1C)- and P/Q (α1A)-type channels (34Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T.

Ca2+-dependent CaM interaction with this domain has been found crucial not only for the Ca2+-dependent inactivation, but also for an opposite effect of Ca2+, calledCa 2+ -dependent facilitation (34Qin N.

Despite the outstanding role of cytosolic segments in channel modulation, our ideas of how these parts affect the gating of the VDCCs are vague. The L-type (α1C) channel is the best studied in this respect; but even here, only the roles of N and C termini have been examined. Removal of the distal half of the CT increases L-type channel currents and open probability by improving the coupling between gating charge (voltage sensor) movement and pore opening (38Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CT acts as an inhibitory gate that conformationally restrains the opening of the channel (38Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Klockner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly to the CT, removal of the NT also enhances the open probability and the macroscopic currents in L-type channels, and a similar role (of an inhibitory gate) for the NT has been proposed (16Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N.

The L-type channel is not inhibited by neurotransmitters in a voltage-dependent manner (32Herlitze S. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the L1 loop of α1C does not bind Gβγ (15Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent facilitation has been demonstrated in L-type VDCC, but it was PKA- rather than G protein-dependent (Refs. 40Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 43Sculptoreanu A. Rotman E. Takahashi M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, α1C has been assumed to lack any interaction with Gβγ. α1C even served in several studies as a donor of presumably Gβγ-indifferent parts, to create chimeras with other α1 types, in the search for parts of α1 that determine the sensitivity to Gβγ. However, here we demonstrate that Gβγ binds to NT and CT of α1C and inhibits the L-type VDCC in a voltage-independent but calmodulin-dependent manner. We identify a novel CaM-binding site in the NT, which, like the previously identified CT-binding site, is an important determinant of the Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation. We propose a model in which NT and CT of the L-type channel form a scaffold that plays a role of an inhibitory gate which integrates the regulatory effects of Gβγ and CaM.

The truncated cDNA was subcloned back into pGEM-SB. The ΔNΔC mutant was constructed by cutting and ligating the appropriate parts of ΔN2–139 and ΔC1700-end mutants. The RNAs were prepared using a standard procedure (50Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, [35S]Met/Cys-labeled Gβ1, Gγ2, CaM, and CaM1234 were translated on the template of in vitro synthesized RNAs using a rabbit reticulocyte translation kit (Promega). The fusion proteins were synthesized and extracted from Escherichia coli using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech kit. Purified GST fusion proteins (5–10 μg) or purified GST (10 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of the lysate, containing the 35S-labeled proteins in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, for 2 h at room temperature, with gentle rocking. In some experiments the incubation was done in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5 C, the incubation was done in the same buffer but with varying concentrations of free Ca2+, in the presence of 2 mm EGTA; free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the MAXC program. Then 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and washed four times in 1 ml of the same buffer. Following washing, GST fusion proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 20 mm reduced glutathione in elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). CaM was analyzed on 15%, Gβ, on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gγ was analyzed on Tricine ready-made gels (Bio-Rad). The labeled products were identified and quantified by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) as described (51Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the N-terminal GST fusion protein was performed as described (17Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This was performed essentially as described (51Ivanina T.

(Lond .). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with mRNAs and incubated in NDE solution containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 days at 22 °C. Plasma membranes were separated manually (51Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) from the rest of the oocyte (designated as internal fraction). 10–20 membranes and 3–5 internal fractions, or 5 whole oocytes, were homogenized, proteins were solubilized, immunoprecipitated as described (16Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 52Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J.

Hosey (Northwestern University, Chicago) (53Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The data are presented as mean ± S.E. To overcome the problem of batch-to-batch variability in current amplitudes, the results were normalized as follows (54Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar): in each oocyte, IBawas normalized to the mean amplitude of IBa in the control group of oocytes of the same donor. These normalized values were averaged across all oocyte batches tested. Comparisons between two groups (e.g. control and Gβγ-expressing groups) were tested for statistically significant differences (p < 0.05 or better) using two-tailed unpaired t tests. Comparison between several groups was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet's or Tukey's tests, using the SigmaStat software (SPSS Corp.). Direct interaction between intracellular segments of α1C with Gβγ was studied in vitro using fragments of α1C fused to GST, covering all the large intracellular segments of α1C (Fig. 1 A). They included the whole NT (N1–154), the full-length CT (C), three subdivisions of the C terminus (C0, C1, and C2, as shown in Fig. 1 A, inset), and three interdomain linker loops (L1, L2, and L3). The binding of Gβγ to NT, CT, or its parts, and L3 has not been examined in the past. The GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and assayed for interaction with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gβ1γ2 subunits. Unexpectedly, NT and CT bound Gβ1γ2, whereas GST alone and loops L1, L2, and L3 did not bind Gβγ (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). The results of all experiments were quantitated by normalizing the 35S-Gβγ signal obtained from each GST fusion protein to that of the NT obtained in the same experiment (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). The CT exhibited the strongest interaction with Gβγ, mainly localized to its proximal half (C0; aa residues 1505–1846). The distal half of the CT, C2, showed a weak but reproducible Gβγ binding. Since there is no binding in the middle of CT (C1), it is plausible that Gβγ binds to two separate sites in the CT, roughly in its first quarter (from the beginning of C0 to the beginning of C1, between aa 1505 and 1664) and the last half. NT showed intermediate Gβγ binding. Fig. 1 C shows that the binding of Gβγ to NT and CT was Ca2+-independent: it was identical in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA, or with no additions (control). The binding of Gβγ to NT (which is a PKC substrate: see Ref. 17Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was not affected by phosphorylation by PKC or by the presence of the Ca2+ channel β2A subunit (data not shown). Of the 5 known Gβ proteins (55Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), the highly homologous Gβ1 through Gβ4 often show considerable selectivity in modulating the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Refs. 56Kleuss C.

However, in α1C, all four β subunits (presented, in all cases, with Gγ2) bound well to NT and CT (Fig. 1 D). Gβ could bind to NT of α1C without the Gγ, while Gγ2 did not bind (Fig. 1 E), as also has been shown for L1 of α1B (58Garcia D.E. Li B. Garcia-Ferreiro R.E. Hernandez-Ochoa E.O. Yan K. Gautam N. Catterall W.A. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9163-9170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although L-type Ca2+ currents in neurons are down-regulated by activation of Gi/o-coupled neurotransmitter receptors (see “Discussion”), such modulations could not be reproduced in two expression systems, oocytes and HEK cells (31Furukawa T.

It seemed the Gβγ, when released from G proteins after activation of the relevant neurotransmitters by agonists, did not directly regulate the L-type channel. This leaves open the question of the functional consequences of the interaction between α1C and Gβγ revealed by experiments of Fig. 1. To address this problem, we used coexpression methodology. L-type channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes in full subunit composition (α1C, α2δ and β2A), or without the β subunit (α1α2δ combination). Currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. At standard levels of expression of the channel used here (1 ng of RNA/oocyte for α1α2δβ, 2.5 ng/oocyte for α1α2δ), the averageIBa was 1064 ± 47 nA (n = 58 oocytes, N = 8 batches) and 324 ± 15 nA (n = 149, N = 19), respectively. In accord with previous reports, activation by acetylcholine of a coexpressed muscarinic m2 receptor (which couples to Gi/oproteins) did not cause any consistent modulation ofIBa (data not shown). However, upon additional coexpression of Gαo, which is indispensable for muscarinic inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels"

In MCF-7 cells, the expression of recombinant IGFBP-3 inhibited proliferation and sensitized the cells to further inhibition by TGF-β1. To investigate the mechanism, we used T47D cells that lack type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII) and are insensitive to TGF-β1. After introducing the TGF-βRII by transfection, the basal proliferation rate was significantly decreased. Exogenous TGF-β1 caused no further growth inhibition, but immunoneutralization of endogenous TGF-β1 restored the proliferation rate almost to the control level. The addition of IGFBP-3 did not inhibit the proliferation of control cells but caused dose-dependent inhibition in TGF-βRII-expressing cells when exogenous TGF-β1 was also present. Similarly, receptor-expressing cells showed dose-dependent sensitivity to exogenous TGF-β1 only in the presence of exogenous IGFBP-3. This indicates that in these cells, anti-proliferative signaling by exogenous IGFBP-3 requires both the TGF-βRII and exogenous TGF-β1. To investigate this synergism, the phosphorylation of TGF-β signaling intermediates, Smad2 and Smad3, was measured. Phosphorylation of each Smad was stimulated by TGF-β1 and, independently, by IGFBP-3 with the two agents together showing a cumulative effect. These data suggest that IGFBP-3 inhibitory signaling requires an active TGF-β signaling pathway and implicate Smad2 and Smad3 in IGFBP-3 signal transduction.

Colletta A.A. McCune B.K. Sporn M.B. Cancer Treat. Res. 1992; 61: 97-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β has been shown to display a variety of biological activities including the negative and positive regulations of cell growth, stimulation of extracellular matrix formation, stimulation of angiogenesis, and induction of differentiation of several cell lineages (2Roberts A.B. Flanders K.C. Kondaiah P. Thompson N.L. van Obberghen-Schilling E.V. Wakefield L. Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Heine V. Sporn M.B. Recent Prog. Horm.

All human breast tumor cell lines secrete all three isoforms of TGF-β, namely TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 (4Valverius E.M. Walker-Jones D. Bates S.E. Stampfer M.R. Clark R. McCormick F. Dickson R.B.

Oncog. 1993; 4: 493-540PubMed Google Scholar), and levels are elevated with increased malignancy (6Daly R.J. King R.J. Darbre P.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).TGF-β is synthesized and secreted as a high molecular weight latent complex that restricts its in vivo availability (7Pircher R. Lawrence D.A. Jullien P. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5538-5543PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pircher R. Jullien P. Lawrence D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TGF-β must be released from this complex before it can exert its actions, which is an important regulatory step in the action of this growth factor. Biological activities of TGF-β are believed to be mediated through specific cell surface receptors (9Tucker R.F. Branum E.L. Shipley G.D. Ryan R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6757-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A number of different size receptors have been identified in cultured cells and tissues, which include types I, II, III, IV, V, and VI receptors (10Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cheifetz S. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16984-16991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of them, only type I receptor (TGF-βRI) and type II receptor (TGF-βRII) have been shown to be directly involved in signal transduction (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Lopez-Caillas F. Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the lack of response to TGF-β in some types of cancer cell lines correlates with the loss or low expression levels of TGF-βRI and/or TGF-βRII (13Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Han W.

Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). They fall into three classes based on sequence similarity and function. Class I Smads or pathway-restricted Smads couple to different receptors. Of these, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated after stimulation by TGF-β (16Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) or activin (17Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas Smad1 and Smad5 are involved in bone morphogenetic protein signaling (18Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In the COOH-terminal region, pathway-restricted Smads have a characteristic Ser-Ser-X-Ser motif, the two most COOH-terminal serine residues of which are phosphorylated by activated TGF-βRI (18Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol.

Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar) appear to be a general partner for the pathway-restricted Smads by bringing the cytoplasmic Smads into the nucleus where they can activate transcriptional responses (16Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Class III Smads, which include Smad6 and Smad7, are known as the inhibitory Smads because they bind to TGF-βRI and interfere with the phosphorylation of the pathway-restricted Smads (22Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 23Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L.

The activated TGF-βRI then interacts with and phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, thus inducing their association with Smad4 followed by the translocation of the heteromeric complex to the nucleus where they can potentiate the transcription of target genes (21Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 24Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a member of a family of six well characterized IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6 (25Baxter R.C. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 is the most abundant IGFBP in the circulation, serves as a storage depot for IGFs (26Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and has been shown to have both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent effects on cell proliferation. In its IGF-dependent actions, IGFBP-3 modulates the interaction between IGFs and their cell surface receptors, resulting in either inhibition or stimulation of cellular growth (27DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 28Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 has also been shown to act as a growth inhibitor in the absence of IGFs (29Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that may be mediated by putative IGFBP-3 receptor(s) on the cell surface. No signaling receptor for IGFBP-3 has yet been unequivocally identified.MCF-7 human breast cancer cells express intact TGF-β signaling machinery and have been shown to be responsive to TGF-β growth inhibition. On the other hand, T47D human breast cancer cells lack TGF-βRII and are unresponsive to TGF-β treatment (30Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that T47D cells also fail to respond to exogenous IGFBP-3, although we previously showed that transfection with IGFBP-3 is growth inhibitory to these cells (31Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that restoration of active TGF-β signaling is required for T47D cells to respond to exogenous IGFBP-3 and that IGFBP-3 stimulates the phosphorylation of the signaling intermediates Smad2 and Smad3, suggesting a previously unrecognized pathway of IGFBP-3 signaling.DISCUSSIONIntracellular signals from TGF-β are transduced by a mechanism that involves the transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII (38Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). TGF-β binds primarily to the TGF-βRII followed by the recruitment of TGF-βRI to form a ternary complex that allows TGF-βRII to phosphorylate TGF-βRI. This activation of the type I receptor kinase is the first necessary step in transducing the TGF-β signal downstream.There is now considerable evidence that the loss of TGF-βRII expression occurs in a variety of human neoplasms, resulting in a lack of response to TGF-β growth inhibition in these cells. Loss of TGF-βRII expression is caused by various mechanisms including homozygous gene losses, gross gene rearrangements, and truncated transcripts of this receptor (13Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V.

Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the TGF-β pathway has also been shown to be caused by the mutation or loss of TGF-βRI (41Kim I.Y. Ahn H.J. Zelner D.J. Shaw J.W. Sensibar J.A. Kim J.H. Kato M. Lee C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 44-48PubMed Google Scholar, 42Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deletion or mutation of Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 has also been demonstrated in several cancer cell lines (43Pouliot F. Labrie C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Any of these mechanisms provides a selective advantage by allowing the cells to escape from TGF-β-mediated growth control.In this study, we have investigated possible interactions between TGF-β and IGFBP-3 signaling pathways. We first showed that the overexpression of IGFBP-3 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which normally express low levels of the protein (44Martin J.L. Coverley J.A. Pattison S.T. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led to a decreased proliferation rate. Exogenous IGFBP-3 is known to inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation (45Pratt S.E. Pollak M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the growth inhibitory effect of the anti-estrogen ICI 182780 (46Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and vitamin D (47Colston K.W. Perks C.M. Xie S.P. Holly J.M.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) on these cells is believed to be mediated in part by the induction of IGFBP-3 gene expression. In contrast, transfection of MCF-7 cells with IGFBP-3 cDNA was reported by Chen et al. (48Chen J.-C. Shao Z.-M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to enhance IGF-I-stimulated proliferation. Although the different responses to IGFBP-3 in different studies are not easily explained, they may be related to the presence of IGFBP-3 proteolytic activity secreted by MCF-7 cells (49Grimes R.W. Manni A. Hammond J.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 39: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), which has recently been shown to be stimulated by estrogen and inhibited by TGF-β (50Salahifar H. Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).We found that in IGFBP-3-transfected MCF-7 cells, sensitivity to growth inhibition by TGF-β was unexpectedly increased, raising the possibility of an interaction between TGF-β and IGFBP-3 inhibitory signaling. Late passage MCF-7 cells are reported to be less sensitive to TGF-β than early passage MCF-7 cells, a difference associated with a 3-fold reduction in TGF-βRII expression (51Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W. Liang J. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate further how TGF-β signaling might be influenced by IGFBP-3, we turned to the T47D breast cancer cell line, which is reported in some studies to totally lack the TGF-βRII expression. In fact, there are conflicting reports regarding the level of TGF-βRII in T47D cells and the sensitivity of these cells to TGF-β treatment. TGF-β inhibition of T47D cell proliferation has been demonstrated by several groups (52Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Wakefield L.M. Roche N.S. Stern D.F. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 53Knabbe C. Lippman M.E. Wakefield L.M. Flanders K.C. Kasid A. Derynck R. Dickson R.B.

Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1849-1860PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others (55Arteaga C.L. Tandon A.K. von Hoff D.D. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3898-3904PubMed Google Scholar, 56Murphy C.L. Dotzlaw H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a resistance to TGF-β effects in these cells. Kalkhoven et al. (30Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that resistance to TGF-β growth inhibition was due to the lack of sufficient TGF-βRII expression. Pouliot and Labrie (43Pouliot F. Labrie C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have also shown that T47D cells lack TGF-βRII but express mRNAs for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. The differences in the TGF-β responsiveness of T47D cell lines reported by various groups may reflect the variation between clonal lines used in different studies.In the present study, we used a T47D cell line with demonstrable resistance to TGF-β1 due to lack of TGF-βRII. Transfection of these cells with a TGF-βRII expression plasmid resulted in a significantly lower basal proliferation rate compared with control vector-transfected cells. This observation suggested that other components in the TGF-β signal transduction pathway are intact and that the loss of TGF-βRII expression is the mechanism by which these T47D cells escape TGF-β growth inhibition. Treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 alone did not have any further growth inhibitory effect on the T47D/TGF-βRII cells over 4 days, although it increased the basal phosphorylation levels of both Smad2 and Smad3 rapidly (within 10–15 min) and transiently. The lack of effect of exogenous TGF-β1 on 4-day growth inhibition may be due to the presence of a sustained level of endogenous TGF-β1, neutralization of which was able to stimulate cell growth almost to the level of TGF-βRII-negative control cells.IGFBP-3 has been shown to mediate the growth inhibitory effects of a number of anti-proliferative agents on breast cancer cells. Growth inhibition by TGF-β (57Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 58Rajah R. Valentinis B.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar), anti-estrogens (46Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the tumor suppressor p53 (60Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) has been shown to correlate with the induction of IGFBP-3 at both the transcriptional and translational levels. However, the mechanism by which IGFBP-3 can mediate these growth inhibitory effects is not well understood. In a previous study, we showed that T47D cells transfected with an IGFBP-3 expression plasmid were growth-inhibited at low passage numbers post-transfection but became refractory to the IGFBP-3 growth inhibitory effect at higher passage numbers (31Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the early passage cells producing endogenous IGFBP-3 were sensitive to the IGFBP-3 growth inhibitory effect is not clear. In the light of the present study, this requires further investigation because we have shown here that exogenous IGFBP-3 is not inhibitory to either T47D/vector or T47D/TGF-βRII cells in the absence of exogenous TGF-β. This finding suggests that IGFBP-3 expressed within the cell may be able to bypass the step that requires TGF-β interaction with TGF-βRII at the cell surface to sensitize the cells to exogenous IGFBP-3.In the presence of an active TGF-β signaling pathway, T47D/TGF-βRII cells are responsive to exogenous IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1, whereas the same combined treatment is inactive in T47D/vector cells. This finding suggests that both active TGF-β signaling pathway and exogenous IGFBP-3 are required to cause growth inhibition in T47D/TGF-βRII cells and that there is synergism between IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1 in their growth inhibitory actions.In investigating the mechanism of this synergism, we have shown the ability of exogenous IGFBP-3 as well as TGF-β1 to potentiate Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. This is the first report of phosphorylation of intracellular signaling intermediates known to be involved in growth inhibitory signals in response to IGFBP-3. The synergistic effect of IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1 was also evident in their potentiation of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation, which was greater in the presence of both effectors than either agent alone. This provides evidence for some commonality in the inhibitory signaling pathways used by TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3. We recently reported that the sensitivity to IGFBP-3 in MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells was abrogated by the expression of oncogenic ras and restored when mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was blocked by the inhibitor PD98059 (61Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway provides a link between the inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 in T47D cells remains to be determined.The identity of the proteins on the T47D cell surface or elsewhere that interact with IGFBP-3 to facilitate the intracellular TGF-β signaling cascade remains elusive. Several cell-associated proteins that bind IGFBP-3 have been described (58Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 62Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Hodgkinson S. Fowke P. Al Somai N. McQuoid M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: R1-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although the specificity of the binding and whether these IGFBP-3-binding proteins play a functional role in the growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 have yet to be confirmed. The type V TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRV) has recently been described as having a role in mediating the IGF-independent growth inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 in mink lung cells (64Leal S.M. Liu Q.L. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 was not stimulated by IGFBP-3 in this cell line, despite an effect of TGF-β on Smad phosphorylation (65Leal S.M. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6711-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional link of the reported signaling of IGFBP-3 through TGF-βRV and the synergy between IGFBP-3 and TGF-β, which is dependent on the presence of TGF-βRII that we have described in T47D cells, is not clear.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the well recognized TGF-β signaling pathway requiring the presence of TGF-βRII and involving the phosphorylation of receptor-associated Smads can be activated by IGFBP-3 in a way that apparently increases the sensitivity toward TGF-β, thus leading to an enhancement of growth inhibition in the presence of both agents. The level at which IGFBP-3 interacts and the mechanism by which T47D cells transfected with IGFBP-3 cDNA may bypass the early steps of the TGF-β signaling cascade remain important areas for investigation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is a member of a family of structurally homologous dimeric proteins, which are multifunctional growth factors (1Wakefield L.M. Colletta A.A. McCune B.K. Sporn M.B. Cancer Treat. Res. 1992; 61: 97-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β has been shown to display a variety of biological activities including the negative and positive regulations of cell growth, stimulation of extracellular matrix formation, stimulation of angiogenesis, and induction of differentiation of several cell lineages (2Roberts A.B. Flanders K.C. Kondaiah P. Thompson N.L. van Obberghen-Schilling E.V. Wakefield L. Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Heine V. Sporn M.B. Recent Prog. Horm.

All human breast tumor cell lines secrete all three isoforms of TGF-β, namely TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 (4Valverius E.M. Walker-Jones D. Bates S.E. Stampfer M.R. Clark R. McCormick F. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6269-6274PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fynan T.M. Reiss M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 493-540PubMed Google Scholar), and levels are elevated with increased malignancy (6Daly R.J. King R.J. Darbre P.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TGF-β is synthesized and secreted as a high molecular weight latent complex that restricts its in vivo availability (7Pircher R. Lawrence D.A. Jullien P. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5538-5543PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pircher R. Jullien P. Lawrence D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TGF-β must be released from this complex before it can exert its actions, which is an important regulatory step in the action of this growth factor. Biological activities of TGF-β are believed to be mediated through specific cell surface receptors (9Tucker R.F. Branum E.L. Shipley G.D. Ryan R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6757-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A number of different size receptors have been identified in cultured cells and tissues, which include types I, II, III, IV, V, and VI receptors (10Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cheifetz S. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16984-16991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of them, only type I receptor (TGF-βRI) and type II receptor (TGF-βRII) have been shown to be directly involved in signal transduction (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Lopez-Caillas F. Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the lack of response to TGF-β in some types of cancer cell lines correlates with the loss or low expression levels of TGF-βRI and/or TGF-βRII (13Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Han W.

Smads are molecules of relative molecular mass 42–60 kDa with two regions of homology at the NH2- and COOH-terminals termed Mad homology domains (MH1 and MH2, respectively), connected with a proline-rich linker sequence (15Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). They fall into three classes based on sequence similarity and function. Class I Smads or pathway-restricted Smads couple to different receptors. Of these, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated after stimulation by TGF-β (16Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawaba"

TGIF binds directly to DNA to repress transcription or interacts with TGF-β-activated Smads, thereby repressing genes normally activated by TGF-β. Loss of function mutations in TGIF result in holoprosencephaly (HPE) in humans. One HPE mutation in TGIFresults in a single amino acid substitution in a conserved PLDLS motif within the amino-terminal repression domain. We demonstrate that TGIF interacts with the corepressor carboxyl terminus-binding protein (CtBP) via this motif. CtBP, which was first identified by its ability to bind the adenovirus E1A protein, interacts both with gene-specific transcriptional repressors and with a subset of polycomb proteins. Efficient repression of TGF-β-activated gene responses by TGIF is dependent on interaction with CtBP, and we show that TGIF is able to recruit CtBP to a TGF-β-activated Smad complex. Disruption of the PLDLS motif in TGIF abolishes the interaction of CtBP with TGIF and compromises the ability of TGIF to repress transcription. Thus, at least one HPE mutation in TGIF appears to prevent CtBP-dependent transcriptional repression by TGIF, suggesting an important developmental role for the recruitment of CtBP by TGIF.

TGIF can also bind to an element within the upstream of the D1Adopamine receptor gene and is able to compete for binding with Meis2, another TALE family homeodomain protein (14Yang Y. Hwang C.K.

TGIF is a transcriptional repressor that contains multiple repression domains and interacts with histone deacetylases (HDAC) (15Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.

Following TGF-β receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation, the activated Smad complex moves to the nucleus (17Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F.

It appears that both HDAC-dependent and -independent repression domains of TGIF play a role in repression of a TGF-β response.In humans, deletion or mutation of a single copy of the TGIFgene, which maps to the HPE4 locus, causes holoprosencephaly (HPE), a prevalent defect of craniofacial development (30Gripp K.W.

The primary brain malformations in HPE consist of incomplete cleavage of the forebrain and are frequently accompanied by facial anomalies including cyclopia. It is not clear whether mutations inTGIF result in HPE because of effects on the TGF-β signaling pathway or on repression of other TGF-β-independent gene responses.CtBP (carboxyl terminus bindingprotein) was first identified as a protein which binds the carboxyl terminus of the Adenovirus E1A protein (33Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 34Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and this interaction is required for transcriptional repression by E1A. Within E1A, the five-amino acid motif, PLDLS, was shown to be required for interaction with CtBP (33Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This motif (or sequences related to it) is present in other transcriptional repressors that bind CtBP (35Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 36Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has demonstrated that PLDLS-like motifs present within a subset of vertebrate polycomb-group proteins bind CtBP (39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus CtBP may interact not only with gene-specific repressors but also with components of general transcriptional repression complexes.We demonstrate that CtBP and TGIF interact via a PLDLS motif in the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF. In response to TGF-β, TGIF can recruit CtBP to an activated Smad complex. The interaction of TGIF with CtBP is required for full repression by TGIF and is disrupted by a single amino acid missense mutation, which results in HPE.DISCUSSIONTGIF is a transcriptional repressor with multiple repression domains, which appears to act in a context-independent manner (15Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TGIF represses transcription when bound to DNA via its cognate site or when brought to DNA by interactions with TGF-β-activated Smads. Repression by the carboxyl-terminal half of TGIF is dependent on the ability of the central repression domain of TGIF to recruit HDACs. We show here that the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF, which represses transcription independent of HDAC activity, interacts with the corepressor, CtBP. This interaction is dependent on the presence of a conserved motif within TGIF (PLDLS, amino acids 24–28). Similar motifs have been identified in many transcriptional repressors and have been demonstrated to be required for recruitment of CtBP (35Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, this motif is conserved in all direct homologs of TGIF from other species, including the chicken AKR2 protein and zebrafish TGIF. Direct homologs of TGIF do not appear to be present in eitherDrosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans, although aDrosophila protein with a highly related homeodomain exists. It is likely that this Drosophila protein will bind to the same DNA sequence but may function differently from vertebrate TGIFs, because it lacks homology to TGIF repression domains.As well as interacting with sequence-specific transcriptional repressors, CtBP is able to interact with a subset of human polycomb group (PcG) proteins via a PLDLS-like motif present within these proteins (39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PcG proteins in Drosophila are chromatin-associated proteins, which play a role in the stable repression of gene expression (48Orlando V. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 49Bienz M. Muller J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An analogous complex of PcG-related proteins is present in mammalian cells, although its precise mechanism of transcriptional repression is not clear (50Alkema M.J. Jacobs J. Voncken J.W. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 51Alkema M.J. Bronk M. Verhoeven E. Otte A. van't Veer L.J. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 52Saurin A.J. Shiels C. Williamson J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Sheer D. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because CtBP is able to homodimerize as well as interact with the related CtBP2 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), this raises the possibility that a dimer of CtBP may bridge an interaction between a gene-specific repressor and a complex of general transcriptional repressors including PcG proteins.Recent evidence has suggested that CtBP represses via an HDAC-independent mechanism (53Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we show that TGIF is able to interact with both CtBP and HDAC1 together, suggesting that TGIF may be able to recruit both of these transcriptional repressors to a specific gene. These results further strengthen the idea that TGIF may be part of a larger complex of transcriptional repressors, which acts to target such complexes to specific DNA elements, either via direct DNA binding or by interaction with TGF-β-activated Smads. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that different TGIF-containing corepressor complexes exist.Interaction of TGIF with CtBP results in the incorporation of CtBP into a TGF-β-activated Smad complex, suggesting that TGIF can recruit both HDAC and CtBP to a Smad complex in response to TGF-β or activin signaling. It is also possible, therefore, that this would result in the recruitment of PcG proteins to an activated Smad complex. It will now be of interest to further clarify the composition of the corepressor complex which TGIF is able to bring to TGF-β-activated Smads. Despite the fact that HDAC and CtBP can interact with TGIF together, it is possible that TGIF recruits only one of these corepressor activities to a specific target gene. Each of these modes of transcriptional repression may play a role either at different promoters or at the same promoter under different conditions, perhaps acting sequentially. However, it appears that at least for repression of some TGF-β-inducible gene responses by TGIF, both the CtBP and HDAC interaction domains are required.In addition to the ability of the amino terminus of TGIF to recruit CtBP, it is possible that this region of the protein represses transcription by a second CtBP-independent mechanism. Several homeodomain proteins have been shown to repress transcription via direct interactions with general transcription factors. Transcriptional repression by Eve and Msx-1 is mediated by interactions of the homeodomain with the TATA-binding protein (54Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 55Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and repression by Msx-2 may require interactions with TFIIF (56Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutations of the PLDLS motif in TGIF block interaction with CtBP but have only a modest effect on transcriptional repression by the amino-terminal half of the protein. In contrast, the P63R homeodomain mutant appears not to block interaction with CtBP but impairs transcriptional repression. Thus, it is possible that the TGIF homeodomain represses transcription by a distinct mechanism, possibly via interactions with general transcription factors.Deletion or mutation of a single copy of TGIF in humans results in HPE (30Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). One previously identified HPE-associated mutation (S28C) in TGIF results in a single amino acid change within the PLDLS motif, which we show prevents interaction with CtBP. It, therefore, appears that disruption of the interaction between TGIF and CtBP can have a dramatic effect on craniofacial development in humans. As yet, it remains to be determined whether such mutations inTGIF cause HPE by affecting TGF-β gene responses or by impairing repression of distinct set of genes.In summary, we demonstrate that TGIF interacts with CtBP via a conserved motif within the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF and that the integrity of this motif is required both for interaction with CtBP and for full transcriptional repression by TGIF. The importance of this interaction is underscored by the fact that an HPE mutation inTGIF disrupts the PLDLS motif in TGIF and the interaction with CtBP. Homeobox genes were first identified in Drosophilawhere they regulate segment identity. The homeodomain is an approximately 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain consisting of three α-helices, which is conserved among numerous proteins from diverse species (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 517-526Crossref Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2McGinnis W. Levine M.S. Hafen E. Kuroiwa A. Gehring W.J.

Cell. 1984; 37: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Members of the atypical TALE1 homeodomain family have a three amino acid loopextension between helices one and two of the homeodomain (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 5Burglin T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity of their homeodomains, outside this region TALE proteins are considerably divergent. Members of this family bind to DNA in association with other homeodomain proteins (6Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The TALE homeodomain protein TGIF (TG-interacting factor) was identified by its ability to bind a specific retinoid responsive element and has been suggested to compete with retinoid receptors for binding to this element (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Bertolino E. Wildt S. Richards G. Clerc R.G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what role TGIF plays in the regulation of retinoid-responsive transcription. TGIF can also bind to an element within the upstream of the D1Adopamine receptor gene and is able to compete for binding with Meis2, another TALE family homeodomain protein (14Yang Y. Hwang C.K.

TGIF is a transcriptional repressor that contains multiple repression domains and interacts with histone deacetylases (HDAC) (15Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression by TGIF is dependent only in part on its ability to recruit HDACs, and TGIF contains at least one HDAC-independent transcriptional repression domain (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The transcriptional response to transforming growth factor TGF-β is dependent on the intracellular mediators of TGF-β signaling, the Smad proteins. Following TGF-β receptor-mediated phosphorylation and activation, the activated Smad complex moves to the nucleus (17Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

A Smad complex is recruited to specific DNA elements via interactions with other DNA-binding proteins (21Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 22Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and by direct Smad-DNA contacts (23Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Gene activation by Smads is, in part, dependent on interactions with coactivators, such as p300/CBP (26Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A TGF-β-activated Smad complex can also interact with TGIF, resulting in transcriptional repression. This repression by TGIF is dependent on competition with coactivators for interaction with the Smads and on the intrinsic repression functions of TGIF (15Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It appears that both HDAC-dependent and -independent repression domains of TGIF play a role in repression of a TGF-β response. In humans, deletion or mutation of a single copy of the TGIFgene, which maps to the HPE4 locus, causes holoprosencephaly (HPE), a prevalent defect of craniofacial development (30Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31Ming J.E.

The primary brain malformations in HPE consist of incomplete cleavage of the forebrain and are frequently accompanied by facial anomalies including cyclopia. It is not clear whether mutations inTGIF result in HPE because of effects on the TGF-β signaling pathway or on repression of other TGF-β-independent gene responses.

Within E1A, the five-amino acid motif, PLDLS, was shown to be required for interaction with CtBP (33Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus CtBP may interact not only with gene-specific repressors but also with components of general transcriptional repression complexes. We demonstrate that CtBP and TGIF interact via a PLDLS motif in the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF. In response to TGF-β, TGIF can recruit CtBP to an activated Smad complex.

Because CtBP is able to homodimerize as well as interact with the related CtBP2 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutations of the PLDLS motif in TGIF block interaction with CtBP but have only a modest effect on transcriptional repression by the amino-terminal half of the protein. In contrast, the P63R homeodomain mutant appears not to block interaction with CtBP but impairs transcriptional repression. Thus, it is possible that the TGIF homeodomain represses transcription by a distinct mechanism, possibly via interactions with general transcription factors.Deletion or mutation of a single copy of TGIF in humans results in HPE (30Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). One previously identified HPE-associated mutation (S28C) in TGIF results in a single amino acid change within the PLDLS motif, which we show prevents interaction with CtBP. It, therefore, appears that disruption of the interaction between TGIF and CtBP can have a dramatic effect on craniofacial development in humans. As yet, it remains to be determined whether such mutations inTGIF cause HPE by affecting TGF-β gene responses or by impairing repression of distinct set of genes.In summary, we demonstrate that TGIF interacts with CtBP via a conserved motif within the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF and that the integrity of this motif is required both for interaction with CtBP and for full transcriptional repression by TGIF. The importance of this interaction is underscored by the fact that an HPE mutation inTGIF disrupts the PLDLS motif in TGIF and the interaction with CtBP. TGIF is a transcriptional repressor with multiple repression domains, which appears to act in a context-independent manner (15Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TGIF represses transcription when bound to DNA via its cognate site or when brought to DNA by interactions with TGF-β-activated Smads. Repression by the carboxyl-terminal half of TGIF is dependent on the ability of the central repression domain of TGIF to recruit HDACs. We show here that the amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF, which represses transcription independent of HDAC activity, interacts with the corepressor, CtBP. This interaction is dependent on the presence of a conserved motif within TGIF (PLDLS, amino acids 24–28). Similar motifs have been identified in many transcriptional repressors and have been demonstrated to be required for recruitment of CtBP (35Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, this motif is conserved in all direct homologs of TGIF from other species, including the chicken AKR2 protein and zebrafish TGIF. Direct homologs of TGIF do not appear to be present in eitherDrosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans, although aDrosophila protein with a highly related homeodomain exists. It is likely that this Drosophila protein will bind to the same DNA sequence but may function differently from vertebrate TGIFs, because it lacks homology to TGIF repression domains. As well as interacting with sequence-specific transcriptional repressors, CtBP is able to interact with a subset of human polycomb group (PcG) proteins via a PLDLS-like motif present within these proteins (39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PcG proteins in Drosophila are chromatin-associated proteins, which play a role in the stable repression of gene expression (48Orlando V. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 49Bienz M. Muller J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An analogous complex of PcG-related proteins is present in mammalian cells, although its precise mechanism of transcriptional repression is not clear (50Alkema M.J. Jacobs J. Voncken J.W. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 51Alkema M.J. Bronk M. Verhoeven E.

Freemont P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because CtBP is able to homodimerize as well as interact with the related CtBP2 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 39Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), this raises the possibility that a dimer of CtBP may bridge an interaction between a gene-specific repressor and a complex of general transcriptional repressors including PcG proteins. Recent evidence has suggested that CtBP represses via an HDAC-independent mechanism (53Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we show that TGIF is able to interact with both CtBP and HDAC1 together, suggesting that TGIF may be able to recruit both of these transcriptional repressors to a specific gene. These results further strengthen the idea that TGIF may be part of a larger complex of transcriptional repressors, which acts to target such complexes to specific DNA elements, either via direct DNA binding or by interaction with TGF-β-activated Smads. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that different TGIF-containing corepressor complexes exist. Interaction of TGIF with CtBP results in the incorporation of CtBP into a TGF-β-activated Smad complex, suggesting that TGIF can recruit both HDAC and CtBP to a Smad complex in response to TGF-β or activin signaling. It is also possible, therefore, that this would result in the recruitment of PcG proteins to an activated Smad complex. It will now be of interest to further clarify the composition of the corepressor complex which TGIF is able to bring to TGF-β-activated Smads. Despite the fact that HDAC and CtBP can interact with TGIF together, it is possible that TGIF recruits only one of these corepressor activities to a specific target gene. Each of these modes of transcriptional repression may play a role either at different promoters or at the same promoter under different conditions, perhaps acting sequentially. However, it appears that at least for repression of some TGF-β-inducible gene responses by TGIF, both the CtBP and HDAC interaction domains are required. In addition to the ability of the amino terminus of TGIF to recruit CtBP, it is possible that this region of the protein represses transcription by a second CtBP-independent mechanism. Several homeodomain proteins have been shown to repress transcription via direct interactions with general transcription factors. Transcriptional repression by Eve and Msx-1 is mediated by interactions of the homeodomain with the TATA-binding protein (54Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 55Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and repression by Msx-2 may require interactions with TFIIF (56Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A.

In both of these receptors systems, a cascade of events involving tyrosine phosphorylation is initiated eventually leading to the recruitment of multiprotein complexes and activation of downstream target proteins or genes. Most of the substrates that are recruited are not specific to the receptor protein-tyrosine kinases or the cytokine receptor signaling pathways. Adapter proteins such as Shc and p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase are utilized by almost all of these signaling pathways (8Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W.Y. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 3743-3747PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has recently emerged as a powerful tool to analyze protein-protein interactions in general as well as in the study of receptor-mediated signaling pathways (10Pandey A. Mann M. Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). We have initiated a systematic study to identify all substrates of the EGFR that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Using a combination of affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and one-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry-based identification, we have previously reported Vav-2 as a novel substrate of the EGFR (11Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In this report we have identified another molecule that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF. This molecule contains an SH3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motif (ITAM) domain and is approximately 55% identical to STAM, a molecule originally identified downstream of the IL-2 receptor complex (12Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar). Based on its relatedness to STAM, it is appropriate to designate this molecule as STAM2. STAM2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon addition of growth factors including EGF and PDGF. Since STAM was shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cytokines, we tested if STAM2 was downstream of cytokine receptors as well (13Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that STAM2 was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-3 in a growth factor-dependent cell line, BaF3. To determine the regions critical for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2, a deletion analysis was carried out. We found that mutants lacking the ITAM domain or the amino terminus and SH3 domain were still capable of being phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, suggesting that these regions were not required for its tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF. When STAM2 was cotransfected with Jak1 or Jak2, it underwent tyrosine phosphorylation but not by Etk that belongs to the Tec family of kinases (14Tamagnone L. Lahtinen I. Mustonen T. Virtaneva K. Francis F. Muscatelli F. Alitalo R. Smith C.I. Larsson C. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3683-3688PubMed Google Scholar, 15Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This suggests that STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases and may mediate some of the effects of Jak kinases. Mutational analysis also showed that presence of the ITAM domain was critical for its tyrosine phosphorylation by Jak1 or Jak2 since a mutant lacking the COOH terminus but not one lacking the ITAM domain underwent tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that different upstream pathways may mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 by EGFR as compared with that of the Jak family of kinases. Finally, when STAM 2 was overexpressed in a reconstitution system in HepG2 cells, it led to increased induction of c-Myc promoter activation by IL-2. Analysis with several deletion mutants of STAM2 showed that several regions were required for this effect. A mutant containing the ITAM domain but lacking the carboxyl terminus (ΔC) did not enhance IL-2-mediated c-Myc induction. This mutants still undergoes efficient tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that residues in the carboxyl terminus are critical for c-Myc induction. A similar result was obtained when several other mutants were tested, indicating that several regions may cooperate for its downstream signaling effects. HeLa and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. BaF3 and 32D cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% conditioned supernatant from WEHI cell line, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. HCD 57 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with erythropoietin and antibiotics. HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (RC20), anti-Shc, anti-Jak1, anti-Jak2, and anti-Grb2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse mAb (4G10), anti-EGFR mAb, EGF, and PDGF were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was from Covance (Denver, PA). Interleukin 3 was from Sigma, and recombinant erythropoietin was a gift from AMGEN. The cDNA clone (DKFZp564C047) corresponding to STAM2 was obtained from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) (17Vente A. Korn B. Zehetner G. Poustka A. Lehrach H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Wild type STAM2 and the various deletion mutants were obtained by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction fragments into the vector pEF-1/myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Wild type EGFR was obtained by subcloning the EGFR cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Decker) into pcDNA3 vector. Wild type PDGFRβ cDNA (18Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Andrius Kazlauskas and was subcloned into pcDNA3. 293T cells were cotransfected with 7.5 μg of wild type STAM2 expression vector along with 7.5 μg of the plasmids encoding EGFR, PDGFR, Jak1, Jak2, or Etk using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer and processed as described below. For electroporation experiments, BaF3 cells were washed two times in PBS, resuspended in PBS, and mixed with 40 μg of STAM2 plasmid. The cells were then electroporated using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). The settings used were 250 V and 950 microfarads. After electroporation, the cells were resuspended in complete medium and allowed to grow for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free medium overnight. For experiments shown in Fig. 1, approximately 108 serum-deprived HeLa cells were left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml EGF for 5 min and processed essentially as described previously (11Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 25 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then incubated with 100 μg of 4G10 mAb coupled to agarose beads and 50 μg of biotin-conjugated RC20 mAb bound to streptavidin-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Precipitated immune complexes were then washed and the bound proteins eluted by 100 mm phenylphosphate in lysis buffer. A protocol describing cell biological and mass spectrometric aspects in greater detail is available (19Pandey, A., Andersen, J. S., and Mann, M. (2000) Science's STKE (www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2000/37/pl1).Google Scholar). The gels were silver-stained by a method compatible with mass spectrometric analysis as described previously (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). In 293T and BaF3 cell transfection experiments, the cells were starved as described above and then were treated with EGF (1 μg/ml) or PDGF (50 ng/ml) or IL-3 (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and lysed in lysis buffer. Cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of antibody against the Myc epitope, for 2 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 1 μg/ml 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine or corresponding Western blotting antibody for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies followed by chemiluminescent detection according to manufacturer's instructions (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HepG2 cells were grown in complete medium to 60% confluence and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with expression vectors in the following amounts: 1 μg of pHXLuc, 1 μg of IL-2Rβ, 1 μg of γc,1 μg of STAT5a, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase, and different amounts of STAM2/pEF1 or pEF1 vector alone as indicated. After 24 h cells were split into two, and 12 h later the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and IL-2 added to 100 units/ml. Cells were harvested after an additional 24-h incubation, and relative luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured on a MicroLumat luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Identification of proteins by mass spectrometry was done essentially according to a strategy described previously (21Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The band indicated in Fig. 1 was excised from one-dimensional silver-stained polyacrylamide gel and processed as described (21Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). After reduction and alkylation of bands, proteins were in-gel digested with an excess of modified, sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. After in-gel digestion, the supernatant was acidified with formic acid and loaded onto a Poros R2™ (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) micro-column and desalted according to Gobom et al. (22Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Subsequently the peptides were eluted with 40% methanol/5% formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray needle (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (23Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) analysis was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, PE Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana) and fragmentation spectra were obtained. Phosphorylated peptides were analyzed by parent ion scanning method as described (24Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as well as by using a modification of this procedure (data not shown). The resulting “peptide sequence tags” (25Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) were used to search the Non-redundant Protein Data Base (EBI) using the PepSea program (Protana). When a peptide match was found in the data base, the retrieved peptide sequence was verified against the MS/MS spectrum. We performed anti-phosphotyrosine affinity purification of HeLa cell lysates that were stimulated with EGF. In parallel, unstimulated cell lysates were subjected to the same protocol in order to identify proteins that were specifically observed in EGF-stimulated immunoprecipitates. Fig. 1 A shows a silver stained gel after these immunoprecipitates were resolved by one-dimensional electrophoresis. The band indicated by the arrow was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as described earlier (21Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The peptides were then extracted from the gel and subjected to nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Several peptides were observed in the mass spectrum of this band as shown in Fig. 1 B. Sequencing of one of these peptides (m/z = 810.9) by fragmentation showed that it was the NH2-terminal peptide derived from STAM, an SH3 and an ITAM domain-containing protein, lacking the initiation methionine as described earlier (Fig. 1 C) (12Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar). STAM was originally identified as a 70-kDa phosphoprotein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-2 in a human T cell line (12Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K.

It was shown to be associated with Jak2 and Jak3 kinases via its ITAM domain and was phosphorylated by these kinases (13Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another peptide derived from STAM was also sequenced, confirming the identification (data not shown). Sequencing of the peptide corresponding to m/z value of 596.35 yielded the sequence VLEALELYNK as shown in Fig. 1 D. Upon searching the data bases with this sequence, it was found to correspond to a GenBank™ entry (accession no. CAB63735) submitted by the German Human Genome Project that was labeled as a hypothetical protein (17Vente A. Korn B. Zehetner G. Poustka A. Lehrach H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two other peptides including a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide that corresponded to this protein were also identified from this band by tandem mass spectrometry (data not shown). Comparison of the open reading frame of this clone to the known proteins in the data base confirmed that it was a novel molecule that was 55% identical to STAM. Because of this sequence relatedness, it is appropriate to refer to this molecule as STAM2. The open reading frame of STAM2 encodes a protein of 525 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 58 kDa. It contains a single SH3 domain as well as an ITAM domain that is found in several signaling proteins and immune receptors, respectively (Fig. 2 A) (26Pawson T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 87-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It contains 16 tyrosine residues, 12 of which are conserved between STAM and STAM2. Most of these tyrosine residues are contained within the COOH terminus or the ITAM domains. A pair of conserved tyrosines is present in the SH3 domain and the region immediately amino-terminal to it. An alignment of ITAM domains of STAM and STAM2 shows that they contain the classic YXXL spaced by nine non-conserved residues (Fig. 2 B) (28Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The ITAM domains of these two proteins are about 72% identical to each other, suggesting that they may possess similar functions in these two proteins. A Northern blot analysis showed that STAM2 was expressed in almost all tissues examined (data not shown). In order to test whether STAM2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by growth factors, we set up a reconstitution assay in 293T cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with Myc epitope-tagged STAM2 and either a control vector or with expression vectors for EGFR or PDGFR. The cells were stimulated with the respective growth factors and cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that STAM2 was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF as well as by PDGF (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, to assess the tyrosine phosphorylation status of STAM2 in response to cytokines, BaF3 cells were electroporated with Myc-tagged STAM2. Western blotting confirmed that STAM2 was indeed tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-3 in these cells (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that, analogous to other adapter proteins such as Shc, STAM2 is involved downstream of both growth factor as well as cytokine receptors (8Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since STAM2 is phosphorylated by cytokine receptors that do not contain any catalytic activity, we wished to ascertain whether the Jak family kinases were capable of phosphorylating STAM2. We therefore cotransfected 293T cells with expression vectors for STAM2 and Jak1, Jak2, or Etk. As shown in Fig. 4, STAM2 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when Jak1 or Jak2 were cotransfected. Etk is a tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Tec family and is unable to phosphorylate STAM2 (16Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since STAM2 is downstream of both EGFR and Jak family kinases, we wished to determine which regions were essential for it to act as a substrate of these kinases. To this end, we constructed a series of mutants lacking various regions as shown by the schematic in Fig. 5 A. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the deletion mutants underwent efficient tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF, suggesting that it is tyrosine-phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues in the SH3 and ITAM domains as well as in its carboxyl terminus. However, when a mutant expressing a deleted ITAM domain was coexpressed with Jak1, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 5 C). This suggests that the ITAM domain is required for its tyrosine phosphorylation by Jak1. Identical results were obtained when these mutants were cotransfected with Jak2 (data not shown). Finally, if a construct containing only the amino-terminal region (N only) was coexpressed with EGFR, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable (data not shown), suggesting that the SH3 domain and the region between the SH3 and ITAM domains may be important for this phosphorylation event. Cytokines such as IL-2 up-regulate immediate early response genes such as those for c-Myc and c-Fos. We therefore decided to test the role of STAM2 in IL-2-mediated induction of c-Myc in a reconstitution system in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, overexpression of WT STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated c-Myc induction. This effect was dependent upon the amount of STAM2 DNA used in the transfection as shown in the figure. STAM has previously been shown to have a similar effect (13Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This implies that STAM2 plays a similar positive role in cytokine signaling as STAM. This effect of STAM was demonstrated to require the ITAM domain since mutants lacking the ITAM domain were unable to cooperate in IL-2-induced c-Myc induction (13Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We tested all of the mutants that we have generated in the reconstitution assay. Fig. 6 B shows that most of the mutants lost the ability to up-regulate IL-2-induced c-Myc promoter activation. Most surprisingly, the mutant lacking the carboxyl terminus (labeled ΔC) but containing the ITAM domain could had no positive effect on c-Myc induction. Similarly, a mutant lacking the amino terminus plus the SH3 domain (labeledΔ(N+ SH3 ) also lost the ability to up-regulate c-Myc induction. It is important to note that both of these mutants undergo efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by Jak kinases, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient for its effect on c-Myc induction. We have identified a novel molecule that is involved in signaling events downstream of receptor protein tyrosine kinases as well as cytokine receptors. STAM like molecules have been found in Drosophila (29Mesilaty-Gross S. Reich A. Motro B. Wides R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 231: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as well Caenorhabditis elegans (data not shown), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function. Cloning of STAM2 expands this family of cytoplasmic molecules containing ITAM domains that are otherwise only found in immune receptors. Since STAM2 does not contain any phosphotyrosine binding motifs such as Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains, it is likely that it does not interact directly with the receptor tyrosine kinases. The ITAM region is dispensable for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 by EGF but not by Jak family kinases, suggesting that there is at least one distinct kinase in the EGFR signaling pathways capable of phosphorylating STAM2. Overexpression of WT STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated c-Myc induction, suggesting that it plays a positive role in cytokine signaling in a manner analogous to STAM. It was found that several regions of STAM2 were required for this effect as evidenced by a deletion analysis. Specifically, deletion of the carboxyl terminus or the unique amino terminus plus the SH3 domain resulted in STAM2 being unable to up-regulate c-Myc induction. One possibility is that multiple protein-protein interactions are required for this effect and the loss of some of them causes STAM2 to become inactive in this assay. Cloning of STAM2 will permit a detailed analysis of signal transduction pathways downstream of cytokines as well as growth factor receptors."

Host macromolecules representing barriers to cercarial invasion are known to be cleaved by proteolytic activities present in cercarial secretions. These include elastin (5Gazzinelli G. Pellegrino J. J. Parasitol. 1964; 50: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); chondromucoprotein (6Dresden M.H. Asch H.L. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1985; 231: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two distinct serine proteases have been reported in extracts of cercariae or in secretions from cercariae induced upon contact with skin lipids. One is a “chymotrypsin-like” protease with a preference for large hydrophobic side chains at P1 (9Cohen F.E. Gregoret L.M. Amiri P. Aldape K. Railey J. McKerrow J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11221-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second is a “trypsin-like” protease with a preference for positively charged side chains at P1 (10Dalton J.P. Clough K.A. Jones M.K. Brindley P.J. Parasitology. 1997; 114: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The class of proteases responsible for host protein degradation has been demonstrated by several independent studies to be serine proteases (6Dresden M.H. Asch H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 289: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the relative contributions to invasion of the trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like proteases are not known. To analyze the relative contributions of each of these proteases to the degradation of host proteins, cercarial secretions were fractionated, and the two proteases purified. The trypsin-like activity, which had not been previously purified or sequenced, was purified, and a cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR1 based on amino-terminal amino acid sequence. Specific inhibitors were identified to evaluate the role of each protease in skin invasion. Proteases were localized by immunohistochemistry, and specific sites of cleavage in elastin, the most protease-resistant target in host skin, were analyzed. AAPF-pNA and LGR-pNA were purchased from Sigma. FPR-CMK and AAPF-CMK were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Approximately 5 × 105cercariae (Puerto Rican strain) were collected in 750 ml of distilled water from 200–300 infected B. glabrata snails using a light induction method previously reported (11Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cercarial secretions were collected using a modification of a previously reported technique (12Stirewalt M.A. Austin B.E. J. Parasitol. 1973; 59: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cercariae were placed in Petri dishes coated with linoleic acid (to simulate skin contact) and floated in a 37 °C water bath to produce a thermal gradient. After 2 h, the cercariae had released the majority of their gland contents, and the conditioned water was collected and filtered to remove cercarial bodies and debris. The secretion sample was then lyophilized and stored at +4 °C until further purification. Snails were maintained with a diet of organic lettuce and school chalk as a calcium supplement (13Mishkin E.M. Jokinen E.H. J. Parasitol. 1986; 72: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All snails were housed in the absence of light to increase yields of cercariae during light induction. BL21 cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were electroporated with the appropriate plasmid construct and selected overnight using LB medium/ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates. A single colony was picked and grown overnight in 4 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 1 ml of overnight culture was added to 1000 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown toA600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to 100 μm; and after 4 h of continued incubation, the cells were pelleted and frozen at −70 °C. Lyophilized secretions from 4 × 106 cercariae were resuspended in 6 ml of running buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.8) and loaded onto an SR 16/100 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed with Sephacryl 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions were eluted at a pumping rate of 25 ml/h. 4-ml fractions were collected at +4 °C. Lyophilized secretions from 4 × 106 cercariae were resuspended in 8 ml of running buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl) and pumped at 1 ml/min through an HR 5/5 Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 6 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 50 mm NaCl) and eluted with 6 ml of elution buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 50 mm NaCl). 300-μl fractions were collected. Fractions from the benzamidine affinity column were diluted 10-fold into running buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and pumped through an HR 5/5 Mono-Q column at 1 ml/min. The column was then washed with an additional 10 ml of running buffer. Elution was performed over 30 1-ml fractions using running buffer and a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl. E. coli pellets from 330 ml of inducted culture were thawed and resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (8 m urea and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cell disruption was completed with six rounds of 20-s sonications on ice. Histidine-tagged proteins (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) were then purified according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1-ml spin columns. All assays were performed with native enzymes in buffer with 100 mm glycine, pH 9.0 (the pH optimum with small synthetic substrates), and 100 μm pNA substrate at room temperature unless otherwise noted. Inhibitors were tested in the same buffer system under the same conditions. A 15-min preincubation of inhibitor with enzyme was carried out before substrate was added. A standard assay consisted of 10 μl of sample and 100 μl of assay buffer in 96-well nylon plates (Falcon polyvinyl chloride plates, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Absorbance was monitored using a UV-Max spectrophotometer and SoftMax Version 2.02 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Skin invasion assays were performed as described previously (11Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, human skin samples were fixed on plastic wells over warm medium (RPMI 1640) while 200 μl of inhibitor solution (2 mm in Me2SO) or controls, including Me2SO, were applied to the skin surface and allowed to permeate and dry for 30 min. Approximately 3000 cercariae in 3 ml of water were then applied using 15-mm plastic cylinders on the skin. After 120 min, the skin was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered Formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cercariae penetrating the skin were counted as described previously (11Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Multiple sections of three separate skin samples were counted for each inhibitor and control. NuPage-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used according to the manufacture's instructions. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Novex transfer system. Peptide sequencing was carried out using an ABI Procise 491 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) at the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California (San Diego). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated by poly(T) affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from the hapatopancreases of five infected snails. RNA was converted to cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. DNA isolation from snails required CsCl purification because of the high proportion of glycoproteins. DNA was isolated from S. mansoni by standard detergent lysis and phenol/chloroform extraction. A nested PCR strategy was used to clone both BgSPs. Amplification conditions for the first PCR were two cycles of 94, 40, and 72 °C each for 1 min and then 35 cycles of 94, 50, and 72 °C each for 1 min. The second PCR conditions were 25 cycles of 94, 50, and 72 °C each for 1 min. The primers used for these reactions were as follows: BgSP-α1 forward, 5′-ATCGTCGGNGGNAARGARTCNATGC-3′; BgSP-β1 forward, 5′-ATGGTCGGWGGWCARGARGCNGTNC-3′; BgSP-α2 forward, 5′-CCNAAYAAYCAYAWNTGYGG-3′; and BgSP-β2 forward, 5′-GCGCCNACNCAYCAYTTYTGYGG-3′. The reverse primer for both the first and second reactions was oligo(dT)15. The E. coli expression construct pET21a-BgSP-β was assembled by inserting the active portion of BgSP-β into the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI of the vector pET21a (Invitrogen). The forward primer 5′-CGCCATATGGTCGGWGGWCARGARGCNGTNC-3′ created anNdeI site (underlined) and changed the first amino acid to a start codon (Ile → Met). This substitution creates an inactive protease. The reverse primer 5′-GCGCTCGAGTCTGTTGATGACGGTGTTA-3′ added an XhoI site (underlined) and deleted the stop codon, creating an open reading frame in the pET21a vector that added a 6-histidine tag to the C terminus of the protein. Genomic PCR was performed using S. mansoni or B. glabrata DNA. Forward primers were targeted to an internal region overlapping the catalytic serine: BgSP-α, 5′-ACGGGGGATGCCGGCGGTC-3′; and BgSP-β; 5′-CAGGGTGATGCCGGTGGCC-3′. Reverse primers were targeted to unique regions within the 3′-untranslated region of each gene: BgSP-α, 5′-TTGGTTCACCGCAGACTT-3′; and BgSP-β, 5′-CGCCCTTTACTATTCGCAT-3′. Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested overnight with the individual restriction enzymes EcoRI, PstI, XbaI, and XhoI (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). The DNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ charged nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using alkaline capillary transfer. The DNA was fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking and prehybridized for 45 min in Rapid-Hyb solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 40 ng of probe (active full-length PCR product) were labeled with32P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a High Prime nick translation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 1 h. 2× SSC stringency washing was sufficient for the removal of nonspecific probe. The membrane was exposed for 3 days at −70 °C to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using intensifying screens. The membrane was then stripped for 30 min in 0.4 m NaOH at 45 °C, washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in strip solution (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1× SSC, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS), and reused. Recombinant His-tagged protein from E. coli was used to produce rabbit antiserum using standard commercial procedures (Corvance, Richmond, CA). Materials prepared for immunohistochemistry were incubated in fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for >2 h and then embedded in JB4 plastic; 7-μm sections were cut; and antibody localization was visualized using an ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). To identify and isolate a previously reported trypsin-like (10Dalton J.P. Clough K.A. Jones M.K. Brindley P.J. Parasitology. 1997; 114: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) activity from cercariae, gel filtration was chosen as the first chromatography step to fractionate the complex protein mixture of cercarial secretions (Fig. 1). The chromogenic substrate LGR-pNA was used to detect the trypsin activity, and AAPF-pNA was used to detect the chymotrypsin-like activity (SmCE). The trypsin activity was identified and resolved from the SmCE activity, and although it was 30-fold more active than SmCE against its small tripeptide substrate, it had no significant activity against macromolecular elastin. Using molecular mass standards as a reference, the trypsin-like activity had an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, whereas the SmCE activity peak eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa. SmCE has a pI >9.0 and may interact with the column resin, retarding its migration relative to other proteins. At higher salt concentrations, the peak of SmCE was shifted to the left (data not shown). To further characterize this native trypsin activity, benzamidine conjugated to Sepharose was employed as a first step affinity column, yielding a 1000-fold purification (Table I). Ion exchange chromatography was employed as the second and final step. The trypsin activity was resolved into two distinct proteases. Sufficient material was generated to obtain unambiguous N-terminal sequences (Fig. 2) for both peaks of activity. These two activities were designated BgSP-α and BgSP-β, corresponding to the order in which they eluted from the column.Table IPurification of native snail trypsinsStepVolumeProtein concTotal proteinEnzyme concTotal activityYield 2-aTotal activity/total activity.Specific activityPurification 2-bSpecific activity/specific activity.mlmg/mlmgmilliunits/mlmilliunits%milliunits/mg-foldStarting material4.56.429.02.08.90.3Benzamidine0.30.100.03139121303801300Mono-Q1.00.0010.0011.11.110110036002-a Total activity/total activity.2-b Specific activity/specific activity.

BgSP-β was significantly more effective at degrading Azocoll (denatured collagen) than BgSP-α.

Open table in a new tab Based on N-terminal sequence data, a set of nested degenerate PCR primers was designed for each protease. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from the hepatopancreases of infected snails. This is the location where the parasite replicates and develops. A SmCE cDNA had previously been cloned from this source (14Newport G.R. McKerrow J.H. Hedstrom R. Petitt M. McGarrigle L. Barr P.J. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13179-13184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once the cercaria leaves the host snail, there is relatively little transcription or translation until after it enters the human host. The nested primers in conjunction with a poly(A) reverse primer yielded two bands of the predicted size. Cloning and sequencing of these two bands revealed two serine proteases of the chymotrypsin-fold family that are 76% similar (Fig. 3). The amino termini matched those of the purified proteases, and the S1 subsites were consistent with trypsin-like serine proteases. Both S1 pockets contained an aspartic acid at the position corresponding to trypsin 195d. A BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) search confirmed that both sequences are unique, but similar to other serine proteases with a chymotrypsin tertiary structure. BgSP-α has a putative glycosylation site at Asn51. The utilization of this glycosylation site is consistent with the observed molecular mass determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. BgSP-α has an apparent molecular mass 2–3 kDa larger than that of BgSP-β, yet their calculated molecular masses are 26,241 and 26,337 Da, respectively. Southern blot analysis showed that both protease sequences are present only in the genome of the intermediate host snail (Fig. 4). Additionally, genomic PCR usingB. glabrata DNA produced a fragment that contained both the protease sequence and the sequence of an intron with the consensus sequence for an acceptor site at the predicted junction (data not shown). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was generated against recombinant BgSP-β produced inE. coli and purified using a 6-histidine tag. Specific localization of the antiserum was visualized in granules produced by the epithelial cells in the hepatopancreas of the snail. No staining was seen at any stage of cercarial development or in or on free swimming cercariae. In contrast, polyclonal antiserum reactive against SmCE, generated with recombinant SmCE produced in E. coli, localized only within the secretory glands of the cercaria and did not stain the adjoining snail tissue (Fig. 5). A search of the gene data base revealed only five proteases that have been identified within the phylum Mollusca (NCBI accession number txid6447). Three of these proteases belong to be furin/Kex family of serine proteases (Lymnaea stagnalis(GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AF140362 andAF140361) and Helix aspersa (AF107213)), a structurally unrelated serine protease (i.e. a protease with a different protein fold). The two remaining proteases belong to the chymotrypsin family (B. glabrata (AA547777) andHaliotis rufescens (X71438)). The amino acid similarities between BgSP-α, BgSP-β, and these two family members range from 35 to 43%. Two conditions were tested to determine what factors may influence the production of BgSPs within the snail. The total activity of BgSPs within the hepatopancreas of the snail was not affected by feeding. No significant differences were seen over an 8-h time course of feeding following 24 h of starvation. Total activity within the hepatopancreas was affected by schistosome infection. The displacement and diminution of the snail hepatopancreas by the dividing parasite caused a “crowding out” effect and reduced the total activity of the BgSPs on average 10-fold (data not shown). The tripeptide inhibitor FPR-CMK was highly effective against the pooled native BgSPs (IC50 = 0.9 nm) and also had some activity against native SmCE (IC50 = 1700 nm). In contrast, AAPF-CMK was effective against SmCE (IC50 = 1200 nm), but had no measurable activity against the BgSPs (IC50 > 10,000 nm) (Table III). To evaluate the role of these proteases in the invasion process, anin vitro human skin invasion assay was used (9Cohen F.E. Gregoret L.M. Amiri P. Aldape K. Railey J. McKerrow J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11221-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Lim K.C. Sun E. Bahgat M. Bucks D. Guy R. Hinz R.S. Cullander C. McKerrow J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med.

AAPF-CMK was effective in reducing the number of cercariae penetrating by >80% (Fig. 6), whereas FPR-CMK produced a 50% reduction in cercarial penetration.Table IIIIC50 values for inhibitors of native SmCE and pooled native BgSPs and their predicted effect on cercariae invading human skinIC50Expected inhibitionAAPF-pNALGR-pNAIf SmCE is requiredIf BgSPs are requirednmAAPF-CMK1200>10,000++ 3-a++, >75% inhibition; +, >50% inhibition; +++, >95% inhibition.NoneFPR-CMK17000.9++++3-a ++, >75% inhibition; +, >50% inhibition; +++, >95% inhibition. Open table in a new tab Elastin is the skin protein most resistant to proteolysis. It is a major component of the dermal barrier to cercarial invasion (16Lewert R.M. Lee C.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1956; 99: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Fukuyama K. Tzeng S. McKerrow J. Epstein W.L. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. 1983; 11: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Native BgSP, native SmCE, and sequence-grade bovine chymotrypsin were compared on a molar basis against insoluble native bovine elastin. Only SmCE demonstrated significant elastase activity (Fig. 7). Three cleavage sites localizing to exons 12 (amino acids 202–225) and 13 (amino acids 226–239) of elastin were identified (Fig. 8). Exon 12 is the same location where macrophage elastase cleaves (18Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). 2R. P. Mecham, personal communication. S. mansoni cercariae directly penetrate human skin within 5–10 min after contact (19Stirewalt M.A. Hackey J.R. J. Parasitol. 1956; 42: 565-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During this process, 10 glands that compose ∼30% of the volume of a cercaria release their contents. Previous studies have shown that these glands contain and release proteolytic activity (12Stirewalt M.A. Austin B.E. J. Parasitol. 1973; 59: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Newport G.R. McKerrow J.H. Hedstrom R. Petitt M. McGarrigle L. Barr P.J. Agabian N. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1974; 35: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two proteases were proposed to be involved in skin invasion. The first, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease also known as SmCE, cleaves a variety of human skin macromolecules and has been studied in detail (9Cohen F.E. Gregoret L.M. Amiri P. Aldape K.

A. 1993; 90: 3583-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The second, a trypsin-like serine protease, has only recently been identified through the use of small synthetic substrates (10Dalton J.P. Clough K.A. Jones M.K. Brindley P.J. Parasitology. 1997; 114: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Secretions from cercariae were collected and assayed for trypsin-like activity using the substrate LGR-pNA. A purification strategy was developed, and the activity was found to result from two similar serine proteases designated BgSP-α and BgSP-β. Southern blot analysis and genomic PCR both demonstrated that the trypsin-like proteases are of snail host origin. The predominance of single bands and their similar arrangements between the two blots suggest that both genes are present in single copies and may be contiguous. Immunohistochemistry localized the protease to secretory vesicles within the epithelium of the snail hepatopancreas. The function of the trypsins in the snail is likely digestion. The trypsin-like activity is released by the snail during the release of cercariae and would therefore contaminate preparations of cercariae or their secretions. Expression of protease activity in the snail was “constitutive” without induction or enhanced release during feeding. However, less activity was found in infected snails due to replacement of the snail tissue by the developing parasites. Elastin is one of the most difficult host macromolecules to degrade, and few proteases are “true” elastases capable of degrading native insoluble elastin (23Mecham R.P. Broekelmann T.J. Fliszar C.J. Shapiro S.D. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18071-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of elastin degradation by parasite larvae, the site of cleavage by SmCE was determined. Solubilized fragments from native bovine elastin degraded by SmCE were purified and sequenced. Three cleavage sites localizing to two exons (exons 12 and 13, amino acids 202–239) within bovine elastin were discovered. To confirm the role of SmCE in the invasion process and to rule out any possible contribution of BgSP (e.g. being passively carried to skin by cercariae), a human skin invasion assay was used in combination with selective protease inhibitors. One inhibitor (AAPF-CMK) inhibited SmCE alone, whereas the other (LGR-CMK) inhibited both the proteases, but was 1900-fold more effective against BgSP. If BgSP contributed to invasion, FPR-CMK should have the predominant effect. If SmCE alone were responsible, both inhibitors should be effective, but AAPF-CMK would be more active. AAPF-CMK inhibited 80% of cercariae invasion, whereas LGR-CMK inhibited 50%. This is the expected result if SmCE was acting alone to facilitate cercarial invasion. SmCE is a biologically potent histolytic protease with activity against many of the macromolecular barriers of skin (5Gazzinelli G. Pellegrino J. J. Parasitol. 1964; 50: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Dresden M.H. Asch H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 289: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Tzeng S.

J. 1985; 231: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is one of the few true elastases capable of degrading insoluble elastin itself. Its cleavage pattern on elastin suggests that exons 12 and 13 (amino acids 202–239) are solvent-accessible domains. Exon 12 is also targeted by macrophage elastase, and the observations reported here support the conclusion of Mecham et al. (23Mecham R.P. Broekelmann T.J. Fliszar C.J. Shapiro S.D. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18071-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that “elastases” are a more diverse family of proteases than originally thought. Insoluble elastin can be degraded by proteases acting outside the alanine-rich regions targeted by mammalian pancreatic elastases."

AP-1 binding sites have been functionally linked to the transcriptional activation of various genes in response to TGF-β. Accordingly, we have previously shown that the heteromeric complex of Smad3 and Smad4 synergizes with c-Jun/c-Fos at the AP-1 binding site of the collagenase I promoter to induce transcriptional activation in response to TGF-β. Using the collagenase I promoter as model system, we have now investigated the role of the c-Jun and Smad3 interactions with the promoter DNA and have further characterized the physical basis of the c-Jun/Smad3 interaction in the transcriptional response. Mutational analyses of the c-Jun protein and the AP-1 binding site in the promoter revealed that the interaction of c-Jun with DNA is necessary for transcriptional activation by TGF-β and Smad3. Similar analyses of Smad3 and the Smad binding sites revealed that binding of Smad3 to DNA is also required, but that its DNA sequence-specific recognition is not essential. We also found that the basic leucine zipper domain of c-Jun and a short sequence close to the N terminus of Smad3 mediate their physical interaction, and that these regions are critical for their DNA-binding function. Our studies provide a basis for understanding the functional cooperativity of Smads with the diversity of transcription factors, which underlies the Smad-induced transcriptional activation in response to TGF-β and related factors.

This family of factors also regulates cell fate decisions and pattern formation during development in species from nematodes to vertebrates (4Harland R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10236-10243Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 6Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Many of the effects induced by TGF-β and related factors result from their ability to regulate transcription of specific sets of genes. The characterization of the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by these factors will provide insights into their role in normal physiological and pathological states. TGF-β signaling is initiated by a cell surface heteromeric complex of type I and type II receptors, which are both transmembrane serine/theronine kinases (7ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Upon ligand binding, the activated type II receptors phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor kinases, which then phosphorylate intracellular signaling mediators, including members of the Smad family of proteins. Smads have been identified as central mediators of the transcriptional effects of the TGF-β superfamily (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Attisano L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, nine Smad proteins have been identified thus far. Bone morphogeneic protein receptors phosphorylate and thereby activate Smads 1, 5, and 8, whereas activin/TGF-β receptors activate Smads 2 and 3. These pathway-specific Smad proteins then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 in the cytoplasm, and subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where they induce or repress transcription of specific genes. The mechanisms by which Smads regulate transcription are a subject of rapidly progressing research. Recent studies have revealed that three important functional characteristics are at the basis of the ability of Smads to activate transcription (11Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 14Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, Smads have an intrinsic DNA binding activity, which is mediated by a sequence in the conserved N-terminal domain, i.e. the N- or MH1-domain. Mad, the Drosophila homolog of Smads 1, 5, and 8, was first shown to be able to bind a GC-rich DNA sequence in the Dpp-responsivevestigial promoter (16Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and, similarly, Smad4 interacts with GC-rich sequences in the Xenopus goosecoidpromoter (17Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, Smads 3 and 4 bind to CAGA- or GTCT-like sequences in several other promoters (18Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

Second, Smads regulate transcription through functional and/or physical interactions with various transcription factors. For example, the Smad2/4 complex interacts with FAST-1 or -2 to activate transcription of the activin-responsive Xenopus Mix.2 or mousegoosecoid genes (17Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 25Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M.

Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, the Smad3/4 complex interacts with c-Jun or c-Jun/c-Fos at the TGF-β-responsive collagenase I promoter (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and the synthetic 3TP-promoter (18Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Smad3 interacts with the vitamin D receptor to mediate the effect of TGF-β on vitamin D3-induced transcription (28Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4 have also been shown to cooperate and interact with the basic helix-loop-helix protein TFE3 to activate transcription from PAI-1 promoter (29Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13105-13130Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Third, the ability of Smads to activate transcription depends on their ability to interact with the general transcription machinery. Thus, the C-terminal sequence of the receptor-activated Smads interacts directly with CBP or p300, two closely related coactivators, which mediate the transcriptional activity of a variety of transcription factors (31Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 32Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R.

These biochemical and molecular studies have established a general model of transcriptional regulation by Smads, whereby the Smads activate transcription through physical interactions and functional cooperativity with selected transcription factors and through their ability to bind DNA sequences in the promoter. The relative contributions of the Smad binding sites in the transcriptional response seem to vary depending on the promoter (14Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Eresh S. Riese J. Jackson D.B. Bohmann D. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 37Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Besides the cooperating transcription factors mentioned above, Smads are likely to engage in interactions with various other transcription factors as well, and the promoter sequence requirements may accordingly substantially differ from each other. Given this information, it is important to characterize the roles of protein-protein interaction and protein-DNA interaction in transducing the transcriptional responses to TGF-β or to Smads. We have previously shown that Smad3 and Smad4 synergize with c-Jun to mediate TGF-β-induced immediate early transcriptional activation of a minimal human collagenase I promoter. This functional synergy correlates with the ability of Smad3 to interact directly with c-Jun, while c-Jun and Smad3 both can bind to an AP-1 binding promoter sequence and a partially overlapping Smad binding sequence, respectively (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). This functional cooperativity between Smad3 and c-Jun is of particular interest to understand the ability of TGF-β to activate transcription of a variety of genes. Many TGF-β-inducible genes, such as PAI-1 (38Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Additionally, TGF-β enhances the expression of some AP-1 family members (20Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 22Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

In this report, we further characterized the functional cooperativity of c-Jun and Smad3 in TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation using the collagenase I promoter as model system. We have now: 1) examined the roles of the c-Jun and Smad DNA binding sites in transactivation of the collagenase I promoter, 2) assessed the relative contributions of DNA binding activities by c-Jun and Smad3 to TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation and to their functional cooperativity, and 3) characterized the physical interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun, and defined the sequence requirement for their association. We find that the AP-1 binding site and the DNA-binding functions of both c-Jun and Smad3 are essential for promoter activation by TGF-β. However, in contrast to the AP-1 binding site, the sequence of the Smad-binding site is less critical. We also find that the N-terminal domain of Smad3 and the basic leucine zipper domain of c-Jun mediate their physical interactions and are critical for their DNA-binding activity. Our studies provide a basis for understanding the functional cooperation of Smads with other transcription factors. Smad3 and derivatives were expressed as N-terminally Flag-tagged versions using the cytomegalovirus-driven pRK5 expression plasmid. pRK5-Smad3, which expresses wild-type Smad3 with an N-terminal Flag tag has been described before (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The Smad3ΔLG, Smad3R74D, Smad3(4A), Smad3(40A), Smad3(41A), Smad3(43A), and Smad3(44A) mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis, and the PCR products were inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII orEcoRI-SalI sites of expression vector pXF1F, a pRK5 derivative with the Flag epitope tag inserted into theClaI-EcoRI sites of pRK5 (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). c-Jun and derivatives were expressed as N-terminally hemagglutinin-tagged versions. pRSV-c-Jun and the RSV vector have been described (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding wild-type c-Jun, c-JunV273, or c-JunΔRK were generated by PCR using pRSV-c-Jun, pSV-c-JunV273, or pSV-c-JunΔRK (46Ransone L.J. Visvader J. Wamsley P. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding c-JunΔC19 and c-JunΔLZ were generated by PCR and ligated into the PstI-HindIII sites of pXF1H-c-Jun. Details about plasmid constructions will be provided upon request. The −73Col-Luc plasmid contains the −73 to +63 sequence of the human collagenase I promoter, which drives the expression of a luciferase reporter gene (47Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 48Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The −60Col-Luc reporter is identical except that it lacks the nucleotides between −73 and −61. Both plasmids were obtained from Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego). D14-Luc was made by replacing the −73 to +63 fragment in plasmid −73Col-Luc with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the −73 to +13 region of the promoter. All other promoter mutants were made by PCR-based mutagenesis using the following primer sets, whereby lower case letters in the primers denote mutations: 1) mA-luc (forward, 5′-GGA TCC AAG CTT GAg GAG TCA GAC AC 3′; reverse, 5′-CGC GTA CCG GAA TGC CAA GCT GGA ATT-3′ (p20V 3′ primer)), 2) mS-Luc (forward, 5′-GGA TCC AAG CTT GAT GAG TCA cga ACC TCT G 3′; reverse, p20V 3′ primer), 3) D14 m1m2-Luc (forward, 5′-ACT CAA GCT TGA GTC Acg aAC CTC TaT CTT TCT GG-3′ (Col m1 m2 primer); reverse, p20V 3′ primer), 4) D14 m3-Luc (forward, 5′-TGTATC TTA TCA TGT CTG GAT CC 3′ (p20V 5′primer); reverse, 5′-TAG AGC TCT TGC TGC TCC AAT ATC CCA GCT AGG AAG CTC CCa aTG TAT ATA TAG-3′ (Col m3 primer)), and 5) D14 m1m2m3 (forward, Col m1 m2 primer; reverse, Col m3 primer). The PCR products were digested with HindIII and SstI, and subcloned into the HindIII-SstI sites of −73Col-Luc. All promoter mutants were verified by sequencing. Mv1Lu epithelial cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml ampicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. F9 and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml ampicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections of Mv1Lu cells were performed in six-well tissue culture plates using the standard DEAE-dextran method (49Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Transfections of F9 and HepG2 cells were carried out in six-well plates using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each transfection, 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and, when indicated, 0.25 μg of the Smad3 expression plasmid and 0.15 μg of the c-Jun expression plasmid were used. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector, as needed. Cotransfection of 0.15 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pSV-β-Gal) allowed all transfections to be normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. TGF-β treatment and luciferase assays were carried out as described (50Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Plasmids pGEX-Smad3, pGEX-Smad3N, pGEX-Smad3NL, and pGEX-Smad3LC, which allow expression of GST-fused Smad3 or Smad3 fragments in Escherichia coli, have been described (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). GST-Smad3ΔH2 was made by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment encoding amino acid 48–425 of Smad3 into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other GST-Smad3 fusions were generated by subcloning PCR-generated cDNA fragments into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detailed information about plasmid constructions will be provided upon request. The full-length and mutants of Smad3 fused to GST were expressed in E. coli and semi-purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B adsorption according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 35S-labeled c-Jun and mutants of c-Jun were generated by in vitrotranscription and translation from the pXF1H-based expression vectors described above. In vitro protein binding assays to test the ability of these radiolabeled products to interact with Smad3 were performed as described. To avoid nonspecific interaction through DNA, the glutathione-Sepharose beads with adsorbed GST or GST-Smad3 proteins were washed with TE buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.6 m NaCl to remove bacterial DNA. For each protein binding assay, 3–5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to the beads was incubated with 35S-labeled c-Jun or c-Jun mutant in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.95, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% skimmed milk, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 1 h, then washed four times in binding buffer without milk. Specifically associated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides, corresponding to the human collagenase I promoter, as indicated, were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase or 3′-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment. The overlapping AP-1/Smad binding sequence in the wild-type collagenase I promoter oligonucleotide (Fig. 2) differed from the EMSA probe used in Zhang et al. (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) with one nucleotide in the SBE, i.e. AGAC in this study versus AGCC in Zhanget al. (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Additionally, the commercially available oligonucleotide (Promega) used in the latter study (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) contained flanking sequences unrelated to the collagenase I promoter sequence. DNA binding assays were carried out as described (24Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) except that 26 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) was used as a nonspecific competitor, and the preincubation of DNA and protein was carried out at 4 °C. For each assay, 100–300 ng of Smad3 proteins fused to GST were used. Excess unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture before preincubation, as required. The sequence of the double-stranded SBE oligonucleotide used as a probe was 5′-TAA AGC ATG AGT CTA GAC ACC TCT G-3′ and its complementary strand. The nonspecific competitor oligonucleotides Oct1 and AP2 were purchased from Promega. To generate the methylation interference probes, the −73 to +13 region of the collagenase I promoter was excised from D14-Luc or D14 m1m2m3-Luc usingEcoRI and BamHI, and subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene), generating pBS-D14 or pBS-D14 m1m2m3. The wild-type and mutant probes were then generated by restriction digestion usingSstII and ClaI (to label the upper strand), orKpnI and XbaI (to label the lower strand), and labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase. 0.5 μl of DMS was then added per 100 μl of labeling reaction mixture containing 500 ng of DNA. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 40 μl of 1.5 m sodium acetate, 0.5m dithiothreitol was added. The probes were then precipitated by addition of ethanol, dissolved in 100 mmTris, pH 8.0, and used in EMSA as described above. After a short exposure of the gel at 4 °C, the unbound free DNA probes and shifted complexes were excised and the DNA was electro-eluted, precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of 1 m piperidine. The samples were incubated at 95 °C for 30 min, and piperidine was removed by several rounds of lyophilization and resuspension in H2O. The samples were electrophoresed on DNA sequencing gels. The plasmid encoding Smad3 fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 has been described (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To obtain plasmids for Smad3ΔLG, Smad3R74D and Smad3(4A) fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, the DNA fragments encoding Smad3ΔLG, Smad3R74D, and Smad3(4A) were generated by PCR and subcloned into theEcoRI-SalI sites of the mammalian expression vector pXF1Gal4, a pRK5 derivative with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) inserted between ClaI/EcoRI sites of pRK5 (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The abilities of Smad3 and its derivatives to transactivate the heterologous Gal4 promoter reporter, pFR-Luc (Stratagene), were assayed essentially as described (32Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We have shown that c-Jun synergizes with Smad3 to activate TGF-β-induced transcription (23Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To characterize this functional cooperativity at the collagenase I promoter, we used the luciferase reporter plasmid −73C"
https://openalex.org/W2062120441,"The syndrome of nonthyroidal illness, also known as the sick euthyroid syndrome, is characterized by a low plasma T3 and an “inappropriately normal” plasma thyrotropin in the absence of intrinsic disease of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. The syndrome is due in part to decreased activity of type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase (5′ D-I), the hepatic enzyme that converts thyroxine to T3 and that is induced at the transcriptional level by T3. The hypothesis tested is that cytokines decrease T3 induction of 5′ D-I, resulting in decreased T3 production and hence a further decrease in 5′ D-I. The proposed mechanism is competition for limiting amounts of nuclear receptor coactivators between the 5′ D-I promoter and the promoters of cytokine-induced genes. Using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, we demonstrate that interleukins 1 and 6 inhibit the T3 induction of 5′ D-I RNA and enzyme activity. This effect is at the level of transcription and can be partially overcome by exogenous steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). The physical mass of endogenous SRC-1 is not affected by cytokine exposure, and exogenous SRC-1 does not affect 5′ D-I in the absence of cytokines.

However, this regulatory system is perturbed by virtually any medical illness or surgical stress, resulting in what is known as the syndrome of nonthyroidal illness or the sick euthyroid syndrome (for reviews, see Refs. 1McIver B. Gorman C.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar and 2Chopra I.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The characteristic features of this syndrome are a low plasma T3 concentration with an “inappropriately normal” TSH. The syndrome is seen with both acute and chronic illnesses such as trauma, myocardial infarction, infection, malignancy, and renal failure. The more severe the nonthyroidal illness, the more depressed is the T3 level. Hospitalized patients will often have a frankly low TSH, and occasionally the T4 level also is low in very sick individuals. In fact, a correlation exists between the magnitude of the thyroid function test abnormalities and the mortality rate. The thyroid function test abnormalities resolve if the patient recovers from the nonthyroidal illness.The mechanism that underlies the sick euthyroid syndrome is poorly understood but is clearly multifactorial. Both central (pituitary or hypothalamic) and peripheral defects are apparent. The central defect is manifest by abnormally low secretion of TSH in response to low circulating thyroid hormone levels. Multiple peripheral defects in the distribution and metabolism of thyroid hormone have been observed, but perhaps the most important is a decrease in the conversion of T4 to T3 (3Kaptein E.M. Hennemann G. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism. Marcel Dekker, New York1986: 297-334Google Scholar, 4Nicoloff J.T. LoPresti J.S. Braverman L.E. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid. 7th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 286-296Google Scholar). It is estimated that direct thyroidal secretion accounts for only approximately 20% of plasma T3. The majority of plasma T3 derives from thyroxine deiodination, primarily by the hepatocyte enzyme type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase. The activity of this enzyme is diminished in the sick euthyroid syndrome, thus accounting for the low plasma T3 despite a normal plasma T4.Hepatocyte 5′ D-I is induced at the transcriptional level by T3 (5Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5100-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, if a signal leads to a decrease in hepatocyte 5′ D-I, the result will be a decrease in plasma T3, which will then lead to a further decrease in 5′ D-I production, thereby creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral of plasma T3 concentration. In the sick euthyroid syndrome, it is presumed that an illness or stress leads to such a signal, creating this downward spiral. Because the sick euthyroid syndrome occurs with essentially any medical illness or surgical stress, the initial signal must be something quite general. In this regard, attention has focused on the role of cytokines (6Bartalena L. Bogazzi F. Brogioni S. Grasso L. Martino E. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which are known to be elevated under a wide array of pathological circumstances.In this paper, the following hypothesis is tested using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Cytokines induce the expression of multiple genes, resulting in competition for limiting amounts of transcriptional coactivators between those genes and the T3-regulated 5′ D-I gene. The resulting coactivator deficiency limits the T3 induction of 5′ D-I, which results in decreased T3 generation, thus initiating the downward spiral. The return of availability of the coactivators results in resolution of the syndrome.DISCUSSIONThe sick euthyroid syndrome is a response to virtually any acute or chronic illness characterized by a decreased plasma T3 and “inappropriately normal” TSH. Whether the body is actually euthyroid or hypothyroid is uncertain (23De Groot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The fact that the TSH rises upon resolution of the syndrome, often to levels above normal, until the plasma T3 normalizes (24Bacci V. Schussler G.C. Kaplan T.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) would argue that the body is actually hypothyroid, but that this is a physiological response to illness. Teleologically, it is argued that the sick euthyroid syndrome evolved to lower metabolic rate and conserve energy. Presumably, the syndrome was adaptive during evolution, but whether it may be maladaptive under certain circumstances is debated (23De Groot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The correlation between the magnitude of thyroid blood test abnormalities and mortality rate (25Maldonado L.S. Murata G.H. Hershman J.M. Braunstein G.D. Thyroid. 1992; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests a causal relationship and has led to small trials of thyroid hormone therapy in extremely sick patients (26Becker R.A. Vaughan G.M. Ziegler G. Seraile L.G. Goldfarb I.W. Mansour E.H. McManus W.F. Pruitt Jr., B.A. Mason Jr., A.D. Crit. Care Med. 1982; 10: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Brent G.A. Hershman J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). No clinical trial has demonstrated an improved outcome when such patients are treated with thyroid hormone. However, an interpretation of the studies to date is clouded by the small number of patients studied, as well as by uncertainties regarding the appropriate dose and form of thyroid hormone and the patient populations that should be treated. It remains possible that the sick euthyroid syndrome is maladaptive for certain subsets of very ill patients, but who those patients are and how they should be treated remain unknown. A better understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies the sick euthyroid syndrome would provide insight into these important questions.The sick euthyroid syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in the secretion of TSH (inappropriately ”normal“ TSH despite low serum T3) and the production of T3 (decreased 5′ deiodination of T4). Interest in the role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of the sick euthyroid syndrome derives from the fact that cytokines are elevated in most medical illnesses and thus could explain the broad circumstances under which the sick euthyroid syndrome is known to occur. A single injection of lipopolysaccharide into cattle, which raises circulating cytokine levels, caused decreases in the plasma T3 concentration and hepatocyte 5′ D-I activity (28Kahl S. Elsasser T.H. Blum J.W. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 2000; 18: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One injection of IL-6 into healthy humans resulted in a transient decrease in serum T3 and TSH (29Torpy D.J. Tsigos C. Lotsikas A.J. Defensor R. Chrousos G.P. Papanicolaou D.A. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1289-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), changes that are reminiscent of the sick euthyroid syndrome. An analysis of 100 consecutive hospitalized patients revealed a weak inverse correlation between the serum levels of IL-6 and T3 (30Boelen A. Platvoet-Ter Schiphorst M.C. Wiersinga W.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with studies in wild-type versus IL-6 null mice (31Boelen A. Maas M.A.W. Lowik C.W.G.M. Platvoet M.C. Wiersinga W.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5250-5254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, following injection of lipopolysaccharide, serum T3 fell in both wild-type and null mice, but the drop was smaller in the IL-6 null animals. Hepatic 5′ D-I RNA decreased in all mice, but again the decrease was smaller in the IL-6 null animals. Taken together, the data suggest that circulating IL-6 plays a role in the pathogenesis of the sick euthyroid syndrome but that it cannot, by itself, fully account for the fall in serum T3. On the other hand, a single injection of IL-6 into wild-type mice had no effect on hepatocyte 5′ D-I RNA, but a single injection of IL-1 caused a transient decrease (32Boelen A. Platvoet-Ter Schiphorst M.C. Bakker O. Wiersinga W.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 146: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-1 also may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the sick euthyroid syndrome. Overall, a combination of various cytokines probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of the sick euthyroid syndrome, although other factors also are likely to be involved.Cytokines ultimately exert their effects by regulating gene expression. The binding of IL-6 to its receptor results in activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (STATs 1 and 3), as well as activation of MAP kinase (for reviews see Refs. 33Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I.

Consequently, a large number of hepatocyte genes are induced, such as those encoding the classical acute phase proteins, and transcription factors such as JunB, c-Fos, and CEBPβ. IL-1 also activates a large number of genes, including the IL-6 gene. Although the signal transduction pathways are not as clear cut, activation of NF-κB is an important step in the action of IL-1 (for reviews, see Refs. 22Stylianou E. Saklatvala J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 34Ramadori G. Christ B. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). IL-1 also activates MAP kinase.Nuclear receptors, including the thyroid hormone receptor, have served as an important paradigm for studying the mechanisms of gene induction by enhancer-binding proteins. The TR contains a transcriptional activation domain known as activator function 2 (AF-2) within its ligand binding domain. The binding of T3 to the TR results in a conformational change, allowing AF-2 to interact with coactivator proteins. The coactivator proteins, in turn, activate gene expression, probably by a variety of mechanisms including acetylation of histones (35Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J.X.

Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, although the TR is bound to DNA even in the absence of hormone, ligand binding is required for the AF-2 domain to activate transcription. A large number of coactivators have been identified that can interact with the AF-2 domain of the TR and other nuclear receptors. The first to be described, SRC-1 (37Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), is now known to be part of a family of structurally related 160-kDa coactivators. SRC-1 is able to form a complex with at least two other coactivators, CBP (12Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Although SRC-1 originally was thought to be a specific coactivator for nuclear receptors, it too now appears to have a broader role. Thus, SRC-1 has been shown to be a coactivator for numerous other transcription factors, such as NF-κB (45Na S.Y. Lee S.K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). It is this idea, coupled with the knowledge that 5′ D-I is induced by T3, that has led to the following working model of inhibition of hepatocyte 5′ D-I in the sick euthyroid syndrome. Cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 are induced by nonthyroidal illness and lead to the induction of a broad array of hepatocyte genes. These genes compete with the 5′ D-I gene for limiting amounts of one or more coactivators, resulting in a decrease in the T3-supported level of 5′ D-I activity. This leads to a decrease in circulating T3, which serves to further decrease 5′ D-I gene transcription, thus creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral of T3 production and plasma T3 concentration. This situation would reverse itself if coactivators became increasingly available. This hypothesis does not address the mechanism of decreased TSH secretion, nor does it address other potential contributors to the sick euthyroid syndrome such as decreased T4 entry into cells (48Sarne D.H. Refetoff S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 61: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and thus it is meant to explain only one aspect of the syndrome.The data presented herein largely support this proposed mechanism. We find that IL-1 and IL-6 inhibit the T3 induction of 5′ D-I in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and that a similar inhibition is seen with other T3 responsive genes. Reporter gene experiments using the 5′ D-I promoter indicate that the cytokine effect is transcriptional, which is not surprising given that the T3 effect is transcriptional. Importantly, this cytokine effect can be overcome partially by cotransfection of the coactivator SRC-1. However, SRC-1 does not affect T3 induction in the absence of cytokines, indicating that this coactivator is not rate-limiting until the cytokines are present. In theory, IL-1 and IL-6 could make SRC-1 rate-limiting in a number of ways. They could, for example, decrease the physical mass of SRC-1. However, this explanation has been excluded by Western blot analysis. We favor the concept that coactivators become limiting because they are being sequestered on the promoters of genes activated by the cytokines, as this seems to be a direct and simple explanation that is consistent with our data. However, other explanations would be possible in theory, such as changes in coactivator phosphorylation. In this regard, SRC-1 is a phosphoprotein, but the functional significance of this phosphorylation is not known (49Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Exogenous SRC-1 only partially overcame the inhibitory effect of IL-1 in our experimental system. This result could simply be an issue of experimental details; a stronger effect may require expression of this coactivator prior to the addition of T3 and IL-1, or for a longer period of time, or at a higher level. Also, it is possible that other coactivators play an important role, or that coactivator-independent mechanisms contribute to the cytokine effect. It should be noted that even a modest increase in 5′ D-I promoter activity due to increased coactivator availability would likely be important. This is because 5′ D-I enzyme activity produces T3, which will further induce the promoter.If the working hypothesis is correct, it would have important implications for the treatment of the sick euthyroid syndrome. Treatment with T3 might be harmful, rather than helpful, because this would serve to draw coactivators away from IL-1- and IL-6-induced genes that presumably serve important adaptive functions. A more logical approach might be to increase the amounts of SRC-1 or other key coactivators, which presumably would require a better understanding of the factors that regulate coactivator levels. Under ordinary circumstances, plasma levels of thyroid hormone are tightly regulated by a homeostatic feedback loop in which hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates secretion of TSH1 by the anterior pituitary, which in turn stimulates secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine represses the synthesis and secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and TSH to complete the negative feedback loop. However, this regulatory system is perturbed by virtually any medical illness or surgical stress, resulting in what is known as the syndrome of nonthyroidal illness or the sick euthyroid syndrome (for reviews, see Refs. 1McIver B. Gorman C.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar and 2Chopra I.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The characteristic features of this syndrome are a low plasma T3 concentration with an “inappropriately normal” TSH. The syndrome is seen with both acute and chronic illnesses such as trauma, myocardial infarction, infection, malignancy, and renal failure. The more severe the nonthyroidal illness, the more depressed is the T3 level. Hospitalized patients will often have a frankly low TSH, and occasionally the T4 level also is low in very sick individuals. In fact, a correlation exists between the magnitude of the thyroid function test abnormalities and the mortality rate. The thyroid function test abnormalities resolve if the patient recovers from the nonthyroidal illness. The mechanism that underlies the sick euthyroid syndrome is poorly understood but is clearly multifactorial. Both central (pituitary or hypothalamic) and peripheral defects are apparent. The central defect is manifest by abnormally low secretion of TSH in response to low circulating thyroid hormone levels. Multiple peripheral defects in the distribution and metabolism of thyroid hormone have been observed, but perhaps the most important is a decrease in the conversion of T4 to T3 (3Kaptein E.M. Hennemann G. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism. Marcel Dekker, New York1986: 297-334Google Scholar, 4Nicoloff J.T. LoPresti J.S. Braverman L.E. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid. 7th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 286-296Google Scholar). It is estimated that direct thyroidal secretion accounts for only approximately 20% of plasma T3. The majority of plasma T3 derives from thyroxine deiodination, primarily by the hepatocyte enzyme type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase. The activity of this enzyme is diminished in the sick euthyroid syndrome, thus accounting for the low plasma T3 despite a normal plasma T4. Hepatocyte 5′ D-I is induced at the transcriptional level by T3 (5Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5100-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, if a signal leads to a decrease in hepatocyte 5′ D-I, the result will be a decrease in plasma T3, which will then lead to a further decrease in 5′ D-I production, thereby creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral of plasma T3 concentration. In the sick euthyroid syndrome, it is presumed that an illness or stress leads to such a signal, creating this downward spiral. Because the sick euthyroid syndrome occurs with essentially any medical illness or surgical stress, the initial signal must be something quite general. In this regard, attention has focused on the role of cytokines (6Bartalena L. Bogazzi F. Brogioni S. Grasso L. Martino E. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which are known to be elevated under a wide array of pathological circumstances. In this paper, the following hypothesis is tested using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Cytokines induce the expression of multiple genes, resulting in competition for limiting amounts of transcriptional coactivators between those genes and the T3-regulated 5′ D-I gene. The resulting coactivator deficiency limits the T3 induction of 5′ D-I, which results in decreased T3 generation, thus initiating the downward spiral. The return of availability of the coactivators results in resolution of the syndrome. DISCUSSIONThe sick euthyroid syndrome is a response to virtually any acute or chronic illness characterized by a decreased plasma T3 and “inappropriately normal” TSH. Whether the body is actually euthyroid or hypothyroid is uncertain (23De Groot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The fact that the TSH rises upon resolution of the syndrome, often to levels above normal, until the plasma T3 normalizes (24Bacci V. Schussler G.C. Kaplan T.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) would argue that the body is actually hypothyroid, but that this is a physiological response to illness. Teleologically, it is argued that the sick euthyroid syndrome evolved to lower metabolic rate and conserve energy. Presumably, the syndrome was adaptive during evolution, but whether it may be maladaptive under certain circumstances is debated (23De Groot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The correlation between the magnitude of thyroid blood test abnormalities and mortality rate (25Maldonado L.S. Murata G.H. Hershman J.M. Braunstein G.D. Thyroid. 1992; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests a causal relationship and has led to small trials of thyroid hormone therapy in extremely sick patients (26Becker R.A. Vaughan G.M. Ziegler G. Seraile L.G. Goldfarb I.W. Mansour E.H. McManus W.F. Pruitt Jr., B.A. Mason Jr., A.D. Crit. Care Med. 1982; 10: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Brent G.A. Hershman J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). No clinical trial has demonstrated an improved outcome when such patients are treated with thyroid hormone. However, an interpretation of the studies to date is clouded by the small number of patients studied, as well as by uncertainties regarding the appropriate dose and form of thyroid hormone and the patient populations that should be treated. It remains possible that the sick euthyroid syndrome is maladaptive for certain subsets of very ill patients, but who those patients are and how they should be treated remain unknown. A better understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies the sick euthyroid syndrome would provide insight into these important questions.The sick euthyroid syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in the secretion of TSH (inappropriately ”normal“ TSH despite low serum T3) and the production of T3 (decreased 5′ deiodination of T4).

Whether these proteins carry a physiological ionic current is not yet known in any tissue. Of the purinergic agonists released during ischemia and other pathological conditions, adenosine has been the most extensively studied. However, under similar conditions, ATP is also released into the extracellular space (9Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 10Kuzmin A.I.

Extracellular ATP modulates the inward rectifying K+ currents, IK1 and IK(Ach), and a delayed outward rectifying current in atrial cells (11Matsuura H. Sakaguchi M. Tsuruhara Y. Ehara T. J. Physiol.

Recently, it was postulated that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the enhancement of the delayed rectifier K+ current by ATP in guinea pig ventricular cells (13Matsubayashi T. Matsuura H. Ehara T. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 635-642PubMed Google Scholar). Besides activating ionotropic P2X receptors, purinergic stimulation by ATP might involve several of the multiple metabotropic P2Y receptors found in cardiac cells (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G.

ATP also activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in several tissues (19Bolego C. Ceruti S. Brambilla R. Puglisi L. Cattabeni F. Burnstock G. Abbracchio M.P. Br. J.

In a variety of cell types, PLA2 activation occurs as a result of phosphorylation by MAPKs (22Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J.

In neutrophils, it was recently reported that inhibitors of p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK individually reduced cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2) activity, whereas their combined blockade caused a total inhibition of cPLA2 (24Hazan-Halevy I. Seger R. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12416-12423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid (AA), which is released by cPLA2 during metabolic inhibition or ischemia, activates a K+ current, IK(AA), in rat neonatal atrial and adult ventricular cells (25Kim D. Clapham D.E.

The channel subunit protein underlying IK(AA) is unknown. We now report a TREK-like K+ current in isolated rat ventricular cells. This current is activated by extracellular ATP via the release of arachidonic acid after cPLA2 activation. The purinergic-dependent activation of cPLA2requires the simultaneous activation of both p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, respectively. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the heart of urethane-anesthetized (2 g/kg, i.p.) Wistar rats as described previously (27Aimond F. Alvarez J.L. Rauzier J.M. Lorente P. Vassort G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The heart was first perfused for 5 min at 35 °C with a nominally Ca-free HEPES-buffered solution containing 117 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 4.4 mmNaHCO3, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 21 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm taurine and then perfused for 40 min with the same solution plus 30 μm Ca2+and 1.2 mg/ml collagenase (CLS4; Worthington). The heart was then gently dissociated through the bore of a large-tip pipette, followed by two decantations to separate dead cells. The cells were then suspended in HEPES buffer with 1 mm Ca2+ and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The yield of well-striated, elongated cells was near 80%. Recording of K+currents was performed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at room temperature (22 °C ± 2 °C). Electrode resistance was between 0.9–1.1 megaohms. The series resistance (Rs), membrane capacitance (Cm), and time constant of membrane capacitance (τc) were determined on voltage-clamped cells according to the equations: Cm=τcI0/(Em(1−(I∞/I0)))and Rs=τc·CmEquation 1 in which Io is the maximum membrane current, I∞ is the current at the end of the 10-ms pulse, and Em is the amplitude of the voltage step (2 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV). K+ currents were recorded during 400-ms-long pulses applied between −130 mV and +50 mV every 6 s in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −50 mV or from a holding potential of −80 mV in some cases, as specified. Recordings were digitized at 200 μs with a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter acquired and analyzed using pClamp 6 software. For experiments, a cell aliquot was put in a Petri dish containing the control solution (117 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). After achieving whole-cell patch-clamp configuration, the cell was exposed to different extracellular solutions by positioning it at the extremity of one of six capillaries (250-μm inner diameter). Such a system allowed rapid changes of solution (<1 s). The control solution was supplemented with 50 μm tetrodotoxin and 2 mmCoCl2 to block Na+ and Ca2+currents, respectively. The internal solution contained 120 mm KCl, 6.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm sodium creatine phosphate, 0.4 mm Na2GTP, 11 mmEGTA, 4.7 mm CaCl2 (120 nm free Ca2+), and 20 mm HEPES; pH was adjusted with KOH to 7.2; total K+ = 145 mm. Cells were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Batches of 250,000 cardiac cells were incubated for 6 min at 37 °C with 30 μm ATPγS, 40 μm arachidonic acid, or 1 μm isoproterenol with or without preincubation with specific inhibitors. Incubation was stopped by addition of perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in NaOH and used to estimate protein content (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The supernatant was neutralized by K2CO3, and the perchlorate precipitate was spun down. An aliquot of the supernatant was used for the cAMP assay. A high specific binding protein assay kit was used to determine cAMP content. Freshly isolated myocytes were prelabeled with [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove free [3H]AA and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The different inhibitors were then added for 20 min before applying the agonist (30 μm ATPγS). Radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting (22Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). After stimulation, cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm Na4P4O7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaF, pH 8.0, supplemented with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysed cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to separate the membrane and contractile proteins from the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was then resuspended with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.2 μmleupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Phosphorylation of MAPK was determined using the cytosolic fraction, whereas cPLA2activity was measured using the membrane fraction. Briefly, proteins from each fraction were loaded (100 μg/lane) on 7.5% acrylamide gels and run overnight. After electrophoretic transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the different antibodies. Antibodies against cPLA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphorylated p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK (New England Biolabs) were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Bound primary antibody was revealed using secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:6,000) for cPLA2 or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000) for MAPK and enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were quantified by a digital imaging system. If necessary, the blots were stripped for 20 min at 50 °C in a Tris buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 10 mm mercaptoethanol adjusted to pH 6.7. Total RNA was prepared from isolated ventricular cells purified on Percoll gradient. Briefly, cells were lysed in guanidinium thiocyanate-containing buffer, and RNA was extracted by a modified phenol chloroform method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 30Richards S.M. Jaconi M.E. Vassort G. Puceat M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using 50 units of SUPERSCRIPT II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3 μm oligo(dT)16, and 5 mmdNTP. PCR was carried out using a set of gene-specific primers designed to anneal to the cDNA of mouse TREK-1 (GenBankTM accession number U73488) (forward primer, 5′-TTTGGCTTTCTACTGGCTGGGG- 3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCGTCTTCTTAGAGATCACCCG-3′ corresponding to sequences 991–1012 and 1372–1393 in the open reading frame of mouse cDNA). Amplification was performed using a touch down protocol comprising 20 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C to 55 °C (−0.5 °C/cycle) for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, followed by 20 cycles at a constant annealing temperature of 55 °C and a final extension step of 8 min at 72 °C. TREK cDNA was also amplified from 300 ng of a mouse 11-day-old embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH). The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the ethidium bromide-stained bands were visualized by scanning photographs of gels using a charge-coupled device camera and Image J 1.01 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The nature of the PCR products was checked by size and confirmed by two sequencing runs using the same primers used for PCR and a second set of primers (forward primer, 5′-CTCCCTGCGGTCATATTCAAGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTCTTAGAGATCACCCGTAGCC-3′) annealing to the two extremities of the fragment amplified by PCR). Comparisons of data were made using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In rat ventricular myocytes, three distinct K+ currents are usually recorded. Hyperpolarizing pulses activate the inward rectifier K+current (IK1) sensitive to low (≈100 μm) Ba2+ concentrations, whereas depolarizing pulses induce activation of the transient outward K+ current (Ito) sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (≈3 mm) and of the delayed rectifier K+ (IK) current sensitive to tetraethylamonium (≈20 mm) (31Barry D.M. Nerbonne J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 363-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The external application of 30 μm ATP induced an increase in both the outward and inward currents that reached steady state after 6 min (Fig. 1 A). The ATP-induced outward current exhibited a fast activation with no inactivation during the imposed voltage steps. In parallel experiments performed in the presence of 3 mm 4-aminopyridine, the time to peak was 7.1 ± 1.3 ms at +50 mV (n = 10). During hyperpolarizing voltage steps to −130 mV, the ATP-induced inward current was large, peaked at 5.5 ± 0.3 ms (n = 10), and demonstrated fast inactivation before reaching a steady value after about 100 ms. Mean current density/voltage relationships established during the first 20 ms of the applied voltage step at the peak of the inward and outward current demonstrated a significant increase in the inward current only (Fig. 1 B). The outward peak current was hardly enhanced as a result of a weak inhibition of Ito. The ATP-induced mean current density/voltage relationship established at the end of the 400-ms voltage pulses exhibited a weak outward-going rectification above −60 mV and showed inward rectification below this voltage (Fig. 1 C). Similar effects were obtained by applying ATPγS (30 μm), or ATP in the presence of theophylline (100 μm), an inhibitor of adenosine-sensitive P1-purinoceptors, whereas the ATP effects were inhibited by suramin, a P2-purinoceptor antagonist (data not shown). Thus, current activation results from ATP activation of P2-purinergic receptors. ATP activated a muscarinic-like K+ current in rat ventricular cells (data not shown), as it does in atrial cells (11Matsuura H. Sakaguchi M. Tsuruhara Y. Ehara T. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 490: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the continued presence of acetylcholine, which itself induced a large transient inward current, the further application of ATP was able to induce sustained outward and inward currents, but not the large transient inward current (Fig. 1 D). Under these conditions, the ATP-induced current showed a fast activation phase with no inactivation for both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses. Similarly, on cells that have been pretreated with PTX to inactivate the muscarinic cascade, ATP induced sustained inward and outward currents (Fig. 1 E). Current/voltage relationships of the ATP-induced sustained current in the presence of Ach or after PTX pretreatment show weak inward and outward rectification with similar reversal potential and conductance (Fig. 1 F). Consequently, ATP activates both a muscarinic-like and a specific P2-purinergic-induced current in isolated ventricular myocytes of the rat. In the following experiments, the properties of the latter current were analyzed. Several compounds known to affect cardiac K+ currents were used to characterize the specific ATP-induced sustained K+ current. Their effects are quantified here on the sustained outward current elicited at +50 mV (Table I). The ATP-induced outward K+ current was enhanced in K+-rich solution, insensitive to glibenclamide, a specific inhibitor of the K(ATP) current, and significantly inhibited by tetracain, Gd3+, and by 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylamonium, and Ba2+ only at high concentrations (Table I). AA is known to trigger an increase in sustained outward K+ currents in cardiomyocytes (25Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 26Kim D. Duff R.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Bogdanov K.Y. Spurgeon H.A. Vinogradova T.M. Lakatta E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H571-H579PubMed Google Scholar) and to activate several two-pore domain K+ channels (2Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In the presence of AA, ATP had no further significant effect (Fig. 2; Table I). The effects of both ATP and AA were similar in the presence of indomethacin and NDGA, respectively, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors (data not shown). The application of 90 mmHCO−3, which is known to induce intracellular acidosis and activate TREK-1 (6Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), mimicked the effect of ATP by activating the sustained K+ current (Fig. 2; Table I). The subsequent application of ATP was without further effect. Furthermore, the ATP-induced sustained K+ current was only slightly inhibited (39%; n = 12) by extracellular acidosis from pH 7.4 to pH 6.8. This excludes the current to be carried by TASK-1 (1Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Thus, besides a muscarinic-like inward current, ATP activates a sustained K+ current whose characteristics point to the recently described acid-sensitive two-pore domain TREK-1 or to a TREK-1-like channel, which we will refer to as ITREK.Table ICharacteristics of the ATP-induced outward K+ current, ITREKControlHigh K+ (5.4 mm)Gliben (10 μm)Tetracain (100 μm)Gd3+ (100 μm)Ba2+ (100 m)4-AP (3 mm)TEA (20 mm)HCO−3 (90 mm)AA (40 μm)Control4.0 ± 0.36.3 ± 0.44.0 ± 0.63.4 ± 0.48.3 ± 1.54.8 ± 0.54.6 ± 1.41.6 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.46.9 ± 0.7+ATP5.9 ± 0.59.9 ± 0.96.1 ± 0.73.1 ± 0.37.3 ± 1.36.0 ± 0.65.2 ± 1.62.4 ± 0.15.1 ± 0.57.1 ± 0.8ATP-induced ITREK1.9 ± 0.2 1-ap < 0.05, significantly different relative to individual controls or to the ATP-induced current in the control conditions (122 nmCa2+i; 2.5 mm K+0;n = 36), respectively.3.6 ± 0.41-ap < 0.05, significantly different relative to individual controls or to the ATP-induced current in the control conditions (122 nmCa2+i; 2.5 mm K+0;n = 36), respectively.b2.1 ± 0.4 1-ap < 0.05, significantly different relative to individual controls or to the ATP-induced current in the control conditions (122 nmCa2+i; 2.5 mm K+0;n = 36), respectively.−0.3 ± 0.2b−1.0 ± 0.4b1.2 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05, significantly different relative to individual controls or to the ATP-induced current in the control conditions (122 nmCa2+i; 2.5 mm K+0;n = 36), respectively.0.7 ± 0.3b0.7 ± 0.11-ap < 0.05, significantly different relative to individual controls or to the ATP-induced current in the control conditions (122 nmCa2+i; 2.5 mm K+0;n = 36), respectively.b−0.2 ± 0.6b0.2 ± 0.2bData are expressed in pA/picofurado.

We used RT-PCR to check for the presence of TREK-1 mRNA in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes using gene-specific primers designed to anneal the cDNA of the mouse TREK-1 K+channel. Fig. 3 shows RT-PCR products generated from the total RNA of these cells, as well as a comparison with the RT-PCR products from mouse embryo hearts. The rat ventricular cardiomyocyte products showed 93% identity with TREK-1 (7Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ITREK activation by ATP would also require AA production after PLA2 stimulation, ventricular myocytes were pretreated with AACOCF3, a specific inhibitor of the cytosolic, Ca2+-sensitive cPLA2. This treatment prevented ATP activation of the sustained outward ITREK. Such an inhibition was not seen with HELSS, a specific inhibitor of another intracellular PLA2, iPLA2. Also, in experiments performed with a pipette solution containing a very low intracellular Ca2+ concentration with 5 mm EGTA and no Ca2+ added, ATP induced a significantly smaller increase in sustained outward K+ current (1.0 ± 02 pA/picofarad). Moreover, in parallel experiments, ATPγS induced translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane as well as a significant increase in the release of AA by isolated rat ventricular myocytes (Fig. 4). These observations indicate that AA increases ITREK as a result of cPLA2 activation. Incubation of cells with either SB202190 or U0126 (or PD98059) (specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK or p42/44 MAPK, respectively) fully prevented ATP-induced cPLA2 translocation, AA release, and ITREK activation (Fig. 4). Similarly, the effects of ATP on cPLA2, AA, and ITREK were prevented by the application of TK inhibitors such as herbimycin A (or tyrphostin and ST 638). Adding 2′d3′-AMP (or SQ22536) and RpcAMPs in the pipette solution, (inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA, respectively) antagonized the activation of ITREK by ATP, whereas incubating the cells with the two compounds prevented AA release and cPLA2 translocation (Fig. 4). Indeed, extracellular ATP is known to increase myocardial cAMP content by activating the specific adenylyl cyclase isoform, ACV, in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (15Puceat M. Bony C. Jaconi M. Vassort G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). cAMP content was increased by 32.5 ± 8.7% (n = 6) in freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes after purinergic stimulation, about 10-fold less than that by maximal isoproterenol stimulation (see also Ref. 15Puceat M. Bony C. Jaconi M. Vassort G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). No effect of AA (40 μm) was seen on the ATP-induced increase in cAMP, nor was this increase inhibited by preincubation with blockers of cPLA2 and MAPK (data not shown). Involvement of PKA in the ATP signal transduction pathway was also suggested when the PKA inhibitor peptide PKI6–22 prevented the increase in ITREK (data not shown). After pretreatment of the cells with cholera toxin, ATP still significantly increased ITREK. Finally, Ro318220, a specific inhibitor of the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK)-1, prevented the activation of ITREK by ATP as well as the translocation of cPLA2. Western blot analysis of p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK revealed that after 6 min, a time chosen to match the electrophysiological experiments, ATP induced activation of both MAPKs (Fig. 5). p38 MAPK activation by ATP was not blocked by herbimycin A (or tyrphostin and ST 638; data not shown) but was significantly inhibited by RpcAMPs (or 2′d3′AMP) (Fig. 5). On the contrary, the former, but not the latter compound significantly inhibited p42/44 MAPK activation by ATP. This indicates that PKA and TK activate p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK, respectively. Ro318220 had no effect on p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK activation (Fig. 5). The present results demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of a native TREK-1-like current. Furthermore, purinergic stimulation of cardiomyocytes induces this K+ current after the activation of cPLA2 by a dual-MAPK cascade. Like the expressed TREK-1 current activated by AA or acidosis, the ATP-induced current in cardiomyocytes is sustained, demonstrates fast activation and weak outward rectification, and shows specific sensitivity to various K+ channel antagonists. In support, RT-PCR products with high identity to the original mouse TREK-1 are generated in the rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. AA activates several TWIK-like currents inin vitro expression systems, including TREK-1, which is also specifically activated by intracellular acidosis (6Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our experiments cannot distinguish whether the AA-induced activation is direct or secondary to the lowering of the intracellular pH (33Wu M.L. Chan C.C. Su M.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E55-E62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a direct effect of AA is favored. A secondary effect is unlikely under our patch-clamp conditions, where the fast superfusion of the cell should wash away released compounds, and the pipette solution pH i"

Nkx3-1 was evaluated for mediating smooth muscle γ-actin (SMGA) gene activity, a specific marker of smooth muscle differentiation. Expression of mNkx3-1 in heterologous CV-1 fibroblasts was unable to elicit SMGA promoter activity but required the coexpression of serum response factor (SRF) to activate robust SMGA transcription. A novel complex element containing a juxtaposed Nkx-binding site (NKE) and an SRF-binding element (SRE) in the proximal promoter region was found to be necessary for the Nkx3-1/SRF coactivation of SMGA transcription.

Although first identified inDrosophila, these regulators have been found in all metazoan species examined to date from fungi to humans. They constitute a family of transcription factors that are recognized by a conserved segment of 60 amino acids, referred to as the homeodomain, that usually recognizes a TTAATT-degenerate DNA consensus binding sequence found within the control elements of target genes (1Gehring W.J.

Genome and expression analyses have now firmly established that there are a variety of homeodomain-containing proteins in vertebrates including a class of unique genes that are dispersed throughout the genome (1Gehring W.J.

Among the dispersed class of homeodomain proteins is the NK family, which was first defined by four genes (nk-1 through nk-4) identified inDrosophila. This family exhibits specific homology within the homeodomain and shares other regions of conserved sequence outside the homeodomain (4Doevendans P.A. Van Bilsen M. Int. J. Biochem.

In Drosophila, two nkgenes, tinman and bagpipe, have been found to be closely linked and are expressed and participate in the specialization of mesoderm-derived heart and visceral organs (8Azpiazu N.

Mutations intinman block dorsal vessel (Drosophila heart equivalent) and visceral musculature formation; however,bagpipe mutations lead to only midgut visceral musculature abnormalities.

These genes demonstrate overlapping expression patterns in somites of early embryos (∼8.5–9 embryonic days); however, only thenkx3-2 gene was expressed in the lateral and splanchnic mesoderm (10Kos L.

In later stage embryos and in adults nkx3genes are differentially expressed. Nkx3-1 is predominantly expressed in brain, kidney, blood vessels, and the male reproductive system (10Kos L. Chiang C.

Frasch M. Lufkin T. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Yoshiura K.I. Murry J.C. Genomics. 1997; 45: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, nkx3 genes retain expression within the mesoderm-derived structures surrounding vascular (Nkx3-1 in the blood vessels) and visceral (Nkx3-2 in the mid- and hindgut mesoderm) organs and may influence smooth muscle cell differentiation. At present, potential target genes regulated by the Nkx3 family have yet to be identified. Smooth muscle cells are integral cellular components of most organs through their role in controlling vascular tone, gastrointestinal motility, fluids movement, and airway resistance. Differentiated smooth muscle cells are characterized by their expression of a unique subset of contractile protein isoforms including smooth muscle α-actin (15Carroll S.L. Bergsma D.J. Schwartz R.J.

Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle cells retain their capacity to modulate reversibly their phenotype during postnatal development (33Mosse P.R. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Owens G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). This phenotypic modulation includes a reentry into the cell cycle and an altered expression of the characteristic proteins of the differentiated cell, effects that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cardiovascular (35Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9999) Google Scholar) and gastrointestinal (36MacDermott R.P. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Status and Future Approaches.

Thus, a knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control smooth muscle development and cell-specific gene expression will provide insights into cellular differentiation and the physiological responses of these cells to injury and disease states. We have examined the expression of the smooth muscle γ-actin (SMGA)1 gene as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate genes during smooth muscle differentiation. In aves (20Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E.

Hect N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); thus SMGA provides an excellent marker for the smooth muscle phenotype. In addition, tissue-restricted expression of SMGA arises during early embryonic development of the vasculature and gastrointestinal tract (17McHugh K.M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18McHugh K.M. Crawford K. Lessard J.L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Kovacs A.M.

Development. 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation of SMGA transcription may require factors unique to the differentiating smooth muscle cell. Transcriptional regulation of the SMGA gene appears to require the interplay of positive- and negative-acting cis elements within the promoter. Two regions displaying positive acting transcriptional activity were mapped on the SMGA promoter, referred to as the specifier and modulator domains (21Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 115-129PubMed Google Scholar). A key ciselement for smooth muscle-specific SMGA transcription found in both of these domains is the CArG/SRE (CC(A/T)6GG) motif. The positive acting transcriptional activity of the specifier and modulator domains is derived from the binding of SRF to the SRE sites within these domains, and we have demonstrated that SRF-containing complexes play a prominent role in the developmental activation of the SMGA gene (40Browning C.L.

Here we demonstrate the cooperative interaction of Nkx3-1 with SRF-activating SMGA transcription. The conservation of structure and activity of actin gene transcriptional machinery permits examining these components utilizing a heterologous cotransfection assay. Transcriptional synergy is supported by a complex of regulatory elements that is composed of immediately adjacent NKE-SREcis elements within the SMGA proximal promoter. Our studies demonstrate that the SMGA gene promoter serves as a target for the NK3 family of transcription factors, specifically the Nkx3-1 factor, and supports the hypothesis that appropriate transcriptional regulation of smooth muscle specific genes requires the combinatorial interactions of SRF with coaccessory trans-acting factors expressed within the smooth muscle cell. Approximately 2300 bp of the avian smooth muscle γ-actin promoter and 5′ deletions have been cloned into pGL-3 basic plasmid driving the expression of the reporter gene luciferase (21Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 115-129PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zimmer W.E. Browning C.L. Kovacs A.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 399Google Scholar, 40Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A.

The −1224, −176, and −108 5′ deletions of the smooth muscle γ-actin promoter were used in transfection experiments in the current study. Mutations were made to γ-actin promoter elements SRE1, SRE2, and NKE1 using multiple primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and verified by DNA sequencing. The SMGA SRE1 was disrupted by changing the wild type element from 5′-CCTATTTAGG-3′ to 5′-CCTATCCCGG-3′ and the SRE2 sequence (5′-CCTATATGG-3′) mutated to 5′-CCTTATGTTT-3′. The SMGA NKE1 was disrupted by changing the wild type element from 5′-CACTTAGCCT-3′ to 5′-CACCCCCCCT-3′). The NKE1/SRE1 double mutant contained the mutations to both sites. PCR was used to isolate the 862-bp Nkx3-1 cDNA from 6-day embryoid bodies with forward primer 5′-GCTCTAGAATGCTTAGGGTAGCGGAGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTGGATCCAGAGACCCCCAGGGAAGACAG. The isolated cDNA was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, TA Cloning Kit) and verified by sequencing. The Nkx3-1 fragment was excised from pCRII withXbaI and BamHI and cloned into identical sites of the pCGN vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter and HA epitope tag. Mutations of the Nkx3-1 sequence were made using PCR-based techniques (Stratagene, Excite PCR Mutagenesis Kit). The pCGN-Nkx3-1 cDNA clone was the template for these experiments, and all mutants were cloned into the same vector maintaining an HA epitope tag for each of the mutant proteins. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western analyses of lysates derived from transfected cells. The −330-bp cardiac α-actin promoter cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene has been previously described. The construction of the consensus NKE reporter construct A20 has also been described previously (41Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 3× (NKE)-tata-luciferase construct was constructed by inserting a linker containing three copies of an intermediate strength NKE in front of the α-cardiac actin minimal TATA box driving the expression of luciferase. Human SRF expression vectors (pCGN-SRF, pCGN-SRFΔC, and pCGN-SRFpm1) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter have been previously described (41Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

The Nkx3-1 homeodomain cDNA was isolated by PCR on the full-length cDNA using forward primer 5′-TCACCAAGCAGCCACAGAAG-3′ (359–379 bp) and reverse primer 5′-CTGCTTTCGCTTGGTCTTATAGC-3′ (529–552 bp). The Nkx3-1 homeodomain protein consisted of 193 bp, including 13 bp 5′ to the homeodomain. To express Nkx3-1 in bacteria, the cDNAs for the full-length and homeodomain-only region of Nkx3-1 were isolated by PCR, verified by DNA sequencing, and cloned into pRSET B (Invitrogen) vector. The full-length and homeodomain-only Nkx3-1 cDNA PCR products were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, TA Cloning Kit). The cDNA for the Nkx3-1 homeodomain region was excised from pCRII withHindIII and XhoI, sites internal to the PCR primers, and ligated into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pRSET B, downstream of a 6× histidine tag. These constructs were used to transform BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). Freshly transformed cells were grown in 500 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to A600 = 0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm was then added, and growth continued for another 2 h. Cells were harvested and suspended in 20 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), sonicated, and cellular debris removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein was purified by binding to a metal affinity column (CLONTECH), washed extensively, and then eluted with fractions of column buffer containing 10–200 mm imidazole. The concentration of the protein was determined by Bradford protein assay, and purity was determined by Coomassie staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Full-length human SRF was expressed and purified as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein as described previously (41Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

The concentration of the protein was determined by Bradford protein assay and purity determined by Coomassie staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Monkey CV-1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated at an approximate density of 5 × 105 cells per 6-cm plate. Cells were transfected 24 h post-plating using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (49Reecy J.M. Li X. Yamada M. DeMayo F.J. Newman C.S. Harvey R.P. Schwartz R.J. Development. 1999; 126: 839-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each transfection reaction contained 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (γ-actin, A20, or α-CA) and various amounts of transactivator plasmids (pCGN-Nkx3.1 and/or pCGN-SRF). All transfections were balanced to 2 μg of DNA with empty vector in order to keep the level of DNA and CMV promoter constant in all transfection reactions. Cells were transfected 16–18 h after which the transfection media were removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum and 10 μg/ml insulin for an additional 48 h. Cells were then harvested by washing with PBS and then scraped in 400 μl of 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and 30 μl of supernatant was analyzed for luciferase activity by mixing with 100 μl of luciferase substrate (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 4 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mmd-luciferin, 0.25 mm coenzyme A). Emitted luminescence was measured for 10 s. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize luciferase activity. Interactions between Nkx3-1 and SRF were examined byin vivo immunoprecipitation using previously described methodology (42Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of either pCGN-Nkx3.1 or pCGN-SRF plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty eight hours post-transfection the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 120 mm NaCl; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 2 μg ml leupeptin; 2 μg/ml pepstatin; and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), rocked at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and protein concentration determined (Bio-Rad), and 500 μg of protein extracts containing SRF and Nkx3-1 were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a total of 500 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 5 mm MgCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.05% Nonidet P-40; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Non-transfected 3T3 cell extracts served as controls. Thirty microliters of protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science) equilibrated in NETN buffer were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of NETN buffer, and suspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled 5 min, briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the smooth muscle γ-actin NKE1/SRE1 elements were constructed consisting of −100 to −74 bp of the promoter (5′-CCATCACTTAGCCTATTTAGGGTCTT-3′). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled using the polynucleotide kinase reaction, and band shift assays were performed as described previously (40Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A.

Briefly, 20 μl containing 1 μg of either poly(dI-dC) or poly(dG-dC) binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 1 mm sodium phosphate; 5% glycerol; 50 mm sodium chloride) and nanogram quantities of purified bacterially expressed proteins were incubated 10 min at room temperature, and then the probe was added (20,000 cpm/reaction) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Binding complexes were then run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was prerun for 20 min, followed by sample electrophoreses for 2 h at 180 V. Binding complexes were visualized by autoradiography. DNase I footprinting was performed on a fragment of the SMGA gene from −108 to +15 using purified SRF and Nkx3-1 proteins. This fragment was cloned into pGL-3 vector as described previously (21Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 115-129PubMed Google Scholar, 40Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V.

The DNA was digested with enzymes present in the vector multiple cloning site that were unique within the gene promoter/luciferase vector (NheI for coding strand and HindIII for non-coding strand), and the DNA construct was then labeled with 32P using Klenow enzyme. Single end-labeled DNA was then digested with the second enzyme and the fragment purified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels as described previously. Each mapping assay contained ∼25 fmol of fragment (25,000 cpm) in 50 μl of gel shift assay buffer described above. Proteins were added to the assay tubes on ice, and the reaction was continued on ice for 1 h, after which DNase I was added and the reaction changed to room temperature for 1 min.

Recent evidence, using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-null mouse, suggests that elevated hepatic RA down-regulates ALDH1 in a unique feedback pathway to control RA biosynthesis. To determine the mechanism of suppression of theALDH1 gene by RA, transactivation studies were carried out in Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cells. RA decreased expression of an ALDH1-CAT construct containing −2536 base pairs of DNA upstream of the transcription start site. Retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) transactivates the ALDH1 gene promoter through a complex with an RA response-like element (RARE) located at −91/−75 bp, which bound to the RARα/retinoid X receptor β heterodimer. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) also transactivates theALDH1 gene promoter through a CCAAT box located 3′ and directly adjacent to the RARE, and the ALDH1 gene is down-regulated in C/EBPβ-null mouse liver. Exposure of Hepa-1 cells to RA results in a decrease in C/EBPβ mRNA levels; however, there was no difference in mRNA and protein levels between wild-type and AHR-null mouse liver. These data support a model in which the RARα and C/EBPβ activate the ALDH1 gene promoter through the RARE and C/EBP response elements, and in Hepa-1 cells, high levels of RA inhibit this activation by decreasing cellular levels of C/EBPβ.

B., Roberts, A. B., and Goodman, D. S. (eds) (1994) The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine, 2nd Ed., Raven Press, Ltd., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The biological activity of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)1 is mediated by the nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (2Chambon P. FASEB. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). The major biosynthetic pathway of retinoic acid from retinol is the irreversible oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid catalyzed by a cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1). 2This gene is formally named ALDH1A1 according tohttp://www.uchsc.edu/sp/sp/alcdbase/aldhcov.html.Aldehyde dehydrogenases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to their carboxylic acid forms. They participate in the detoxification of acetaldehyde (3Harrington M.C. Henehan G.T. Tipton K.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the metabolism of biogenic amines (4Mackarell A.D. MacWright R.S. Pietruszko R.

Recently, a critical role for this enzyme in mammalian development was established by the finding that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2, also known as mouse ALDH1) homozygous null embryos fail to develop due to multiple abnormalities (7Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Studies using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-null mouse model revealed a novel pathway of feedback control of RA synthesis (8Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838PubMed Google Scholar). Due to lower cellular levels of an RA catabolism, these mice have elevated hepatic levels of RA and retinyl palmitate, the main storage depot of RA. Levels of the Raldh2 mRNA are also markedly lower in these animals as compared with wild-type mice, indicating that RA suppresses expression of the Raldh2 gene. In humans, the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase is designated ALDH1 (9Yanagawa Y. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Yoshida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17521-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, the molecular mechanisms by which RA down-regulates the ALDH1 gene expression were investigated. Transactivation studies revealed that RARα and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) control ALDH1reporter gene expression, and positive activation by these factors is inhibited by RA. In Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cells, the RA inhibitory effect is mediated by decreased cellular levels of C/EBPβ. However, this mechanism does not occur in the intact mouse liver. Mouse hepatoma-derived Hepa-1 cells were obtained from Daniel W. Nebert and characterized in an earlier report (10Hankinson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid was obtained from Sigma. The ALDH1 gene promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs designated pCAT-2536, pCAT-673, pCAT-91, and pCAT-50 were provided by Akira Yoshida (City of Hope, Duarte, CA) and described previously (9Yanagawa Y. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Yoshida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17521-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The deleted and mutated pCAT-91ΔC and pCAT-91mut1 vectors containing the deletion of CCAAT box and the mutation CCAAT → CCTCT, respectively, were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The Raldh2 cDNA was obtained from Gregg Duester (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) (11Hsu L.C. Chang W.C. Hoffman I. Duester G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SV40 promoter region prepared from pCAT-promoter vector (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) was ligated with pUMSVOCAT, and the resultant pCAT-SV40 vector was used as an internal reference for CAT assay. The rat pMEX-C/EBPα and pMEX-C/EBPβ expression vectors were described in an earlier report (12Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez J.F. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided by Peter F. Johnson (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). Ronald M. Evans (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Diego, CA) supplied the human RARα expression vector (13Giguere V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). RARα and RXRβ antibodies were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), and the C/EBPβ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz CA). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-null (14Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.T. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1997; 268: 722-726Crossref Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ-null (15Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) mice were described previously. Hepa-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transient transfection assays were carried out using the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique (16Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1999) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 5th Ed., John Wiley and Son, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with 6 μg of the test plasmid and 2 μg of pRSV-luciferase control plasmid (16Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1999) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 5th Ed., John Wiley and Son, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). After 48 h, the treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping and centrifugation, resuspended in 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer, and lysed by freezing/thawing four times. Aliquots from the supernatant of the lysate were used for luciferase assays (17De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). The remainder of the supernatant was heated to 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate deacetylase and stored at −70 °C prior to determine the CAT activity. CAT assays were performed by the phase-extraction method (18Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate, and CAT activity was normalized to luciferase activity. The CAT activity was determined by scanning the amount of 14C radioactivity in the thin layer chromatography plates using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. Luciferase activity was measured using a Analytical Luminescence Laboratory Monolight luminometer. Double-stranded oligonucleotides to the RARα-binding site (5′-CGAGTTCAGCGAGAGTTCAGC-3′) (19Leroy P. Naksshatri H. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10138-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the 5′ upstream humanALDH1 gene −91 to −59 region (5′-GCTCTGAGTTTGTTCATCCAATCGTATCCGAGT-3′), −91 to −75 region (5′-GCTCTGAGTTTGTTCAT-3′), and an unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CTGCAGTGACCACTGCCCCATCATTGCTGGCTC-3′) were end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hepa-1 cell nuclear extracts (10 μg), prepared as described (20Andrews N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)), with 2 μl of the double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm). The mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. In competition assays, a large excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor was incubated together with the nuclear extract prior to adding the32P-labeled probe. The sequences of the CCAAT motif oligonucleotides were as follows: CCAAT protein 1 (CP1) (5′-AGACTTTGTAAAAAGACTAAACAATTTCA ACTCACGAAAC-3′), CCAAT protein 2 (CP2) (5′-GTTTTACTCGGTAGAGCAAGCACAAACCAG-3′), CCAAT transcription factor (CTF) (5′-TACCTTATTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAAT-3), and C/EBP (5′-CTAGGGCTTGCGCAATCTATATTCG-3′) (21Stewart M.J. Diplle K.M. Stewart T.M. Crabb D.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 173: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For gel mobility supershift assays, RARα and RXRβ antibodies were incubated with the probe-nuclear extract mixtures for additional 60 min prior to gel electrophoresis. Hepa-1 cells were harvested, lysed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjected to centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 50 μg of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and probed as recommended by the manufacturer. Rabbit polyclonal RARα antibody was used at 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% non-fat dry milk, and proteins interacting with antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence blot detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from Hepa-1 cell cultures or mouse liver was isolated by homogenizing cells in a guanidine/phenol solution (Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX). Total RNA (20 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes in 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). The RNA was fixed to the membranes by baking at 80 °C for 2 h, prehybridized in SSC/formamide solution, and hybridized at 42 °C with the 32P-labeled probes. cDNAs were labeled by random priming with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment using [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled probes were added to the membranes at 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml. Filters were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film overnight at −80 °C with aid of an Phosphor screen. AHR-null mouse livers present high levels of RA together with decreased ALDH1 mRNA levels when compared with wild-type mouse livers, suggesting an involvement of RA in ALDH1 gene regulation. To delineate the mechanism of retinoid action on humanALDH1 gene expression, a reporter plasmid containing 2536 bp of the human ALDH1 gene promoter sequence linked to a CAT gene (pCAT-2536) was used. The pCAT-2536 construct was transfected into Hepa-1 cells and treated with RA. RA at 0.01 μm inhibited about 50% of the activity and 70% at 1 μm (Fig. 1). These data indicate that RA is able to decrease activity of the ALDH1 gene promoter. To assess whether the RA effects on ALDH1 gene regulation were mediated by the RAR, Hepa-1 cells were co-transfected with an RARα expression vector and the pCAT-2536 reporter construct. In the absence of exogenous RA, increased RARα levels resulted in an increase in the CAT activity to a maximum of 7-fold over the control with no exogenous RARα (Fig. 2). The amounts of transfected RARα expression vector correlated with an increase in RAR protein (Fig. 2). RARα was also detected in non-RARα-transfected cells. Addition of RA inhibited RARα-mediated transcription by approximately 50%. These data establish that RARα is responsible, in part, for controlling expression of theALDH1 gene and that RA inhibits RARα-mediated transactivation. To establish the location in the ALDH1 gene promoter of the RARα response element, deletion constructs were examined by co-transfection with the RARα expression vector. All reporter constructs were activated by RARα except for the pCAT-50 (Fig. 3). These data indicated that the putative ALDH1 RARE is located between −50 and −91 from the transcription start site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the human (−39 to −107 bp) ALDH1 gene 5′-flanking region revealed that a sequence similar to the consensus RARE motif, AGTTCA, is located at −75/−81 bp (Fig. 4). This segment is a possible site through which RARα might exert ALDH1transcriptional control. A CCAAT box and octamer-binding site were also found in this region.Figure 4Nucleotide sequence of human ALDH1 gene 5′-flanking region. CCAAT box and Oct regulatory elements are enclosed by boxes, and the RARE-like element isunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether RARα binds to the RARE-like motif, EMSA was performed (Fig. 5). Addition of Hepa-1 nuclear extracts resulted in the formation of three DNA-protein complexes. This binding was saturated since excess of unlabeled −91/−59 blocks its formation (lane 4–7), whereas excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide did not compete with the labeled oligonucleotide probe (lane 3). Competition experiments using a consensus RARE oligonucleotide decreased binding only to complexes 2 and 3 but not complex 1 (lane 8–11), suggesting that these complexes are the results of binding to RAR. To characterize better the nature of this interaction, EMSA supershifts were used to detect endogenous RARα in nuclear extracts of Hepa-1 cells (Fig. 6). RARα antiserum supershifted a consensus RARE complex (lanes 3 and 4) as well as complex 2 bound to the human −91/−59 region (lanes 7 and8). No supershift was observed when non-related antiserum was used (lanes 2 and 6). These data indicate that complex 2 represents RARα bound to the −91/−59 region.Figure 6Binding of RAR to the human −91/−59 ALDH1 gene region. Nuclear extracts from Hepa-1 cells were incubated with radiolabeled consensus RARE (lanes 1–4) or radiolabeled −91/−59 (lanes 5–8) and then incubated with RARα antibody (lanes 3, 4, 7, and8) for 60 min, and EMSA supershift analysis was performed.Lanes 1 and 5 are consensus RARE and −91/−59 radiolabeled probes, respectively, plus nuclear extract. Lanes 2 and 6 are incubations with a unrelated antibody (Ab) (Cyclin B, 8 μg). The arrowsidentify the shifted bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further delineate the extent of the RARα binding region in the human ALDH1 gene promoter, the labeled probe was trimmed to −91/−75. This eliminated the CCAAT box and the octamer-binding site region and resulted in a single band corresponding to complex 2 (Fig. 7, lane 2) which was supershifted when nuclear extracts were incubated with RARα or RXRβ antibodies (lanes 3 and 4). This confirmed that complex 2 represents RARα/RXRβ heterodimers. To compare the affinity of RARα for the human −91/−59 5′-flanking region with a consensus RARE, competitive inhibitions were performed (Fig. 5), and the relative intensity of complex 2 was determined (Fig. 8). RARE competed equivalently with the human −91/−59 oligonucleotide for binding to RARα/RXRβ, indicating that the human ALDH1 −91/−59 region is functionally similar to the consensus RARE. The CCAAT box found in the human ALDH1 gene promoter region could represent a binding site for a number of nuclear factors including CP1, CP2, CTF, and C/EBP. Therefore, the binding of these nuclear factors was tested in a competitive EMSA. Binding of the nuclear factor to the −91/−59 human region was partially decreased by unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequences for CP1, CP2, CTF, and C/EBP (Fig. 9). All unlabeled oligonucleotides were able to decrease specifically complex 3, but the C/EBP competitor DNA was the most effective. This suggests that C/EBP members can bind to the human −91/−59 region and may contribute to the control of ALDH1 gene transcription. To confirm that one of the C/EBP family members (β) binds to the human −91/−59 region, nuclear extracts were incubated with C/EBPβ antibody and then analyzed by EMSA. Incubation of the nuclear extracts with the antibody resulted in a shift in the mobility of the bound oligonucleotide (Fig. 10 A, lanes 2 and 4), confirming that C/EBPβ binds to the CCAAT box located within −91/−59 of the human ALDH1 gene promoter region. In order to determine whether C/EBPβ functionally affects theALDH1 gene promoter transactivation, Hepa-1 cells were co-transfected with a C/EBPβ expression vector pMEX-C/EBPβ and the pCAT-91 reporter construct. Transfection of the C/EBPβ expression vector resulted in an increase of the CAT activity that reflected the increased ratio of the vector to the reporter construct DNA (Fig. 10 B). However, when constructs containing deleted and mutated CCAAT boxes (pCAT-91ΔC and pCAT-91mut1, respectively) were co-transfected with the pMEX-C/EBPβ expression vector, no changes in CAT activity were observed. Moreover, deletion and mutation of the CCAAT box resulted in a 5-fold decrease of CAT activity compared with that expressed by pCAT-91 (Fig. 10 C), indicating that the binding of C/EBPβ is essential for basal promoter activity. A pMEX-C/EBPα expression vector did not activate expression of pCAT-91 (data not shown). These data establish that C/EBPβ together with the RARα/RXR heterodimer is responsible in part for the expression of theALDH1 gene. To examine whether RA was able to alter binding of RARα/RXRβ heterodimer and/or C/EBPβ to −91/−59 human ALDH1 gene promoter binding sites, Hepa-1 cells were treated with 1.0 μm RA, and the nuclear extracts were used for gel mobility shift analysis. Binding of the human −91/−59 probe to complex 3 was significantly decreased using extracts from RA-treated cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 11 A). These data show that RA causes a decrease in C/EBPβ binding. However, addition of RA directly to the nuclear extracts of untreated cells did not alter formation of the complex thus ruling out a direct interaction of RA with C/EBPβ (data not shown). The effect of RA on C/EBPβ binding to ALDH1 gene CCAAT region could be due to a decrease in C/EBPβ transcription. To determine whether RA alters C/EBPβ expression, Hepa-1 cells were treated with RA, and mRNAs encoding ALDH1, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ were analyzed by Northern blotting. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and ALDH1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced after RA treatment (Fig. 11 B, lanes 2 and 3). To determine whether levels of expression of C/EBPβ are altered in the AHR-null, mRNA was measured (Fig. 12). C/EBPβ mRNA levels were not different between wild-type and AHR-null mice. Levels of C/EBPβ protein were also not different between the two genotypes (data not shown). However, ALDH1 expression was markedly lower in livers of mice lacking C/EBPβ (Fig. 12). These data suggest that theALDH1 gene is controlled by C/EBPβ in the mouse, but its regulation by RA in liver may be through a C/EBPβ-independent mechanism. A feedback pathway to control levels of RA synthesis was uncovered using the AHR-null mouse (8Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838PubMed Google Scholar). This mouse model has a defect in RA catabolism leading to elevated RA levels and decreased ALDH1 mRNA levels, suggesting that RA play an important role in ALDH1gene regulation. The goal of these studies was to determine the mechanism by which RA controls ALDH1 gene expression. Transactivation studies using the human ALDH1 gene promoter linked to a reporter vector revealed that RARα stimulated promoter activity in the absence of exogenous RA, indicating that RARα mediates ALDH1 gene expression. Although no exogenous ligand was added, the endogenous RA probably activates RARα. Similar spontaneous activation was observed in other studies when RXR, RARα, and RARβ expression vectors were used (22Crowe D.L. Osaseri U.E. Shuler C.F. Mol. Carcinogen. 1998; 22: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.K. Hermann T. Husmann M. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol.

By using deletion constructs of the ALDH1 gene 5′-flanking region, a putative RARE within the −91/−59 region of the human ALDH1promoter was identified. This segment of DNA is highly conserved between the human, mouse, and rat ALDH1 gene promoters (9Yanagawa Y. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Yoshida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17521-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and contains an octamer factor-binding site and CCAAT box. The RARE-like motif was located upstream and adjacent to the CCAAT box. EMSA confirmed that RARα/RXRβ heterodimers bind to the human −91/−59 ALDH1 gene 5′-flanking region with similar affinity to the consensus RARE DR-5 type element. The 15 bp corresponding to the human −91/−75 region was identified as the minimal response element. RAREs can be grouped into 3 categories, depending on the orientation of their AGTTCA half-site as follows: 1) direct repeats; 2) palindromes; and 3) complex elements with little or no obvious consensus structure. The RARE reported here seems to belong to the last group. Complex RAREs are typically only weakly responsive, and its activation requires RAR overexpression and generally shows lower affinity for the receptorin vitro (25Lucas P.C. O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M. Imai E. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Richard S. Zingg H.H. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of the human −91/−59 ALDH1 gene promoter region to the RARα/RXRβ appears to be similar to RARE/DR-5 element, which is one of the most potent sequences found in promoters of RARβ-responsive genes (28de The H. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1990; 32: 30-32PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, exogenous RA inhibits ALDH1 promoter expression and blocks RARα stimulatory effects, suggesting that RARα may activate the gene at low cellular levels of RA, whereas RA inhibitory effects occur at higher concentrations. In this regard, RA has been shown to inhibit the expression of certain genes by antagonizing the enhancer interaction of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (29Fanjul A.M. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the case of the ALDH1 gene, however, no apparent activator protein 1 site was found in the 5′ promoter region. It was also reported that retinoids inhibit gene expression by antagonizing the enhancer action of C/EBPβ (30DiSepio D. Malhorta M. Chandraratna R.A. Nagpal S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25555-25559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, C/EBPβ was found to be a positive regulator of theALDH1 gene promoter, and its response element (CCAAT box) is located downstream of the RARE. The deletion and mutation analysis demonstrated that the CCAAT box is critical for the ALDH1promoter activity. The role of C/EBPβ in regulation of theALDH gene in the context of the animal was suggested by the fact that levels of ALDH1 mRNA were markedly lower in C/EBPβ-null mice as compared with wild-type animals. The possibility that the inhibitory effects of RA on ALDH1gene transcription occur through interference with C/EBPβ (31Nicholson R.C. Mader S. Nagpal S. Leid M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was investigated using EMSA with Hepa-1 cell nuclear extracts treated with RA. The results demonstrated that C/EBPβ binding to the CCAAT box element decreased, whereas no change of RARα binding to the RARE was observed. Therefore, it seems that high levels of RA inhibitALDH1 gene expression by antagonizing C/EBPβ action. However, the decrease of C/EBPβ binding appears not to be as a result of direct interference of binding to the CCAAT box since addition of RA directly to the nuclear extracts of untreated cells did not alter the complex formation (data not shown). Rather, RA appears to down-regulate C/EBPβ expression thus offering a potential mechanism for the RA inhibitory effects. Indeed, it was reported that RA regulates C/EBPα and C/EBPβ during liver development (33Menendez-Hurtado A. Vega-Nunez E. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 234: 605-610Google Scholar), blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting C/EBPβ-mediated transcription, and blocks the expression of the C/EBPα gene (34Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of C/EBPβ gene expression by RA could be through interleukin 6, a positive C/EBPβ transactivation factor, since its activity is blocked by RA (35Ogata A. Nishimoto N. Shima Y. Yoshizaki K. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1994; 84: 3040-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a RARE has not been reported to be associated with the C/EBPβ promoter region, the data reported herein opens the possibility of a direct regulation of C/EBPβ transcription by RA. Alternatively, down-regulation of C/EBPα may affect the C/EBPβ activity since it has been shown that C/EBPβ is under the control of C/EBPα at the post-translational level (36Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current study was initiated because of the earlier finding that ALDH1 was expressed at low levels in the livers of AHR mice having an abnormally high RA concentration (8Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested the intriguing possibility that RA feedback inhibits its synthesis by decreasing expression of ALDH1. In the Hepa-1 cells used in this study, exogenous RA decreases trans-activation of theALDH1 promoter and also decreases C/EBPβ mRNA levels. Although these data would suggest that RA directly or indirectly affects C/EBPβ expression in cultured cells, another mechanism for reduction of ALDH1 in liver may be more important since C/EBPβ mRNA and protein are not significantly decreased in the livers of AHR-null mice. In conclusion, the present study shows a negative feedback control ofALDH1 gene expression by RA. In cultured hepatoma cells, the inhibitory affect of RA appears to be through direct or indirect down-regulation of C/EBPβ, a factor that acts as a positive regulation ALDH1 gene transcription. This positive regulation by C/EBPβ was also indicated by analysis of the C/EBPβ-null mice. In hepatoma cells, RARα/RXRβ acts positively on the ALDH1 gene at basal cellular levels of RA. Thus it remains a possibility that in the liver of AHR-null mice, RARα inhibits expression of the ALDH1 gene in the presence of high RA concentration by a mechanism distinct from involvement of C/EBPβ or through a post-translational modification of C/EBPβ. In any case, the ALDH1 regulatory region of the human, mouse, and ratALDH1 gene promoters all have the RARE and CCAAT box regions suggesting conservation in the control of this gene by RARα and C/EBPβ and strongly indicate an important feedback control of RA synthesis mediated by RARα.

Their multifunctional effects are elicited through oligomeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. TGF-β binding to primarily the type II receptor (TβRII) then stabilizes the heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (TβRI) and results in transphosphorylation and activation of TβRI by the TβRII. The activated TβRI then propagates the signal through transient interaction with and phosphorylation of receptor-restricted Smads. Whereas Smad2 and Smad3 mediate TGF-β and activin signals, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 act downstream of bone morphogenetic proteins. Receptor-mediated phosphorylation occurs on two serine residues in a SSXS motif in the C-terminal domain of receptor-restricted Smads. Once phosphorylated, receptor-restricted Smads dimerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus and modulate transcription of TGF-β target genes (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

In addition, Smad7 expression has been shown to be induced by other factors such as shear stress, epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, interferon-γ, and TNF-α, suggesting that its transcription may serve as a regulatory mechanism integrating and modulating the physiological response of different signaling pathways (11Afrakhte M.

Failure to eliminate immature B cells results in lymphoproliferation and the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer (16Lebman D.A. Edmiston J.S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mouse immature B cell line, WEHI 231, has been used as an in vitro model system to study B cell tolerance and apoptosis (17Scott D.W. Livnat D. Pennell C.A. Keng P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Scott D.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 393-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gottschalk A.R. Quintáns J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 8-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis in these cells can be induced after membrane interaction with antibodies against cell surface IgM chains (anti-IgM) as well as by TGF-β (20−22). A signal for abrogating or rescuing WEHI 231 cells from anti-IgM-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis can be generated by concomitant signaling through CD40 (22Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). CD40 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed by B cells (23Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It is structurally related to the TNF receptor family and plays a critical role in promoting cell survival, immunoglobulin class switching, and memory cell formation (24Kehry M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2345-2348PubMed Google Scholar).CD40 has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but interacts with adapter molecules of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, which couple to multiple signaling pathways, including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, Janus tyrosine kinase/Stat3, S6 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase, and NFκB (25Kashiwada M. Kaneko M. Yagita H. Takemori T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1451-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

It remains unclear how all these signaling pathways contribute to the B cell response to CD40. Recent studies, however, have focused on the roles of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase and NFκB in CD40-mediated survival in B-lymphocytes. Using a RAG2-deficient complementation model, it has been shown that B-lymphocytes isolated from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-deficient mice have a diminished proliferative response to CD-40 ligand (30Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Also, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, induces growth arrest and apoptosis in a B cell lymphoma cell line, and their CD40-mediated rescue was shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent (31Curnock A.P. Knox K.A. Cell. Immunol. 1998; 187: 87-97Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NFκB plays a vital role in B-lymphocyte survival. Agents that decrease NFκB/Rel activity promote apoptosis, whereas inducers of cell survival such as interleukin-6, platelet-derived growth factor, and CD40L up-regulate NFκB/Rel activity (32Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that NFκB can serve as a target for Akt kinase, resulting in its activation and consequent anti-apoptotic activity (33Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 34Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that, although CD40 may elicit the activation of numerous signaling pathways, the proliferative and anti-apoptotic response of B cells to CD40 ligand may be mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/NFκB pathway.In this study we demonstrate that CD40 activation protects WEHI 231 cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis and is associated with induction of Smad7 expression. The induction of Smad7 by CD40 is NFκB-dependent. We also demonstrate that Smad7 overexpression abolishes the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effect of TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of Smad7 are specific for TGF-β and do not affect IgM-induced growth arrest or apoptosis.DISCUSSIONTGF-β is an important regulator of cell growth and is essential for maintenance of normal immunological homeostasis and lymphocyte proliferation (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 2Piek E. Heldin C.-H. Dijke P.T. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 16Lebman D.A. Edmiston J.S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes as well as a few other cell types respond to TGF-β by undergoing apoptosis; however, the mechanisms regulating this process are not well understood and appear to be cell-specific. The ability of TGF-β to induce apoptosis in immature B cells may be a major mechanism controlling lymphocyte growth and subsequently regulating the immune response (20Benhamou L.E. Cazenave P. Sarthou P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Warner G.L. Ludlow J.W. Nelson D.A. Gaur A. Scott D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that apoptosis induced by TGF-β in pre-B-lymphocytes can be rescued by stimulation with an anti-CD40 antibody. The anti-apoptotic effect of anti-CD40 is associated with an NFκB-dependent induction of Smad7, a TGF-β-signaling pathway inhibitor. Overexpression of exogenous Smad7 specifically abrogates TGF-β-induced apoptosis without affecting anti-IgM-induced cell death.The growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of TGF-β and anti-IgM in B-lymphocytes have previously been characterized and share many of the same signaling events. Thus, TGF-β and anti-IgM both block cells in late G1 with an accompanying decrease in the level of c-myc, and both modulate the activity of Rb, p53, p21Waf1/Cip1, p27, cyclin A, caspase protease family members, and NFκB and thereby induce cells to growth arrest and apoptosis (40Ruiz-Vela A. González De Buitrago G. Martı́nez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46Wu M. Arsura M. Bellas R.E. FitzGerald M.J. Lee H. Schauer S.L. Sherr D.H.

Biol. 1986; 6: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with these similarities in signaling, it was proposed that the effects of anti-IgM were mediated through autocrine production of TGF-β, especially since anti-IgM induces the production of active TGF-β in WEHI 231 cells. On the other hand, neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β have no effect on anti-IgM-induced pRb phosphorylation and growth arrest (21Warner G.L. Ludlow J.W. Nelson D.A. Gaur A. Scott D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings now reveal another commonality between growth arrest and apoptosis induced by anti-IgM or TGF-β. Indeed, stimulation of the cells with anti-CD40 inhibits both signaling pathways induced by either TGF-β or anti-IgM and, thus, rescues cells from apoptosis induced by either stimulus. Mechanistically, however, the induction of Smad7 by anti-CD40 is specific in blocking TGF-β-induced growth arrest and apoptosis and has no effect on the anti-IgM-induced effects. In addition, anti-IgM does not induce phosphorylation of Smad2. 2S. Patil, G. M. Wildey, and P. H. Howe, unpublished data. We therefore conclude that CD40 induces at least two different inhibitory pathways. One of them results in induction of Smad7 expression and specifically blocks the TGF-β-induced response, whereas another inhibitory pathway or protein, distinct from Smad7, inhibits anti-IgM-induced cell death. Thus, our results support the idea that, at the membrane level, TGF-β and anti-IgM induce growth arrest and apoptosis through two independent pathways. This does not exclude the possibility that the downstream pathways of TGF-β and IgM-signaling merge into a common pathway mediating apoptosis, In this regard, CD40 activates anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-xL, which inhibit both anti-IgM-and TGF-β-induced apoptosis (39Merino R.

The existence of a common pathway mediating both anti-IgM- and TGF-β-induced apoptosis awaits further studies.Smad7 is an inhibitor of signaling by the TGF-β-activated Smads (8Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi H.

Its expression is induced by TGF-β itself, and Smad7 is therefore postulated to mediate an auto-inhibitory feedback loop to down-regulate TGF-β signaling. Recent results (13-15) have shown that other cytokines and growth factors can induce Smad7 expression. For example, interferon-γ induces Smad7 expression through a Janus tyrosine kinase 1/Stat1-dependent mechanism, and this induction of Smad7 has been proposed to mediate the antagonistic effects of interferon-γ on TGF-β signaling (13Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Also lipopolysaccharide and TNF-α can induce Smad7 expression, thereby inhibiting TGF-β-signaling, and this induction occurs through an NFκB/RelA-dependent mechanism (14Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these findings in that they demonstrate another context in which antagonistic pathways cross-talk with TGF-β signaling through Smad7. In our study, the CD40-induced survival pathway antagonizes the TGF-β-induced apoptotic pathway through an NFκB-dependent induction of Smad7. Our study is the first demonstration that the CD40-induced survival pathway antagonizes the growth inhibitory and apoptotic responses to TGF-β through Smad7.The critical role of NFκB in the induction of Smad7 is supported by not only our results with CD40 induction but also by previous results using RelA-defective fibroblasts, demonstrating that TNFα induction of Smad7 requires NFκB (14Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the 5′-flanking region of the Smad7 gene contains multiple potential NFκB sites (54Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 55von Gersdorff G. Susztak K. Rezvani F. Bitzer M. Liang D. Böttinger E.P. J. Biol.

The role of NFκB in antagonizing apoptosis in WEHI 231 cells is well documented as is its induction by CD40. The signaling intermediates linking the CD40 receptor and NFκB are currently under investigation. It is tempting to speculate that, as reported with other anti-apoptotic ligands, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway couples the CD40 receptor to NFκB activation.Several previous reports implicate Smads in apoptosis. Smad2 and Smad3 have both been proposed to play an active role in activin- and TGF-β-mediated cell death in epithelial cells, and their activity is enhanced by Smad4 (56Yanagisawa K. Osada H.

In contrast, Smad7 induces apoptosis in prostatic carcinoma cells, suggesting some cell type-dependent differences (50Landstrom M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our data now show that the induction of Smad7 expression by anti-CD40 may be a key event that leads to suppression of TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Together with previous findings, our data support the hypothesis that the TGF-β receptor-activated Smads activate or repress transcription of key genes involved in cell death or survival.In summary, we demonstrate that CD40 receptor activation rescues WEHI 231 cells from TGF-β-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. The antagonism is associated with an up-regulation of Smad7 expression. We demonstrate that the induction of Smad7 by anti-CD40 is NFκB-dependent. In addition, we show that overexpressed Smad7 blocks TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis without affecting anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Self-tolerance and autoimmunity requires that only a small population of immature B cells survive in an environment that is selectively tuned toward cell death. Our results provide insight into the mechanism used by cells to subvert the apoptotic effects of TGF-β and thereby survive. The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 superfamily consists of cytokines, which play important roles in regulating essential cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 2Piek E. Heldin C.-H. Dijke P.T. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Their multifunctional effects are elicited through oligomeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. TGF-β binding to primarily the type II receptor (TβRII) then stabilizes the heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (TβRI) and results in transphosphorylation and activation of TβRI by the TβRII. The activated TβRI then propagates the signal through transient interaction with and phosphorylation of receptor-restricted Smads. Whereas Smad2 and Smad3 mediate TGF-β and activin signals, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 act downstream of bone morphogenetic proteins. Receptor-mediated phosphorylation occurs on two serine residues in a SSXS motif in the C-terminal domain of receptor-restricted Smads. Once phosphorylated, receptor-restricted Smads dimerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus and modulate transcription of TGF-β target genes (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Smad7 interacts with TβRI, blocking the phosphorylation and activation of receptor-restricted Smads, thereby preventing further signal propagation (8Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T.

Transcription of Smad6 and Smad7 is initiated by TGF-β stimulation, thus providing a regulatory feedback mechanism to terminate signaling through the activated receptors (11Afrakhte M. Morén A.

In addition, Smad7 expression has been shown to be induced by other factors such as shear stress, epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, interferon-γ, and TNF-α, suggesting that its transcription may serve as a regulatory mechanism integrating and modulating the physiological response of different signaling pathways (11Afrakhte M.

Elimination or clonal deletion of self-reactive B cells during development is mediated through apoptosis and is essential for maintenance of immune tolerance. Failure to eliminate immature B cells results in lymphoproliferation and the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer (16Lebman D.A. Edmiston J.S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mouse immature B cell line, WEHI 231, has been used as an in vitro model system to study B cell tolerance and apoptosis (17Scott D.W. Livnat D. Pennell C.A. Keng P. J. Exp.

Apoptosis in these cells can be induced after membrane interaction with antibodies against cell surface IgM chains (anti-IgM) as well as by TGF-β (20−22). A signal for abrogating or rescuing WEHI 231 cells from anti-IgM-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis can be generated by concomitant signaling through CD40 (22Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). CD40 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed by B cells (23Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It is structurally related to the TNF receptor family and plays a critical role in promoting cell survival, immunoglobulin class switching, and memory cell formation (24Kehry M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2345-2348PubMed Google Scholar). CD40 has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but interacts with adapter molecules of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, which couple to multiple signaling pathways, including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, Janus tyrosine kinase/Stat3, S6 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase, and NFκB (25Kashiwada M.

It remains unclear how all these signaling pathways contribute to the B cell response to CD40. Recent studies, however, have focused on the roles of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase and NFκB in CD40-mediated survival in B-lymphocytes. Using a RAG2-deficient complementation model, it has been shown that B-lymphocytes isolated from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-deficient mice have a diminished proliferative response to CD-40 ligand (30Fruman D.A.

https://openalex.org/W1507844320,"Abstract Salicylate and its pro-drug form aspirin are widely used medicinally for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, and more recently for their ability to protect against colon cancer and cardiovascular disease. Despite the wide use of salicylate, the mechanisms underlying its biological activities are largely unknown. Recent reports suggest that salicylate may produce some of its effects by modulating the activities of protein kinases. Since we have previously shown that the farnesyltransferase inhibitorl-744,832 inhibits cell proliferation and p70s6k activity, and salicylate inhibits cell proliferation, we examined whether salicylate affects p70s6k activity. We find that salicylate potently inhibits p70s6k activation and phosphorylation in a p38 MAPK-independent manner. Interestingly, low salicylate concentrations (≤250 μm) inhibit p70s6k activation by phorbol myristate acetate, while higher salicylate concentrations (≥5 mm) are required to block p70s6k activation by epidermal growth factor + insulin-like growth factor-1. These data suggest that salicylate may selectively inhibit p70s6kactivation in response to specific stimuli. Inhibition of p70s6k by salicylate occurs within 5 min, is independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and is associated with dephosphorylation of p70s6k on its major rapamycin-sensitive site, Thr389. A rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70s6k is resistant to salicylate-induced Thr389 dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1968113286,"By using a eukaryocytic cell expression cloning system, we have isolated cDNAs of the globoside synthase (β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) gene. Mouse fibroblast L cells transfected with SV40 large T antigen and previously cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNAs were co-transfected with a cDNA library prepared from mRNA from human kidney together with Forssman synthase cDNA, and Forssman antigen-positive cells were panned using an anti-Forssman monoclonal antibody. The isolated cDNAs contained a single open reading frame predicting a type II membrane protein with 351 amino acids. Surprisingly, the cDNA clones turned out to be identical with previously reported β3Gal-T3, which had been cloned by sequence homology with other galactosyltransferases. Substrate specificity analysis with extracts from cDNA-transfected L cells confirmed that the gene product was actually β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that specifically catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine onto globotriaosylceramide. Results of TLC immunostaining of neutral glycolipids from the cDNA-transfected cells also supported the identity of the newly synthesized component as globoside. The results show that glycosyltransferases apparently belonging to a single glycosyltransferase family do not necessarily catalyze reactions utilizing the same acceptor or even the same sugar donor.

J.

Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1986; 42: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). β1,4-Galactosyltransferase then synthesizes lactosylceramide (LacCer),1 which is a common precursor structure of the majority of glycosphingolipids present in mammals and birds. Three major series of glycolipids are synthesized starting from LacCer by addition of β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine (lacto/neolacto-series), α2,3-sialic acid (ganglio-series), or α1,4-galactose (globo-series). Moreover, addition ofN-acetylgalactosamine in a β1,4-linkage leads to the synthesis of asialo-ganglio series.Globo-series glycolipids are ubiquitously present in human and many other mammalian tissues, whereas some tissues such as kidney, placenta, testis, erythroid cells, heart, and spleen express them at high levels. Recently, the key enzyme to initiate the synthesis of the globo-series glycolipid, Gb3/CD77 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase, α1,4Gal-T), gene has been cloned by us (2Kojima Y. Fukumoto S.

The expression pattern of the gene also indicated that globo-series glycolipids may be more widely expressed than previously believed, suggesting the importance of structures containing the globo-series backbone.Globoside is the most prominent neutral glycosphingolipid in human erythrocytes (5Suzuki A. Kundu S.K. Marcus D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 473-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is an essential structure of blood group P antigen (6Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Globoside is synthesized from globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, Pk antigen) by the action of β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β1,3GalNAc-T). Therefore, Pk individuals lack β1,3GalNAc-T activity and accumulate the precursor Pk. On the other hand, p individuals lack Gb3/CD77 synthase activity with essentially intact β1,3GalNAc-T activity (7Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and they lack the expression of both Gb3/CD77 and globoside.Recently, a large number of glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been isolated. Many of them could be classified into several families based on their similarities in primary structures, e.g. there have been 9 fucosyltransferase genes (8Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), 18 members of sialyltransferase genes (9Tsuji S. J. Biochem.

However, no glycosyltransferases responsible for β1,3GalNAc linkages have been isolated so far.In this study, we have isolated cDNAs of β1,3GalNAc-T responsible for the synthesis of globoside using a eukaryocytic cell expression cloning system and taking advantage of the previously cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase. To our surprise, the cloned cDNAs of globoside synthase turned out to be identical with β1,3Gal-T3 (β3Gal-T3) which was considered to be a galactosyltransferase responsible for the formation of Galβ1,3GlcNAc-R structures, although no enzymatic activity was reported for the expressed cDNA (11Amado M.

These results suggest that glycosyltransferases that seem to be members of a transferase family do not necessarily catalyze enzyme reactions with either the same sugar donor or the same acceptor structure. We propose here the name β3GalNAc-T1 for the cloned globoside synthase gene.DISCUSSIONGloboside was defined as a major sugar-contained lipid of human blood stroma that formed perfectly round globules (spherocrystals) as viewed under microscope, and its name was chosen to reflect its property (24Yamakawa T. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1952; 39: 393-402Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The main glycolipid structure from hog erythrocyte stroma was also determined to be β-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(1→3)-galactosyl-(1→4)-galactosyl-(1→4)-glucosyl-ceramide, namely globoside (25Miyatake T. Handa S. Yamakawa T. Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 38: 135-138PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic pathway of globoside has been recognized in the studies of rare blood group types PKand p (26Marcus D.M.

Since P and Pk structures were absent in the p individuals, and P structure was absent in Pk individuals; P (globoside) was considered to be synthesized from Pk(Gb3) independently from P1 antigen structure (27Naiki M. Fong J. Ledeen R. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although there were some ambiguous interpretations and remaining issues for the relationship between these structures (6Naiki M.

Their results demonstrated that cells from Pk individuals lacked β1,3-GalNAc-T activity, and those of p individuals were deficient in α1,4-Gal-T activity in accordance with the predicted synthetic pathway of these glycolipid structures.Chien et al. (32Chien J.-L. Williams T. Basu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1778-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Taniguchi and Makita (33Taniguchi N. Makita A. J. Biol.

These results showed good agreement with the nature of the enzyme expected from the isolated cDNA reported here,i.e. Mn2+ requirement, pH optimum at 6.9, and substrate specificity. The molecular masses they determined (64 and 57 kDa) differed from those predicted from the cloned cDNAs (∼40 kDa); however, this discrepancy might be due to glycosylation modifications that would increase the predicted molecular mass or to a difference in species studied.The goal of this study was to isolate β1,3GalNAc-T cDNA responsible for the synthesis of globoside from Gb3. Surprisingly, the cloned cDNA insert contained a primary structure similar to those of β1,3Gal-T gene family (β3Gal-T family) and was identical to β3Gal-T3 (11Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F.

Although they did not exclude the existence of other β3Gal-T which could be responsible for the formation of SSEA-3, it seems clear that a member of β3Gal-T family certainly shows dual activity toward GlcNAc and GalNAc-based acceptors (40Zhou D. Henion T. Jungalwala F.B. Berger E.G. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22631-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Zhou et al. (41Zhou D. Dinter A.

This cDNA product exhibited inverted donor and acceptor specificities (β1,3GlcNAc-transfer onto Galβ1,4-R), whereas it shared the conserved sequence motifs among β3Gal-Ts except for the majority of conserved cysteine residues. Together with our results, these data indicate that the β3Gal-T family contains diverse glycosyltransferases that use various nucleotide sugars and acceptors, and this family might represent enzymes responsible for the catalysis of glycosidic β1,3-linkages.Recently, a function of globoside as an initiator of signal transduction through AP1 and CREB associated with cell adhesion was reported (42Song Y. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although globoside has been considered to be an adhesion molecule on epithelial cells to various bacteria such as uropathogenicE. coli (43Lund B. Lindberg F.P. Baga M. Normark S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a receptor for pig edema disease toxin (44DeGrandis S. Law H. Brunton J. Gyles C. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol.

Med. 1993; 177: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), its physiological function in vivo has never been elucidated. If signals transduced via globoside regulate transcription factors like AP1 and CREB, the control of the gene expression of globoside synthase would be very critical in the development and differentiation, and the availability of globoside synthase gene would strongly promote researches in these fields. Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases starting from the glucosylation of ceramide (1Hakomori S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1986; 42: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). β1,4-Galactosyltransferase then synthesizes lactosylceramide (LacCer),1 which is a common precursor structure of the majority of glycosphingolipids present in mammals and birds. Three major series of glycolipids are synthesized starting from LacCer by addition of β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine (lacto/neolacto-series), α2,3-sialic acid (ganglio-series), or α1,4-galactose (globo-series). Moreover, addition ofN-acetylgalactosamine in a β1,4-linkage leads to the synthesis of asialo-ganglio series. Globo-series glycolipids are ubiquitously present in human and many other mammalian tissues, whereas some tissues such as kidney, placenta, testis, erythroid cells, heart, and spleen express them at high levels. Recently, the key enzyme to initiate the synthesis of the globo-series glycolipid, Gb3/CD77 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase, α1,4Gal-T), gene has been cloned by us (2Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and other groups (3Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B.

Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25315-25321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the gene also indicated that globo-series glycolipids may be more widely expressed than previously believed, suggesting the importance of structures containing the globo-series backbone. Globoside is the most prominent neutral glycosphingolipid in human erythrocytes (5Suzuki A. Kundu S.K. Marcus D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 473-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is an essential structure of blood group P antigen (6Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Globoside is synthesized from globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, Pk antigen) by the action of β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β1,3GalNAc-T). Therefore, Pk individuals lack β1,3GalNAc-T activity and accumulate the precursor Pk. On the other hand, p individuals lack Gb3/CD77 synthase activity with essentially intact β1,3GalNAc-T activity (7Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and they lack the expression of both Gb3/CD77 and globoside. Recently, a large number of glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been isolated. Many of them could be classified into several families based on their similarities in primary structures, e.g. there have been 9 fucosyltransferase genes (8Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), 18 members of sialyltransferase genes (9Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), 7 β4-galactosyltransferase genes (10Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), 5 β3-galactosyltransferase genes (11Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12770-12778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and 7 peptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase genes (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) isolated to date. However, no glycosyltransferases responsible for β1,3GalNAc linkages have been isolated so far. In this study, we have isolated cDNAs of β1,3GalNAc-T responsible for the synthesis of globoside using a eukaryocytic cell expression cloning system and taking advantage of the previously cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase. To our surprise, the cloned cDNAs of globoside synthase turned out to be identical with β1,3Gal-T3 (β3Gal-T3) which was considered to be a galactosyltransferase responsible for the formation of Galβ1,3GlcNAc-R structures, although no enzymatic activity was reported for the expressed cDNA (11Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12770-12778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These results suggest that glycosyltransferases that seem to be members of a transferase family do not necessarily catalyze enzyme reactions with either the same sugar donor or the same acceptor structure. We propose here the name β3GalNAc-T1 for the cloned globoside synthase gene. DISCUSSIONGloboside was defined as a major sugar-contained lipid of human blood stroma that formed perfectly round globules (spherocrystals) as viewed under microscope, and its name was chosen to reflect its property (24Yamakawa T. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1952; 39: 393-402Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The main glycolipid structure from hog erythrocyte stroma was also determined to be β-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(1→3)-galactosyl-(1→4)-galactosyl-(1→4)-glucosyl-ceramide, namely globoside (25Miyatake T. Handa S. Yamakawa T. Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 38: 135-138PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic pathway of globoside has been recognized in the studies of rare blood group types PKand p (26Marcus D.M. Naiki M. Kundu S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3263-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since P and Pk structures were absent in the p individuals, and P structure was absent in Pk individuals; P (globoside) was considered to be synthesized from Pk(Gb3) independently from P1 antigen structure (27Naiki M. Fong J. Ledeen R. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although there were some ambiguous interpretations and remaining issues for the relationship between these structures (6Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Marcus D.M. Naiki M. Kundu S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vox Sang. 1974; 26: 518-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enzymes responsible for the synthesis of globo-series glycolipids were studied by Kijimoto-Ochiai et al. (7Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Hilderbrand and Hauser (30Hilderbrand J. Hauser G. J. Biol.

Acta. 1974; 337: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their results demonstrated that cells from Pk individuals lacked β1,3-GalNAc-T activity, and those of p individuals were deficient in α1,4-Gal-T activity in accordance with the predicted synthetic pathway of these glycolipid structures.Chien et al. (32Chien J.-L. Williams T. Basu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1778-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Taniguchi and Makita (33Taniguchi N. Makita A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5637-5642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified globoside synthase from embryonic chicken brain or canine spleen, respectively. These results showed good agreement with the nature of the enzyme expected from the isolated cDNA reported here,i.e. Mn2+ requirement, pH optimum at 6.9, and substrate specificity. The molecular masses they determined (64 and 57 kDa) differed from those predicted from the cloned cDNAs (∼40 kDa); however, this discrepancy might be due to glycosylation modifications that would increase the predicted molecular mass or to a difference in species studied.The goal of this study was to isolate β1,3GalNAc-T cDNA responsible for the synthesis of globoside from Gb3. Surprisingly, the cloned cDNA insert contained a primary structure similar to those of β1,3Gal-T gene family (β3Gal-T family) and was identical to β3Gal-T3 (11Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F.

These findings suggest that the β3Gal-T family is heterogenous and contains glycosyltransferases that utilize a variety of sugar donors or acceptors. Our results also indicated that authors (11Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) found that β3Gal-T5, which was reported to be involved in the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis, an antigen in gastrointestinal and pancreatic epithelia and tumor cells derived therefrom, was a stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) synthase (i.e. a β1,3-galactosylgloboside synthase) (40Zhou D. Henion T. Jungalwala F.B. Berger E.G. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22631-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although they did not exclude the existence of other β3Gal-T which could be responsible for the formation of SSEA-3, it seems clear that a member of β3Gal-T family certainly shows dual activity toward GlcNAc and GalNAc-based acceptors (40Zhou D. Henion T. Jungalwala F.B. Berger E.G. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22631-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Zhou et al. (41Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This cDNA product exhibited inverted donor and acceptor specificities (β1,3GlcNAc-transfer onto Galβ1,4-R), whereas it shared the conserved sequence motifs among β3Gal-Ts except for the majority of conserved cysteine residues. Together with our results, these data indicate that the β3Gal-T family contains diverse glycosyltransferases that use various nucleotide sugars and acceptors, and this family might represent enzymes responsible for the catalysis of glycosidic β1,3-linkages. Recently, a function of globoside as an initiator of signal transduction through AP1 and CREB associated with cell adhesion was reported (42Song Y. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although globoside has been considered to be an adhesion molecule on epithelial cells to various bacteria such as uropathogenicE. coli (43Lund B. Lindberg F.P. Baga M. Normark S. J.

If signals transduced via globoside regulate transcription factors like AP1 and CREB, the control of the gene expression of globoside synthase would be very critical in the development and differentiation, and the availability of globoside synthase gene would strongly promote researches in these fields.

The putative primary structure revealed the close relationship of P450foxy to the bacterial cytochrome P450BM3, a fused protein of cytochrome P450 and its reductase from Bacillus megaterium. The amino acid sequence identities of the P450 and P450 reductase domains of P450foxy were highest (40.6 and 35.3%, respectively) to the corresponding domains of P450BM3. Recombinant P450foxy expressed in yeast was catalytically and spectrally indistinguishable from the native protein, except most of the recombinant P450foxy was recovered in the soluble fraction of the yeast cells, in marked contrast to native P450foxy, which was exclusively recovered in the membrane fraction of the fungal cells. This difference implies that a post (or co)-translational mechanism functions in the fungal cells to target and bind the protein to the membrane. These results provide conclusive evidence that P450foxy is the eukaryotic counterpart of bacterial P450BM3, which evokes interest in the evolutionary aspects concerning the P450 superfamily along with its reducing systems.

Despite the incomparable molecular diversity of the P450 superfamily, the tertiary structure is considered to be well conserved among all members (5Gotoh O. J. Biol.

This hypothesis is now being proven by an increasing body of knowledge of their crystal structures (7Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The species P450nor and P450foxy were originally isolated from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (13Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both are unique in that they are self-sufficient, which means that they can complete their functions without the aid of other proteinaceous components such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (referred to as P450 reductase). P450nor functions as nitric-oxide reductase, taking part in the process of fungal denitrification. Its self-sufficient nature depends on its ability to receive electrons directly from NAD(P)H (13Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the unique reaction of P450nor, P450foxy catalyzes the subterminal (ω-1 to ω-3) hydroxylation of fatty acids (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that seems to be a standard P450-dependent monooxygenase reaction, whereas it is also unusual because of its self-sufficient nature. P450foxy was suggested to be a fused protein of P450 and its reductase; and thus, the electrons from NADPH should transfer to the active-site heme via its putative reductase domain (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fatty acid (or alkane) terminal (ω) and subterminal (in-chain; ω-1, ω-2, etc.) hydroxylations occur widely in nature and are catalyzed by multicomponent monooxygenase systems. The “terminal oxidases” of the bacterial systems except P450BM3 are of the non-heme iron type (15McKenna E.J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3882-3889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas those of eukaryotes are of the P450 type (1Omura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W.

Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the terminal (ω) hydroxylation of alkanes in bacteria and yeast is to utilize alkanes as carbon and energy sources via the β-oxidation of fatty acids that are formed by the successive oxidation of alkanes (17Kusunose M. Kusunose E. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1374-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the physiological roles of the terminal hydroxylation of fatty acids including those of P450BM3 and P450foxy are essentially unknown. In-chain hydroxylated fatty acids are located in cutins that protect plants from microbial attack (18Salaün J.-P. Helvig C. Drug Metab. Drug Interact. 1995; 12: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A contribution of P450-dependent fatty acid (eicosanoid) hydroxylation to the control of the arachidonate cascade in mammals has been proposed (1Omura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Makita K. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). P450BM3 (CYP102) of the bacterium Bacillus megaterium was the first member of the superfamily that was found to be fused with its reductase (20Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450foxy bears close resemblance to P450BM3 in terms of self-sufficiency, molecular mass, high catalytic turnover, and other enzymatic properties (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that P450foxy is also a fused protein. Furthermore, P450foxy reacts with polyclonal antibodies raised against P450BM3 (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that they are quite similar. Limiting proteolysis of P450foxy yielded two main polypeptides that were separable on SDS-PAGE.1 TheirMr values suggest that the two polypeptides are derived from the P450 and reductase domains, respectively. Only the polypeptide with the lower Mr that should have been derived from the P450 domain reacted with the polyclonal antibodies raised against P450BM3 (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This indicated similarity between the P450 domains of P450foxy and P450BM3. On the other hand, the only difference between P450foxy and P450BM3 was in their apparent intracellular localization. P450foxy was purified from the membrane fraction after solubilization (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas P450BM3 is a soluble protein. Here, we cloned the P450foxy-encoding gene and expressed it in a heterologous yeast host-vector system. The results showed close relationships between not only the P450 domains, but also the reductase domains of P450foxy and P450BM3, generating questions about the molecular evolution of P450 and its reductase. The F. oxysporum MT-811 fungal strain containing P450foxy (21Tomura D. Obika K. Fukamizu A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was the source of DNA. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRA, Y1090, and MV1190 were the host cells for λEMBL3, for λgt11, and for the construction of plasmids, respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 (Invitrogen) and its transformants were cultured in 2% dextrose and 0.67% yeast nutrient base (Difco) supplemented with 60 μg/ml l-leucine, 20 μg/mll-histidine, and 40 μg/ml l-tryptophan; YEPD medium (1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% peptone (Difco), and 2% dextrose); and YEPG medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% galactose). Recombinant P450foxy was produced by culturing yeast transformants in 50 ml of YEPD medium in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask at 30 °C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. The cells were transferred 24 h later to YEPG medium and cultivated for >24 h under the same conditions. Purified P450foxy (150 μg) (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and digested with trypsin as described (22Aebersold R.H.

After separation by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, the amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides obtained were determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise 492 automated protein sequencer. Total DNA of F. oxysporum MT-811 (21Tomura D. Obika K. Fukamizu A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was the template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following degenerate oligonucleotide primers: FA, 5′-TTYACNGCNTTYGARGAYGA-3′ (corresponding to FTAFEDE); FB, 5′-CCRTGN(C/G)(A/T)NGGNGCRTC-3′ (corresponding to DAPSHG); FC, 5′-GAYGARCCNAAYTGGGG-3′ (corresponding to DEPNWG); and FD, 5′-ATRAAYTTRTCNGCRTCRTT-3′ (corresponding to NDADKFI). The first PCR used 200 pm FA and 200 pm FB as the primers and 0.5 μg of total DNA as the template. Amplification proceeded by denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The second PCR used the product of the first PCR as the template and FC and FD as the primers under the same conditions. Total DNA of F. oxysporum MT-811 was partially digested withSau3AI, ligated to BamHI-digested λEMBL3, packaged in vitro, and transfected into E. coliXL1-Blue MRA. The resultant DNA library was screened by plaque hybridization (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the PCR product obtained above (see Fig. 1 A) as the probe. Nucleotides were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) using the LONG READIR Model 4200 automated DNA sequencer (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Southern blot analysis essentially proceeded as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probes were labeled and hybridized; membranes were washed; and signals were detected using the ECL nucleotide labeling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cDNA library ofF. oxysporum MT-811 (25Kizawa H. Tomura D. Oda M. Fukamizu A. Hoshino T. Gotoh O. Yasui T. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10632-10637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened by plaque hybridization using the 1.4-kilobase pair SalI fragment of CYP505 (see Fig. 1 A) as the probe. About 60% of the total cDNA that contained the 3′-end was obtained by this procedure. The 5′-region of the CYP505 cDNA was obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as follows. mRNA was purified from total RNA of F. oxysporum (21Tomura D. Obika K. Fukamizu A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA was synthesized using a Marathon kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The 5′-end of the cDNA was ligated to a 44-base adapter oligonucleotide (supplied with the kit) that included annealing sites for primers AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′). PCR was performed with theCYP505-specific primer 5′-2 (5′-TGTTTGCTTGATCTCCAAAGCGTAGTT-3′) and primer AP1. The product was used as the template for the second PCR using the nested primer 5′-1 (5′-AGGATCCGTCATAGTGAAATTGAAGTT-3′) and primer AP2. The product was subcloned into the pGEM®-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The transcription initiation site was estimated from the results of 5′-RACE using the Marathon kit and primer R1(5′-CTGGGAACTTCCTCTTATGCTCAA-3′). The expression plasmid pYESfoxy was constructed as follows. The product of reverse transcription PCR was used as the template for PCR with the oligonucleotide primer YE1 (5′-GGGGTACCATGGCTGAATCTGTCC-3′, corresponding to the amino terminus of P450foxy) and primer 5′-1. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T, the KpnI-BamHI fragment of which was ligated to the same restriction sites of pYES2 (Invitrogen) to generate pYESfoxy1. The AatII-SphI fragment of theCYP505 cDNA was inserted between the AatII and SphI sites of pYESfoxy1 to generate pYESfoxy. S. cerevisiae INVSc1 was transformed with pYES2 or pYESfoxy using lithium acetate (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 10 ml of 50 mm MES (pH 7.0) containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted twice using a French pressure cell press (30,000 p.s.i.) and then separated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was fractionated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 80 min and used as the soluble fraction. The precipitate was solubilized with 0.15% Emulgen 913 (Kao Co., Tokyo) and separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 80 min. The supernatant was used as the membrane fraction. Recombinant P450foxy was purified over DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) as described (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mycelia ofF. oxysporum MT-811 were collected on filter paper and disrupted as described (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cell-free extracts were fractionated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min into supernatant (soluble fraction) and precipitate (membrane fraction). The membrane fraction was further solubilized in 0.5 m KCl or 0.15% Emulgen 913 on ice for 1 h. The fraction was again separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the solubilized fraction (supernatant). Samples (10 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was analyzed using 2000-fold diluted anti-P450foxy antiserum raised against purified recombinant P450foxy. Immunoreactive signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer. Fatty-acid hydroxylase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activities were measured as described (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). P450 content was determined using an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1cm−1 for the difference in absorbance between 450 and 490 nm (27Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The amino acid sequences of proteins were aligned using GENETYX-MAC Version 10.1.1. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the ClustalW Version 1.5 multiple alignment program (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). Based on the amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides, four degenerate oligonucleotide primers (FA, FB, FC, and FD) were designed for nested PCR (28Morrison J.F.J. Markham A.F. McPherson M.J. Hames B.D. Taylor G.R. PCR2 : A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 181Google Scholar) against total DNA of F. oxysporum (Fig. 1 A). A 920-base pair fragment with a deduced amino acid sequence that contained portions of sequences exactly the same as those of the tryptic peptides (Fig. 2) was specifically amplified. This indicated that this fragment was derived from the gene for P450foxy. The genomic DNA library was subsequently screened using the 920-base pair fragment as a hybridization probe. One positive clone was selected and sequenced. An entire open reading frame was found (Fig. 2). The presence of five introns in the open reading frame was confirmed by comparison with the cDNA. The results of 5′-RACE suggested that the transcription should start at position −230 (Fig. 2). We deduced an initiation codon at positions +1 to +3 because no potential initiation codon was observed between positions −230 and +1, and the deduced initiation codon was surrounded by the fungal consensus sequence TCA(C/A)(A/C)ATG(G/T)C (29Ballance D.J. Yeast. 1986; 4: 229-236Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence contained the same sequences as those of the six tryptic peptides (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the open reading frame codes P450foxy, and the DNA region was designated as CYP505. In the 5′-upstream region of CYP505, two CAAT sequences are located at positions −359 to −356 and −534 to −531 (Fig. 2).CYP102 of B. megaterium contains in its 5′-upstream region the Barbie box, which responds to barbitals to induce transcription of the gene (30Liang Q. He J.S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, no such sequence was found in CYP505, consistent with our previous finding that P450foxy is not induced by barbitals (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Total DNA of F. oxysporum was digested with EcoRV or PstI (Fig. 1 B) or KpnI (data not shown) that do not digest CYP505 and hybridized with the probe P450foxy cDNA. Only a single hybridization signal was obtained from each blot, indicating that one copy of CYP505is present in F. oxysporum MT-811. The deduced amino acid sequence of CYP505 is composed of 1066 amino acid residues, and its calculated Mr is 117,871, which agreed well with that of purified P450foxy (118,000) estimated by SDS-PAGE (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic clustering analysis suggested that the primary structure contained neither a membrane anchor sequence in its amino terminus nor a long hydrophobic stretch in the internal regions (data not shown), although P450foxy should be membrane-bound. The primary structure of P450foxy can be divided into P450, P450 reductase, and their linker domains from sequence alignment with P450BM3 (31Ruettinger R.T. Wen L.P. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10987-10995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 3 and 4). The N-terminal 475 amino acid residues form the P450 domain, which contains the sequence FGNGKRACIG (Fig. 3, boxed). This sequence is consistent with the heme-binding motif (F(G/S)XGX(R/H)XCXG) that is strictly conserved in P450 (4Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The P450 domain also contains the conserved sequence AGHET (Fig. 3, boxed), which agrees with the consensus sequence ((A/G)GX(E/D)T) around the conserved Thr residue in helix I (32Graham-Lorence S. Peterson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Other residues (Glu322 and Arg325) in the putative helix K were also conserved in P450foxy.Figure 4Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of the P450 reductase domain of P450foxy (FOXR) with the sequences of the reductase domains of B. megaterium P450BM3 (BMR) and rat P450 reductase (NCRAT).

Its sequence showed an overall similarity to those characteristic of P450 reductases (Fig. 4). Most of the consensus sequences or amino acid residues conserved in P450 reductases (33Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), in particular those forming the FAD-, FMN-, and NADPH-binding domains (Fig. 4,boxed), are also highly conserved in P450foxy. The alignment indicated that the linker domain would be formed with 20 amino acid residues between the P450 and reductase domains (Fig. 3,underlined). This domain contains two Lys residues and many other hydrophilic residues. This appeared to be consistent with our previous finding (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that the limiting tryptic digestion of P450foxy yielded two polypeptides that would have arisen from the P450 and reductase domains, respectively, as the result of cleavage at this domain. The primary structure of each domain of P450foxy was compared with those of other cytochromes P450 and P450 reductases (Table I). The degree of homology (amino acid sequence identity) was highest (∼40.6%) between the P450 domain of P450foxy (referred to as FOXP) and the P450 domain of P450BM3 (referred to as BMP). In contrast, sequence identity to other cytochromes P450 was <24%. The intimate relationship between FOXP and BMP is also indicated in the phylogenetic tree of the P450 superfamily (Fig. 5) that was constructed between representative members from various organisms. In addition, FOXP and BMP are more closely related to the CYP4 (34Kimura S. Hanioka N. Matsunaga E. Gonzalez F.J. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1989; 8: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), CYP52 (35Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Tanimoto T. Fujii M. Ohta A. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and CYP86 (36Benveniste I. Tijet N. Adas F. Philipps G. Salaun J.P. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) families, all of which catalyze fatty acid subterminal (or terminal) hydroxylation, than to other families. These fatty-acid hydroxylase cytochromes P450 form a cluster in the tree on the basis of catalytic function rather than the phylogenetic relationship of the organisms of their origins.Table IAmino acid sequence identities of the P450 and P450 reductase domains of P450foxy (CYP505) to homologs of various originsIdentity 1-aPercent identical residues are defined as 100 × ((number of matched sites)/(sum of numbers of matched, substituted, and unpaired sites)).HumanRatHouseflyA. thalianaS. cerevisiaeB. megaterium%P450 (family)22.723.521.626.323.640.6(CYP4A11)(CYP4A1)(CYP6A1)(CYP97B3)(CYP56)(CYP102)P450 reductase24.525.026.126.1/26.224.935.3The respective accession numbers for P450 and P450 reductases are as follows: human, PIR JX0331 and A33421; rat, PIR S01336 and A00402; housefly, PIR A32157 and GenBank™/EBI L19897; Arabidopsis thaliana, GenBank™/EBI Z97337 and PIR S21530 and S21531; S. cerevisiae, PIR B36395 and A41447; and B. megaterium, PIR A34286.1-a Percent identical residues are defined as 100 × ((number of matched sites)/(sum of numbers of matched, substituted, and unpaired sites)).

The sequence identity of the P450 reductase domain of P450foxy was again the highest (35.3%) to the P450 reductase domain of P450BM3 (Table I) and much lower (∼25%) to other P450 reductases. The extent of the identity was similar (24.9%) to the reductase of S. cerevisiae, the most closely related organism to F. oxysporum listed in Table I. Therefore, the sequence identities of both the P450 and P450 reductase domains of P450foxy are exceptionally high to the respective domains of P450BM3, although the reductase domains of P450foxy did not seem to react with the polyclonal antibodies to P450BM3 on Western blots (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the overall regions of P450foxy and P450BM3 is 37.3%. These results indicate that P450foxy and P450BM3 originated from the same ancient gene. Expression of recombinant P450foxy (rP450foxy) was examined using the S. cerevisiae host-vector system. The transformed yeast cells harboring pYESfoxy produced a spectrophotometrically detectable amount of P450, whereas those harboring only the vector (pYES2) did not. Concentrations of 0.098 and 0.13 nmol of P450/mg of protein were recovered from both the soluble and membrane fractions of the transformed cells, respectively, and at an 80:20 ratio of the absolute amount. Recombinant P450foxy was therefore recovered mostly (80%) in a soluble form, in contrast to its native form, which was originally purified from the membrane fraction of F. oxysporum. A specific signal was detected by Western blotting at the predicted Mr of 118,000 in both fractions (Fig. 6 A). These recombinant proteins seemed to be correctly folded because lauric acid-dependent NADPH oxidase activity was also detected in both fractions (900 and 2100 nmol of NADPH/min/nmol of P450, respectively). The difference in the specific activity between the fatty-acid hydroxylase activities recovered in the two fractions could not be elucidated, whereas the recombinant protein seemed to be somewhat stabilized by binding to the membrane. These results indicate that P450foxy is produced in a soluble form that is partially associated with membranes in yeast cells. Recombinant P450foxy was solubilized from the membrane fraction and then partially purified and characterized. The absorption spectra are characteristic of those of P450foxy (Fig. 6 B). Several kinetic parameters, such as the turnover of laurate hydroxylase activity, Km for NADH, and the turnover of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, determined using the recombinant protein were indistinguishable from those determined using the native protein (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Table II). Thus, the exceptionally high catalytic turnover of native P450foxy as compared with other P450 monooxygenases could be reproduced in the recombinant protein. Furthermore, rP450foxy also exhibited the phenomenon observed with native P450foxy (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) as well as P450BM3 (37Klein Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar): its NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was enhanced in the presence of the substrate to be hydroxylated (fatty acid) (TableII). These results unequivocally demonstrate that the rP450foxy expressed in the yeast system is spectrally and kinetically indistinguishable from the native protein.Table IICatalytic activities of native and recombinant P450foxyLaurate hydroxylaseKm for NADHCytochromec reductaseCytochrome c reductase with 0.15 mm lauric acidnmol NADPH min−1 nmol−1 P450mmnmol min−1 nmol−1 P450nmol min−1 nmol−1 p450rP450foxy1210 ± 1100.15 ± 0.05890 ± 501590 ± 140P450foxy 2-aData are from Nakayamaet al.

( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Data are mean values of three experiments. Native P450foxy is assumed to be a membrane-bound protein, but results have not been conclusive (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We examined this property by Western blotting using the anti-P450foxy antiserum. As shown in Fig. 7 A, a specific signal with anMr of 118,000 reacted to the antiserum in both the cell-free extracts before fractionation and the membrane fraction, but not in the soluble fraction of F. oxysporum. P450foxy was partially released into the soluble fraction by washing the membrane fraction with 0.5 m KCl and mostly solubilized by 0.15% Emulgen 913 (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that P450foxy is loosely bound to the membrane. An immunoreactive signal was undetectable in the soluble fraction of F. oxysporum (Fig. 7 A, lane 3), in contrast to the yeast cells, in which most of the rP450foxy was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 6 A). A mechanism missing in the yeast cells may act in the original fungal cells to translocate P450foxy to membranes. In this study, we cloned the gene of P450foxy (CYP505) of F. oxysporum and expressed it in heterologous host yeast cells. The results provide conclusive evidence that P450foxy is a fused protein of P450 and its reductase and that it has a phylogenetically close relationship to P450BM3 ofB. megaterium as predicted (14Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although they originated in a eukaryote and in a prokaryote, respectively. Genomic analysis has recently revealed that Bacillus subtilis contains two genes encoding a protein that is closely related to P450BM3 (PIR accession numbers A69975 and D69799), suggesting a wide distribution of P450BM3 among the genera Bacilli. Our findings regarding P450foxy further demonstrate that this type of fused protein would occur more often in nature across phyla than has been thought. The phylogenetic relationships between the members of the P450 superfamily approximately agree with those between the source organisms of each P450 (4Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J.

For example, prokaryotic cytochromes P450 are clustered into a big branch that is separate from eukaryotic groups, and most plant cytochromes P450 are also clustered. However, two exceptions are known. Prokaryotic P450BM3 is classified in the same eukaryotic group as the CYP4 and CYP52 families (4Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, 16Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P-450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar), and P450nor ofF. oxysporum (CYP55) is classified in the group of prokaryotic cytochromes P450 (16Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P-450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar, 39Nebert D.W. Nelson D.R. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

These relationships also appear in Fig. 5. P450 may have emerged at a very early stage, possibly before eukaryotic cells appeared (16Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P-450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar, 40Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 572-593PubMed Google Scholar), and the cytochromes P450 associated with steroidogenesis have retained the oldest functions of P450 (40Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 572-593PubMed Google Scholar). The recent finding of CYP51 (P45014DM) in prokaryotes (41Aoyama Y. Horiuchi T. Gotoh O. Noshiro M. Yoshida Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) has afforded further evidence to support this hypothesis. The appearance of fatty-acid (alkane) (sub)terminal hydroxylase cytochromes P450 in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that are grouped in the same branch in the phylogenetic tree (4Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, 16Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P-450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar) seems to indicate that P450 also acquired this function at a very early time. However, the known fatty-acid (alkane) terminal hydroxylases of prokaryotes are mostly dependent on non-heme iron proteins (15McKenna E.J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3882-3889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of P450BM3. The finding of P450foxy in a eukaryote is therefore intriguing. In addition to the P450 domain, the sequence identity of the P450 reductase domain of P450foxy is also exceptionally high to the corresponding domain of P450BM3 among the reductases examined (TableI). In contrast to the vast molecular diversity of P450, P450 reductase is usually found as a single molecular species, except in plants, which have two (43Urban P. Mignotte C. Kazmaier M. Delorme F. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19176-19186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). P450 reductase of this type containing both FMN and FAD is fundamentally found only in eukaryotes. Therefore, the genes for the P450 and reductase domains of P450foxy and P450BM3 appear to have fused after F. oxysporum and B. megaterium diverged. This suggests a horizontal transfer of the fused gene between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that occurred as an evolutionary event. Comparison of the reductase domains of P450foxy and P450BM3 with more reductases will clarify the origin of the fused proteins, although both the P450 and P450 reductase domains of the fused proteins seem to have originated in eukaryotes. Whether or not F. oxysporumcontains an “usual” P450 reductase that is not fused with P450 requires investigation. The occurrence of another P450 reductase species in F. oxysporum is possible because the fungus should contain other P450 species, e.g. at least CYP51, which is essential for the synthesis of steroids (40Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 572-593PubMed Google Scholar, 41Aoyama Y. Horiuchi T. Gotoh O. Noshiro M. Yoshida Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also expressed the P450foxy-encoding gene in the heterologous hostS. cerevisiae. The recombinant protein was catalytically and spectrally indistinguishable from the native protein, except for the fact that it was recovered mostly in the soluble fraction of the yeast cells. The native protein was exclusively recovered from the membrane fraction of fungal cells. We cannot yet explain why a small portion (20%) of rP450foxy was recovered in the membrane fraction. TheMr values of the native and recombinant protein species recovered in the soluble and membrane fractions were identical according to SDS-PAGE (Figs. 6 and 7). This does not necessarily rule out the possibility that these protein species are not completely identical. However, removing a few amino acid residues from the N or C terminus by post-translational proteolysis is unlikely to have rendered most of the rP450foxy soluble because a small portion of the polypeptide comprising only a few amino acid residues probably cannot anchor the polypeptide to a membrane. The distribution of a small portion of rP450foxy to the membrane fraction might have arisen from a nonspecific interaction. On the other hand, native P450foxy would be targeted and bound to the membrane by a post (or co)-translational mechanism that functions in the fungal cells, but does not work in the yeast cells, because it was exclusively recovered in the membrane fraction of the fungal cells. The protein may be modified by a hydrophobic moiety such as a fatty acid (44Grand R.J.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or a prenyl group (38Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Such a modification is consistent with our findings that native P450foxy was loosely bound to the membrane and that the purified protein was inert against Edman degradation performed using an automated peptide sequencer, 2N. Nakayama and H. Shoun, unpublished data. suggesting that its N terminus is blocked. The mechanism that targets and binds P450foxy to the membrane remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1969732387,"Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 play an important role in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent signaling. We have recently demonstrated that both kinases are associated with the uPA receptor (uPAR) and mediate uPA-induced activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat1, Stat2, and Stat4) in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Janus kinases are not only required for Stat activation but may also interfere with other intracellular signaling pathways. Here we report that in VSMC, Tyk2 interacts with a downstream signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). We demonstrate that uPA induces PI3-K activation, which is abolished in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2. The regulatory subunit p85 of PI3-K co-immunoprecipitates with Tyk2 but not with Jak1, Jak2, or Jak3, and uPA stimulation increases the PI3-K activity in Tyk2 immunoprecipitates. Tyk2 directly binds to either of the two Src homology 2(SH2)p85 domains in a uPA-dependent fashion. We provide evidence that the Tyk2-mediated PI3-K activation in response to uPA is required for VSMC migration. Thus, two unrelated structurally distinct specific inhibitors of PI3-K, wortmannin and LY294002, prevent VSMC migration induced by uPA. No migratory effect of uPA was observed in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2. Our results underscore the versatile function of Tyk2 in uPA-related intracellular signaling and indicate that PI3-K plays a selective role in the regulation of VSMC migration.

Our results underscore the versatile function of Tyk2 in uPA-related intracellular signaling and indicate that PI3-K plays a selective role in the regulation of VSMC migration. Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription urokinase-type plasminogen activator uPA receptor vascular smooth muscle cells phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Src homology 2 polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis A major pathway for signal generation by cytokines, growth factors, and polypeptide hormones involves activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase family (Jak kinases)1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) proteins (1Ziemiecki A.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar). Jak activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several Stat proteins that form homo- and heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription by binding to specific promoter sequences of stimulated genes (3Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Which members of the Jak and Stat families are activated varies greatly among different agonists and in different cell systems (4Schindler C. Exp.

We have recently demonstrated that the urokinase receptor (uPAR) utilizes the Jak/Stat pathway for intracellular transmission in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and endothelial cells (6Dumler I.

Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1999; 107: 96-101Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Some of these functions require uPAR-dependent signal transduction, which remains imperfectly defined. uPAR is associated with two Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, which become activated in response to uPA and subsequently induce formation and activation of Stat1, Stat2, and Stat4 complexes (6Dumler I.

Both kinases co-localized with the uPAR to the leading edge of migrating VSMC (6Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), implying a possible contribution of the Jaks to cell migration, most likely via the interactions with other kinases or signaling molecules. Several reports have shown that Jaks and Stats interfere with multiple signaling cascades, such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), Pyk2, and Src kinases. These cascades couple Jak/Stat to pathways with different downstream signaling functions (5Ward A.C. Touw I. Yoshimura A. Blood. 2000; 95: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chatterjee-Kishore M. Van den Aker F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We reasoned that PI3-K is a candidate for mediating uPA-induced VSMC migration. PI3-K phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol, and the phosphorylated lipid products of this enzymatic reaction may act on multiple downstream effectors (12Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PI3-K is composed of two subunits, a regulatory p85 subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The regulatory p85 subunit contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which bind to specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs and have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (14Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The ability of p85 SH2 domains to associate with other proteins links PI3-K to distinct signaling cascades required for control of cell growth and proliferation, adhesion and motility, differentiation, and survival (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports underscore the importance of PI3-K in cell migration (16Vanhaesebroeck B.

In this study, we investigated the extent to which PI3-K and Janus kinases are involved in the uPA-induced cell migration. Our findings demonstrate that in human VSMC, Tyk2, besides activation of Stat proteins in response to uPA, is the main uPA-dependent pathway of PI3-K activation. Tyk2 interacts with PI3-K via the SH2 domains of p85 catalytic subunit that, in turn, leads to p85 tyrosine phosphorylation and to PI3-K activation. The association of both kinases is critical to provide VSMC cytoskeletal reorganization in response to uPA required for cell migration.

The cells were grown in SmGM2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and were used between passages 3 and 6. For uPA stimulation experiments, the cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and were then treated with uPA as described (6Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Human transformed kidney epithelial cells HEK 293 were obtained from Microbix Biosystems (Toronto, Canada). Total RNA from human VSMC was extracted according to the acid phenol extraction protocol (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Full-length wild type Tyk2 cDNA was performed by PCR on two pairs oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GATGCCCGGGTCTGTGCTGAATG; antisense, 5′-CACGGCCAAGAAAGAAAAATAAGT) according to the high fidelity PCR protocol (Roche Diagnostics). The product of the reverse transcription reaction with tRNA was used as a template for PCR, and the PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1TOPO plasmid. The structure of Tyk2 was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant adenovirus DNA for Tyk2 expression was generated by homologous recombination inEscherichia coli BJ5183 essentially as described previously (20Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an HindIII–XbaI fragment of the plasmid pCRIITyk2 encoding wild type human Tyk2 was ligated intoXbaI–HindIII-digested pBKTGCMV. The resulting construct was cleaved with restriction endonucleases PacI and EheI to linearize it and to transform together with the linear adenoviral vector pAD1 in E. coli strain BJ5183. The recombinant adenovirus construct was cleaved with PacI and transfected into the packaging cell line HEK 293 by calcium phosphate precipitation (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The concentration of the recombinant adenovirus was assessed based on the absorbance at 260 nm and on limiting dilution plaque assay (22Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). An expression construct that encodes Tyk2 that is mutated in its active center at residue 3079 (Lys into Glu) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the corresponding recombinant adenovirus was prepared as indicated above. VSMC were grown to 50% confluency and infected for 1 h with recombinant AdTyk2 adenovirus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 500 plaque-forming units/cell. The efficiency of infection was assessed by immunological staining with anti-Tyk2 antibody. Cells were serum-starved overnight 1 day after infection and used for experiments on the second day after infection. Total RNA was prepared from VMSC at the indicated times after Ad5Tyk2 infection after 6 h of serum starvation using standard protocol with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was electrophoresed through an agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a gene-screen plus (DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany), and hybridized with nick-translatedBamHI fragment from Tyk2 cDNA as described (23Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An actin probe was used to confirm equal RNA loading on the gel. Subconfluent and serum-starved VSMC were treated with 1 nm uPA for 5–180 min at 37 °C, lysed, and precleared as described previously (6Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 nmwortmannin for 20 min at 37 °C. For immunoprecipitation, precleared cell lysates containing 800–1000 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4–5 μg of antibody coupled to protein A-agarose. Precipitates were washed in PBS-Tween buffer and were used for PAGE and Western blotting. The blots were developed with the indicated antibodies, and the immune complexes were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Membrane stripping was performed using 200 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 2% SDS for 45 min at 50 °C. For the in vitro phosphorylation assay, 400–800 μg of protein of precleared cell lysates were incubated with 4–5 μg of the indicated antibody coupled to protein A-agarose for 2 h. Precipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The kinase assay was performed in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. Precipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and twice in PBS-Tween buffer. The reaction product was eluted in 150 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 5 mm sodium orthovanadate and then subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of the indicated antibody coupled to protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some experiments, gels containing phosphorylated proteins were soaked in 1 n KOH at 55 °C for 2 h to hydrolyze phosphate on serine and threonine. Precleared cell lysates containing 600–800 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-PI3-K antibody against the p85 regulatory subunit and then precipitated on protein A-agarose. Precipitates were washed once with lysis buffer containing 300 μm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then four times with 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and then subjected to the in vitro kinase reaction in a final volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 mg/mll-α-phosphatidylinositol, 3 mmMgCl2, 15 mm ATP, and 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. Phase separation of lipids was performed in two steps byn-hexane/isopropyl alcohol (26:14) and 2 nKCl/HCl (8:0.25). Phosphorylated lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on aluminum sheets silica gel 60W (Merck, Germany) in chloroform/methanol/H2O/25% ammonium (45:35:7.5:2.8; v/v/v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. GST fusion proteins containing the single C- or N-terminal p85 SH2 domain (GST-p85-C-SH2 and GST-p85-N-SH2) bound to glutathione-agarose beads were used for affinity precipitation. Precleared cell lysates containing 400–800 μg of protein were incubated with 3–4 μg of SH2 domain conjugates for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with PBS-Tween buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted with 2-fold Laemmli sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm glutathione and were used for PAGE and Western blotting. Chemotaxis assay was performed using modified Boyden chambers with polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter membranes, 8-μm pore size, as described (24Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 25,000–30,000 cells in serum-free SmGM2 medium were added to the upper well of the Boyden chamber. uPA was diluted in serum-free SmGM2 and added to the lower well of the Boyden chamber, and migration was allowed for 4 h. When chemotaxis was performed in the presence of the PI 3-K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002, these substances were added to the upper well. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Cell migration was quantified by densitometry, and cell migration in the absence of chemoattractant was taken as 100%. Wounding experiments using confluent VSMC monolayer were performed as described previously (6Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Before wounding, cells were cultured in serum-free SmGM2 medium for 6 h. In migration experiments using PI3-K inhibitors, cells were pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 in serum-free medium for 30 min before wounding, and then inhibitors were added again to the serum-free medium after wounding together with or without uPA. Cell migration was monitored by time lapse imaging using an endoscope (telecam PAL 20210036, Storz, Germany) attached to an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) and acquisition and analysis software (Avid Videoshop, Avid Desktop Software Inc., Microsoft Excel). The wounds were viewed inside an environmental chamber under constant temperature (37 °C) and humidified in 5% CO2 and air (CTI Controller 3700; Zeiss). Microscopic recordings were started immediately after wounding, and then further images were taken every 30 min for 9 h following wounding. Results are the mean number of migrated cells ± S.D. at indicated time points or -fold stimulation of at least five separate experiments. Cells were seeded and cultured on glass coverslips, and wounding was performed as indicated above. Cells were allowed to migrate for 8 h at 37 °C and then treated for different time periods with appropriate inhibitors or stimulators. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Then cells were stained with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium. Immunofluorescent staining for Tyk2 was performed as described previously (6Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Color images were captured using a SensiCam 12-bit CCD camera (PCO Computer Optics, Kelheim, Germany) and acquisition and analysis software (AxioVision and KS 300; Carl Zeiss, Vision, Munich, Germany) running on a Power PC 586/200MMX-64MB (Inteq, Berlin, Germany). Images for Alexa 488 and Cy3 staining were captured digitally and were imported as TIF files into Illustrator for analysis and printing. To address the potential role of PI3-K in uPA-mediated signaling, we first assayed PI3-K activity directly by measuring the levels of the product, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in serum-starved VSMC stimulated with uPA at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1 A, uPA induced a significant increase (up to 3-fold) in PI3-K activity in a time-dependent manner with a sustained PI3-K activation observed after 3 h. The PI3-K-specific inhibitor wortmannin, which binds covalently to the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K and inhibits PI3-K irreversibly at nanomolar concentrations (12Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) completely blocked the uPA-induced stimulation of enzyme activity (Fig. 1 B). To assess a potential contribution of uPA's proteolytic activity to the mechanisms of PI3-K activation, the amino-terminal fragment of uPA, ATF, was used for cell stimulation. ATF provided the same effect (Fig. 1 C), confirming the involvement of proteolytically inactive uPA in signaling events. We also examined the requirement for uPAR upon PI3-K activation. For this purpose, we used soluble recombinant uPAR, which is a known competitor for the uPA- and ATF-uPAR binding. The data presented in Fig. 1 C clearly demonstrate that the pretreatment of VSMC with soluble recombinant uPAR significantly decreased the uPA/ATF-induced PI3-K stimulation (shown for ATF).Figure 1uPA induces PI3-K activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in VSMC. A, VSMC were treated with 1 nm uPA for the indicated times at 37 °C, and the PI3-K assay was performed with subsequent thin layer chromatography and autoradiography visualizing phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3)P) products. B, cells were untreated or treated with uPA for 30 min and/or with wortmannin, as indicated. C, VSMC were stimulated with 1 nm ATF for 45 min in the presence or absence of 20 nm soluble recombinant uPAR. Recombinant soluble uPAR was expressed and purified as described previously (23Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Quantification of the results by densitometry is shown below eachpanel. D, phosphorylation of p85 was assayed in control VSMC and after cell activation with 1 nm uPA byin vitro kinase assay combined with two rounds of immunoprecipitation (IP and re-IP) with anti-p85 polyclonal antibody (Ab), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography before (upper panel) and after (middle panel) KOH treatment. The equal loading of precipitated proteins on the gel was confirmed by immunoblotting (lower panel). WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined PI3-K p85 subunit phosphorylation after uPA stimulation using an in vitro kinase assay combined with two rounds of immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 1 D, upper panel). The results demonstrate that uPA markedly increased phosphorylation of the p85 protein. The band was resistant to alkaline hydrolysis, indicating tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D, middle panel). The equal loading of precipitated material on the gel was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 D, lower panel). To examine the potential link between PI3-K and uPA-mediated Jak/Stat signaling, we first performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Jak antibodies and looked for the p85 subunit of PI3-K in the immunoprecipitates. Proteins that were co-precipitated with Jaks were subjected to in vitro kinase assay as above, and the phosphorylated proteins were reimmunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody. As a control for p85 recovery, both rounds of immunoprecipitation were performed with anti-p85 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, upper panel, one band corresponding to p85 was detected in Tyk2, but not in Jak1, Jak2, or Jak3 immunoprecipitates. The identity of the immunoprecipitated p85 band was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). To verify that antibodies to Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 were behaving appropriately under our experimental conditions, the additional positive controls were performed, confirming that all three kinases might be precipitated from the VSMC lysates (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrate that p85 can directly and constitutively associate with Tyk2 in VSMC. Moreover, Tyk2 immunoprecipitates possessed PI3-K activity, which was enhanced by uPA stimulation (Fig. 2 C). To further characterize this interaction, we overexpressed the wild type Tyk2 in VSMC using adenoviral cell infection. The overexpression enabled us to obtain cell lysates enriched in Tyk2, which is otherwise expressed at a low level in native VSMC. Immunofluorescent staining of control uninfected cells and Ad5Tyk2-VSMC with anti-Tyk2 antibody confirmed the efficiency of cell infection with the recombinant adenovirus under these conditions (Fig. 3 A). Northern and Western blot analysis were further used to confirm the expression of Tyk2 mRNA and protein in VSMC infected with adenovirus and cultured for different time periods. As shown in Fig. 3 B, VSMC infection with Ad5Tyk2 resulted in a dramatic increase in Tyk2 mRNA and protein levels relative to uninfected cells. The Tyk2 protein expression reached a maximum 2 days after infection and decreased within the next 3 days. In further experiments, we therefore used VSMC cultured for 2 days after infection with Ad5Tyk2. To investigate the interaction mechanisms between Tyk2 and p85,in vitro binding experiments were performed. We used two GST fusion proteins containing the single C- and N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the human p85 subunit of PI3-K (GST-p85-C-SH2 and GST-p85-N-SH2) immobilized on the glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were incubated with the lysates of unstimulated and uPA-stimulated Ad5Tyk2-VSMC, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyk2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C, one major band corresponding to Tyk2 was detected in both GST-p85-C-SH2 and GST-p85-N-SH2 precipitates from uPA-stimulated cells. Tyk2 bands identified in unstimulated cells were significantly weaker. These results strongly suggest that Tyk2 directly associates with PI3-K through the binding to both C- and N-terminal SH2 domains of p85 and that this association is uPA-inducible. Recent reports imply that PI3-K is involved in cell migration control (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat.

Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we next examined the possible impact of PI3-K on VSMC migration in response to uPA. For this purpose, two main approaches were used, namely directional VSMC migration in Boyden chambers and cell movement in a wounded VSMC monolayer monitored by time lapse imaging (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 4 A displays the data on directional migration of VSMC along the uPA gradient tested in a microchemotaxis Boyden chamber. After 4 h, cell migration in response to uPA was significantly enhanced about 3-fold, compared with migration in the presence of medium alone. To examine the requirement of PI3-K for uPA-promoted cell migration, VSMC were subjected to migration assays in the presence of two unrelated structurally distinct specific PI3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. Cell treatment with both inhibitors decreased uPA-related cell migration w"
https://openalex.org/W2107994145,"The serine proteinases plasmin and thrombin convert proenzyme matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) into catalytically active forms. In addition, we demonstrate that plasmin(ogen) and thrombin induce a significant increase in secretion of activated murine macrophage elastase (MMP-12) protein. Active serine protease is responsible for induction, as demonstrated by the absence of MMP-12 induction in plasminogen(Plg)-treated urokinase-type plasminogen activator-deficient macrophages. Since increased MMP-12 protein secretion was not accompanied by an increase in MMP-12 mRNA, we examined post-translational mechanisms. Protein synthesis was not required for early release of MMP-12 but was required for later secretion of activated enzyme. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated basal expression in macrophages that increased following serine proteinase exposure. Inhibition of MMP-12 secretion by hirudin and pertussis toxin demonstrated a role for the thrombin G protein-coupled receptor (protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)). PAR-1-activating peptides were able to induce MMP-12 release. Investigation of signal transduction pathways involved in this response demonstrate the requirement for protein kinase C, but not tyrosine kinase, activity. These data demonstrate that plasmin and thrombin regulate MMP-12 activity through distinct mechanisms: post-translational secretion of preformed MMP-12 protein, induction of protein secretion that is protein kinase C-mediated, and extracellular enzyme activation. Most importantly, we show that serine proteinase MMP-12 regulation in macrophages occurs via the protein kinase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor PAR-1. The serine proteinases plasmin and thrombin convert proenzyme matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) into catalytically active forms. In addition, we demonstrate that plasmin(ogen) and thrombin induce a significant increase in secretion of activated murine macrophage elastase (MMP-12) protein. Active serine protease is responsible for induction, as demonstrated by the absence of MMP-12 induction in plasminogen(Plg)-treated urokinase-type plasminogen activator-deficient macrophages. Since increased MMP-12 protein secretion was not accompanied by an increase in MMP-12 mRNA, we examined post-translational mechanisms. Protein synthesis was not required for early release of MMP-12 but was required for later secretion of activated enzyme. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated basal expression in macrophages that increased following serine proteinase exposure. Inhibition of MMP-12 secretion by hirudin and pertussis toxin demonstrated a role for the thrombin G protein-coupled receptor (protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)). PAR-1-activating peptides were able to induce MMP-12 release. Investigation of signal transduction pathways involved in this response demonstrate the requirement for protein kinase C, but not tyrosine kinase, activity. These data demonstrate that plasmin and thrombin regulate MMP-12 activity through distinct mechanisms: post-translational secretion of preformed MMP-12 protein, induction of protein secretion that is protein kinase C-mediated, and extracellular enzyme activation. Most importantly, we show that serine proteinase MMP-12 regulation in macrophages occurs via the protein kinase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor PAR-1. matrix metalloproteinase murine macrophage elastase plasminogen, Thr, thrombin pertussis toxin urokinase-type plasminogen activator tissue-type plasminogen activator protein kinase C phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Serine and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 have important roles in hemostasis and remodeling of extracellular matrices during fibrinolysis and tissue repair. Abnormal regulation of these proteinases may cause tissue destruction. MMPs are typically secreted in zymogen form and require extracellular activation. The serine proteinases plasminogen, plasmin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) have classically been shown to function in fibrinolysis (tPA/uPA/plasmin), cell motility and invasion (uPA/plasmin), and MMP activation. The MMPs are a family of structurally related zinc-containing enzymes that are either secreted or membrane-associated (membrane-type MMPs; MT-1–5 MMPs). As a group, the MMPs are capable of degrading all extracellular matrix components. In addition to fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix degradation, MMPs and serine proteinases can cleave nonmatrix proteins with significant biological ramifications. For example, MMPs and related ADAMs (adisintegrin andmetalloproteinase domain) can cleave and release a variety of active molecules from cell surfaces, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (1Moss M.L.

In addition, both MMPs and serine proteinases generate angiostatin, an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, from plasminogen (3Cornelius L.A. Nehring L.C. Harding E. Bolanowski M. Welgus H.G.

Such redundant activity and interaction of the serine and metalloproteinase families have precedence in previous work. Plasmin cleaves many pro-MMPs, including the gelatinases MMP-2 and -9 (progelatinase A and B) (10Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO. 1997; 9: 2319-2332Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and MMP-12 (macrophage elastase) (11Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Crawley J. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckout Y. Shapiro S.D. Lupu F.

At the cellular level, uPA-generated plasmin controls gelatinase activity in HT1080 cells (10Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P.

Another serine proteinase, thrombin, has also been reported to activate MMPs (progelatinase A, MMP-2) in microvascular endothelial cells (12Zucker S. Conner C. DiMassimo B.I. Ende H. Drews M.

Protease-activated receptor (PAR-1) is a unique cell surface-associated receptor activated by thrombin proteolysis that is characteristically coupled to G protein heterodimers (14Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is also activated by plasmin (15Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver C. Abrams J.A. Hoxie C.

It is a member of the seven-transmembrane domain family that is activated following proteolytic cleavage of its N terminus (16Bernatowicz M.S. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This newly formed N terminus acts as a tethered ligand to activate the receptor. Peptides homologous to this tethered ligand can also activate the receptor but are not as effective as thrombin that cleaves between residues Arg41 and Ser42. Many cell types, including endothelial cells (17Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Sandoval R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol.

Hemostasis. 1998; 24: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) express PAR-1. While the activation of pro-MMPs to their active form by serine proteinases has been previously described, the purpose of this study was to explore other mechanisms of MMP regulation by the serine proteinases plasmin(ogen) and thrombin. Recombinant mouse macrophage elastase (MMP-12, MMP-12) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli to homogeneity as described (20Shapiro S. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli-derived enzyme is spontaneously active, since only its catalytic domain is expressed upon purification. Glu-human plasminogen (Plg), plasmin, cycloheximide, aprotinin, pertussis toxin, hirudin, and genestein were obtained from Sigma. Glu-plasminogen was prepared from fresh frozen plasma by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. Purity is >98% Glu-plasminogen and <2% Lys-plasminogen, as determined by acetic acid/urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thrombin was obtained from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT).d-Phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethylketone 2-HCl, forskolin, calphostin C, and PKC inhibitor H7 were purchased from Calbiochem. PAR-1 (thrombin receptor)-specific peptides were generated (TRAPs; TFLLR-NH2 and TFRIFD-NH2), as was an irrelevant peptide (FLTRL-NH2) at the protein sequencing facility at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). PAR-1-activating peptide sequences are identical to the protein sequence C-terminal to the receptor cleavage site and duplicate the action of thrombin (14Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal monospecific antibody to mouse macrophage elastase was generated in rabbits as described (21Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and used at 1:1000 for Western analysis unless otherwise stated. For immunohistochemistry, the antibody was used at 1:150. A Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used for immunofluorescence at 1:500. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from mice deficient in MMP-12 by targeted mutagenesis (MMP-12 −/−) (129/Sv background) (21Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and their wild-type littermates (MMP-12 +/+). Peritoneal macrophages were also harvested from mice deficient in plasminogen, urokinase plasminogen activator, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Carmeliet, University of Leuven, Leuven, Brussels). Peritoneal macrophages from MMP-12 +/+ and MMP-12 −/− mice were obtained by peritoneal lavage. In some experiments, to increase macrophage yield, mice received a 1-ml intraperitoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate (22Kumar R. Dong Z. Fidler I.J. J. Imunol. 1996; 157: 5104-5111PubMed Google Scholar), and 5 days following injection, peritoneal macrophages were harvested and plated into 24-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 1 × 106 cells/well in 10% fetal calf serum-supplemented DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h of culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were placed in serum-free medium and treated with 20 μg/ml of plasmin(ogen), 10–100 units/ml of thrombin or buffer control in the presence or absence of the serine proteinase inhibitor aprotinin for 48 h. Cell-conditioned media were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis and casein zymography. Cell-conditioned media harvested from buffer control, plasmin(ogen)-treated (20 μg/ml) or thrombin-treated (10–100 units/ml) MMP-12 +/+ and MMP-12 −/− macrophages were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following the addition of 25 μm DTT in protein running buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were transferred to a Nylon membrane and blocked with 5% casein in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG MMP-12-specific antibody (1:1000 dilution) (21Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.

For some experiments, murine macrophages were pretreated with monensin (1 μm) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to treatment with plasminogen (20 μg/ml) or plasmin (20 μg/ml) for 6–48 h. Plasmin(ogen) and thrombin stimulation was also performed following pretreatment with, and in the presence of, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (genestein, herbimycin, orthovanadate) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin). These studies were followed with effectors of cAMP (forskolin), protein kinase C (calphostin C, H7), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PD98059) as outlined in Table I. Pertussis toxin pretreatment was performed overnight. Western analysis for MMP-12 was performed.Table IEffect of inhibition of signal transduction mediators on serine proteinase-induced MMP-12 secretionCompoundTargetInhibitionCompoundTargetInhibitionGenestein (50 μm)Tyrosine kinase−Forskolin (100 μm)cAMP+Herbimycin-A (500 nm)Tyrosine kinase−PD 98059 (50 μm)MEK+Orthovanadate (100 nm)Phosphatase inhibitor−Calphostin C (2 μm)Protein kinase C+Indomethacin (6 μg/ml)Cycloxygenase−WortmanninPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase−H-7 (100 μm)Protein kinase A, C, G− Open table in a new tab Nonreduced conditioned media from Plg- and plasmin- stimulated MMP-12-competent macrophages were subjected to an α-casein 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in ice-cold buffer. The gel was then placed in 2.5% Triton-X in PBS, washed, and incubated in fresh incubation buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 8.2, 0.005 m CaCl2, 0.5 mmZnCl2) for 48 h. The gels were stained with 0.125% Coomassie Blue and then destained with a 5% acetic acid, 10% methanol solution to observe gel lysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured murine peritoneal macrophages by guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and quantified spectrophotometrically. Equivalent amounts of total cellular RNA (5 μg) were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and the RNA was transferred to nylon membranes. Northern blots were probed with random primed, [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragments specific for MMP-12. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed on murine macrophages, following a protocol modified from a procedure previously detailed (25Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13890-13894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, murine macrophages (3 × 108 cells) were plated on four T75 tissue culture flasks in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of plasmin (20 μg/ml) for 12 h. At 12 h, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cell suspension was then sheared three times using a 22-gauge needle. Trypan blue incorporation was used to assure nuclear isolation and the absence of nuclear lysis. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing cytoplasm and membranes was removed. The nuclei were then resuspended in ice-cold transcription buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and nuclei were resuspended in ice-cold transcription buffer, rNTP mix, 200 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. This mixture was incubated 20 min at 30 °C. Nuclei were then spun, supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate/sarkosyl, β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm sodium citrate, 3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation was performed, and the RNA was incubated overnight at −20 °C. The pellet was dried and resuspended in hybridization mixture (50% deionized formamide, 4× SSC, 2× Denhardt's solution, E. coli tRNA, 50 mmNa2PO4, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5), placed on ice, and pulse-spun, and radioactivity was counted. 1 × 107cpm of labeled nascent transcripts from control and treated cells were placed in a fresh tube, heated at 80 °C for 10 min, and then hybridized for 24 h to a previously prepared nitrocellulose membrane slot blotted with 3 μg of MMP-12 cDNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, and Bluescript (pBS) plasmid cDNA. Peritoneal murine macrophages (control and thioglycollate-stimulated) from MMP-12-deficient mice (MMP-12 −/−) and their wild type littermates (MMP-12 +/+), harvested as described, were plated onto two-chambered Lab Tech slides (Nalgen Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 5 × 105 cells/well in 10% fetal calf serum DMEM for 2 h. The macrophages were stimulated with plasmin (20 μg/ml) or thrombin (10 units/ml) in serum-free DMEM overnight and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in PBS four times and incubated with MMP-12 polyclonal antibody (1:150) in 2% fish gelatin (Sigma) in PBS or irrelevant rabbit serum (Vecta Labs, Burlingame, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS four times, incubated with a Cy3-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500 in 2% fish gelatin in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature, washed in PBS four times, and coverslipped. The slides were examined under a Nikon confocal microscope equipped with fluorescent filters under a × 60 oil immersion lens and analyzed with Laser Sharp 2000 (Bio-Rad). Murine peritoneal macrophages were harvested from MMP-12-competent mice and incubated with Plg (20 μg/ml) (Sigma) in the presence or absence of aprotinin (Sigma) for 48 h. Western analysis of the macrophage-conditioned media for MMP-12 demonstrated small amounts of pro-MMP-12 at 54 kDa in control macrophages and the generation of active MMP-12 (29 kDa) in the Plg-stimulated MMP-12 +/+ macrophages (Fig. 1 A). Active MMP-12 was not, however, secreted by the Plg-stimulated MMP-12 +/+ macrophages in the presence of aprotinin, demonstrating dependence upon serine proteinase activity. Peritoneal murine macrophages were stimulated with plasmin (Sigma) (20 μg/ml), 48-h conditioned medium was collected, and Western analysis for MMP-12 was performed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment with either Plg or plasmin resulted in increased MMP-12 release and activation to a 29-kDa form. Densitometry of autoradiographs (n = 4) demonstrated a 2.5–3.6-fold increase in secreted protein over control levels (p < 0.05 for plasmin) (Fig. 1 C). Casein zymography confirmed the 29-kDa band seen on Western in addition to the typical 22-kDa fully processed form (Fig. 1 D). We presume that the 29-kDa form represents an active enzyme with an N-terminal AA sequence at the beginning of the catalytic domain extending through part of the C-terminal domain as described previously (23Shapiro S.D. Griffin G.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Welgus H.G. Senior R.M. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4664-4671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion on zymography probably is a function of continual processing of the C-terminal domain while running through the gel. Control macrophage-conditioned media produced a minimal lysis at 22 kDa, and Plg-treated MMP-12 −/− macrophages did not produce lytic bands at any molecular weight (data not shown). To further investigate the role of plasmin(ogen) in MMP-12 production, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were harvested from serine proteinase uPA-deficient mice (uPA −/−) and mice deficient in Plg (Plg −/−) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA −/−). The macrophages were plated on tissue culture plastic and incubated in the presence of Plg (20 μg/ml) or plasmin (20 μg/ml), and Western blot analysis for MMP-12 was performed (Fig. 2). Increased amounts of activated MMP-12 (29 kDa, arrow) were produced following both Plg and plasmin stimulation in wild-type, Plg −/−, and tPA −/− macrophages. Interestingly, increased MMP-12 secretion and activation was observed in the uPA −/− macrophages in response to plasmin but not Plg. This suggests that the active serine proteinase plasmin, which is generated from plasminogen via uPA, is required for the secretion and activation of MMP-12 in murine macrophages. Although equal numbers of macrophages were plated from wild-type and each serine proteinase-deficient animal, Plg −/− macrophages produced lesser amounts of constitutive pro-MMP-12 and less activated MMP-12 following Plg and plasmin stimulation. This was seen in repeat experiments. We then explored plasmin-mediated secretion of MMP-12 at varying time points (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). As demonstrated in Fig. 3, MMP-12 protein secretion increases over time, without a coincident increase in pro-MMP-12. This further demonstrates a true increase in secretion and activation of MMP-12, as opposed to sole activation of proenzyme. Although the activation of MMP-12 by plasmin(ogen) has previously been described (11Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Crawley J. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckout Y. Shapiro S.D. Lupu F. Collen D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), we demonstrated an increase in total MMP-12 protein by Western analysis in the Plg- and plasmin-stimulated macrophages compared with control. Therefore, we investigated MMP-12 mRNA levels by Northern analysis following stimulation with Plg and plasmin. There was no change in MMP-12 mRNA levels at 12 h (data not shown) or at 24 h in the presence of Plg or plasmin (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, nuclear run-on assays did not demonstrate Plg or plasmin induction of MMP-12 transcription (Fig. 4 B). To determine if plasmin promotes an active secretion of basally expressed MMP-12 protein, macrophages were pretreated with either monensin (1 μm) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) 1 h prior to plasmin or plasminogen treatment. As demonstrated by Western analysis of conditioned media, monensin pretreatment blocked secretion of pro-MMP-12 (54 kDa) in control macrophages and both pro- and activated (29 kDa) MMP-12 in Plg- and plasmin-treated cells (Fig. 5 A), demonstrating active secretion of protein. Pretreatment with cycloheximide limited the amount of activated MMP-12 secreted in Plg-treated macrophages, and this amount remained constant (Fig. 5 B), indicating that active protein synthesis is required for the robust induction of secretion seen at later time points (24 and 48 h; Figs. 1 and 3). The slower initial induction of secretion in plasminogen-treated (12–18 h; Fig. 5 B) compared with plasmin-treated (6–12 h; Fig. 3) macrophages may be reflective of the time required for the macrophage-mediated generation of effective amounts of plasmin from the parent protein plasminogen. Compared with control, monensin- and cycloheximide-treated cells showed no evidence of cell damage as examined by inverted microscopy (data not shown). Control and plasmin-stimulated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and their cell-conditioned media that were examined at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h for MMP-12 secretion by Western analysis (Fig. 3) were also examined by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy for MMP-12 protein expression. Non-thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were examined at 24 h following plasmin stimulation. Western analysis of conditioned media from plasmin-treated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages demonstrated a progressive increase in the active form of MMP-12 (29 kDa) as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Corresponding immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of control macrophages at 24 h (Fig. 6, upper left panel) demonstrated a positive signal for MMP-12 in a cytoplasmic pattern (red signal demonstrates positive staining for MMP-12 protein; laser reflectance of cell morphology depicted in green). Following plasmin treatment, the MMP-12 signal increased in intensity as early as 12 h following treatment and was intense by 24 h (Fig. 6, lower left panel). Additionally, in the plasmin-treated cells, positive staining for MMP-12 accumulated within the extracellular matrix at 24 h (Fig. 6, asterisk, lower left panel). This was not seen in untreated cells or in cell-free plasmin- or plasminogen-containing tissue culture wells that were similarly examined (data not shown). This demonstration of extracellular MMP-12 is suggestive of macrophage “footprinting,” where membrane and cytosol fragments, possibly containing enzyme, are left behind following cell migration. In the continued presence of plasmin, increased MMP-12 protein expression was demonstrated at both 48 h (Fig. 6, lower right panel) and 72 h when compared with control, untreated cells (Fig. 6,lower right panel, inset). To determine that MMP-12 protein was truly constitutively expressed, we examined peritoneal macrophages from non-thioglycollate-treated mice. In fact, staining for MMP-12 protein was demonstrated in a cytoplasmic pattern in control cells (data not shown). Similarly examined serine proteinase thrombin-stimulated macrophages at 24 h (Fig. 7, shown without green signal laser reflectance) demonstrated a significantly increased signal for MMP-12 in the cytoplasm (arrow, right panel) compared with control, constitutive MMP-12 expression (arrow, left panel). As in plasmin-treated cells at 24 h, extracellular expression of MMP-12 was again seen following thrombin treatment (asterisk,right panel). We therefore further explored the serine proteinase thrombin, due to its well characterized signal transduction mechanism and its effect on of MMP-12 secretion. Western analysis of conditioned media from thrombin-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages shows that thrombin also induces MMP-12 secretion and activation (Fig. 8 A), consistent with our findings by confocal microscopy. Thrombin and plasmin are capable of activating the thrombin G protein-coupled receptor, proteinase activator receptor-1 (PAR-1). To determine if induction of MMP-12 was occurring through thrombin receptor activation, we attempted to block thrombin activity by preincubating thrombin with hirudin (Sigma) prior to exposure to macrophages. Hirudin, a leech-derived Thr-specific inhibitor, neutralizes the activity of thrombin by binding to its anion site, blocking receptor activation. On Western blot analysis, hirudin inhibited the thrombin-induced secretion of activated MMP-12 protein (Fig. 8 A). In addition, the PAR-1-binding but proteolytically inactive Thr-d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethylketone 2 HCl complex, totally inhibited Thr induction (data not shown) and suggests that the serine proteinase proteolytic activity of Thr is important for inducing MMP-12. To confirm that Thr was acting through activation of PAR-1 to induce MMP-12 protein, PAR-1 (thrombin receptor)-specific peptides were generated (TRAPs; TFLLR-NH2 and"

Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulatedphosphoprotein) proteins play an important role in actin and filament dynamics, whereas members of the semaphorin protein family are guidance signals in embryo- and organogenesis. Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP.

Besides several other protein families, the semaphorins function in this respect as guidance cues to growth cones of navigating axons (1Strittmatter S.M.

The Sema1a protein identified as the first member of the semaphorin family and formerly known as G-SemaI/FasIV was isolated some years ago in a screen for glycoproteins active in axon guidance processes in the American grasshopper Schistocerca americana (5Kolodkin A.L.

It exhibited a repulsive and in later experiments also an attractive activity on certain populations of outgrowing pioneer axons in the grasshopper limb bud (6Wong J.T.W. Wong S.T.M. O'Connor T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, Sema3A/Sema3A was isolated only shortly thereafter, prepared from a soluble fraction of embryonic chicken brain. The purified Sema3A/SEMA3A contained an activity capable of collapsing the growth cones of outgrowing dorsal root ganglia (7Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of these two proteins from such distantly related species as invertebrates and vertebrates identified the semaphorins as a new gene family active in neural and organ development (8Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1997; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Today the semaphorins represent a large family (>25 genes) of secreted and transmembranous glycoproteins defined by a common semaphorin domain of 500 amino acids (aa),1currently represented in eight different subclasses (subclasses 1–7 and V) (8Kolodkin A.L.

Only recently, members of the semaphorin gene family have also been implicated in neuronal apoptosis and cell death signaling (10Gagliardini V. Fankhauser F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Shirvan A. Ziv I. Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z.G. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Semaphorins as mediators of neuronal apoptosis.J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both processes, axon outgrowth during embryogenesis and cell degradation/elimination during programmed cell death, are characterized by a drastic remodeling of cytoskeletal elements. Unfortunately, proteins that link signals from the cell surface to the filament assembly-regulating machinery during semaphorin-mediated axon guidance processes are currently unknown. A general role in filament dynamics control and actin-based motility is played by the proline-rich proteins of the Ena/VASP family (12Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Enabled (ena) was identified as a genetic suppressor of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (abl) inDrosophila, whereas VASP (vasodilator-stimulatedphosphoprotein) was identified as a target for cyclic AMP and GMP-dependent protein kinases and through its involvement in the motility of the intracellular bacteriaListeria monocytogenes (13Gertler F.B. Doctor J.S. Hoffmann F.M. Science. 1990; 248: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Halbrugge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbacher P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these discoveries, based on functional approaches, the mammalian Ena homolog Mena (mammalian Ena) and the EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein) protein were identified by their sequence similarity to Ena and VASP (12Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Proteins of the Ena/VASP family share a strictly conserved domain structure that consists of the amino-terminal EVH-1 (Ena-VASP homology), the carboxyl-terminal EVH-2 domain, and a proline-rich core domain. These domains are additionally discriminated by their broad functional diversity. The amino-terminal EVH-1 domain is involved in subcellular distribution and is capable of binding to a target domain displaying the motif (D/E)FPPPPX(D/E) (15Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This target domain is found in the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and zyxin and also in the surface protein ActA of Listeria, where it is critically involved in the intracellular motility of these bacteria via the recruitment of the host cell VASP proteins to the bacterial surface (16Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E. Gertler F.B. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the carboxyl-terminal EVH-2 domain can directly bind to F-actin and plays a crucial role in multimerization of Ena/VASP proteins (17Carl U.D. Pollmann M. Orr E. Gertler F.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, the proline-rich core of Ena/VASP directly binds the G-actin-associated protein profilin as well as the Src homology 3 domains of the Abelson and Src kinases (17Carl U.D. Pollmann M. Orr E. Gertler F.B. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Aromatic and basic residues within the EVH1 domain of VASP specify its interaction with proline-rich ligands.Curr.

Therefore, Ena/VASP proteins function as a key element in the targeting of the filament synthesis machinery to areas of aggregation/concentration at cell sites associated with motility, growth, and adhesion such as focal adhesion points and lamellipodia. Here we describe the new human and murine semaphorin 6 variants SEMA6A-1 and Sema6A-1 that bind to the Ena/VASP-like protein EVL. Interaction of these proteins results in the recruitment and localization of EVL to submembranous SEMA6A-1 structures of transfected cells. Our findings suggest that the newly identified semaphorin 6 variants play an important role in retrograde signaling to cytoskeletal elements controlling proteins like Ena/VASP. Total RNA was prepared from tissues or cultured cells by the TRIzol procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA with the poly(A)-Tract system (Promega). cDNA was generated from total RNA of human SK-N-MC cells using the Superscript preamplification kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using primers matching the Sema6A (GenBankTM accession number AF030430) sequence (base pairs 307–327 and 506–526). Primers were as follows: 5′-primer, GACGTAGACACATGCAGGATG; 3′-primer, GAGCGATGTTGGCATGTTTGG. PCR conditions were the following: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 45 s with a thermal cycler (MJ Research). PCR products were subcloned into pBSIIKS(−), sequenced by a commercial service, and verified. A fragment that exhibited a 90% identity to Sema6A was used to screen a SK-N-MC-λZAP Express library, which was generated from 2 μg of mRNA (Stratagene). In total, four full-length SEMA6A-1 clones could be isolated. For 3′-RACE analysis, cDNA was generated from mouse total brain RNA using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Subsequent PCRs were performed with the Advantage 2 polymerase (CLONTECH), and products were ligated into pBSIIKS(−) and sequenced. Genomic sequence encoding missing fragments of the sema6A-1 gene were amplified usingTaq polymerase (Sigma) and human genomic DNA as template purified with the Genomic Tips System (Qiagen) from human SK-N-MC cells. Primers were designed based on the available genomic DNA sequence data (AC008524, AC010233.3, AC010296.2, and AC010497.3). Sequencing was performed by a commercial service. Assembling of contigs and sequence fragments was done using the DNAStar software (Lasergene) and the HUSAR software (DKFZ, Heidelberg). For in situ hybridization, riboprobes corresponding to sequence positions aa 55–289 (0.7-kb more internal probe) or aa 869–1030 (0.5-kb C-terminal probe) were used. Circular plasmids were linearized, and riboprobes were synthesized with T3 polymerase. Expression patterns were the same for both probes, and sense controls gave no detectable signals. In situhybridization experiments were performed as described previously (20Marsicano G. Lutz B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4213-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Human fetal and adult tissue blots were purchased from CLONTECH. A DNA fragment corresponding to aa 869–1030 of SEMA6A-1 was randomly labeled in a total volume of 20 μl using Klenow enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed with the Easy Hyb solution (CLONTECH). For control hybridizations, a β-actin probe purchased fromCLONTECH was used. AXbaI/ScaI fragment corresponding to aa 99–1030 was subcloned into the pFLAGCMV-1 vector (Sigma), which fuses an N-terminal FLAG tag to the protein that allows rapid detection of the fusion protein with the monoclonal α-FLAG antibody. Site I and site II mutations of SEMA6A-1 were generated with the PCR overlap procedure, and resulting products were subcloned into the pFLAG-SEMA6A-1 construct (22Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Flanking primers were the following: 5′-primer, CTGGGTCCCCCGGGAGCCTCCCTGTCTCAG; 3′-primer, CTGCCGCAGCGCTTCTTGGTCTGGTGGGTA. Site I primers were as follows: 5′-primer, AGGGGAGCCAACGCGGCGGCCGCCCCGCAGAGG; 3′-primer, CGGGGCGGCCGCCGCGTTGGCTCCCCTGCCAAA. Site II primers were as follows: 5′-primer, AAGCCGGCCGTAGCCGCCAAAGCATCCTTTGCTCCC; 3′-primer, AAAGGATGCTTTGGCGGCTACGGCCGGCTTTAGCGA. ΔCyt-2 was constructed by deleting the SmaI/XhoI fragment, which corresponds to the Cyt-2 terminal domain from the pFLAG-SEMA6A-1 construct, and religation of the remaining plasmid after a fill-in reaction for the overlapping DNA ends using Klenow enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For verification, all mutant sites were sequenced. Proteins were separated by conventional vertical gel electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For Western blot analysis, a monoclonal α-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 1:4000, α-EVL and α-Mena were used at 1:5000, and α-VASP (Alexis Corp.) was used at 1:4000. Detection of stained proteins was performed with α-mouse or α-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by a commercial service (Eurogentec, Belgium) with peptides corresponding to aa 876–889. The crude sera were used unpurified for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent stainings. For detection of proteins in cells, indirect immunofluorescent staining was carried out. Cells were transfected with pFLAG-SEMA6A-1 or pFLAG-SEMA6A-1 mutants using the superfect procedure (Qiagen), grown for 2 days after transfection on fibronectin (Sigma)-coated slides, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline. Used antibodies were α-SEMA6A-1 (1:500), α-FLAG (10 μg/ml) (Sigma), α-EVL (1:500), and α-Mena (1:500). Detection of proteins was performed using α-rabbit and α-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine. Cells transfected with pFLAG-SEMA6A-1, pFLAG-CMV1, or pFLAG-SEMA6A-1-mutants (site I, site II, ΔCyt-2) were solubilized in ice-cold extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 140 mm, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (23Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Extracts were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose suspension (Sigma) for immunoprecipitation or nickel beads (Qiagen) for nickel bead pull-down assays. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies (α-EVL, α-Mena, α-VASP) were added, and incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose suspension (75 μl) (Sigma) was added, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in extraction buffer containing Triton X-100. Subsequently, the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In nickel bead pull-down assays, purified EVL(His)6 (1 μg/ml) was added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein complexes were pelleted through the addition of nickel beads (50 μl) and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected and washed as described above. Probes were subsequently separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted, and analyzed as described above. In an attempt to identify and isolate repulsive guidance cues that are involved in degenerative processes such as neuronal apoptosis, we isolated cDNAs from a human cDNA library and a mouse RACE cDNA pool that encode the two new semaphorin 6 variants (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1, respectively. 2F. Gertler, unpublished results. The open reading frames encode proteins of 1030 and 1005 aa with calculated molecular masses of 112.2 and 114.4 kDa. Both proteins are closely related to the murine semaphorin 6A (Sema6A), a protein known to repel embryonic sympathetic axons (Fig. 1 A) (24Zhou L.J. White F.A. Lentz S.I. Wright D.E. Fisher D.A. Snider W.D. Cloning and expression of a novel murine semaphorin with structural similarity to insect semaphorin I..Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 26-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Xu X.-M. Fisher D.A. Zhou L. White F.A. Ng S. Snider W.D. Luo Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2638-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted proteins SEMA6A-1 and Sema6A-1 were 142 and 127 aa longer when compared with the already known Sema6A. This is due to an additional peptide stretch within their cytoplasmic domain, which was to date unknown for members of the semaphorin protein family. Within the region of overlap, the proteins share 93% identity/95% similarity to Sema6A and 39–62% homology to the other class 6 semaphorins (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether these newly identified variants result from alternative splicing, we performed BLAST data base searches on human genomic sequences. Here, we identified four working drafts (AC008524, AC010233.3, AC010296.2, and AC010497.2) of the human chromosome 5 and a mapped genomic survey sequence (AB002453) that localizes the human sema6A-1 gene to the disease locus 5q21–22, which is known to be deleted in certain forms of lung cancer (26Ueno K. Kumagai T. Kijima T. Kishimoto T. Hosoe S. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Gaps between genomic sequences containing segments of identity to SEMA6A-1 were amplified by PCR on human genomic DNA, sequenced, and analyzed. Thus, the assembled human genesema6A-1 consists of 20 exons, including two untranslated exons, covering roughly 60 kb of genomic sequence on chromosome 5. The genomic structure gives no evidence for the existence of a shorter Sema6A-like human variant indicative of alternative splicing (Fig. 1 A). In addition, we performed 3′-RACE analysis on human cDNA and were unable to amplify 3′-endings corresponding to the previously described Sema6A sequence. Finally,in situ hybridization with 3′-terminal Sema6A-specific probes (base pairs 2721–2770, accession number AF030430) on murine adult and embryonic tissues did not exhibit any specific signal (Data not shown). An in depth analysis of the cytoplasmic tail uncovered that the SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 cytoplasmic domains can be subdivided into two peptide stretches named herein Cyt-1 and Cyt-2, respectively. Both domains contain no obvious signaling motifs. While Cyt-1 shares a degree of homology to the cytoplasmic domains of other semaphorin 6 proteins ranging from 25 to 35%, Cyt-2 displays no homology to any known semaphorin. Surprisingly, Cyt-2 exhibits a small region of homology (33% identity/49% similarity) to zyxin, a proline-rich protein that is present at focal adhesion points and that is directly involved in the regulation of filament dynamics via binding to Ena/VASP proteins (27Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt S.M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K.-H. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 147: 1549-1560Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 expression is consistent with a role as a guidance signal or regulatory element during development and regeneration/degeneration in embryonic and adult tissues, we examined the sites of expression by RNA in situhybridization (Sema6A-1) and Northern blotting (SEMA6A-1). Northern blot analysis with the carboxyl-terminal SEMA6A-1-specific probe (aa 869–1030) indicated that two major SEMA6A-1 transcripts of equal intensity and of 5 and 7 kb in length are present in human embryonic and adult tissues (Fig. 2, Aand B). The highest expression levels of SEMA6A-1 were detected in human embryonic brain and kidney, whereas only low to moderate expression was seen in developing lung and liver. Only small amounts of SEMA6A-1 transcripts were detected in human adult tissues with the exception of rather strong expression levels in the highly regenerative placental tissues (Fig. 2 B). Employing oligonucleotides representing C-terminal sequences of the previously described shorter Sema6A, we were not able to detect any mRNA transcript in multiple tissue murine Northern blots. These experiments, RACE, in situ hybridizations, and Northern blotting, indicate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is not the result of alternative splicing of the putative Sema6A gene. In situ hybridizations revealed that Sema6A-1 displays a complex expression pattern in the mouse embryo. Neural embryonic tissues displayed high levels of Sema6A-1 mRNA expression in proliferating zones, in the diencephalon, retina, in dorsal root ganglia, and also in the trigeminal ganglion (Fig. 3, A and B). Remarkably, in particular areas of differentiation such as the diencephalon, expression persists into adulthood (Fig. 3, Cand D). A more regionalized expression of Sema6A-1 was seen in coronal and sagittal sections from adult mouse brain (Fig. 3,C–I). Most prominently, high levels were observed in the olfactory system including piriform cortex, in basically all of the thalamic nuclei except the paraventricular nucleus and intermediodorsal nucleus, in hypothalamus, in amygdala, and in layers IV and VI of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 3, D–F). Sema6A-1 is also present in corpus callosum and in anterior commissure (not shown); thus, also glial cells express Sema6A-1 mRNA (Fig. 3 G). In the cerebellum, all granule cells are positive, with an enhanced expression in the flocculus, and also in the brain stem, various motor nuclei highly express Sema6A-1, e.g. facial, trigeminal (not shown), and vagus nuclei (Fig. 3, H and I). We also screened various developmental stages of the mouse embryo with an oligonucleotide probe representing C-terminal sequences of the Sema6A cDNA but were not able to detect any signal above background (data not shown). The identification of a zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain raised the question of whether SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 could also bind to members of the Ena/VASP protein family. Given this, SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 could, therefore, be directly involved in actin dynamics via the Ena/VASP cascade. Binding of zyxin and other proteins to the EVH1 domain of Ena/VASP proteins occurs via a peptide stretch that displays the conserved sequence motif DFPPPP (15Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M.

Protein sequence analysis revealed that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 exhibits next to the region of homology to zyxin two modified sites of this sequence that may mediate binding to Ena/VASP (site I, DNPPPAP (aa 858–964); site II, DVPPKP (aa 1010–1015)). In order to address the question of whether SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 may be involved in mediating extracellular signals to members of the Ena/VASP protein family, we constructed an amino-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged SEMA6A-1 (FLAG-SEMA6A-1). Immunoblotting of FLAG-SEMA6A-1 expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) detected a major protein band of 125 kDa in size, which closely corresponds to the predicted protein size (Fig. 4, lane 2). Protein samples separated without β-mercaptoethanol showed that SEMA6A-1 forms dimeric complexes, a feature commonly observed for semaphorins (Fig. 4, lane 3) (31Klostermann A. Lohrum M. Adams R.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15708-15713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Higher molecular weight complexes that were also detected may be due to an artificial aggregation of these proteins, a phenomenon frequently observed for transmembranous proteins. Expression in human HEK293 followed by immunofluorescent analysis using α-FLAG and α-SEMA6A-1 revealed that the expression product of FLAG-SEMA6A-1 is localized at the cell surface (Fig. 5,A1 and A2). The analysis of the confocal images furthermore demonstrated the high specificity of the crude rabbit sera (Fig. 5 A3). Immunofluorescent analysis of transfected HEK293 and mouse hippocampal HT22 cells using α-FLAG/α-Mena (in HEK293) or α-FLAG/α-EVL (in HT22) double stains clearly revealed that SEMA6A-1 colocalizes with EVL (Fig. 5, B2 and B3) and Mena (Fig. 5, C2 and C3), members of the Ena/VASP family, further indicating a possible interaction between these proteins.Figure 5Overexpression of FLAG-SEMA6A-1 in transfected cells uncovered colocalization with EVL and Mena.Indirect immunofluorescence of pFLAG-SEMA6A-1-transfected cells using the FLAG antibody (A1) and the SEMA6–1/Sema6A-1 specific antibody (A2) revealed a membranous localization of SEMA6A-1. Overlapping regions of detected SEMA6A-1 stainings of these two antibodies are indicated by the yellow color in the merged image (A3). Double immunofluorescent stainings using antibodies against EVL (B2) and the FLAG epitope (B3) or Mena (C2) and FLAG epitope (C3) demonstrated the expression of these proteins in overlapping regions, clearly indicating a colocalization and co-action. B1and C1 show phase contrast micrographs for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Employing antibodies specific for Mena, VASP, and EVL, we tried to co-immunoprecipitate SEMA6A-1 from Triton X-100 extracts of transfected HEK293 and HT22 cells to prove a direct interaction of SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 and Ena/VASP proteins. Western blot analysis of the precipitated protein complexes revealed that the FLAG-SEMA6A-1 protein co-immunoprecipitates with EVL but neither with Mena nor with VASP (Fig. 6, A–C). In a second experiment, we supplemented Triton X-100 extracts of untransfected HT22 cells with purified native FLAG-SEMA6A-1 protein followed by α-EVL co-immunoprecipitation of the protein complexes. Subsequent Western blot analysis again revealed that SEMA6A-1 coprecipitates with the EVL protein (Fig. 6 A). To confirm this molecular interaction and to identify the binding motif within the SEMA6A-1 sequence, we mutated all proline and aspartic acid residues within the two peptide stretches of site I and site II to uncharged alanine residues in both sites, resulting in the constructs FLAG-SEMA6A-1-mut-I (site-I; DNPPPAP mutated to ANAAAAA) and FLAG-SEMA6A-1-mut-II (site-II; DVPPKP mutated to AVAAKA). In addition, we generated a deletion construct lacking the complete Cyt-2 domain (FLAG-SEMA6A-1ΔCyt-2). Extracts of SEMA6A-1-mutant-transfected cells were combined with purified His-tagged EVL protein, and protein complexes were precipitated with nickel beads. These pull-down assays revealed that the sequence DVPPKP is responsible and sufficient for binding of FLAG-SEMA6A-1 to EVL, since precipitation was not possible with the FLAG-SEMA6A-1-mut-II or the FLAG-SEMA6A-1ΔCyt-2 constructs, whereas precipitation was not altered with the FLAG-SEMA6A-1-mut-I construct. These data derived from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down assays confirm a direct interaction of SEMA6A-1 and EVL as already indicated by the colocalization of these proteins.

However, molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of COX-2 are not well understood. In this report, we describe a unique post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of COX-2 mRNA stabilization in MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly metastatic cell line derived from a human mammary tumor. High levels of COX-2 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity were induced by serum withdrawal, which were potently inhibited by the addition of serum or >100-kDa serum factor. Nuclear run-on analysis and actinomycin D chase experiments indicate that regulation is primarily at the level of post-transcriptional mRNA stability. Interestingly, SB203580, an inhibitor of the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and overexpression of the dominant-negative p38α construct potently inhibited the serum withdrawal-induced COX-2 mRNA levels. Indeed, the half-life of COX-2 mRNA decreased from 9 to 4.5 h after SB203580 treatment, suggesting that signal transduction by the p38 SAPK pathway is required for COX-2 mRNA stability.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The transcription of the COX-2 gene is induced by various extracellular stimuli, which regulate intracellular signal transduction pathways that in turn modulate the activity of the transcription factors and hence regulate the COX-2 promoter (13Herschman H.R. Reddy S.T. Xie W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the cAMP-response element, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (NF-IL6), and NFκB responsive elements were shown to be important (13Herschman H.R. Reddy S.T. Xie W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional induction, stabilization of the COX-2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level is necessary to achieve maximal induction (14Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J.

Biophys. 1993; 306: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppression of the COX-2 mRNA by anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone involves the destabilization of the COX-2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level (16Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization/destabilization mechanisms are very poorly understood. To facilitate this, various studies have characterized the structure and regulation of COX-2 mRNA isoforms. The COX-2 mRNA is composed of two molecular species (4.6- and 2.8-kb isoforms), which are derived by alternative polyadenylation (17Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Multiple copies of the AUUUA mRNA instability motif are present in the 3′-untranslated region of the COX-2 mRNA isoforms (17Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that COX-2 mRNA stability is regulated by cytokines such as IL-1 and transforming growth factor β and that activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) signal transduction pathways is required (19Ridley S.H. Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol.

The COX-2 gene is overexpressed in a variety of neoplastic diseases such as colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, lung, breast, and skin cancer (22Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A.

The fact that intestinal polyp formation is regulated by COX-2 gene dosage (11Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M.

Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that COX-2 overexpression is an important factor in tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms of COX-2 expression and function in tumorigenesis are under intensive investigation. An important issue is the delineation of molecular mechanisms that allow enhanced COX-2 overexpression in tumors. A recent study has shown that the COX-2 gene is overexpressed in human breast cancer cells (23Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, enhanced synthesis of PGE2, a major product of COX-2, was observed in human breast cancer as well as in experimental murine mammary tumor tissues (24Schrey M.P. Patel K.V. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Tan W.C. Privett O.S. Goldyne M.E. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 3229-3231PubMed Google Scholar). It also has been shown that highly metastatic and estrogen-independent tumors secrete high levels of PGE2(24Schrey M.P. Patel K.V. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Rolland P.H. Martin P.M. Jacquemier J. Rolland A. Toga M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1980; 64: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Liu and Rose (27Liu X.H. Rose D.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5125-5127PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a highly invasive, metastatic, and estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, expressed high levels of COX-2 in a constitutive manner, whereas non-metastatic, less invasive, and estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells expressed low levels of COX-2. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of COX-2 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data indicate that constitutive overexpression of COX-2 by serum withdrawal in MDA-MB-231 cells is achieved by regulation at the post-transcriptional level of mRNA stabilization. Interestingly, the p38 SAPK pathway appears to be required for COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Furthermore, a novel serum factor appears to antagonize the serum withdrawal-induced mRNA stabilization of COX-2. The human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) and MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 1% antimycotic-antibiotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.). All other cell lines, glioblastoma cell lines (U-118 and U-373), melanoma cell lines (M21 and SK-Mel-2), lung carcinoma cells (A-549), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435, BT-474), prostate cancer cells (DU-145, LNCap, PC-3), colon carcinoma cells (HT-29, HCT-116, Caco-2, DLD-1), endometrial carcinoma cells (AN3CA), and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080), were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. Stable transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells was done with the flag-tagged p38α dominant-negative expression construct (pCDNA3-flag-P38α) (kindly provided by Dr. S. Huang, the Scripps Research Institute) or vector using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable clones were selected in the culture medium containing 2.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Sigma). Cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 24 h and then incubated in medium containing 10% or 0% FBS for additional 48 h. Cells were also incubated in the presence or absence of PMA, a known activator of COX-2 expression; PD98059, the ERK-1/2 kinase (MEK-1/2) inhibitor; or SB203580, the p38 SAPK inhibitor. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF, lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNA3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1×)) for phospho-MAPK immunoblotting or lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1×)) for COX-2, β-actin, and flag immunoblotting. Lysed cells were collected by scraping and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were resolved by 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for phospho-ERK-1/2 or phospho-MAPKAPK2 (p-MK2) immunoblotting or 5% nonfat dry milk for COX-2, β-actin, and flag immunoblotting in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, the membrane was incubated with anti-phospho-ERK-1/2, anti-phospho-MAPKAPK2 (39Hannigan M. Zhan L. Ai Y. Huang C.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1998; 46: 55-58Google Scholar), anti-COX-2 (29Creminon C. Habib A. Maclouf J. Pradelles P. Grassi J. Frobert Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), anti-β-actin (Sigma), or anti-flag (Kodak) antibody. The membrane was further incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and developed in the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PGE2 release in the culture medium by cells stimulated for 15 min with 30 μm of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) was used as an indication of COX-2 enzyme activity. PGE2 was determined by radioimmunoassay utilizing the method described by Mitchell et al. (30Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Other AA metabolites were also assayed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Cells were incubated with 12.5 μm[14C]AA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in serum-free medium. After 15 min at 37 °C, the conditioned medium was collected and acidified with 1 m HCl, then subjected to lipid extraction with 6 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separation on silica-G TLC plates in the solvent system Iw as described (31Bailey J.M. Muza B. Hla T. Salata K. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 54-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC plates were analyzed using a low energy phosphor screen/PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). All eicosanoid standards were purchased from Cayman Inc. Radioactive eicosanoid bands were compared with cold standards visualized by staining with phosphomolybdic acid. Pulse labeling with BrdUrd was conducted in glass-bottom dishes using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals labeling and detection kit, with the modifications described previously (32Trifan O.C. Smith R.M. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34141-34147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The nuclei of cells were visualized by staining for 5 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Cells with fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. BrdUrd-positive and apoptotic cells cultured in the presence or absence of serum were counted and expressed as percentage of the total number of cells. Cells grown on glass coverslips for 48 h in the presence or absence of serum were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS (3×), cells were incubated with an anti-COX-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS (3×), cells were further incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS (3×), coverslips were mounted on a glass-slide with 50% glycerol in PBS and analyzed by a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. Total RNA was isolated with the RNA-STAT60 reagent (Tel-test) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel containing 4% (v/v) of formaldehyde and the integrity of the RNA was monitored by ethidium bromide staining. RNA was transferred via capillary onto Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) and UV cross-linked by Stratalinker (Stratagene). The human COX-2 (1.6 kb) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 0.6 kb) insert were radioactively labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random primer labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membranes were hybridized and washed by the protocol of Church-Gilbert (33Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography or PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The bands were quantified using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics). MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 10% or 0% FBS for 48 h and stimulated with 10 nm of PMA for 4 h. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were isolated, and nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed as described by Greenberg and Ziff (34Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), after which RNA was extracted as described by Celano et al. (35Celano P. Berchtold C. Casero Jr., R.A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled, nuclear RNA samples were purified and then hybridized to the COX-1 and COX-2 probe, pCDNAneo, and total cDNA library from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which were immobilized on Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then washed, dried, and visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Briefly, FBS was sequentially separated through a series of Centricon columns (Ambion) with different molecular mass cut-off filters of 3, 10, 30, and 100 kDa. Each fraction was collected and treated to MDA-MB-231 cells, which were grown under serum-free conditions for 24 h. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells are highly invasive, metastatic, and estrogen-independent, whereas the MCF-7 cells are less invasive and estrogen-responsive (27Liu X.H. Rose D.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5125-5127PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell lines proliferate in serum-containing medium (10% FBS) and are growth arrested under serum-free conditions (0% FBS). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells grown in 10% or 0% FBS for 48 h were stimulated for 4 h with PMA (10 nm), a well-known activator of COX-2 expression (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, COX-2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells was strongly induced by PMA stimulation in both serum-stimulated and serum-starved conditions. In MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 10% FBS, PMA stimulated COX-2 mRNA expression as anticipated. In sharp contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 0% FBS expressed high levels of COX-2 mRNA and PMA stimulation only slightly augmented it. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), levels of COX-2 protein and PGE2 synthesis were also strongly induced in MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 0% FBS. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed to analyze arachidonic acid metabolites released into the cell culture medium. As shown in Fig. 1 D, metabolites such as PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, 6-keto-PGF1α, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid/12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid levels were significantly elevated in serum-starved cells, suggesting that COX activity, rather than the terminal isomerase activity, is up-regulated. Immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted to determine the subcellular localization of COX-2 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 10% or 0% FBS. As shown in Fig. 1 E, COX-2 protein was strongly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane. These data indicate that serum deprivation in MDA-MB-231 cells up-regulates COX-2 expression and activity. To rule out the effect of cell death as a stimuli in this phenomenon, we next determined the cell cycle kinetics of MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 F, cells were quiescent but not apoptotic following serum starvation. Exaggerated COX-2 mRNA expression in serum-starved MDA-MB-231 cells was suppressed by FBS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Heat treatment of FBS (95 °C for 30 min) strongly suppressed the inhibitory activity (data not shown). In addition, as shown in Fig. 2 B, molecular mass cut-off experiments indicated that the >100-kDa fraction of FBS down-regulated the COX-2 mRNA. This activity was present in several types of serum, namely, FBS, bovine serum, horse serum, and calf serum, and was recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation (data not shown). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a novel >100-kDa heat-sensitive serum factor induces the suppression of COX-2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. We next examined the kinetics and reversibility of COX-2 mRNA suppression by serum in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were grown in medium containing 10% or 0% FBS for indicated times (0–4 days) or cells were grown in medium containing 0% FBS for 2 days, then switched to medium containing 10% FBS for the next 2 days. As shown in Fig. 2 C, COX-2 mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 0% FBS for 0–4 days were increased in a time-dependent manner, whereas COX-2 mRNA levels of MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 10% FBS were very low. However, the enhanced COX-2 mRNA induced by 0% FBS for 2 days was suppressed by the addition of 10% FBS at the 2-day time point. These results indicated that the induction of COX-2 mRNA expression by serum deprivation in MDA-MB-231 cells was reversible and regulatable. To determine if this phenomenon occurs in other cells, we tested various cancer cell lines to see if serum withdrawal induced COX-2 expression. Specifically, we tested glioblastoma cell lines (U-118 and U-373), melanoma cell lines (M21 and SK-Mel-2), lung carcinoma cells (A-549), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431), breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, BT-474), prostate cancer cells (DU-145, LNCap, PC-3), colon carcinoma cells (HT-29, HCT-116, Caco-2, DLD-1), endometrial carcinoma cells (AN3CA), and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080). As shown in Fig. 3, marked expression of COX-2 mRNA by serum withdrawal was observed only in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, no COX-2 expression was detected in other mammary cancer cell lines, including MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, and BT-474. Low COX-2 induction was observed in A549 lung cancer cells, HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, M21 melanoma cells, and colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2; however, the magnitude of induction was significantly lower than that in MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that COX-2 polypeptide expression paralleled that of mRNA levels (data not shown). These data suggest that the MDA-MB-231 cell line possesses a unique regulatory mechanism of COX-2 expression, with respect to the magnitude of COX-2 induction upon serum withdrawal. We next focused on the mechanisms involved in the induction of COX-2 mRNA after serum withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PMA stimulated COX-2 mRNA expression either in 10% or 0% FBS, and this induction was completely suppressed by actinomycin D. This suggested that activation of the COX-2 transcription was required for the induction of COX-2 mRNA by PMA. In contrast, serum withdrawal-induced COX-2 mRNA was not suppressed markedly by actinomycin D. This indicated that enhanced transcription of COX-2 was not involved in serum deprivation-induced COX-2 induction. To directly prove this point, we next measured the transcription rate of COX-2 by nuclear run-on transcription analysis as shown in Fig. 4 B. Although activation of COX-2 transcription was induced by PMA, serum deprivation did not induce COX-2 transcription, suggesting that the enhanced COX-2 mRNA by serum deprivation in MDA-MB-231 cells was due to the regulation at the post-transcriptional level. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, including ERKs, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 SAPK are engaged in transcriptional regulation of inducible genes in response to extracellular stimuli (36Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data indicated that MAPK family members play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability of the COX-2 gene (19Ridley S.H. Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J.

Interestingly, high steady-state levels of phosphorylated ERK-1 and -2 were detected in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5 A). Serum withdrawal did not significantly alter steady-state phospho-ERK-2 levels but suppressed phospho-ERK-1 levels at 1–4 h (Fig. 5 A). Another subclass of the MAPK family, p38 SAPK is known to be activated by inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress signals such as hyperosmolarity (38Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E.

In this study, we investigate the identity of the K+ and Cl−channels that mediate the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in ciliated epithelial cells from murine trachea. RVD was inhibited by tamoxifen and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, two agents that block swelling-activated Cl− channels. These data suggest that swelling-activated Cl− channels play an important role in cell volume regulation in murine tracheal epithelial cells. Ba2+ and apamin, inhibitors of K+ channels, were without effect on RVD, while tetraethylammoniun had little effect on RVD. In contrast, clofilium, an inhibitor of the KvLQT/IsK potassium channel complex potently inhibited RVD, suggesting a role for the KvLQT/IsK channel complex in cell volume regulation by tracheal epithelial cells. To investigate further the role of KvLQT/IsK channels in RVD, we used IsK knock-out mice. When exposed to hypotonic solutions, tracheal cells from IsK(+/+) mice underwent RVD, whereas cells from IsK(−/−) failed to recover their normal size.

Simonsen L.O. Lambert I.H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1993; 7: 187-248Crossref Google Scholar). Although the ability of maintaining a constant volume in the face of osmotic stress is important for all cells in the body, the process assumes particular significance in epithelial cells. In the case of the airways, the luminal face of the epithelial cells is covered by a liquid (airway surface liquid, ASL) that modifies its osmolality under different situations, becoming hyperosmolar (e.g. during cold or dry ventilation) or hypoosmolar (e.g. breathing fog) (2Man S.F. Adams G.K. Proctor D.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1979; 46: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Bromberg P.A. Gatzy J.T. J. Appl.

These changes in the osmolality of the ASL affect other airway functions, including protein and hydroelectrolytic secretion, and release of inflammatory mediators (5Price A.M. Webber S.E. Widdicombe J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 2788-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Wells U.M. Hanafi Z. Widdicombe J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 77: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite the significance of ASL to airway physiology and pathophysiology the molecular basis for the ion pathways involved in cell volume regulation is largely unknown. Although the molecular identity of the swelling-activated Cl− channels has been the subject of several studies in recent years (7Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Valverde M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), little is known about the identity of the swelling-activated K+ channels involved in RVD. In this study we have characterized the ionic conductances underlying the RVD response in murine tracheal cells. We have found that the potassium channel complex KvLQT/IsK (10Busch A.E. Suessbrich H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 26-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) plays an important role in cell volume regulation by murine tracheal cells. For this study, we used mice from two different outbred genetic backgrounds. One group yielded control animals, while the other gave wild-type isk(+/+) and nullisk(−/−) mice (11Vetter D.E. Mann J.R. Wangemann P. Liu J. McLaughlin K.J. Lesage F. Marcus D.C. Lazdunski M. Heinemann S.F. Barhanin J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1251-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Mice (4–20 weeks old) were killed by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide prior to tissue removal. Animals were maintained and experiments performed according to the guidelines issued by the Animal Care Committees at the respective institutions involved. Tracheal epithelial cells were isolated using sterile conditions. The trachea proximal to the bronchial bifurcation was excised from the mice and adherent adipose tissue removed. The tracheal was opened longitudinally, cut into three pieces, and incubated in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.1% (w/v) protease XIV, 0.1 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease I, 2 mmdl-dithiothreitol, and 50 μg ml−1 gentamicin for 16 h at +4 °C with occasional gentle agitation. Following tissue digestion, 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the medium to deactivate enzymes, undigested fragments of tissue were removed and tracheal epithelial cells harvested by low speed centrifugation (5 min at 500 rpm). The collected cells were resuspended in Ham's F-12 nutrient medium supplemented with 1 μg ml−1 insulin, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 μg ml−1 gentamicin at +4 °C. Tracheal cells remained viable for up 24 h at +4 °C. Tracheal cell volume experiments were performed at 37 °C to obtain a larger number of cells with beating cilia (a prerequisite for cell selection). Tracheal epithelial cells were attached to glass coverslips coated with 75 mg ml−11-ethyl-3(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbonimide and 15 mg ml−1 concanavalin A (12Kim Y.K. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1306-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), placed in the bottom of a recording chamber, bathed in isotonic Hanks' solution, and observed under phase contrast optics using an inverted microscope (Leica DMIL). Single cells with well defined membranes and beating cilia were selected and digital images acquired at timed intervals using a Photonics camera and Quanticell 500 software (Applied Imaging). Photomicrographs of tracheal epithelial cells were analyzed using NIH Image software (version 1.58) to determine the area of cells. The radius (R) of individual cells was calculated using the following equation.R=area/πEquation 1 Assuming that tracheal epithelial cells are spherical in shape, cell volume (V) was calculated using the equationV=4/3·π·r3Equation 2 and normalized to that measured at time t = 0. The isotonic Hanks' solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.25 (osmolality, 302 ± 6 mOsm; n = 12). The hypotonic Hanks' solution (osmolality, 205 ± 10 mOsm;n = 16) was prepared by removing 50 mm NaCl from the isotonic Hanks' solution and adjusting it withd-mannitol when necessary. All chemicals were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, UK). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. ofn observations. To compare sets of data, we used Student'st test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Fig.1 shows phase contrast images of a single ciliated tracheal cell. Images were taken under isotonic conditions (Fig. 1 a, left) and after 2 min (Fig.1 a, middle) and 30 min (Fig. 1 a,right) in a 25% hypotonic solution. Superfusion of the cell with the hypotonic solution resulted in a clear increase in cell size. After the initial swelling, the cell returned close to its preswelling size by undergoing a RVD response. Fig. 1 b quantifies the RVD response of control tracheal cells, which achieved 80 ± 6% volume recovery at 30 min. Swelling-activated chloride channels, Cl(swell), have been described in many cell types (7Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Okada Y.

Among the different Cl(swell) channels, the outwardly rectifying, ATP-dependent channel, also known as volume-regulated anion channel or volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel, has been implicated in the RVD response of several cell types (13Valverde M.A. Bond T.D.

Higgins C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both drugs have also been shown to inhibit the RVD response in T84 epithelial cells (14Bond T.D. Ambikapathy S. Mohammad S. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 511: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on this data, we examined the effect of DDFSK and tamoxifen on the RVD response of control murine ciliated tracheal cells (Fig.2). DDFSK at 100 μm and tamoxifen at 5 μm were added to the bathing solution 3 min before exposure to a 30% hypotonic shock. Fig. 2demonstrates that both compounds prevented RVD. These data suggest that swelling-activated Cl− channels play an important role in RVD in murine tracheal epithelial cells. To investigate the identity of the K+ channels that mediate RVD in murine tracheal epithelial cells, we tested the effect of Ba2+ and tetraethylammoniun (TEA) (19Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 20Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) two agents that inhibit a wide range of K+ channels. Apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+channels (21Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), inhibited RVD in mouse small intestinal cells, 2M. A. Valverde, unpublished observation. therefore, we also tested its effect on murine tracheal epithelial cells. Fig. 3, a and b, demonstrates that Ba2+ (5 mm) and apamin (2.5 μm) failed to prevent RVD in ciliated cells from control mouse trachea, while Fig. 3 c shows that TEA (5 mm) only partially inhibited RVD. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of TEA was 4.3 mm, but the maximal level of inhibition was only about 50% (data not shown). In contrast, Fig. 3 d shows that clofilium (100 μm), an inhibitor of the KvLQT/IsK potassium channel complex, almost completely inhibited RVD in ciliated tracheal cells. To explore further the role of the KvLQT/IsK potassium channel complex in RVD, we used a mouse model that has a complete loss of theisk gene product (11Vetter D.E. Mann J.R. Wangemann P. Liu J. McLaughlin K.J. Lesage F. Marcus D.C. Lazdunski M. Heinemann S.F. Barhanin J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1251-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Like ciliated tracheal cells from outbred control mice (Fig. 1 b), wild-type mice,isk(+/+), showed around 75% RVD response, measured 30 min after switching to a hypotonic solution (Fig.4). In contrast, isk(−/−) litter mates presented a reduced RVD response (∼25%) over the same 30-min exposure to hypotonic shock. These data suggest that the IsK potassium channel subunit plays a key role in RVD by epithelial cells from mouse trachea. The apical membrane of airway epithelial cells is covered by a thin layer of ASL (22Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 516: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that provides the right microenvironment for cilia motility and, hence, mucus clearance. The tonicity and/or salt composition of ASL may vary under both physiological (2Man S.F. Adams G.K. Proctor D.F. J. Appl.

Cell. 1999; 96: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study we have addressed, for the first time, the homeostatic volume adjustments triggered in the ciliated airway epithelial cells by changes in the tonicity of the medium. As in many other epithelia (14Bond T.D. Ambikapathy S. Mohammad S. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 511: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Walters R.J. O'Brien J.A.

Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), ciliated cells of the murine trachea show a biphasic response to hypotonic solutions. They rapidly swell due to the entry of water, and subsequently they initiate a recovery phase, named RVD, toward the initial cell volume. The RVD response in murine tracheal cells appears to depend on the activity of both Cl− and K+ channels as inhibition of either type of channels prevents the full RVD. The RVD is inhibited by DDFSK and tamoxifen, suggesting the participation of the DDFSK- and tamoxifen-sensitive outwardly rectifying swelling activated Cl− channel (9Valverde M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Valverde M.A. Bond T.D. Hardy S.P. Taylor J.C. Higgins C.F. Altamirano J. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 198-205PubMed Google Scholar, 34Suessbrich H. Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. Lang F. Busch A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Clofilium has also been shown to block volume-sensitive potassium currents and RVD in Ehrlich cells (35Niemeyer M.I. Hougaard C. Hoffmann E.K. Jorgensen F. Stutzin A. Sepulveda F.V. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 524.3: 757-767Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although in this case the authors, on the basis of the lack of voltage-dependence of the K+ current, concluded that KvLQT1/IsK channels could not underlie the volume-sensitive macroscopic K+ currents. A role for KvLQT/IsK channels in the RVD of murine tracheal cells was suggested by our pharmacological studies. This hypothesis was further examined by the use of IsK knock-out mice. The tracheal cells obtained from this animal model showed marked reduction of the RVD response (25% RVD versus 80% RVD in the wild-type mice). The molecular mechanism by which the presence of IsK improves the RVD response in tracheal cells is unknown at present. However, our data suggest two possible mechanisms. First, IsK might act as the volume sensor within the channel complex. In response to cell swelling, it may undergo a conformational change that opens the KvLQT channel pore. Second, IsK might shift the activation of the channels to potentials close to the resting membrane potential of tracheal cells and hence accelerate the potassium efflux under hypotonic conditions. Consistent with this idea, co-assembly of KCN3 (IsK) with KCNQ1 potassium channels in intestine modulates the voltage dependence of channel activation (36Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The first hypothesis would involve a principal role for the activation of potassium channels to activate the RVD response, while the second would confer them a more passive role, with the activation of swelling-activated chloride channels being the starting signal. Although we cannot discard the first hypothesis, we favor the second possibility as basolateral I sK currents have been identified in tracheal cells under isosmotic conditions (37Hwang T. Suh D. Bae H. Lee S. Jung J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In that respect, I sK current has been associated to the maintenance of transepithelial chloride secretion in the airways (37Hwang T. Suh D. Bae H. Lee S. Jung J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38MacVinish L.J. Hickman M.E. Mufti D.A. Durrington H.J. Cuthbert A.W. J. Physiol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and potassium secretion in the stria vascularis (39Marcus D.C. Shen Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C857-C864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of IsK with cell volume regulatory mechanisms has been previously proposed in vestibular dark cells (40Wangemann P. Liu J. Shen Z. Shipley A. Marcus D.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 263-273PubMed Google Scholar), although a more recent study disagrees with this view (11Vetter D.E. Mann J.R. Wangemann P. Liu J.

In this respect, it is worth mentioning that both studies measured the peak increase in cell height, which reflects the osmometric behavior of the cells, rather than the RVD, which represents the cell regulatory adjustments following a hypotonic shock. A more direct approach to study the modulation of IsK by cell swelling, using electrophysiological techniques, has showed the increase inI sK current following hypotonic shock in oocytes expressing IsK (41Busch A.E. Varnum M. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In conclusion, it appears that the KvLQT1/Isk potassium channel complex plays important roles in the physiology of murine secretory epithelia,i.e. maintenance of Cl− (36Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S.

To study the mechanisms of TGF-β1 action on primitive hematopoietic cells, we used the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent, multipotent FDCP-Mix cell line. TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition was observed in high concentrations of IL-3, while at lower IL-3 concentrations TGF-β1 induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects of TGF-β1 occur via a p53-independent pathway, since p53null FDCP-Mix demonstrated the same responses to TGF-β1. IL-3 has been suggested to enhance survival via an increase in (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL expression. In FDCP-Mix cells, neither IL-3 nor TGF-β1 induced any change in Bcl-xL protein levels or the proapoptotic proteins Bad or Bax. However, TGF-β1 had a major effect on Bcl-2 levels, reducing them in the presence of high and low concentrations of IL-3. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in FDCP-Mix cells rescued them from TGF-β1-induced apoptosis but was incapable of inhibiting TGF-β1-mediated growth arrest. We conclude that TGF-β1-induced cell death is independent of p53 and inhibited by Bcl-2, with no effect on Bcl-xL.

Despite a high turnover of mature blood cells, hematopoietic stem cells are normally quiescent. This is achieved, at least in part, through the action of hematopoietic growth inhibitors (1Broxmeyer H.E. Whetton A.D. Gordon J. Blood Cell Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1996: 121-150Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1),1 the prototypic member of a large family of soluble growth and differentiation factors, has been shown to possess potent antiproliferative activity for many cell types including epithelial and hematopoietic cells (2Jetten A.M.

Priestley G.V. Wolf N.S. Bartelmez S.H. Blood. 1996; 88: 82-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth-suppressive actions of TGF-β1 on hematopoietic cells appear to be specific for primitive hematopoietic cell populations, with more mature, lineage-restricted progenitors being resistant to these effects (4Keller J.R. Mantel C. Sing G.K. Ellingsworth L.R. Ruscetti S.K. Ruscetti F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Ottmann O.G. Pelus L.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2661-2665PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, TGF-β1 has been reported to behave as a bidirectional regulator of hematopoietic cell growth, its effects being dependent on both differentiation status and the presence of other cytokines (8Jacobsen S.E. Keller J.R. Ruscetti F.W. Kondaiah P. Roberts A.B. Falk L.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Keller J.R. Jacobsen S.E. Sill K.T. Ellingsworth L.R. Ruscetti F.W. Proc. Natl.

These bidirectional effects have also been observed in vivo in normal mice injected with TGF-β1 either alone or in combination with other growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (12Goey H. Keller J.R. Back T. Longo D.L. Ruscetti F.W. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 877-880PubMed Google Scholar, 13Migdalska A. Molineux G. Demuynck H. Evans G.S. Ruscetti F. Dexter T.M.

In contrast to other growth suppressor molecules such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 are apparent throughout the whole stem cell hierarchy including the very primitive long term repopulating cells (LTRCs) (6Sitnicka E. Ruscetti F.W. Priestley G.V. Wolf N.S. Bartelmez S.H. Blood. 1996; 88: 82-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Keller J.R. Bartelmez S.H. Sitnicka E. Ruscetti F.W. Ortiz M. Gooya J.M. Jacobsen S.E.

The demonstration that neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β1 but not MIP-1α could induce normally quiescent progenitors into the cell cycle in long term bone marrow cultures has suggested that autocrine/paracrine production of TGF-β1 is likely to be an important mechanism of maintaining stem cell quiescence in vivo (17Eaves C.J. Cashman J.D. Kay R.J. Dougherty G.J. Otsuka T. Gaboury L.A. Hogge D.E. Landsdorp P.M. Eaves A.C. Humphries R.K. Blood. 1991; 78: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cashman J.D. Eaves C.J. Sarris A.H. Eaves A.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2338-2344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role of TGF-β1 in hematopoiesis has been further complicated by the demonstration that TGF-β1 can also induce apoptosis of both normal and leukemic progenitors (19Lotem J. Sachs L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Taetle R. Payne C. Dos Santos B. Russell M. Segarini P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jacobsen F.W. Stokke T.

The addition of TGF-β1 to primitive hematopoietic progenitors has been shown to inhibit the survival-promoting effects of several cytokines including stem cell factor and Flt3-L (21Jacobsen F.W. Stokke T. Jacobsen S.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 2957-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Veiby O.P. Jacobsen F.W. Cui L. Lyman S.D. Jacobsen S.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2953-2960PubMed Google Scholar). These effects could be significant; one study has already indicated that removal of endogenous TGF-β1 from cultures could be of benefit in ex vivoexpansion protocols to improve the number of cells with long term bone marrow reconstitution activity (16Soma T., Yu, J.M. Dunbar C.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 4561-4567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are now substantial data on the actions of TGF-β1 on primitive hematopoietic cells, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects have remained elusive. While some groups have correlated the growth-regulatory effects of TGF-β1 with changes in receptor expression for survival/growth-stimulatory factors such as the colony-stimulating factors (23Jacobsen S.E. Ruscetti F.W. Dubois C.M. Lee J. Boone T.C. Keller J.R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1706-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jacobsen S.E. Ruscetti F.W. Roberts A.B. Keller J.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4534-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dubois C.M. Ruscetti F.W. Stankova J. Keller J.R. Blood. 1994; 83: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), others have shown that this mechanism cannot always account for the activities of this cytokine (26Fan K. Ruan Q. Sensenbrenner L. Chen B. Blood. 1992; 79: 1679-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2539-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Postreceptor mechanisms must therefore also be involved in mediating the effects of TGF-β1 on hematopoietic cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that many survival- and death-inducing stimuli mediate their effects, at least in part, through the modulation of Bcl-2 family members (28Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). This family comprises proteins that can antagonize or promote cell survival. The ratio of homodimers and heterodimers within the Bcl-2 family has been suggested to determine cell survival in many cell systems. For example, homodimers of the proapoptotic family member Bax can induce apoptosis, while the formation of Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimers promote survival (29Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar, 30Yin X.M. Oltval Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Positive regulators of cell survival such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor have been shown to exert their effects by up-regulating the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively (31Rinaudo M.S.

There is now evidence that modulation of Bcl-2 members can also play a part in the proapoptotic activities of TGF-β1 in a variety of different cell types including some leukemic cells (34Tsukada T. Eguchi K. Migita K. Kawabe Y. Kawakami A. Matsuoka N. Takashima H. Mizokami A. Nagataki S. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1995; 210: 1076-1082Google Scholar, 35Naas S.J. Li M. Amundadottir L.T.

In the present study, the IL-3-dependent and multipotent FDCP-Mix cell line was utilized as a model to study the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of TGF-β1 on normal, primitive hematopoietic progenitors. FDCP-Mix cells are karyotypically normal and have previously been shown to be responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of MIP-1α (40Heyworth C.M. Pearson M.A. Dexter T.M. Wark G. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We report that TGF-β1 is able to reversibly inhibit the growth of FDCP-Mix cells cultured in high concentrations IL-3 that promote proliferation, while in lower IL-3 concentrations TGF-β1 induces apoptosis independent of p53, and this is inhibited by Bcl-2 expression. p53null FDCP-Mix cells were generated using long term marrow cultures derived from p53null mice as described previously (41Spooncer E. Lord B.I. Dexter T.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FDCP-Mix cells expressing Bcl-2 were generated as described by Fairbairn et al. (42Fairbairn L.J. Cowling G.J. Reipert B.M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The multipotent FDCP-Mix, Bcl-2-transfected, and p53nullFDCP-Mix cells were maintained in Fischer's medium supplemented with preselected batches of horse serum (HS; 20%, v/v) and 5% IL-3-conditioned medium (43Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Puromycin (1 mg/ml) was also included in the Bcl-2 FDCP-Mix cell cultures. In these culture conditions, the FDCP-Mix cultures maintain a primitive blast cell phenotype. The cells were subcultured twice a week to a cell concentration of 6–8 × 104 cells/ml and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Cells in logarithmic phase were washed free of growth factors and plated out (2 × 103cells/plate) in triplicate in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), 20% (v/v) HS, 10% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) IL-3 conditioned medium, 0.33% (v/v) agar, and the appropriate concentration of TGF-β1 added at 1% (v/v). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After 7 days, plates were removed, and the number of colonies was scored. Colonies were defined as aggregates of more than 50 cells. The rate of cell proliferation was determined by measuring DNA synthesis using the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into chromosomal DNA as described previously (44Pierce A. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Tavernier J. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Heyworth C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed free of cytokines and seeded (1.5 × 105cells/ml) in IMDM supplemented with 10% (v/v) HS, 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), and the appropriate concentration of TGF-β1 (R&D Systems). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, washed thoroughly, and then plated out in soft gel colony-forming assays. Cells were washed and resuspended (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) in IMDM supplemented with 10% (v/v) HS and the appropriate concentration of recombinant murine IL-3 and TGF-β1. After 24, 48, and 72 h, samples were taken, and viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. (Our previous work has shown that trypan blue exclusion gives similar results to acridine orange staining.) Apoptotic assays were performed using the annexin V, propidium iodide-based assay (R&D Systems) and analyzed using a FacsVantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co., Mountain View, CA). Western blotting was carried out as described previously (45Spooncer E. Fairbairn L. Cowling G.J. Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 620-630PubMed Google Scholar). Correct protein loading is ensured by measurement of protein concentration, and even transfer was assessed by Ponceau S staining of filters. Antibodies used were polyclonal murine Bcl-2, murine Bax, and human Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies for murine Bad were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY). We have previously shown that FDCP-Mix cells are susceptible to growth suppression by the growth inhibitor MIP-1α (40Heyworth C.M. Pearson M.A. Dexter T.M. Wark G. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To establish whether FDCP-Mix cells were a good model system for studying TGF-β1 actions on primitive hematopoietic cells, the responses of this cell line to TGF-β1 were assessed. We first examined the effects of TGF-β1 on IL-3-stimulated colony formation. TGF-β1 alone was unable to induce colony formation (data not shown). Concentrations of TGF-β1 of 50 pm or higher were shown to cause a major reduction in colony number compared with control cells treated with IL-3 alone (Fig. 1 A). Maximal inhibition of colony formation occurred at TGF-β1 concentrations above 75 pm. At this dose, TGF-β1 decreased colony number by approximately 70%. As colony-forming assays were performed over a 7-day period, to assess the kinetics of TGF-β1 growth inhibition we cultured FDCP-Mix cells in IL-3 for 24, 48, and 72 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 and then performed [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. TGF-β1 had relatively little effect in the presence of IL-3 (10 ng/ml) after 24 h, but beyond 48 h there was a marked inhibition of proliferation at TGF-β1 concentrations above 15 pm (Fig. 1 B). Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle status revealed that TGF-β1 did not induce growth arrest at any phase of the cell cycle. The proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was similar for cells cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 even after 72 h (percentage of cells in S/G2/M without TGF-β1 was 21.9 ± 1.4%; with TGF-β1, it was 20.8 ± 2.1%). TGF-β1 therefore appears to be slowing down progression of cells through all phases of the cell cycle. We next investigated the reversibility of TGF-β1-induced growth suppression. Following 48-h treatment with IL-3 (10 ng/ml) and various concentrations of TGF-β1, cells were washed free of cytokines and then plated out in soft gel colony-forming assays (Fig. 1 C). Cells pretreated with TGF-β1 were able to form similar numbers of colonies as controls. TGF-β1 does not therefore affect the viability of clonogenic cells. While the viable cells remaining after TGF-β1 treatment are still clonogenic, it still remains possible that TGF-β1 can selectively kill a subset of nonclonogenic cells present in FDCP-Mix cultures. We tested this possibility using first viable cell counts and then the apoptotic-specific annexin V assay. TGF-β1 induced no loss of cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-3 (Fig. 2 D); similarly, there was no increase in the percentage of cells staining for the apoptotic and dead cell-specific markers annexin V and propidium iodide, respectively (Table I). Thus, in the concentration of IL-3 employed in colony forming and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition was not a result of reduced viability.Table IEffect of TGF-β1 on the viability of FDCP-Mix cellsTimeIL-3TGF-β1Viable, no stainingPI-negative and annexin-positiveAnnexin- and PI-positivehng/mlpm%%%240.01074.3 ± 3.717.7 ± 3.17.9 ± 0.610060.3 ± 4.227.0 ± 3.412.5 ± 0.910094.4 ± 0.64.2 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.110094.6 ± 0.73.9 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.2480.01053.9 ± 3.432.9 ± 3.512.9 ± 2.410020.0 ± 6.658.9 ± 6.720.8 ± 4.510093.2 ± 0.54.4 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.410092.9 ± 1.34.9 ± 0.82.1 ± 0.4720.01043.7 ± 4.641.3 ± 1.314.7 ± 5.41006.8 ± 2.669.7 ± 5.122.9 ± 6.810087.9 ± 2.56.6 ± 1.85.2 ± 0.910092.8 ± 0.85.0 ± 0.91.9 ± 0.2FDCP-Mix A4 cells were washed and incubated in IMDM containing 10% HS (v/v) and the appropriate concentration of IL-3 ± 100 pm TGF-β1.

Open table in a new tab FDCP-Mix A4 cells were washed and incubated in IMDM containing 10% HS (v/v) and the appropriate concentration of IL-3 ± 100 pm TGF-β1. The number of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells was determined using the annexin V, propidium iodide (PI)-based assay and analyzed using a FacsVantage flow cytometer after 24, 48, and 72 h. The data presented are the mean of four individual experiments ± S.E. Previous studies on primitive hematopoietic progenitors have shown that TGF-β1 can antagonize the survival-promoting effects of cytokines such as stem cell factor and Flt3-L (21Jacobsen F.W. Stokke T. Jacobsen S.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 2957-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Veiby O.P. Jacobsen F.W. Cui L. Lyman S.D. Jacobsen S.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2953-2960PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-β1 could also inhibit IL-3-stimulated survival, FDCP-Mix cells were cultured in a range of IL-3 concentrations (0–10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (0–100 pm), and then the cell viability and the number of apoptotic cells were assayed. In concentrations of IL-3 that promoted survival with little detectable proliferation (0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (>50 pm) induced a marked decrease in cell viability (Fig. 2, A andB). These effects became more prominent over time, with the most significant effects on viability seen after 72 h. Annexin V assays performed under the same conditions confirmed that this reduction in viability was a result of TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. After 72 h in the presence of 0.01 ng/ml IL-3, only 7% of cells treated with 100 pm TGF-β1 were still viable compared with 44% of untreated cells (Table I). Having established that the FDCP-Mix cell line is a good model for studying both the antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions of TGF-β1 on primitive progenitors, we next attempted to discern the mechanisms by which these effects occur. Studies on nonhematopoietic cells have implicated the tumor suppressor p53 in the growth-suppressive effects of TGF-β1 (46Reiss M. Brash D.E. Munoz-Antonia T. Simon J.A. Ziegler A. Velluci V.F.

The detection of a TGF-β1-resistant subpopulation in high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) isolated from p53-deficient mice (but not wild type littermates) has suggested that p53 may play a role in TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory pathways in hematopoietic cells (50Sasaki H. Matsuda M. Lu Y. Ikuta K. Matsuyama S. Hirabayashi Y. Mitsui H. Matsumura T. Muramatsu M. Tsukada T. Aizawa S. Inoue T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In order to test this, we utilized a multipotent and IL-3-dependent FDCP-Mix cell line isolated from long term bone marrow cultures derived from p53null mice (p53null FDCP-Mix). TGF-β1 reversibly suppressed IL-3-stimulated proliferation of p53null FDCP-Mix cells in a dose-dependent manner as determined by soft gel colony-forming assays (Fig. 3 A) and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays (Fig. 3 B). Since p53 has been shown to mediate the effects of many apoptotic stimuli in hematopoietic cells, we also examined the effects of TGF-β1 on p53null FDCP-Mix viability. While apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal was delayed in p53null FDCP-Mix cells compared with FDCP-Mix cells expressing wild type p53, no significant differences in their responses to TGF-β1 could be detected. This delay in apoptosis, in p53null cells, has been previously reported in mast cells derived from p53null mice (51Silva A. Wyllie A. Collins M.K.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 2717-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with results obtained with a dominant negative p53 in a hematopoietic cell line (52Gottlieb E. Haffner R. von-Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Oren M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 induced a dose-dependent decrease in p53nullFDCP-Mix cell viability in the presence of IL-3 concentrations that promoted survival alone (Fig. 4,A and B). These proapoptotic effects of TGF-β1, however, were completely overcome by higher concentrations of IL-3 as seen in FDCP-Mix cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Retroviral transfection of the p53null FDCP-Mix cells with p53 gave similar results (data not shown). We therefore conclude that p53 is not absolutely required for TGF-β1-induced growth suppression or apoptosis in primitive myeloid progenitors.Figure 4The effect of TGF -β1 on p53null FDCP-Mix cell death. Cells were washed free of cytokines and cultured in the presence of 0.01 (A), 0.1 (B), 1 (C), or 10 ng/ml IL-3 (D) and a range of TGF-β1 concentrations. The percentage of dead cells after 24, 48, and 72 h was determined using trypan blue exclusion.

To investigate whether TGF-β1-induced apoptosis of FDCP-Mix cells is mediated through the modulation of these proteins, we analyzed the expression of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. We first examined the expression of the antiapoptotic member Bcl-xL, which has been shown to be up-regulated by a variety of survival stimuli in hematopoietic cells including cytokines (31Rinaudo M.S. Su K. Falk L.A. Halder S. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 80-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dibbert B. Daigle I. Braun D. Schranz C. Weber M. Blaser K. Zangemaster-Wittke U. Akbar A.N. Simon H. Blood. 1998; 92: 778-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dumon S. Santos S.C. Debierre-Grockiego F. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Cocault L. Boucheron C. Mollat P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 53Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J.M. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein levels of Bcl-xL were unaltered by IL-3 removal or by the addition of TGF-β1 to FDCP-Mix cells (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bad were unaffected by the reduction of IL-3 levels or TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 5, B andC). However, in contrast, the expression of Bcl-2 was dramatically reduced by TGF-β1. Bcl-2 protein levels were decreased by 2-fold 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment, and this decrease was still maintained after 48 h (Fig. 5 D). While others have shown that IL-3 can increase Bcl-2 expression in some hematopoietic cells (31Rinaudo M.S. Su K. Falk L.A. Halder S. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 80-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we detected no significant differences in Bcl-2 expression in FDCP-Mix cells cultured in low or high concentrations of IL-3 (Fig. 5 D). Furthermore, we found that TGF-β1-induced decreases in Bcl-2 levels occurred in high concentrations of IL-3 that can abolish the proapoptotic actions of this cytokine. These data therefore demonstrate that high levels of Bcl-2 are not absolutely necessary for FDCP-Mix survival. To determine whether TGF-β1-induced apoptosis is mediated by down-regulation of Bcl-2, we used retroviral technology to generate clonal cell populations of FDCP-Mix that express human Bcl-2 (Fig. 6 A). These FDCP-Mix Bcl-2 cell lines were able to undergo normal myeloid differentiation when cultured in appropriate conditions (42Fairbairn L.J. Cowling G.J. Reipert B.M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 did not affect the sensitivity of FDCP-Mix cells to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β1. IL-3-stimulated colony formation (Fig. 6 B) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 6 C) of FDCP-Mix Bcl-2 cells were reversibly suppressed by TGF-β1 to a similar degree as parental cells. Trypan blue and annexin V assays demonstrated that these Bcl-2-expressing cell lines were more resistant than parental cells to apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation. When we expressed human Bcl-2 in FDCP-Mix cells, we observed a delay in apoptosis of the cells cultured in the absence or in low concentrations of IL-3 (Fig. 7 A, TableII). However, when we examined the effects of TGF-β1 on FDCP-Mix Bcl-2 cells cultured in low concentrations of IL-3, there was a complete abrogation of TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7, A and B). TGF-β1-treated FDCP-Mix Bcl-2 cells underwent apoptosis at a similar rate as untreated cells in all concentrations of IL-3 tested (Fig. 7,A–D). Thus, it appears that TGF-β1-mediated effects on primitive myeloid cell survival can be inhibited by ectopic expression of Bcl-2 protein. This effect, in the presence of low concentrations of IL-3, has a major impact on cellular survival.Figure 7TGF -β1-induced apoptosis is blocked by high levels of Bcl-2. The effect of Bcl-2 on TGF-β1-mediated cell death of FDCP-Mix cells was assessed using the FDCP-Mix Bcl-2 (clone 15) cell line"

This phenomenon has been studied at the cellular level in a neuroendocrine organ which elaborates a mixture of diastereoisomers of a 72-residue neuropeptide, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone. For the first time, amino acid isomerization has been shown to occur in the perikarya of fully specialized neurosecretory cells, as a late step of the maturation of the hyperglycemic hormone precursor and after propeptide cleavage. The specificity and efficiency of this phenomenon indicates the existence of a new enzyme family involved in the biogenesis of peptide hormones.

Conformational changes associated with cellular stress or with mutations of the gene coding for the protein are, under physiological conditions, strictly controlled by complex mechanisms leading to repair or degradation of the modified protein (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In the last few years, evidence has accumulated for the existence of a mechanism which modifies peptide structure by selectively inverting the configuration of a single aminoacyl residue from the natural l- to thed-form (2Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 481-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the widely accepted paradigm concerning the presence of only l-aminoacyl residues in proteins and peptides from eukaryotic organisms. Such a phenomenon, though crucial for the bioactivity of the molecule because it introduces a major stereochemical change, has probably been largely underestimated in eukaryotic peptides (and proteins) because it remains undetectable by routine physicochemical or molecular analytical methods. The presence of a d-aminoacyl residue in a eukaryotic peptide was first demonstrated in small (4–8 residue) peptides isolated from different animal sources such as frog skin (opioid peptides dermorphins, dermenkephalins, or antimicrobial peptides bombinins) (3Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10967-10970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mollusc nervous tissues (neuroexcitatory peptides from different species) (4Kreil G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In each case, the d-amino acid residue is located at the second position of the sequence. The situation is different in the octapeptide contryphan, isolated from the venom of the marine gastropod Conus radiatus, where ad-tryptophan constitutes the fourth residue of the sequence (5Jimenez E.C. Oliviera B.M. Gray W.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28002-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The presence of a d-amino acid residue (d-phenylalanine) was also detected in position 3 of the sequence of a 72-amino acid crustacean neurohormone (crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, CHH)1(6Soyez D. Van Herp F. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Tensen C.P. Lafont R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yasuda A. Yasuda Y. Fujita T. Naya Y. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1994; 95: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This neurohormone is largely synthesized in the major crustacean neurosecretory system, the X-organ-sinus gland complex, located in the eyestalks. The coexistence of CHH and [d-Phe3]CHH within sinus glands was described recently for the crayfish Orconectes limosus, the biological model used in the present study (8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The only case where a d residue (d-serine) has been found near the C terminus (at position 46) is a 48-amino acid spider toxin isolated from the venom of the funnel web spiderAgelenopsis aperta (ω-agatoxin 4B) (9Heck S.D. Siok C.J. Krapcho K.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Thadeio P.F. Welsh M.J. Williams R.D. Ganong A.H. Kelly M.E. Lanzetti A.J. Gray W.R. Phillips D. Parks T.N. Jackson H. Ahlijanian M.K. Saccomano N.A. Volkman R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), also named ω-agatoxin TK D (10Kuwada M. Teramoto T. Kumagaye K.Y. Nakajima K. Watanabe T. Kawai T. Kawakami Y. Niidome T. Sawada K. Nishizawa Y. Katayama K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 587-593PubMed Google Scholar). Changing an l to a d residue has major functional consequences. For example, the all-l residue counterparts of frog skin opioid peptides and molluscan fulicin and fulyal were shown to be totally devoid of biological activity (2Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 481-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Jollès P. D-Amino Acids in Sequences of Secreted Peptides of Multicellular Organisms. Birkhäuser, Basel1998: 37-56Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The d residue-containing isoform of agatoxin demonstrated increased potency against P-type calcium channels and enhanced stability in the venom (9Heck S.D. Siok C.J. Krapcho K.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Thadeio P.F. Welsh M.J. Williams R.D. Ganong A.H. Kelly M.E. Lanzetti A.J. Gray W.R. Phillips D. Parks T.N. Jackson H. Ahlijanian M.K. Saccomano N.A. Volkman R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The crustacean [d-Phe3]CHH displays different kinetics and increased potency in its hyperglycemic effect and, in addition, exhibits a potent inhibitory activity upon molting gland ecdysteroidogenesis (6Soyez D. Van Herp F. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Tensen C.P. Lafont R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Keller R. Kegel G. Reichwein B. Sedlmeier D. Soyez D. Roubos E.W. Wendelar Bonga S.E. Vaudry H. De Loof A. Recent Developments in Comparative Endocrinology and Neurobiology. Shaker, Nijmegen, The Nederlands1999: 209-212Google Scholar). In every case where the mRNA encoding the d-amino acid containing peptide has been cloned, a typical codon was found corresponding to the modified residue. This indicates that amino acid epimerization should occur as a post-translational event. This is in agreement with studies where the stereoinversion of the serine 46 of ω-agatoxin 4C (the all-l residue equivalent to the ω-agatoxin 4B) was obtained in vitro after incubation with a venom fraction (although with a rather low yield and slow kinetics) (9Heck S.D. Siok C.J. Krapcho K.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Thadeio P.F. Welsh M.J. Williams R.D. Ganong A.H. Kelly M.E. Lanzetti A.J. Gray W.R. Phillips D. Parks T.N. Jackson H. Ahlijanian M.K. Saccomano N.A. Volkman R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Isomerization of agatoxin Ser46 in the venom gland may therefore be considered as a late, post-secretory and reversible event. Nevertheless, such a mechanism could hardly be applied to a cellular system, as suggested by the few data available on the biosynthesis of the frog skin peptides (13Mor A. Delfour A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6264-6270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paucity of information on the timing and mechanism of the isomerization process in peptide-secreting cells urged us to use the crustacean X-organ-sinus gland as a model to investigate this phenomenon. Because we knew that a 3:1 mixture ofl-/ d-isoforms was produced by the crayfish neuroendocrine system (8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we decided as a first step to determine at which biosynthetic intermediate thed -phenylalanyl residue could be identified. In parallel, we undertook a structural exploration of the CHH-producing system to elucidate to what extent the neurosecretory cells were specialized in the production of the CHH isomers. CrayfishO. limosus were collected by a commercial fisherman in the river Saône (France) and kept at 11–14 °C in the laboratory in filtered recirculating freshwater under natural photoperiod. The animals (20–30 g) were fed once a week with catfood pellets, sampling of the eyestalks being made 3–4 days after feeding. Both male and female crayfish were used at different periods of the year including the breeding season. Though molt stage of the animals was not precisely determined, external morphological parameters indicated if the animals had molted recently or not. Before sampling the eyestalks, the animals were anesthesized by immersion in ice-cold water for 15 min. For immunohistochemistry and labeling experiments, eyestalk tissues were dissected to separate the ganglia containing the XO-SG complex from the surrounding tissues (epidermis, muscle, and retina). Immediately after dissection, pulse incubations were performed on watch-glasses (10 organs/200 μl of medium) at room temperature in an orbital shaker in modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), depleted in leucine and cysteine, diluted 1:1 with freshwater crustacean saline (14Van Harreveld J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1936; 36: 428-432Crossref Scopus (817) Google Scholar) (osmolality: 420 mosm) as described in Ref. 15Ollivaux C. Soyez D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. l-[3H]leucine (1.6 MBq) andl-[35S]cysteine (1.6 MBq) were added just prior to incubation. Chase incubations were performed in incubation medium enriched with l-leucine (0.125 g/L),l-cysteine (0.12 g/L), and antibiotics (0.10 mg/L streptomycin and 0.16 mg/L tetracycline). In preliminary experiments, organs were directly put into electrophoresis sample buffer (1 organ/15 μl) after incubation (see below) and disrupted by sonication before heating (95 °C, 10 min) and electrophoresis. Some incubations included monensin sodium salt (70 nm, Sigma) in the medium as prohormone maturation inhibitor (16Orci L. Halban P. Amherd M. Ravazolla M. Vassalli J.-D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1984; 39: 39-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Before RP-HPLC, labeled organs were homogenized in 15% trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml/10 organs). After centrifugation, the protein pellet was rinsed six times with 15% TFA prior to extractions with 10% acetic acid, first at 80 °C for 5 min and then twice at room temperature. The supernatant containing the peptides was injected into the HPLC column. Separation of peptides by RP-HPLC was performed essentially as described in Ref. 8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. Fractionation of the X-organ-sinus gland extracts was performed on a Nucleosil C18 column (Macherey-Nagel, 5-μm particle size, 250-mm long and 4.0-mm internal diameter). The peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of acetonitrile in water (both eluents containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. UV absorbance of the eluent was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions of thirty seconds duration were collected. Separation of tryptic fragments was performed on a microbore (250 mm × 2.0 mm internal diameter) column, filled with the same stationary phase as above. Radioactivity in aliquots of each chromatographic fraction was determined after mixing with 1 ml of biodegradable scintillation solution (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager Elite instrument (Perseptive Biosystem, Inc., Framingham, MA) The molecular mass of peptides present in HPLC fractions was determined as follows. Dried aliquots of fractions were redissolved in 2 μl of 30% formic acid. One-half microliter was deposited on the MALDI stainless steel target and immediately mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix (a saturated solution of sinnapinic acid in acetonitrile/water 30:70 (v/v), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). After drying, the target was introduced into the mass spectrometer and the spectra recorded. SDS-PAGE was performed with a MiniProtean system (Bio-Rad) with tricine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in the buffers instead of glycine, according to Ref. 17Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar. HPLC fractions were dried with a Speed-Vac (Savant Instruments Inc., Holbrook, NY) before addition of a 20-μl sample buffer (4% SDS, 12% glycerol (w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6). Molecular weight markers were from the “Low molecular weight range kit” from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech with aprotinin (6.5 kDa) added. After migration in a 10% acrylamide gel, proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the markers. The gel was destained and then dried on a Whatman paper sheet with a gel-dryer (Bio-Rad) before autoradiography with Hyperfilm βMax (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) x-ray film or with a combination of Biomax MS film with an intensifying screen system (Biomax Tanscreen-LE), both from Kodak. Different antisera were used for immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. Two rabbit antisera, namedr-anti-pQL and r-anti-pQDin this article, were raised against the synthetic pQL and pQD octapeptides described below, respectively. The production and preliminary characterization of these antisera have been described earlier (8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For double labeling experiments, an additional antiserum (named gp-anti-pQL) was produced in a guinea pig against pQL conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin. After removal, eyestalks were dissected and the medulla terminalis together with the X-organ and sinus gland were fixed overnight at 4 °C in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.01 M, pH 7.2 phosphate-buffered saline. For double immunostaining, antisera from two species were used,r-anti-pQD and gp-anti-pQL. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, medullae were incubated with both primary antibodies diluted (r-anti-pQDat 1:400 and gp-anti-pQL at 1:200) in PBS to 0.01m containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h at room temperature. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline/normal goat serum/Triton, a mixture of secondary antibodies coupled to fluorochromes was added for 18 h at room temperature under darkness. Secondary antibodies solutions were anti-rabbit conjugated with rhodamine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:200 and anti-guinea pig coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:100, diluted in the same buffer as the primary antibodies. After washings, tissue fragments were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA) on microscope slides under glass coverslips and kept at 4 °C until use. Confocal microscopy was carried out using the TCS 4D confocal imaging system (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), equiped with a × 63 objective (plan apo, NA = 1.4). For fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine, an Argon-Krypton ion laser adjusted to 488 nm and 568 nm was used. For each optical section, double fluorescence images were acquired in sequential mode. The signal was processed to integrate 8 lines to reduce noise. The focus step between sections was generally 1 μm. A focal series was collected for each specimen and eventually processed to produce single composite images (extended focus), combining a high spatial resolution with an increased field depth. Micrographs were processed and assembled with Adobe Photoshop 5.0. (Adobe Systems Inc, San José, CA). As a specificity control for the observed fluorescence, single labeling experiments were performed with either of the antiserum, and the preparation was examined at both excitation wavelengths. No overlapping of the emission fluorescence could be detected. The following synthetic peptides were used in this study: two octapeptides with a sequence identical to the N-terminal part of the isoforms of the crayfish CHH (pGlu-Val-Phe-Asp-Gln-Ala-Cys-Lys (octapeptide pQL) and pGlu-Val-d-Phe-Asp-Gln-Ala-Cys-Lys (octapeptide pQD); the corresponding peptides with a glutamine instead of a pyroglutamate at the N terminus (octapeptides QL and QD, respectively); the octapeptide pGlu-d-Val-Phe-Asp-Gln-Ala-Cys-Lys; and a 15-mer peptide with the sequence Asp-Gln-Ser-Val-Ser-Lys-Arg-Gln-Val-Phe-Asp-Gln-Ala-Cys-Lys (corresponding to residues 29–42 of the prepro-CHHA according to Ref.18De Kleijn D.P.V. Janssen K.P.C. Martens G.J.M. Van Herp F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These peptides were synthesized by Neosystem Lab (Strasbourg, France). After deblocking and a first step of purification, the cysteinyl residues were reduced by dithiothreitol under argon. The reduced peptides were further purified by RP-HPLC. Direct ELISA was performed on aliquots of HPLC fractions as described in Ref. 8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. Briefly, 5 or 10 μl of each fraction were deposited in the wells of the microtiter plate and dried under vacuum. After a 2-h incubation with coating buffer (0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.6), the immunological procedure included 3 incubation steps: first with the primary antibody (r-anti-pQL andr-anti-pQD) diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively, in PBS buffer containing Tween 20 and sodium azide (both from Prolabo, France); then with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-sodium azide; and finally with the phosphatase substrate solution (p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt dissolved in coating buffer). The two first steps lasted 1.5 h at 37 °C. Readings of the absorbance were performed every 15 min. Before use, 10 to 20 μl of the stock enzyme slurry (TPCK-treated enzyme (EC 3.4.21.4, Sigma-Aldrich) attached to agarose beads in 1 m acetic acid) was vortexed with 2 ml of the digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8 containing 5 mm EDTA and 10 mmdithiothreitol to reduce disulfide bonds). After centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was discarded and the gel resuspended in 20 μl of digestion buffer. Pro-CHH digestions were performed as follows. The dry peptide was redissolved in 5 μl of acetonitrile/water (1:1). Then 45 μl of digestion buffer and 2 μl of enzyme suspension were added to the tube. After 3 h at 37 °C, the digestion mixture was diluted to 200 μl with 10% acetic acid and then filtered on a Millex GV4 Millipore filter (0.2-μm pore size). Before HPLC, internal standards (2 μg of each synthetic peptide, octapeptides pQL, pQD, QL, QD) were added to the hydrolysate. CHH is synthesized in the ribosome-associated endoplasmic reticulum of crayfish neurosecretory perikarya as a ∼14-kDa preprohormone (18De Kleijn D.P.V. Janssen K.P.C. Martens G.J.M. Van Herp F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The deduced ∼12-kDa CHH precursor was characterized in the present study by in vitro radioactive labeling of X-organ-sinus gland complexes followed by chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis. After a 2-hour labeling period with [35S]cysteine, a prominent radioactive peak was eluted at 38 min, a few minutes earlier than the UV-absorbant CHH peaks (Fig.1 a). The corresponding autoradiogram shows a peptide with an apparent molecular mass close to 12 kDa, identical to the mass of the labeled prohormone visualized on autoradiograms of crude extract from labeled X-organ-sinus gland complexes (Fig. 1 b, lane A). When organs were rinsed for one hour in cold medium after labeling, a lighter band was present on the autoradiogram of crude extracts, with an apparent molecular weight close to 7.7 kDa (Fig. 1 b,lane B) matching CHH visible as the major Coomassie Blue-stained band after electrophoresis of a sinus gland extract (data not shown). The possible precursor to product relationship between the 12-kDa and 7.7-kDa bands was confirmed by pulse-chase incubations in the presence of monensin (a compound known to inhibit propeptide processing, Ref. 16Orci L. Halban P. Amherd M. Ravazolla M. Vassalli J.-D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1984; 39: 39-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) where, even after a 1-h chase, only the 12-kDa band was visible (Fig. 1 b, lane C). After RP-HPLC of extracts from labeled organs chased for 1 h, radioactive mature CHH and [d-Phe3]CHH were characterized (Fig. 1, c and d, peaks 4 and 5). In addition, several radioactive biosynthetic intermediates were identified, including two forms of prohormones (Fig.1 c, peaks 1 and 2). These peaks have been shown in another study to correspond to the molecule with the native and amidated C terminus, respectively (15Ollivaux C. Soyez D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping following tryptic digestion realized on larger scale preparations of these two compounds demonstrated that no fragment corresponding to the CHH N-terminal octapeptide with a d-phenylalanyl residue could be detected in the hydrolysate (Fig.2).Figure 2Identification of the N-terminal octapeptide of labeled pro-CHH by tryptic digestion and HPLC separation of the fragments. Dried fractions containing labeled pro-CHH (Fig. 1,peak 1) from several experiments were hydrolyzed to completion with trypsin and analyzed by RP-HPLC using synthetic octapeptides as internal standards. A peak of radioactivity which comigrated with QL was obtained, whereas no radioactive peak was observed in the QD elution position (arrows). Such proteolytic cleavage was reproduced with different preparations of peaks 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) with a similar result. Chromatographic analysis was performed on Nucleosil C18, 5-μm particle size of dimensions 2.0 × 250 mm, and flow rate 0.2 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 30 s. The elution gradient (acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) is represented by the dotted line. Elution positions of the synthetic peptides are shown by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After radioactive labeling, the percentage of radioactive [d-Phe3]CHH was calculated to be close to 16% (15Ollivaux C. Soyez D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If a comparable percentage of a putatived-Phe-containing pro-CHH was present in our preparations, the corresponding d-Phe-containing fragment would have been clearly identifiable after RP-HPLC. During pulse-chase experiments, another radiolabeled intermediate was identified as immature CHH form with unblocked N-terminal (glutaminyl residue) (Fig. 1, c and d, peak 3). This assumption was based on the following grounds: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed the presence in corresponding fractions of an ion with a 8421-Da mass versus 8404 Da for the mature CHHs (spectra not shown). The 17-Da difference may be attributed to cyclization of the glutaminyl residue present as the N-terminal residue after cleavage of the pro-CHH. This was confirmed by the presence of a radioactive fragment comigrating with the octapeptide with the sequence Glu-Val-Phe-Asp-Glu-Ala-Cys-Lys after trypsinization of peak 3 followed by RP-HPLC (data not shown). Accordingly, peak 3 showed in direct ELISA a clear immunoreactivity against an anti-pQL antiserum (Fig.1 e). When ELISA was performed on aliquots of fractions from the same analysis with an anti-pQD antiserum, a minor immunoreactive zone was obtained, in the ascending front of the major CHH peak (Fig. 1 e, peak 3′). As for peak 3, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of peak 3′ fractions demonstrated the presence of an 8421-Da ion, in addition to the 8404-Da CHH ion (data not shown). This indicates the presence in the extracts of an N-terminally unblocked form of [d -Phe3]CHH. The storage of unblocked forms of CHH in crab sinus gland has already been reported (19Chung J.S. Webster S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Chung J.S. Wilkinson M.C. Webster S.G. Reg. Pept. 1998; 77: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). From our data, we conclude that tissue extracts contain immature forms of CHH and [d-Phe3]CHH with unblocked N termini. Therefore, isomerization of the Phe3 residue should occur before cyclization of the N-terminal glutaminyl residue of the CHH. Besides, the in vitro proteolytic cleavage experiments show that the d-phenylalanyl residue is not present at the prohormone level. Taken together, our results show that isomerization is realized shortly after (or even simultaneously with) propeptide cleavage. Confocal analysis of whole-mounts of X-organ-sinus gland complexes was performed after double immunofluorescent labeling using specific antisera gp-anti-pQL andr-anti-pQD. Two distinct cell types were observed, either green fluorescent, indicative of a labeling by the anti-pQL antiserum exclusively (“l-cells”), or orange from the superposition of fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine fluorescence, attesting a labeling by both antisera (for the sake of clarity these cells will be subsequently called “d-cells”, although l- andd-immunoreactivity are both present in their perikarya) (Fig. 3, a andb). Organs from animals of both sexes and different physiological status (in terms of molt and reproductive stage) were processed for immunohistochemistry and examined. A constant overall pattern of fluorescence was observed, with the orange d-cells arranged mostly in a horseshoe-shaped configuration at the surface of the X-organ (Fig. 3 a), except when the organ was accidentally stretched during dissection (Fig. 3 b). The number of the different CHH cells was also constant with a figure of 8d-cells over a total of 30 CHH cells. Variations in the coloration (from yellow to dark orange) was observed between different organs or different cells in the same organ (Fig. 3 b). Nevertheless, the distinction between l- andd-cells was never ambiguous. In an earlier immunohistochemical study (8Soyez D. Laverdure A.M. Kallen J. Van Herp F. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the presence in crayfish and lobster neurosecretory systems of cells labeled either exclusively by the r-anti-pQL antiserum or both by ther-anti-pQL and r-anti-pQDantiserum was described, which suggested that d-cells were actually producing a mixture of both isoforms. Here it was observed that, in the d-cells, secretory granules with different labeling were not evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3,c and d); gp-anti-pQLlabeled (green) granules clusters being generally in the perinuclear region whereas the peripheral part of the cytoplasm was enriched with mixed (yellow/orange) orr-anti-pQD labeled (red) clusters. A major observation was that in every case, green fluorescence was no longer detectable as the granules enter the axon of these cells (Fig.3 c, arrow). Interpretation of the colocalization of anti-pQL and -pQD immunoreactivity in the perikarya ofd-cells required a precise determination of the specificity of the antisera versus the different molecules studied. It was established by direct ELISA on pro-CHH preparations that the specific antisera did not recognize significantly the precursor molecule (data not shown), as it was suggested by the assay depicted in Fig. 1 e. This may be explained by steric hindrance of the binding of the specific IgGs to the pro-CHH, because of the extension of the molecule on the N-terminal side of the peptide chain. This hypothesis was demonstrated by immunoassays with synthetic peptides (Fig. 4), which showed that thegp-anti-pQL antiserum recognized specifically the Glu and pGlu N-terminally ending octapeptides containing a phenylalanyl residue in the l-configuration exclusively. Consequently, the gp-anti-pQL antiserum labeling in the d-cells very likely visualizes the unblocked form of CHH generated by prohormone cleavage, before inversion of the chirality of the Phe3 residue, which fully agrees with biochemical data. The isomerization process is clearly evidenced by the reactivity of the secretory granules with the r-anti-pQDantiserum. Variations in the relative amounts of l and dimmunoreactive material observed between different d-cells (Fig. 3, c and d) may be explained if prohormone cleavage and Phe3 isomerization are occurring with different kinetics. In this context, it is interesting to note that the only peptide isomerase characterized to date, that from A. aperta venom, inverts the Ser46 of agatoxin with a rather low efficiency, because only 65% of thel-Ser-containing toxin may be isomerized, even after several days of incubation with enzyme preparation (9Heck S.D. Siok C.J. Krapcho K.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Thadeio P.F. Welsh M.J. Williams R.D. Ganong A.H. Kelly M.E. Lanzetti A.J. Gray W.R. Phillips D. Parks T.N. Jackson H. Ahlijanian M.K. Saccomano N.A. Volkman R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), probably as a result of reaction reversibility. The situation is very different in crustacean neurosecretory cells producing the d-isomer of CHH, where all of the [l-Phe3]CHH seems isomerized during the maturation process, before the secretory granules leave the perikaryon to migrate within the axon to the neurohemal organ. Although a precise timing of the different events has not been made, it was established in another study (15Ollivaux C. Soyez D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that mature radiolabeled CHH and [d-Phe3]CHH are already present at the X-organ level 3 h after the beginning of the experiment. In the medulla terminalis containing the X-organ-sinus gland complex, axonal arborizations from the two CHH cell types were clearly segregated (Fig. 3 e). These structures being classically considered as important regulatory input areas (21Van Herp F. Coast G.M. Webster S. Recent Advances in Arthropod Endocrinology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1998: 53-70Google Scholar), their spatial organizations suggest a differential nervous regulation of the two cell types. This is in agreement with physiological data indicating distinct functions for CHH and d-[Phe3]CHH (12Keller R. Kegel G. Reichwein B. Sedlmeier D. Soyez D. Roubos E.W. Wendelar Bonga S.E. Vaudry H. De Loof A. Recent Developments in Comparative Endocrinology and Neurobiology. Shaker, Nijmegen, The Nederlands1999: 209-212Google Scholar). In the axonal tract, axons from d-cells were grouped together (Fig. 3 f), but in the sinus gland l- andd-axon terminals were not segregated but rather tightly intermingled (Fig. 3, g and h). We have demonstrated in the present work that the isomerization process is an integral part of the cascade of prohormone processing events. A comprehensive maturation scheme of the CHH precursor in thed-cells is proposed Fig.5. Although our results indicate that isomerization is realized before CHH N-terminal cyclization, the possibility that this process occurs to some extent on mature (blocked) CHH cannot be excluded, depending upon the substrate specificity of the putative enzyme, which is not known at the moment. A intriguing aspect of the post-translational isomerization of peptides is the strict positional specificity. This process affects only one given residue near the extremity of the molecule. For example, Phe3 of lobster CHH is epimerized, but Phe17 is not (6Soyez D. Van Herp F. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Tensen C.P. Lafont R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may be explained by an optimal accessibility of the peptide termini to a putative modifying enzyme; however, the existence of site-specific recognition, well known for other enzymes such as prohormone convertases (22Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Chrétien M. Vaudry H. Tonon M.C. Roubos E.W. De Loof A. Trends in Comparative Endocrinology and Neurobiology. From Molecular to Integrative Biology. 839. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, New York1998: 9-24Google Scholar) cannot be ruled out. To date, this cannot be yet demonstrated when considering the wide variation of the amino acid motifs surrounding the isomerization site in the fewd-amino acid containing peptides described so far. Moreover, the modified residue differs according to the peptide considered (i.e. alanyl in dermorphin, methionyl in dermenkephalin, asparagyl in fulicin, phenylalanyl in CHH, etc.). This strongly suggests the existence of a family of peptide isomerases with different substrate specificities. The nature and specificity of the members of this putative enzyme family remains to be elucidated. To date, the only enzyme with a proposed peptide isomerase activity isolated so far belongs to the widely distributed subtilisin-like serine protease family (23Shikata Y. Watanabe T. Teramoto T. Inoue A. Kawakami Y. Nishizawa K. Katayama K. Kuwada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16719-16723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), like the prohormone convertases. The modification of the chirality of a given residue in a peptide chain constitutes an elegant way to increase structural diversity and hence to diversify properties and functions from a given genomic motif. Considering the broad range of animal groups where d-amino acid containing peptides have been described (molluscs, arachnids, crustaceans, amphibians), it is tempting to speculate that such a phenomenon should exist in other groups as well, including higher organisms like mammals and humans. The demonstration of this hypothesis as well as further investigations into the occurrence and physiological significance of such a mechanism is a fascinating research goal.

They can be superficial with damage limited to the epithelium or associated with a deeper involvement of the epithelial basement membrane and of the stromal lamella. Severe recurrent and persistent corneal wounds are most commonly secondary to ocular diseases and damage such as recurrent erosion, mild chemical burns, superficial herpetic infections, neuroparalytic cornea, autoimmune diseases, and stromal ulcerations due to viral or bacterial infections or to severe burns (1Reim M. Kottek A. Schrage N. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 183-225Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite currently available treatments, many of these corneal wounds persist for weeks and months or else recur frequently and can progress to corneal perforation. Tissue repair requires cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion. Cell adhesion and migration in turn require extracellular matrix (ECM)1 synthesis and assembly. ECM is a complex, cross-linked structure of proteins and polysaccharides. It organizes the geometry of normal tissues. Fibronectin (FN) is an ECM adhesion protein identified as a potential wound healing agent because of its cell attachment, migration, differentiation, and orientation properties (for a review see Refs. 2Humphries M.J.

The increase in FN expression that has been reported to occur during corneal wound healing was postulated to be coordinated with the expression of its major integrin receptor α5β1 (5Murakami J.

Med. 1992; 120: 86-93PubMed Google Scholar), as has also been shown for laminin and tenascin and their corresponding integrin receptor subunits α6 and α9, respectively (19Garana R.M. Petroll W.M.

As a consequence, it is not surprising that ECM, through its interactions with membrane-bound integrins, exerts profound influences on the major cellular program of growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by altering, through a number of signal transduction pathways, the transcription of genes whose specific functions are linked to these cellular functions. Binding of ECM components, such as FN, with their corresponding integrin receptors will trigger the activation of intracellular signaling mediators such as focal adhesion kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and Rho family GTPases (for a review see Ref. 27Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Activation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway is of particular interest since it links integrin-mediated signaling to transcriptional regulation of genes that are crucial for cell growth and differentiation. The results presented hereby provided evidence that, by acting on α5 gene expression, such a route of signal transduction might alter cell adhesion properties as well. The downstream cascade of family members that are activated following transient activation of Ras GTP-binding proteins through receptor tyrosine kinases include MAPK/ERK kinase (designated MEK) and ERK1 (p44)/ERK2 (p42) (28Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1/ERK2 through phosphorylation causes their translocation to the nucleus, where they have been reported to phosphorylate and activate distinct transcription factors, such as ELK, c-Jun, and c-Myc (29Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 1921-1933Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 30Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 31Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P.

McCormick F. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that FN can alter the transcription of the α5 integrin subunit gene at the promoter level. Such a FN responsiveness was shown to be determined by the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to a target site that is part of a perfect inverted repeat which, by itself, can confer FN responsiveness to an otherwise unresponsive heterologous promoter. Most of all, the FN-activated, integrin-mediated signal transduction pathway appears to require activation of ERK1/ERK2 since the Sp1 DNA binding affinity, and, as a consequence, the FN responsiveness of the α5 promoter were both found to be diminished by blocking their activation with the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059. Together, these results demonstrate the novel finding that the α5integrin subunit, through activation of the MAPK pathway, can autoregulate its own synthesis in a manner that is dependent on the extracellular concentration of FN. Rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCECs) were obtained from the central area of freshly dissected rabbit corneas as described previously (33Boisjoly H.M. Laplante C. Bernatchez S.F. Salesse C. Giasson M. Joly M.-C. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and then grown to low (near 15% coverage of the plates), intermediate (near 75% coverage), or high cell density (100% coverage for more than 48 h) under 5% CO2 in SHEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. When indicated, human plasma FN (obtained as described previously (34Regnault V. Rivat C. Geshier C. Stoltz J.F. Rev. Fr. Transfus. Hemobiol. 1990; 33: 391-405PubMed Google Scholar)) or ECM gel (basement membrane matrice from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, Fisher) was coated for 18 h at 37 °C on the culture dishes at varying concentrations (FN, 1–16 μg per cm2; ECM, 10 μg per cm2). Coated Petri dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked at 37 °C with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then seeded and grown as above. Inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 was performed by culturing subconfluent RCEC in the presence of 10 μm of the MEK/kinase inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma) for 48 h before cells were harvested. Drosophila Schneider cells (ATCC CRL-1963) were cultured at 28 °C without CO2in Schneider medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. The plasmids α5−41, α5−92, α5−178, and α5−954, which all bear the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene fused to DNA fragments from the human α5 gene upstream regulatory sequence extending up to 5′ positions −41, −92, −178, and −954, respectively, but all sharing a common 3′ end located at position +23, have been described previously (35Birkenmeier T.M.

The recombinant plasmids bearing one or two sense copies of either the α5 FRE or its mutant derivatives were created by inserting the corresponding double-stranded oligomers upstream from the basal promoter of the mouse p12 gene (into the uniqueBamHI site) that has been previously mutated into its Sp1-binding site (and designated p12.108/M (36Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). The Sp1 expression vector pPacSp1 was generously provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (Institute für Molecular Biology und Tumorforschung, Philipps Universität Marburg, Germany), whereas the LacZ expression plasmid pAC5/V5-His/LacZ was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the present study were chemically synthesized using a Biosearch 8700 apparatus (Millipore). They contained the DNA sequence from the human α5promoter comprised between positions −82 and −56 and designated the α5 FRE (5′-GATCAGCCGGGAGTTTGGCAAACTCCTCCCC-3′) or its mutated derivatives (α5FRE/m5′, 5′-GATCAGCCGAAAAATTGGCAAACTCCTCCCC-3′; α5FRE/m3′, 5′-GATCAGCCGGGAGTTTGGCAAACTAAAAAAC-3′; α5FRE/m5′+3′, 5′-GATCAGCCGAAAAATTGGCAAACTAAAAAAC-3′), the DNA binding site for human HeLa CTF/NF-I in adenovirus type 2 (5′-GATCTTATTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGAG-3′) (37De Vries E. Van Driel W. Van den Heuvel S.J.L. Van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the high affinity binding site for the positive transcription factor Sp1 (5′-GATCATATCTGCGGGGCGGGGCAGACACAG-3′) (38Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), or the Sp1-binding site (designated p12.A) identified in the basal promoter from the mouse p12 gene (5′-GATCCAGTGGGTGGAGCCTG-3′) (36Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RCEC plated at either low (5 × 104 cells per 35-mm tissue culture plates), intermediate (5 × 105 cells per 35-mm tissue culture plates), or high (1, 5 × 106 cells per 35-mm tissue culture plates) cell density were transiently transfected using the polycationic detergent LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Each LipofectAMINE-transfected plate received 1.5 μg of the test plasmid and 0.5 μg of the human growth hormone (hGH)-encoding plasmid pXGH5 (39Selden R.F. Burke-Howie K. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). DrosophilaSchneider cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (36Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guérin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 60-mm culture plate. Levels of CAT activity for all transfected cells were determined as described (40Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guérin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and normalized to the amount of hGH secreted into the culture media and assayed using a kit for quantitative measurement of hGH (Immunocorp, Montréal, Québec, Canada). Because the metallothionein-I promoter, which directs expression of hGH from the pXGH5 plasmid, proved to be highly inefficient inDrosophila cells, CAT activities from transfected Schneider cells were normalized to the amount of β-galactosidase encoded by the plasmid pAC5/V5-His/LacZ and cotransfected along with the CAT recombinant constructs. Each cell-containing plate therefore received 15 μg of the test plasmid, 4 μg of pAC5/V5-His/LacZ, and 1 μg of pPAC (empty vector). In the cotransfection experiments performed with the Sp1 expression plasmid, the empty pPAC was substituted for 1 μg of pPacSp1. The value presented for each individual test plasmid transfected corresponds to the mean of at least three separate transfections done in triplicate. To be considered significant, each individual value needed to be at least three times over the background level caused by the reaction buffer used (usually corresponding to 0.15% chloramphenicol conversion). Standard deviation is also provided for each transfected CAT plasmid. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from RCEC grown solely on plastic or FN-coated culture dishes and dialyzed against DNase I buffer (50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mmK3PO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) as described (41Roy R. Gosselin P. Guérin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar) except that a combination of protease inhibitors (pepstatin A (0.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), chymostatin (5 μg/ml), antipain (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), benzamidine (5 mm)) (all reagents from Sigma) was added to all the buffers used in order to restrict proteolysis. Extracts were kept frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C until use. EMSAs were carried out using either the 27-bp α5 FRE or the high affinity Sp1 oligomer as 5′ end-labeled probes. Approximately 2 × 104 cpm labeled DNA was incubated with crude nuclear proteins (as specified in the figure legends) from RCEC grown on either untreated or FN-coated culture dishes in the presence of 500 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer D (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol (v/v), 25 mm KCl, 0.05 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.125 mmphenyl methosulfonyl fluoride). Occasionally, crude nuclear extracts from human HeLa cells were also used in EMSA as a positive control for comparison purposes. Incubation proceeded at room temperature for 10 min upon which time DNA-protein complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis through 6% native polyacrylamide gels run against Tris glycine buffer as described (42Schneider R. Dorper T. Gander I. Mertz R. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1303-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C to reveal the position of the shifted DNA-protein complexes generated. Competitions in EMSA were performed using 10 μg of crude nuclear proteins from RCEC grown in the presence of FN at 8 μg per cm2 as above except that molar excesses (100- and 500-fold) of synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the DNA sequence of the α5 FRE, the DNA-binding site for human HeLa CTF/NF-I in adenovirus type 2 (37De Vries E. Van Driel W. Van den Heuvel S.J.L. Van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the high affinity binding site for the positive transcription factor Sp1 (38Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), or the p12.A Sp1-binding site from the mouse p12 gene (36Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were added to the binding reaction prior to loading on the gel. Supershift experiments in EMSA were conducted by first incubating varying amounts (as specified in the figure legends) of crude nuclear proteins from RCEC grown either with (8 μg per cm2) or without FN, in the presence of 250 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), with either none or 1 μl (corresponding to 1 μg) of a commercially engineered rabbit antiserum raised against the transcription factor Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in buffer D. Then, 2 × 104 cpm FRE-labeled probe was added, and incubation was extended for another 15 min at room temperature. Samples were finally loaded on high ionic strength, 6% native polyacrylamide gels and run at 4 °C against Tris glycine buffer as above. Formation of DNA-protein complexes was revealed following autoradiography at −70 °C. Crude nuclear proteins were obtained from either HeLa cells (used as a positive control) or from RCEC grown on culture dishes coated or not with FN (8 μg per cm2) as detailed above. Protein concentration was evaluated by the Bradford procedure and further validated following Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide fractionated nuclear proteins. One volume of sample buffer (6 m urea, 63 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, 0,00125% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was added to 20 μg of proteins before they were size-fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. A full set of protein molecular mass markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) was also loaded as a control to evaluate protein sizes. The blot was then washed once in TS buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) and 4 times (5 min each at 22 °C) in TSM buffer (TS buffer plus 5% (w/v) fat free Carnation milk and 0.1% Tween 20). Then, a 1:500 dilution of a rabbit monoclonal antibody raised against the transcription factor Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the membrane-containing TSM buffer and incubation proceeded further for 4 h at 22 °C. The blot was then washed in TSM buffer and incubated an additional 1 h at 22 °C in a 1:1000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The membrane was successively washed in TSM (4 times, 5 min each) and TS (twice, 5 min each) buffers before immunoreactive complexes were revealed using Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and autoradiographed. Studies conducted by Rajagopal et al. (23Rajagopal S. Huang S. Albitar M. Chakrabarty S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and Huang et al. (24Huang S. Varani J. Chakrabarty S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) both provided evidence that the level of expression for the mRNA encoding the α5 integrin subunit was positively modulated by the presence of the extracellular matrix component fibronectin. We therefore exploited transient transfection of primary cultured RCEC using recombinant plasmids bearing the CAT reporter gene fused to various segments from the human α5 gene promoter (35Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Boedeker E.D. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20544-20549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in order to evaluate whether such an FN-dependent increase in α5 mRNA could be determined by discrete cis-acting elements from the α5 gene upstream regulatory region. For this purpose, a recombinant plasmid bearing the α5promoter up to position −954 (α5-954) inserted upstream from the CAT reporter gene was transfected into RCEC plated either on plastic or FN-coated culture dishes (2 μg/cm2) at varying cell densities. As Fig. 1 Aindicates, culturing RCEC on FN-coated Petris did not alter the activity driven by the α5−954 plasmid when transfected at low cell density (near 15% coverage of the plates). However, at both intermediate (near 75% coverage) and high (100% coverage for more than 48 h) cell density, the activity of the α5promoter was found to be 6.1- and 6.4-fold, respectively, higher when cells are grown on FN-coated culture plates rather than solely on plastic. Withdrawal of the serum contained into the culture medium (which normally contains 5% FBS) prior to cell seeding on FN-coated culture dishes had no statistical effect on the CAT activity directed by α5−954 (results not presented). The dose dependence of the α5 promoter FN responsiveness was next evaluated by transfecting RCEC plated at an intermediate cell density on culture dishes coated with either none or increasing concentrations of FN (from 1 to 16 μg/cm2). As shown on Fig. 1 B, the activity directed by the α5−954 plasmid increased proportionally to the amount of FN coated on the culture dishes, reaching a drastic 18-fold stimulation at 16 μg/cm2 FN. No further increase in α5promoter function was observed at FN concentrations above 16 μg/cm2 (results not presented). We therefore conclude that the activity of the human α5 promoter can be drastically increased when RCEC are grown on FN-coated culture dishes and that such a positive influence is obviously cell density-dependent. Discrete cis-acting regulatory elements are known to mediate many of the regulatory effects that are triggered through signal transduction pathways by binding trans-acting nuclear proteins with distinctive regulatory properties. To determine more precisely the minimal α5 promoter sequence required to confer FN responsiveness, CAT recombinant plasmids bearing various 5′ deletions of the α5 promoter were transfected into RCEC grown at intermediate density on both plastic and FN-coated (2 μg/cm2) culture dishes. Neither the deletion of the α5 promoter down to position −178 nor −92 could prevent the average 5-fold increase in α5 promoter activity observed when RCEC are grown on FN-coated plates. However, the further deletion of the α5 sequences down to position −41 almost totally abolished the FN responsiveness of the α5promoter. A detailed examination of this 41-bp sequence revealed the presence of a perfect inverted repeat of the following sequence, 5′-GGAGTTTG-3′ (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, FN responsiveness of the α5 promoter appears to be determined by a short stretch of DNA sequence contained between positions −41 and −92 relative to the α5 mRNA start site. Apart from FN, proteins such as collagen IV, vitronectin, entactin, and laminin are also commonly found in the extracellular matrix. We examined whether components from the ECM other than FN can also alter the expression directed by the α5 promoter in RCEC. For this purpose, RCEC were grown to intermediate cell density on either untreated or ECM-coated culture dishes before they were transiently transfected with the α5−954 plasmid. The ECM gel (basement membrane matrice from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, Fisher) contains laminin, collagen IV, entactin, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans but no FN. As shown on Fig. 3 A, the CAT activity driven by α5−954 is increased by only 2.5-fold when RCEC are grown on ECM-coated dishes (10 μg/cm2). The CAT activity directed by the α5 promoter was raised to 4-fold when both FN (2 μg/cm2) and the ECM gel (10 μg/cm2) are coated together on the culture dishes. However, optimal promoter activation was obtained when FN (2 μg/cm2) was coated alone on the culture plates (7.6-fold activation). Transient transfection of RCEC plated on ECM-coated culture dishes with the recombinant plasmids bearing the various 5′ deletions of the α5 promoter identified the ECM-responsive element somewhere between positions −178 and −954 (Fig. 3 B). We conclude that components from the ECM other than FN had only a moderate effect on the α5 promoter activity and that their action is mediated through a cis-acting element distinct from that which determines FN responsiveness in RCEC.Figure 7The α5 FRE can confer FN responsiveness to the basal promoter of the heterologous p12 gene. A, a synthetic oligonucleotide bearing the α5 inverted repeat from position −82 to −56 (α5 FRE) was inserted in either one (in plasmid p12/FRE) or two sense copies (in plasmid p12/2xFRE) upstream from the bas"

We have recently cloned a multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster(Dm-dNK), and we have shown that the enzyme phosphorylates cytotoxic pyrimidine and purine nucleoside analogs. The broad substrate specificity of the enzyme, as well as its very high catalytic rate, makes it a unique member of the nucleoside kinase enzyme family. In the present study, we evaluated Dm-dNK as a suicide gene by constructing a replication-deficient retroviral vector that expresses the enzyme. The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 and a thymidine kinase-deficient osteosarcoma cell line were transduced with the recombinant virus. We showed that Dm-dNK can be expressed in human cells, that the enzyme retained its enzymatic activity, and that it is localized in the cell nuclei due to a nuclear localization signal in its C-terminal region. The cells expressingDm-dNK exhibited increased sensitivity to several cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, such as 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, and 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine.

The HSV-1 TK gene is introduced into cancer cells using either viral or non-viral vectors. The nucleoside kinase phosphorylates nucleoside analogs such as the guanosine analog ganciclovir to their monophosphate derivatives, and cellular enzymes further phosphorylate the compounds to their triphosphate forms. Ganciclovir triphosphate interferes with DNA replication (6Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19039-19044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and induces cell death, probably by apoptosis (7Freeman S.M. Abboud C.N. Whartenby K.A. Packman C.H. Koeplin D.S.

This phenomenon, known as the “bystander effect,” results in killing of a larger portion of cells than those transduced with the suicide gene. One limiting factor for the efficiency of suicide gene therapy is the kinetic properties of the “suicide” nucleoside kinase.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have purified a nucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster that catalyzed the phosphorylation of all the natural pyrimidine and purine deoxyribonucleosides. In addition to its broad substrate specificity, the enzyme also exhibited a high catalytic rate that is 10–100-fold higher than reported for the previously studied nucleoside kinases. The broad substrate specificity of this enzyme, together with its high catalytic rate, makes it a unique member of the human and viral nucleoside kinase enzyme family. We have recently cloned the cDNA of this multisubstrate enzyme, named D. melanogasterdeoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK), and shown that it also efficiently phosphorylates several anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside analogs (21Johansson M. Van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23814-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we decided to evaluate the possible use of Dm-dNK as a suicide gene by expressing the enzyme in human cancer cell lines. In summary, we have shown thatDm-dNK can be expressed in human cells with retained enzymatic activity and that it increases the sensitivity of the cells to several cytotoxic nucleoside analogs. We used a retrovirus vector based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus to generate a replication-deficient recombinant retrovirus containing the cDNA of Dm-dNK. Oligonucleotide primers containing engineered EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites were designed flanking the open reading frame ofDm-dNK cDNA (5′-AAGAATTCGGACTGATGGCGGAGGCAGCATCC and 5′-TTCTCGAGTGGTTATCTGGCGACCCTCTGGC). The primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction, and the DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI site of the pLXSN plasmid vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid was purified using the NucleoBond plasmid purification kit (CLONTECH). The DNA sequence of the constructed plasmid was verified by DNA sequence determination using an ABI310 automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RetroPack PT67 packaging cells (CLONTECH) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The constructed pLXSN plasmid vector was transfected into the packaging cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technology. Inc.) according to the protocol provided by the supplier. The medium from the transfected cells was collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and diluted 2-fold with fresh medium. The virus-containing medium was subsequently used to transduce the cancer cell lines as described below. TK-deficient osteosarcoma cells was a kind gift from Prof. J. Balzarini, Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium. MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a gas phase of 5% CO2. The cells lines were transduced with the retrovirus containing medium mixed with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. The cells were incubated for 48 h and then cultured continuously for 3 weeks in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell protein extracts were prepared as described (22Arnér E.S.J. Spasokoukotskaja T. Eriksson S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm NaF, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.6 μg of protein extract in a total volume of 35 μl. 2.5 μm[methyl-3H]dThd (Moravek Biochem), 3 μm[5-3H]-1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) (Moravek Biochem), or 3 μm[8-3H]-2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (CdA) (Moravek Biochem) were used in the assays and mixed with equivalent amounts of unlabeled substrates. The araC phosphorylation assay mixtures were supplemented with 50 μm tetrahydrouridine to inhibit deamination of araC by cytidine deaminase. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on Whatman DE-81 filters after 10-, 20-, and 30-min incubation at 37 °C. The filters were washed three times in 5 mmammonium formate. The nucleoside monophosphates were eluted from the filter with 0.5 m KCl, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides (Nunc, Inc.) for 24 h and subsequently labeled with [methyl-3H]dThd (Moravek Biochem) for 12 h. The slides were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed 10 min in methanol:acetic acid (3:1), and washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, once with water, and once with methanol. The slides were coated with Hypercoat photoemulsion (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed 1–3 weeks at 4 °C. The autoradiograms were developed using D-11 developer (Eastman Kodak Co.). We used the pEGFP-N1 plasmid vector (CLONTECH) to express theDm-dNK cDNA in fusion with the green fluorescent protein (dNK-GFP). Oligonucleotide primers containing engineeredEcoRI and SalI restriction enzyme sites were used to clone the open reading frame of Dm-dNK cDNA (5′-AAGAATTCGGACTGATGGCGGAGGCAGCATCC and 5′-ATGTCGACCTGGCGACCCTCTGGCGCTTGC) into theEcoRI-SalI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector. The C-terminal mutations (Δ247/dNK-GFP and Δ244–245/dNK-GFP) were introduced by using two extended 3′-oligonucleotide primers (5′-ATGTCGACCTGGCGACGCTCTGGCGCTTGCTGGGC and 5′-ATGTCGACCTGCGACCCTCTGGCTCTCGCTGGGCGACAC). The plasmids were transfected into the cell lines using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described above. The nuclei of the cells were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed in a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a SPOT RT digital camera. 9-β-d-Arabinofuranosyladenine (araA), araC, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine (araT), ganciclovir, and CdA were obtained from Sigma. 2′,2′-Difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) was obtained from Lilly. 9-β-d-Arabinofuranosylguanine (araG), (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine (BVDU), and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) were gifts from Prof. J. Balzarini, Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium. The cells were plated at ≈2000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Nucleoside analogs were added after 24 h, and the medium containing the nucleoside analogs was changed daily. Cell survival was assayed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after 4 days of drug exposure. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The IC50 value of the investigated compounds was calculated as the mean value of these experiments. We used a retrovirus vector based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus to create replication-deficient recombinant retroviridae with (dNK-pLXSN) and without (pLXSN) the Dm-dNK cDNA (Fig. 1). A TK1-deficient human osteosarcoma cell line and an MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line were transduced with the retroviridae, and polyclonal populations of stably transfected cells were selected. We used autoradiography to visualize in situ incorporation of [3H]dThd into DNA of the thymidine kinase 1-deficient osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2). The wild-type untransduced cells and the cells transduced with the pLXSN vector alone showed a faint dotted autoradiography pattern distributed throughout the cells, indicating phosphorylation of dThd by mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 and its subsequent incorporation into mitochondrial DNA (23Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cells expressingDm-dNK exhibited dark staining of the cell nucleus indicating incorporation of [3H]dThd into nuclear DNA. Approximately 90% of the cells incorporated dThd in nuclear DNA, indicating that the majority of the transduced cancer cells expressed active Dm-dNK. To quantify the total level of nucleoside kinase activity in the cells, we determined the phosphorylation of dThd, CdA, and araC in cell protein extracts (Fig. 3). Untransfected osteosarcoma cells deficient in cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 activity showed low levels of dThd phosphorylation, probably catalyzed by mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (23Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells transduced with the pLXSN retroviral vector alone showed similar levels of dThd phosphorylation as the wild-type cells, whereas the cells transfected with dNK-pLXSN exhibited ≈100-fold higher enzymatic activity than the parent cell line. Untransfected MIA PaCa-2 cells exhibited a higher basal level of dThd phosphorylating activity compared with the osteosarcoma cells due to the retained expression of TK1 in the pancreatic cells. However, the Dm-dNK expression increased the dThd kinase activity ≈35-fold in the MIA PaCa-2 cells as well. The phosphorylation of CdA and araC in the cell protein extracts were also increased 4–15-fold in the Dm-dNK-transduced osteosarcoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells compared with the untransfected parent cell lines and the cells transfected with pLXSN vector alone (Fig. 3). In summary, these experiments showed that human cancer cells transduced with the dNK-pLXSN retroviral vector expressed enzymatically active Dm-dNK and that the expression resulted in an increase of nucleoside and nucleoside analog phosphorylation. We determined the sensitivity of the untransduced cells and the cells transduced with either the retroviral vector alone or the dNK-pLXSN vector for several cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (TableI). The cytotoxicity (IC50) was determined after 4 days of drug exposure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The difference in sensitivity between the wild-type cell lines and the cells transduced with the pLXSN vector without Dm-dNK was less than 3-fold for all investigated compounds. Both the osteosarcoma cells and the pancreatic cancer cells that expressed Dm-dNK showed an increase in sensitivity to several of the nucleoside analogs. The highest increase in sensitivity for the osteosarcoma cell was detected for BVDU, CdA, dFdC, and FdUrd with a 100–400-fold decrease in IC50 compared with the untransduced cells. araC and araT showed ≈50-fold reduction in IC50, whereas araA and ganciclovir showed between 3- and 9-fold reduction in IC50 compared with the untransduced cells. araG was not toxic to either cell line at the investigated concentrations. The highest increase in sensitivity for the MIA PaCa-2 cells was observed for BVDU with a >6400-fold increased sensitivity. araT and dFdC increased the sensitivity 30- and 75-fold, respectively. CdA showed a 6-fold increase in sensitivity in theDm-dNK-expressing cells, whereas the sensitivity of araA, araC, FdUrd, and ganciclovir was not enhanced by Dm-dNK expression in this cell line.Table ISensitivity (IC50) of osteosarcoma and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to nucleoside analogsOsteosarcoma (μm)MIA-PaCa (μm)wtpLXSNDm-dNKwtpLXSNDm-dNKAraA14264.54.54.21.3araC0.280.310.00510.090.090.075araG>50>50>50>50>50>50araT17110.3216270.53BVDU2.01.90.022>50>500.0078CdA5.09.00.0224.94.90.82dFdC0.0670.0770.000360.0710.0650.00094FdUrd5.83.50.0540.010.0080.006GCV9.0163.2>50>50>50wt, wild type; GCV, ganciclovir.

In order to determine the subcellular location of the Dm-dNK when overexpressed in human cells, we constructed a fusion ofDm-dNK and GFP to visualize the protein in vivo(dNK-GFP) (Fig. 4). The cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the fusion protein exhibited green fluorescence predominantly in the nucleus of the cells. The nuclear location was verified by contra-staining the cells with DAPI. Based on sequence analysis Munch-Petersen and co-workers (25Munch-Petersen B. Knecht W. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Piskur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6673-6679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggested two possible nuclear localization signals starting at residue 95 (PTNKKLK) and 242 (PSKRQRV). We decided to test the role of the putative nuclear localization signal in the C terminus of the protein in an experiment using site-directed mutagenesis. The putative nuclear localization signal was mutated by either replacing Arg-247 with a serine residue (Δ247/dNK-GFP) or by replacing Lys-244 and Arg-245 with glutamic acid and serine amino acid residues, respectively (Δ244–245/dNK-GFP). When expressed in the osteosarcoma cell line, Δ247/dNK-GFP and Δ244–245/dNK-GFP were both retained in the cytosol and did not translocate to the cell nucleus (Fig. 4). In summary, these experiments showed that the nuclear localization of Dm-dNK in human cells is mediated by the C-terminal signal sequence. Here we have shown that the multisubstrate nucleoside kinase ofD. melanogaster retains its enzymatic activity when expressed in human cells and that the activity results in an enhanced sensitivity to several cytotoxic pyrimidine and purine nucleoside analogs. These results suggest that Dm-dNK may be used as a suicide gene in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. Two of the most promising candidate nucleoside analogs to use in conjunction withDm-dNK gene transfer are the pyrimidine analogs dFdC and BVDU. dFdC is currently used in the treatment of several types of solid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (26Hui Y.F. Reitz J. Am. J. Health-Syst. Pharm. 1997; 54: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It may be possible to increase the efficiency of this therapy by transduction of tumor cells in vivo with theDm-dNK gene. BVDU, the second candidate nucleoside analog, was initially developed as an anti-herpetic agent, and the compound has been used to treat patients with varicella zoster infections (27Wildiers J. De Clercq E. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1984; 20: 471-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BVDU shows low toxicity to untransduced cells, but the cells expressingDm-dNK are highly sensitive to the compound. The concurrent use of both a nucleoside analog that is restricted to Dm-dNK for activation, such as BVDU, and a nucleoside analog that already has shown clinical efficacy in treatment of malignant tumors, such as dFdC, is one possible approach to develop new treatment modalities for tumors with combined gene and chemotherapy. Combining the therapy with other anti-metabolites to achieve synergistic effects may be another approach to enhance the efficiency of nucleoside kinase suicide gene therapy. Recent studies on HSV-1 TK-transduced cancer cells suggest that synergistic cytotoxicity and enhanced bystander effects may be achieved when combining ganciclovir with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (28Boucher P.D. Ostruszka L.J. Shewach D.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1631-1636PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase results in decreased de novo dNTP synthesis, which is favorable for the incorporation of nucleoside analogs into DNA. Furthermore, a decrease of the dNTP pool may also increase the phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs because several nucleoside kinases are feedback-inhibited by dNTPs. The nucleoside analogs dFdC and CdA are both potent inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase once phosphorylated to their diphosphate forms. Because Dm-dNK phosphorylates both of these compounds, it is possible that they will inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and thereby enhance the phosphorylation of BVDU or other nucleoside analogs that are activated by Dm-dNK. We are presently initiating studies on tumor models to investigate further the possible use of Dm-dNK as a suicide gene in vivoand to evaluate the possible benefits of combining multiple nucleoside analogs to improve this therapeutic regime. The unique features of Dm-dNK as a suicide gene compared with HSV-1 TK and other nucleoside kinases are its broad substrate specificity and high catalytic rate. Pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides have in vitro higher affinity to the enzyme compared with purine deoxyribonucleosides (20Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Johansson M. Van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6673-6679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The difference in affinity between purine and pyrimidine nucleosides is also observed for some, but not all, nucleoside analogs. Enzymatic assays performed with recombinant Dm-dNK show that pyrimidine nucleoside analogs such as BVDU, FdUrd, araC, and araT compete more efficiently with the natural pyrimidine substrates dThd and dCyd compared with most of the investigated purine nucleoside analogs such as araG and araA (21Johansson M. Van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23814-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, one of the exceptions is the clinically important purine nucleoside analog CdA, which efficiently competes with both dThd and dCyd for phosphorylation by Dm-dNK. This compound did also show a marked increase in cytotoxicity in theDm-dNK-transfected cells. Studies on HSV-1 TK-transfected cells suggest that the purine phosphorylating activity in vivo may be increased by mutations that decreases the enzymes affinity to pyrimidine nucleoside analogs (29Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Adman E.T. Black M.E. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We are currently initiating studies to investigate if a similar approach can be used to enhance purine nucleoside analog phosphorylation catalyzed byDm-dNK. Dm-dNK is sequence related to the human nucleoside kinases deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and thymidine kinase 2 (21Johansson M. Van Rompay A.R. Degrève B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23814-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The human enzymes differ in their subcellular location by being located in either the nucleus, cytosol, or mitochondria (23Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Johansson M. Zheng X. Zhu C. Karlsson A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that Dm-dNK is targeted to the cell nucleus when expressed in human cell lines. Two putative nuclear localization signal sequences have been identified in theDm-dNK sequence (25Munch-Petersen B. Knecht W. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Piskur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6673-6679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We showed that two independent mutants of the putative nuclear localization signal located in the C terminus of the protein completely abolished its nuclear translocation. These experiments showed that this signal is the physiologically important signal mediating the nuclear localization. We do not yet know whether the nuclear location of the enzyme is restricted to the mammalian cells used in this study or whether the enzyme is also located in the nucleus of D. melanogaster cells as well. Interestingly, HSV-1 TK is also located in the cell nucleus when expressed in human cells (33Degrève B. Johansson M. De Clercq E. Karlsson A. Balzarini J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9535-9543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the nuclear location of nucleoside kinases is, however, yet unclear, since studies suggest that phosphorylated nucleoside analogs may freely traverse the nuclear envelope, and no differences in nucleoside analogs sensitivity have been detected when nucleoside analogs are phosphorylated in either of the two subcellular compartments (30Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The success of suicide gene therapy is dependent on efficient gene delivery systems and the selective expression of the suicide gene in tumor cells. Most of the in vivo studies on nucleoside kinase suicide gene therapy have been performed using first generation retro- or adenovirus vector systems (2Moolten F.L. Wells J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 3Culver K.W. Ram Z. Wallbridge S. Ishii H. Oldfield E.H. Blaese R.M.

Philippon J. the Study Group on Gene Therapy for Glioblastoma Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These systems show insufficient vector distribution and low transduction efficiencies. Recently, significant achievements in vector developments have been made for both viral and non-viral systems (34Romano G. Michell P. Pacilio C. Giordano A.D. Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Progress has also been made in achieving selective and targeted expression of the suicide gene in tumor cells. Several tissue-specific promoters have been shown to direct transgene expression to a certain tissue or cell type. These promoters include the tyrosinase promoter for transgene expression in melanocytes that may be used for targeting melanoma cells (35Siders W.M. Halloran P.J. Fenton R.G. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 281-291PubMed Google Scholar), the prostate-specific antigen promoter for selective gene expression in prostate and prostate cancer tissue (36Latham J.P. Searle P.F. Mautner V. James N.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar), and the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter for gene expression in brain tumors of glial origin (37Chen J. Bezdek T. Chang J. Kherzai A.W. Willingham T. Azzara M. Nisen P.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3504-3507PubMed Google Scholar). Several promoters of tumor marker proteins, such as the carcinoembryonic antigen (38Cao G. Kuriyama S. Gao J. Kikukawa M. Cui L. Nakatani T. Zhang X. Tsujinoue H. Pan X. Fukui H. Qi Z. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the α-fetoprotein (39Mawatari F. Tsuruta S. Ido A. Ueki T. Nakao K. Kato Y. Tamaoki T. Ishii N. Nakata K. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 301-306PubMed Google Scholar), can also be used to control selective transgene expression in tumor cells. Novel vector systems also utilizes receptors specific for tumor cells or other phenotypic alterations of the cancer cells to restrict vector transduction or replication to tumor cells (34Romano G. Michell P. Pacilio C. Giordano A.D. Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The recently developed oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-015 utilizes the loss of p53 function in many types of human tumors for selectivity. The ONYX-015 adenovirus cannot replicate in cells with intact p53 (40Bischoff J.R. Kirn D.H. Williams A. Heise C. Horn S. Muna M. Ng L. Nye J.A. Sampson-Johannes A. Fattaey A. McCormick F. Science. 1996; 274: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), and the virus thus only kills cells deficient in p53 expression, whereas normal cells are not killed by the virus. Initial clinical studies using the ONYX-015 virus for local treatment of tumors show promising results (41Khuri F.R. Nemunaitis J. Ganly I. Arseneau J. Tannock I.F. Romel L. Gore M. Ironside J. MacDougall R.H. Heise C. Randlev B. Gillenwater A.M. Bruso P. Kaye S.B. Hong W.K. Kirn D.H. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the efficacy may be further enhanced by the concomitant use of a suicide gene expressed by the virus (41Khuri F.R. Nemunaitis J. Ganly I. Arseneau J. Tannock I.F. Romel L. Gore M. Ironside J. MacDougall R.H. Heise C. Randlev B. Gillenwater A.M. Bruso P. Kaye S.B. Hong W.K. Kirn D.H. Nat.

In the future, it will be important to evaluate these novel vectors and expression system using the optimal prodrug/suicide gene combination to achieve the most efficient killing of transduced tumor cells as well as killing of untransduced tumor via bystander effects."
https://openalex.org/W1987826983,"The rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE) is unique among all known vertebrate PDE families for several reasons. It is a catalytic heterodimer (αβ); it is directly activated by a G-protein, transducin; and its active sites are regulated by inhibitory γ subunits. Rod PDE binds cGMP at two noncatalytic sites on the αβ dimer, but their function is unclear. We show that transducin activation of frog rod PDE introduces functional heterogeneity to both the noncatalytic and catalytic sites. Upon PDE activation, one noncatalytic site is converted from a high affinity to low affinity state, whereas the second binding site undergoes modest decreases in binding. Addition of γ to transducin-activated PDE can restore high affinity binding as well as reducing cGMP exchange kinetics at both sites. A strong correlation exists between cGMP binding and γ binding to activated PDE; dissociation of bound cGMP accompanies γ dissociation from PDE, whereas addition of either cGMP or γ to αβ dimers can restore high affinity binding of the other molecule. At the active site, transducin can activate PDE to about one-half the turnover number for catalytic αβ dimers completely lacking bound γ subunit. These results suggest a mechanism in which transducin interacts primarily with one PDE catalytic subunit, releasing its full catalytic activity as well as inducing rapid cGMP dissociation from one noncatalytic site. The state of occupancy of the noncatalytic sites on PDE determines whether γ remains bound to activated PDE or dissociates from the holoenzyme, and may be relevant to light adaptation in photoreceptor cells.

Addition of γ to transducin-activated PDE can restore high affinity binding as well as reducing cGMP exchange kinetics at both sites. A strong correlation exists between cGMP binding and γ binding to activated PDE; dissociation of bound cGMP accompanies γ dissociation from PDE, whereas addition of either cGMP or γ to αβ dimers can restore high affinity binding of the other molecule. At the active site, transducin can activate PDE to about one-half the turnover number for catalytic αβ dimers completely lacking bound γ subunit. These results suggest a mechanism in which transducin interacts primarily with one PDE catalytic subunit, releasing its full catalytic activity as well as inducing rapid cGMP dissociation from one noncatalytic site. The state of occupancy of the noncatalytic sites on PDE determines whether γ remains bound to activated PDE or dissociates from the holoenzyme, and may be relevant to light adaptation in photoreceptor cells. phosphodiesterase from rod photoreceptors catalytic heterodimer of PDE inhibitory 10-kDa γ subunit of rod PDE α-subunit of the rod photoreceptor G-protein, transducin rod outer segments nonactivated PDE trypsin-activated PDE transducin-activated PDE guanosine 5′-O-[3-thiotriphosphate], αt-GTPγS, activated form of αt turnover number for activated PDE (units: cGMP hydrolyzed per s) based on the Pαβ dimer concentration calcium-calmodulin-dependent PDE Initiation of the phototransduction cascade in vertebrate rod photoreceptors by light results in the sequential activation of the visual pigment (rhodopsin), the photoreceptor G-protein (transducin), and the effector enzyme (cGMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.35), PDE)1 (for reviews see Refs. 1Stryer L.

We demonstrate a direct correlation between occupancy of cGMP at the noncatalytic sites of PDE and the state of association of the inhibitory Pγ subunit. Our results are consistent with transducin activation reducing cGMP binding affinity primarily at one of the two high affinity, noncatalytic sites on PDE. Furthermore, transducin activation of PDE cannot achieve the maximum catalytic potential of PDE that is observed when the Pγ subunits are completely removed from the Pαβ catalytic dimer. These changes in the noncatalytic and catalytic sites upon transducin activation are mediated through changes in Pγ interaction with Pαβ upon binding of transducin to PDE. The coordinated, allosteric regulation of cGMP and Pγ binding to Pαβ upon transducin activation operate too slowly to play a role in the rapid events of rod phototransduction (i.e. excitation and recovery) but may be important in more slowly developing aspects of light adaptation.

When p53 is bound by a number of N-terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies, its rate of dissociation from DNA is reduced, and its ability to protect a cognate site from DNase I digestion is increased. Moreover, greatly reduced dissociation is observed with p53 protein lacking the N-terminal 96 amino acids. By contrast, deletion of the C terminus does not affect p53 dissociation from DNA or DNase I protection. p53 protein expressed in and purified from bacterial cells displays markedly more instability on its consensus DNA-binding site than does p53 produced in insect cells, suggesting that post-translational modifications may affect the stability of the protein.

Because the ability of p53 to bind DNA sequence-specifically is tightly correlated to its tumor suppressor activity, it is biologically relevant to investigate events that may alter the affinity of p53 for DNA. The sequence-specific DNA binding region of p53 is contained in the central conserved region of the protein (amino acids 100–300) (25Prives C. Cell. 1994; 78: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This region is flanked on the C-terminal side by a tetramerization domain (amino acids 325–356) followed by a stretch of amino acids rich in basic residues. This C-terminal region is capable of DNA strand reassociation and DNA strand transfer activities (26Brain R. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1775-1780PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T.

It has been reported that phosphorylation of the p53 N terminus, as opposed to its C terminus, is compartmentally restricted to the nucleus (59Martinez J.D. Craven M.T. Joseloff E. Milczarek G. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is possible that the p53 N terminus can be involved in interdependent interaction with the C terminus to regulate defined functions of p53. Sakaguchi et al. (60Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) reported that C-terminal acetylation requires phosphorylation of sites within the N terminus. Furthermore, phosphorylation of N-terminal Ser-15 by DNA-PK increases the recruitment of CBP/p300 (61Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), which can acetylate lysine residues within the C terminus. This acetylation can then lead to increased sequence-specific binding by p53 in vitro (62Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser-15 also weakens the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 (51Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) and with the basal transcription factor TFIID (63Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6348-6355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results concerning phosphorylation of Ser-15 might seem contradictory with regard to transcriptional activation, as tethering to transcription factors might appear to be an indispensable link to activity. However, this attests to the intricate and complex nature of p53 regulation by cellular factors. Work with antibodies, often seen as mimetics of cellular proteins, has invoked interesting questions with regard to the regulation of DNA binding by p53. To gain further insight into the possible roles of interacting proteins on the association of p53 with DNA, we have examined the effect of both N- and C-terminal antibodies on p53 dissociation. The ability of p53 to function as a transcriptional activator may rely not only on the sequences to which it binds but also on its ability to stay bound to DNA with kinetics that favor activated transcription. Our results show that the N terminus contains an auto-inhibitory region whose regulation of core DNA binding can occur via protein-protein interactions. p53 proteins were expressed and purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (64Jayaraman L. Freulich E. Prives C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sf-9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type p53 or p53ΔC30 (residues 1–363). The proteins have affixed to their second residue the HA sequence MGYPYDVPDYA. Cells were harvested and extracted 48 h post-infection, and p53 proteins were immunopurified over a column containing protein A-Sepharose matrix cross-linked to monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Bound proteins were washed and subsequently eluted with peptide containing the HA epitope YPYDVPDYA. The p53ΔN23 and p53ΔN96 proteins used in electromobility shift competition assays were constructed and expressed by similar means. Bacterially expressed human p53 central core domain (residues 96–312) was a gift from N. Pavletich and was prepared as described previously (65Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). p53 proteins expressed in E. coli were prepared as follows. The p53 cDNA was cloned into pRSETB (Invitrogen) as described in Koet al. (54Ko L.J. Shieh S.Y. Chen X. Jayaraman L. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) to produce His-tagged protein at the N terminus. The construct for p53ΔN96 was cloned after polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA fragment by using primers containing the restriction sites KpnI and BspMI. Expression of constructs was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) (Novagen) grown at 19 °C. Proteins were purified over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen). Further purification was performed via chromatography over Hi-trap heparin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) matrices. Monoclonal antibodies DO-2, DO-13, and DO-14 were obtained from Serotec. Monoclonal antibodies C-36, DO-1, PAb 1801, and PAb 421 were purified from hybridoma supernatants with protein A-Sepharose and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. EMSAs were performed as described previously (66Chen X. Farmer G. Zhu H. Prywes R. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides representing thep21 (5′-AAT TCT CGA GGA ACA TGT CCC AAC ATG TTG CTC GAG-3′) binding site were annealed, and the double-stranded species were purified on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel. The oligomer was then end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega Corp.). Each reaction mixture contained p53, monoclonal antibodies, double-stranded probe (20,000–50,000 cpm), 4 μl of 5× EMSA reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 125 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, and 10 mm MgCl2), 1 μl of 40 mmspermidine, 1 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Distilled water was added to a final volume of 20 μl, and mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition assays, 100-fold excess of unlabeled, annealed oligomers representing each relevant site were added for the appropriate time points. Mixtures were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were electrophoresed in 0.5×X TBE buffer at 200 V for 1 h at 4 °C and then dried and quantitated by PhosphorImaging using Image-Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). A 405-bpHindIII-ScaI fragment of WWP-luc (kindly provided by B. Vogelstein) representing a portion of the human p21promoter and containing the p53 response element (5′-GAA CAT GTC CCA ACA TGT TG-3′), located 2.4 kilobase pairs upstream of p21 coding sequences, was labeled with 32P via a fill-in reaction using the large fragment Klenow of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Each reaction mixture contained probe (100,000 cpm), 10 μl of 5× reaction buffer (162.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 31.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm KCl, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm spermidine, 25 ng/ml poly(dG·dC)) and 25 μl of BC100 (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). Along with indicated amounts of protein (baculovirus or bacterially expressed p53 and monoclonal antibodies), distilled water was added to a final volume of 50 μl. Binding mixtures were incubated for 40 min at room temperature, at which time 50 μl of ice-cold DNase I digestion buffer (5 mm CaCl2/10 mm MgCl2) was added to each mixture, and the tubes were removed to ice. DNase I (45 ng, Worthington) was added to each sample, and digestions proceeded for 2.5 min on ice. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 90 μl of Stop Solution (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA). DNA samples were then deproteinized by phenol/chloroform extraction and collected by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 7.5 m ammonium acetate. Pellets were washed once with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, immediately placed on ice, and loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 1 h at 25 mA after which the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The monoclonal antibody PAb 421, which recognizes amino acids 372–382 at the C terminus of p53, has been previously shown to stimulate dramatically the quantity of p53-DNA complexes that can be detected by the electromobility shift assay (EMSA) (33Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 37Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We sought to confirm this result via an alternative DNA binding assay, the DNase I footprint. A32P-labeled, 405-bp fragment of the p21 promoter containing one p53 response element was used as a binding substrate. Wild-type HA-tagged human p53 protein, which had been expressed and affinity purified from insect cells, was used as a source of protein. Increasing amounts of p53 protein conferred a dose-dependent increase in protection of the consensus DNA-binding site from DNase I digestion (Fig. 1 B). To examine the possible stimulatory effect of antibodies, we chose from preliminary binding curves a concentration of p53 yielding relatively weak protection. Surprisingly, upon titration of PAb 421 (amino acids 372–382) at ratios of antibody to p53 that were sufficient to shift completely and stimulate p53-DNA complexes in the EMSA (Fig. 1 C), we observed no increase the amount of protection provided by p53 alone (Fig. 2 A). The interaction of the p53 protein with antibody was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, if immune complexes between p53 and PAb 421 were allowed to form prior to introduction into the footprinting reactions, no stimulation was apparent (data not shown). By contrast, when an N-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody, PAb 1801 (amino acids 46–55) (70Banks L. Matlashewski G. Crawford L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), was added to the binding reaction mixtures with the same amount of p53, a significant increase in the amount of protection provided by p53 alone was observed (Fig. 2 B). This was striking in light of the fact that PAb 1801, as shown previously (71Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25468-25478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), conferred little or no effect on p53 binding in the EMSA (Fig. 1 C). It should be noted that neither PAb 421 nor PAb 1801 caused any changes in the footprinting pattern of p53 binding to its consensus sequence (i.e. identical nucleotides in the sequence were protected with and without antibody).Figure 1p53 binds to its consensus sequence in a fragment of the p21 promoter.

Lanes with equivalent amounts of p53 protein are marked with anasterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To extend the observation that PAb 1801 stimulates p53 protection of DNA from DNase I cleavage, we examined a series of antibodies that bind different N-terminal epitopes for their possible effects on sequence-specific binding by p53 (Fig. 3). By using PAb 1801 as a control for stimulation of binding, we titrated antibodies DO-2 (amino acids 10–16) (72Vojtesek B. Bartek J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 151: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), DO-1 (amino acids 20–25) (72Vojtesek B. Bartek J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. J. Immunol.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 389-393PubMed Google Scholar) into DNase I footprinting reaction mixtures that contained a fixed amount of p53 (Fig. 4). Each of the antibodies with epitopes N-terminal to the PAb 1801 epitope (amino acids 46–55) stimulated p53 protection from DNase I digestion (Fig. 4,A–C), whereas DO-14, recognizing an antigenic determinant downstream of the PAb 1801 epitope, had no effect on binding by p53 (Fig. 4 D). The abilities of all antibodies, including DO-14, to interact with p53 were confirmed in EMSA experiments that showed that p53-DNA complexes were completely shifted at similar ratios of antibody:p53 as those used in DNase I footprints (see Fig. 6 A and data not shown). Our data therefore suggest that a region within the N terminus, extending to within the vicinity of residue 55, negatively regulates sequence-specific binding by the core domain.Figure 4N-terminally directed p53 antibodies stabilize sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 in DNase I footprints.

https://openalex.org/W2001568722,"Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophilaneuronal CaMKII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified recombinant DmUba2/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S) mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120 species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt) protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates. High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype with retinal degeneration. These results suggest that normal SUMO conjugation is essential in the differentiated nervous system and reveal a potential novel mechanism that regulates neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function. Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophilaneuronal CaMKII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches.

The best studied molecule of this type is ubiquitin. Ubiquitination primed, proteosome-mediated protein degradation is involved in multiple cellular processes (1Haas A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In the initial ubiquitin conjugation step, an activating enzyme (ubiquitin activating enzyme 1) utilizes ATP to activate ubiquitin C terminus and binds to ubiquitin with an active site cysteine residue through a thioester linkage. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred to one of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (Ubcs)1 through transthiolation. Ubcs can directly (or in some cases, with the help of ubiquitin protein ligases) catalyze the isopeptidyl bond formation between ubiquitin C terminus and lysine residues in protein substrates. Polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by a multisubunit 26 S proteosome complex. A family of small modifiers bearing sequence homology to ubiquitin, the SUMO (small ubiquitin-relatedmodifier) family, has been identified recently (4Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), were shown to form a heterodimer (structurally equivalent to a ubiquitin activating enzyme 1) and function to activate the mature form of Smt3 (16Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Ubc9, a gene product required for S. cerevisiae G2-M transition (17Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), was shown to function as an Smt3 conjugating enzyme (18Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). An Smt3-specific protease, Ulp1, has been recently cloned and shown to contribute to the maturation of Smt3 precursor by cleaving after and exposing the mature end glycine residue and to cleave Smt3 from Smt3-protein conjugates (19Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Mammalian Ubc9 was also shown to be a SUMO-1 specific conjugating enzyme (20Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T.

It was shown that recombinant human Uba2, Aos1, and Ubc9 are sufficient to conjugate SUMO-1 to a human substrate, IκBα (24Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Subcellular fractionation experiments in mammalian cells showed that proteins that can form conjugates with SUMO are limited and are mostly high molecular weight nuclear proteins (7Matunis M.J.

Since none of the conserved lysine residues imperative for ubiquitin polymer formation are present in SUMO, SUMO is probably not able to form polymeric chains.

We report the identification of the Drosophila Uba2, Aos1, and SUMO-1 homologs through a combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and Drosophila expressed sequence tag (EST) data base searches. Both the sequences of these components and the mechanism through which SUMO-1 is activated are found to be highly conserved inDrosophila. We present in vivo evidence supporting Drosophila Uba2 functioning to activate theDrosophila SUMO-1, and for this conjugation system playing a critical role in the nervous system. In addition, we found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal CaMKII is modified by DmSUMO-1. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to a protocol described previously (31Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C. Keselman I. Kusinitz F. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, a Drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) R5 isoform (32Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) variable region plus association domain cDNA was inserted into pEG202 and used as a bait to screen aDrosophila adult head cDNA library (provided by J. Huang and M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA) in vector pJG4-5. The bait and the library plasmids were sequentially transformed into the host strain EGY48 (containing an integrated LEU2 reporter gene with its normal upstream regulatory sequences replaced with LexA operators) and plated onto solid medium to select for the lacZ reporter plasmid, the bait, and the library plasmids. Transformants were collected and an aliquot (corresponding to 25 million transformants) was replated on solid medium to select for induced transcription of the LEU2 reporter. Among the 1500 Leu+ transformants that appeared, 100 were eliminated due to their ability to activate the lacZ reporter on selective medium containing glucose. The rest of the transformants were visually classified into strong, medium, and weak groups according to their speed to turn blue on galactose (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactosidel, X-gal) medium. 200 transformants that belonged to the strong group were further analyzed: library plasmids were retrieved from these transformants and the cDNA inserts classified according to their HaeIII digestion patterns. Representative clones from each class were sequenced using the ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and the Biochemistry Core Facility at Brandeis University. The EcoRI fragment of interaction clone XL2 insert contains DmUbc9's full-length coding region and part of its 3′-untranslated region. This fragment was used for the fusion construct and probe labeling described below. To obtain a full-length DmUba2 cDNA, the 5′-nucleotide sequence of interaction clone XL48 was used to search the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project (BDGP) EST data base. One of the LD clones thus identified (LD11358) was found to contain the full-length DmUba2 coding region and flanking regions. To introduce the C175S mutation, an ∼600-bp fragment was PCR amplified with the 5′ primer, 5′-AGCGAAGCTTCCCGGGCTCCACCA, in which the cysteine codon TGC was changed to a serine codon TCC (underlined) and the 3′ primer 5′- CCACGAAATCCATGGCTGGCTG. The resulting PCR product was used to replace the corresponding region in wt DmUba2. The resulting EcoRI/XhoI fragment (C175S R/X) was used for subsequent constructs. The protein sequence of S. cerevisiae Aos1 (YPR180W) was used to search the BDGP EST data base. Several clones were found to encode proteins with significant homology in their N terminus to the N terminus of S. cerevisiae Aos1. The clone with the highest score, LD13875, was found to contain the full-length DmAos1 coding region and flanking regions (see “Results” for details). To obtain a Drosophila SUMO-1 homolog, the protein sequence of Smt3 (GenBankTMU27233) was used to search the BDGP EST data base. One EST clone (LD07775) was found to encode a protein with ∼50% identity to Smt3. A version of DmSUMO-1 cDNA that encodes the putative mature protein (ending at Gly88) was produced by PCR amplification from LD07775 using the 5′ primer, 5′- GGAATTCATGTCTGACGAAAAGAAGGG, and the 3′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCGCTAGCCACCAGTCTGCTGCTGGT. The 3′ primer introduced a stop codon and an EcoRI site immediately after Gly88-coding codon. The resulting PCR product was used in subsequent constructs. The sequences of all PCR products were verified by sequencing. A new pGEX vector (pGEX-1XL) was modified from pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by introducing multiple desired restriction enzyme sites into the polylinker region. The pcDNA3-HA mammalian expression vector was derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by introducing a short fragment encoding the HA epitope tag into the polylinker region (31Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C. Keselman I. Kusinitz F. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To obtain a pGEX vector allowing expression of a GST fusion protein which could be labeled by protein kinase, the polylinker region of pGSTag (provided by M. Neville and M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA) was modified to allow in-frame fusions. The vector thus obtained was named pGEX-1KT. Other vectors used include: pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), pET28a (Invitrogen), and pUAST (33Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for producing and purifying GST fusion proteins was modified from a previous protocol (34Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Briefly, a small volume of a saturated culture of Escherichia coli BL21 bearing a GST fusion protein encoding plasmid (in the experiment to test complex formation between His6-DmUba2 and GST-DmAos1, the bacteria harbor both a GST fusion protein encoding and a His-tag protein encoding plasmids) was diluted to an A600 of ∼0.1 in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.4. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1–0.5 mm and the culture was allowed to grow for 2.5 h under the induction condition. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Pellets were lysed on ice by sonication in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and allowed to bind at 4 °C for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose was pelleted by low speed centrifugation and then washed extensively in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton). The bound GST fusion protein was eluted with 10–20 mm reduced glutathione (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In some cases, glutathione was subsequently removed through dialysis. GST-K-DmSUMO-1 was radioactively labeled according to a previous protocol (35Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, the GST fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed once with labeling buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.15, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The supernatant was aspirated and the Sepharose beads were resuspended in 2–3 bed volumes of the labeling buffer containing 0.5 unit/μl of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 0.7 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The kinase reaction proceeded at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by aspirating the supernatant and washing the beads extensively with the labeling buffer. The GST fusion protein was eluted by rocking the Sepharose beads at 25 °C for 20 min in 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In experiments testing complex formation between His6-DmUba2 and GST-DmAos1, bacteria harboring both pET-DmUba2 and pGEX-DmAos1 were induced to express both fusion proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose pull down assay was performed as described for GST fusion protein purification. The His6-DmUba2·GST-DmAos1 complex was eluted in 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. This eluate was also used for in vitro DmSUMO-1 activation assay. To assess complex formation, eluate was treated at 37 °C for 10 min with SDS sample buffer containing or lacking BME before loading unto an SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. For Ni-NTA-agarose pull down, bacterial pellets were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm BME through sonication. Clarified lysates were supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Ni-NTA-agarose was added and the binding was allowed to proceed for 25 min. Extensive washing was done with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BME, and 20 mm imidazole. Elution was done in a buffer containing 200 mm imidazole in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. To assess complex formation, eluate was treated at 37 °C for 10 min with SDS sample buffer containing or lacking BME before loading for SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Antisera were produced using GST fusion proteins overexpressed in and purified from E. colias antigens. The following fusion proteins were used: GST-XL7 (XL7 encodes the C-terminal 266 amino acids of DmUba2), GST-DmAos1, GST-DmUbc9, GST-K-DmSUMO-1, and GST-CaMKII-C (CaMKII-C encodes the N-terminal 265 amino acids of Drosophila CaMKII). Antisera thus obtained were used directly for immunoblotting analysis. In experiments estimating protein expression levels during fly development and comparing expression levels in adult heads versus bodies, appropriate amounts of different stage flies were collected (adult fly heads and bodies were separated with a sizing sieve), rinsed in water to remove food residue, frozen on dry ice, and disrupted in grinding buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) with an electronic tissue grinder (Concept Inc.). Ground samples were centrifuged and the supernatant from each sample was supplemented with SDS sample buffer, heated, and subject to immunoblotting. Total Drosophila head or body RNA was extracted from frozen fly parts (separated with sizing sieves) using the ULTRASPEC RNA total RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx), following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were electrophoresed and equilibrated as described (36Kevil C.G. Walsh L. Laroux F.S. Kalogeris T. Grisham M. Alexander J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Radioactive probes were synthesized from DmUbc9 R or rp49 (control) template using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Synthesis product mixtures were used for hybridization without purification. Hybridization and washing steps were carried out as described (36Kevil C.G. Walsh L. Laroux F.S. Kalogeris T. Grisham M. Alexander J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were done using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fluorescent signals were examined 20–30 h post-transfection using an Olympus IX70 microscope with epifluorescence optics. To determine protein expression levels, COS cells were directly lysed in SDS sample buffer and cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stained with Ponceau to confirm equal loading after electrotransfer. Western blotting and chemiluminescent detection were performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 50 mg of frozen fly heads were homogenized with an electric grinder in a total of 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 or 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM was used in the purification procedure to inhibit SUMO-specific isopeptidases (7Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For the control sample, the buffer did not contain NEM. Homogenates were spun at 4 °C to remove cuticle. Saturated ammonium sulfate was slowly added into the supernatant with stirring to a final concentration of 45%. Stirring continued for 30 min on ice. Proteins were precipitated by spinning for 10 min at 8000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0, 10, or 50 mm NEM. CaM-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 was added. Binding was allowed to proceed for ∼1 h. CaM-Sepharose was then pelleted at room temperature through low speed centrifugation. A small fraction of the supernatant was saved to be used as the total sample in immunoblotting. The pelleted Sepharose was extensively washed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Bound proteins were eluted at 100 °C in SDS sample buffer. Boiled beads were spun and the supernatant used in standard immunoblotting. In the experiment to assess DmSUMO-1 conjugation to mammalian proteins, COS cells transfected with pcDNA3-HA (control), pcDNA3-HA-DmSUMO-1 (encoding the putative mature form of DmSUMO-1), or pcDNA3-HA-DmSUMO1FL (encoding the full-length DmSUMO-1) were pelleted (∼30 h post-transfection), resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and allowed to sit on ice for 15 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and used as crude cytosol fractions. The pellets after centrifugation were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5% Nonidet P-40 and further dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The fractions thus obtained were used as crude nuclear fractions. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and treated as in standard immunoblotting using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (provided by L. Liu and M. Rosbash, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). In experiments using fresh fly head extract as a source for DmSUMO-1 activating enzymes, extracts were prepared by grinding Canton-S fly heads in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with an electronic tissue grinder. Cuticle was removed through centrifugation and the supernatant was immediately used in in vitro thioester formation assays. In experiments using purified recombinant proteins as the activating enzyme source, the eluate (containing His6-DmUba2/GST-DmAos1 heterodimer) from glutathione-Sepharose pull down assay was used. A typical thioester formation assay was done in a 20-μl volume and contained ∼2.5 μm radioactively labeled GST-K-DmSUMO-1, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and some of the following: ∼100 nm equivalent of recombinant His6-DmUba2·GST-DmAos1 complex (or fresh head extract containing 50 μg of total protein), ∼0.6 μm recombinant GST-DmUbc9 and 5 mm ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30–45 min. Each reaction mixture was then split into two tubes, incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 min in SDS sample buffer containing or lacking BME, and followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiograp"
https://openalex.org/W2164134170,"The sarcoglycan complex in striated muscle is a heterotetrameric unit integrally associated with sarcospan in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The sarcoglycans, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, are mutually dependent with regard to their localization at the sarcolemma, and mutations in any of the sarcoglycan genes lead to limb-girdle muscular dystrophies type 2C-2F. In smooth muscle beta- and delta-sarcoglycans are associated with epsilon-sarcoglycan, a glycoprotein homologous to alpha-sarcoglycan. Here, we demonstrate that gamma-sarcoglycan is also a component of the sarcoglycan complex in the smooth muscle. First, we show the presence of gamma-sarcoglycan in a number of smooth muscle-containing organs, and we verify the existence of identical transcripts in skeletal and smooth muscle. The specificity of the expression of gamma-sarcoglycan in smooth muscle was confirmed by analysis of smooth muscle cells in culture. Next, we provide evidence for the association of gamma-sarcoglycan with the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex by biochemical analysis and comparison among animal models for muscular dystrophy. Moreover, we find disruption of the sarcoglycan complex in the vascular smooth muscle of a patient with gamma-sarcoglycanopathy. Taken together, our results prove that the sarcoglycan complex in vascular and visceral smooth muscle consists of epsilon-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycans and is associated with sarcospan."
https://openalex.org/W2030388915,"In the present study we have investigated cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells double-loaded with the fluorescent probes fluo-3 and rhod-2. Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with 500 nm acetylcholine caused release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and produced cytosolic Ca2+ signals in form of Ca2+ waves propagating from the luminal to the basal cell pole. The increase in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration was followed by Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. Between onset of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals there was a delay of 10.7 ± 0.4 s. Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria could be inhibited with Ruthenium Red and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, whereas 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, which inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases, did not prevent Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria. Carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria could only be observed after a preceding stimulation of the cell with a physiological agonist or by treatment with 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, indicating that under resting conditions mitochondria do not contain releasable Ca2+ ions. Analysis of the propagation rate of acetylcholine-induced Ca2+ waves revealed that inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake did not accelerate spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Our experiments indicate that in the early phase of secretagogue-induced Ca2+ signals, mitochondria behave as passive Ca2+-buffering elements and do not actively suppress spreading of Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acinar cells.

Both chloride and enzyme secretion occurs via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms (1Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). Chloride secretion is accomplished by activation of Ca2+-sensitive chloride channels, whereas enzyme secretion involves fusion of enzyme-loaded zymogen granules into the luminal membrane. The Ca2+-sensitive step in enzyme secretion probably takes place before the actual fusion triggering event (2Rohlicek V. Schmid A. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 428: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Schmid A. Schulz I. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 432: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on the structural and functional polarization of pancreatic acinar cells, it is not surprising that in this cell type polarized Ca2+ signals can be observed. Stimulation of acinar cells with low agonist concentrations causes oscillations in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt), which are mostly confined to the luminal cell pole (4Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), whereas high agonist concentrations produce intracellular Ca2+ waves, which initiate in the secretory region and subsequently travel throughout the cell (6Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Schulz I. Krause E. González A. Göbel A. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The propagation of Ca2+ waves is modulated by secretagogue-dependent activation of protein kinase C (8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and agonist-induced production of arachidonic acid (9González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). From these data a model was developed which proposes that in pancreatic acinar cells the spatiotemporal characteristics of cytosolic Ca2+ signals are controlled by different intracellular Ca2+ stores, with different sensitivities to IP3 and/or Ca2+. Since IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals always start at the luminal cell pole, it is assumed that in this cell region the mostly IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores are located. From the luminal trigger zone, Ca2+ signals propagate to the basal cell membrane by some kind of calcium-induced Ca2+ release from stores located around the trigger zone and in basal cell regions (4Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ signals throughout the cell does not only depend on secondary Ca2+ release but also on Ca2+ uptake into intracellular stores. In pancreatic acinar cells it has been shown that inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases with 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) causes acceleration of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves (8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, active Ca2+ extrusion via plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (10Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as capacitative Ca2+influx triggered by Ca2+ store depletion (11Krause E. Pfeiffer F. Schmid A. Schulz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32523-32528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) participate in long term regulation of [Ca2+]cyt. Although agonist-evoked Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells was the subject of numerous studies during the last years, there is only little information about the role of mitochondria in Ca2+ signaling. It is well known that mitochondria can sequester a considerable amount of Ca2+ (12Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria is mediated by a high capacity uniporter in the inner membrane that permits transport of Ca2+ down its electrochemical gradient. Ca2+efflux occurs via Na+-dependent and Na+-independent mechanisms (12Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism via opening of permeability transition pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been identified (12Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ichas F Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Ca2+ fluxes across the mitochondrial membranes have two fundamental physiological consequences: (i) the mitochondrial metabolism can be adapted to the actual energy demand of the cell (14Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), and (ii) mitochondria can modulate cytosolic Ca2+ signals (15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P.

Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both rapid accumulation of Ca2+ via the high capacity, low affinity uniporter as well as subsequent release of Ca2+ sequestered in mitochondria determine amplitude and shape of cytosolic Ca2+ signals (24Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goddwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitochondria participate in the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ influx by spatial redistribution of Ca2+that entered the cell via store-operated Ca2+ channels (25Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Amplification of IP3-induced Ca2+mobilization by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria has been suggested by Ichas et al. (13Ichas F Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In a recent study on mouse pancreatic acinar cells it has been shown that in this cell type mitochondria are preferentially localized in a belt surrounding the apical zymogen granule-rich cell pole (26Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Since by treatment of the cells with the mitochondrial inhibitors carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and antimycin, IP3-induced local Ca2+ signals in the secretory cell pole were transformed into global Ca2+ signals, which travel throughout the cell, it was suggested that in pancreatic acinar cells mitochondria act as a diffusion barrier for Ca2+ and thereby confine cytosolic Ca2+ signals evoked by low agonist concentrations to the secretory cell pole. To address the question of whether in pancreatic acinar cells mitochondria are active elements in modulation of agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signals more directly, we double-loaded pancreatic acinar cells with the two fluorescent Ca2+indicators fluo-3 and rhod-2. Selective accumulation of rhod-2 in mitochondria was confirmed by co-staining of rhod-2 with MitoTrackerTM Green FM. Mitochondrial potentials (ΔΨm) were monitored with the ratiometric dye JC-1. In most cells mitochondria could be found close to the secretory pole but also within the apical cell pole as well as beneath the plasma membrane at the basolateral side. Stimulation of the cells with ACh led first to an increase in [Ca2+]cyt and with some latency in the mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could be inhibited with Ruthenium Red and CCCP. Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake did not accelerate propagation of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves. From these data we conclude that in pancreatic acinar cells, mitochondria are able to participate in long term regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals but are not actively involved in formation of the early agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Transfer of cytosolic Ca2+signals into mitochondria may adapt mitochondrial metabolism to the increased energy demand of the cell during enzyme and electrolyte secretion. fluo-3/AM, rhod-2/AM, MitoTrackerTM Green FM, and JC-1 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Europe), tBHQ was from Aldrich, and Ruthenium Red was from Merck. CCCP and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–24 °C). Mean values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, and only Pvalues < 0.05 were considered as significant. Adult male CD-1 mice (35–40 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The pancreas was removed and placed into a preparation buffer with the following composition: 130 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, 0.2% (w/v) albumin, 0.01% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). The pancreas was injected with 1 ml of preparation buffer supplemented with collagenase type V (30 units/ml) and incubated in 2 ml of the same buffer in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 10 min. Enzymatic digestion was followed by mechanical dissociation of cells by gentle pipetting. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged, and the cells were washed twice in preparation buffer without collagenase. With this isolation procedure we obtained single acinar cells as well as small cell clusters consisting of 2 up to 5 cells. For quantitative measurement of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, freshly isolated cells were loaded at 4 °C for 15 min with 8 μm rhod-2/AM in preparation buffer. Low temperature was chosen to diminish enzymatic cleavage of rhod-2 acetoxymethylesters in the cytosol (23Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). After incubation with rhod-2/AM, cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 30 × g, resuspended in preparation buffer, and incubated at room temperature (21–24 °C) for 30 min to allow hydrolysis of rhod-2/AM trapped in mitochondria. After rhod-2 loading, cells were kept at 4 °C, and experiments were performed within the next 3 h. To confirm that rhod-2 fluorescence signals originate from mitochondria, pancreatic acinar cells were double-loaded with rhod-2/AM and the fluorescent mitochondrial marker MitoTrackerTMGreen FM (25Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 27Haughland R.P. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR1996: 266-271Google Scholar). After loading of rhod-2 at 4 °C, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in preparation buffer, and then incubated in presence of 100 nm MitoTrackerTM Green FM for 30 min at room temperature. Cytosolic Ca2+ signals were monitored using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fluo-3. Cells were loaded with fluo-3/AM at a concentration of 4 μm for 30 min at room temperature (8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For simultaneous registration of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, cells were double-loaded with rhod-2 and fluo-3. Rhod-2 loading was performed at 4 °C for 15 min with 8 μm rhod-2/AM. Then, cells were washed and incubated with 4 μm fluo-3/AM for 30 min at room temperature. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were registered using the cationic dye JC-1 (28Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml JC-1 at 37 °C for 10 min. After loading, cells were kept on ice until use. Dye-loaded cells were transferred to a perfusion chamber, mounted on the stage of an inverse microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 100 TV) equipped with a confocal laser-scanning system from Bio-Rad (MRC-1024). Cells were allowed to adhere to the glass coverslip for several minutes and then were continuously superfused with a bath solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Confocal fluorescence images of 128 × 128 pixels with a resolution of 0.334 μm/pixel were recorded every 2 s. Cells double-loaded with fluo-3 and rhod-2 were simultaneously excited at 488 and 568 nm with a 15-mW krypton/argon laser. Laser intensity was reduced to 1–3% with neutral density filters to reduce photobleaching. The emitted light was filtered with band pass filters and detected with two photomultipliers at 522/35 nm and 605/32 nm, respectively. The same protocol was used for cells double-loaded with rhod-2 and MitoTrackerTM Green FM. The propagation rate of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves was determined as described previously (8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29González A. Pfeiffer F. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C810-C817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells loaded solely with fluo-3 were excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence images (emission > 515 nm) of 128 × 128 pixels were taken every 0.25 s. In the luminal and basal cell pole, small rectangular areas were selected, and the speed of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves was calculated from the distance between these areas and the time lag between the increase in [Ca2+]cyt at the luminal and basal cell region. Changes in ΔΨm were monitored by use of the ratiometric dye JC-1. This dye accumulates in mitochondria, where it forms red fluorescent aggregates at high mitochondrial membrane potentials. At low membrane potential JC-1 exists mainly in the green fluorescent monomeric form. JC-1-loaded cells were excited at 488 nm, and emission light was captured at 605/32 nm (JC-1 aggregates) and 522/35 nm (JC-1 monomers) with two separate photomultipliers. Data are presented as emission ratios (605 nm/522 nm). Pancreatic acinar cells loaded with rhod-2/AM displayed an inhomogeneous fluorescence pattern with bright structures of globular and filamentous shape within a diffusely and very faintly labeled cytosol. Accumulation of rhod-2 in the nucleus, probably in nucleoli, could sometimes also be noticed (23Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Bright fluorescent spots were in principle spread all through the cytosolic area but often concentrated near the zymogen granule area and beneath the basolateral plasma membrane. When images were taken every five seconds for several minutes, changes in the position of the fluorescent structures could be noticed, indicating that rhod-2 accumulated within movable organelles. To confirm that rhod-2 fluorescence did indeed originate from mitochondria, pancreatic acinar cells were double-loaded with rhod-2/AM and MitoTrackerTM Green FM (n = 6), an indicator that specifically labels mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial membrane potentials (25Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Coincidence of rhod-2 and MitoTrackerTM Green FM fluorescence in almost all bright spots (>50 cells) proved that rhod-2 indeed accumulated in mitochondria. In most cells, clusters of mitochondria were localized in the lateral cell regions near the secretory granules between the nucleus and zymogen granules and beneath the basal plasma membrane. Single mitochondria could also be found in between the zymogen granules in the luminal cell pole as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum-containing basal cell region. An arrangement of mitochondria in the form of a continuous belt between secretory and basal cell pole, as described by Tinel et al. (26Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), could sometimes be observed. However, scanning of these cells in zaxis revealed that a three-dimensional network of mitochondria that completely covers the secretory cell pole and forms a thorough barrier between luminal and basal cell pole only exceptionally exists. Accumulation of mitochondria in the region between zymogen granules and nucleus seems to be the casual result of displacement of mitochondria by those organelles. No differences in the distribution of mitochondria could be found when rhod-2 staining at low temperature was omitted and the cells were loaded immediately after cell preparation with MitoTrackerTM Green FM at room temperature (n = 5; >500 cells), indicating that temporary exposure of acinar cells to 4 °C does not alter mitochondrial localization. To follow changes in both [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]m, we double-loaded pancreatic acinar cells with rhod-2/AM and fluo-3/AM (n > 20). In contrast to rhod-2, fluo-3 remains in the cytosol and, therefore, reports changes in [Ca2+]cyt (30Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to differences in the excitation and emission spectra, changes in the fluorescence of rhod-2 and fluo-3 can be registered with only little interference. Fig. 1 A shows a representative fluorescence image of a pancreatic acinar cells stained with fluo-3 and rhod-2. The cell was simultaneously excited at 488 and 568 nm, and fluo-3 and rhod-2 fluorescence was captured with two separate photomultipliers at 522/35 nm and 605/32 nm, respectively. The two resulting images were superimposed, presenting the fluo-3 image ingreen and the rhod-2 image in red. The image shows the typical punctuated pattern for rhod-2 staining of mitochondria and the more or less homogeneous distribution of fluo-3 in the cytosol. Yellow regions ,which would indicate co-localization of both dyes at similar concentrations, could not be recognized. To test cross-reactivity of rhod-2 and fluo-3 fluorescence signals, we stimulated the cell with 1 μm ACh and analyzed the fluorescence signals originating from several small areas within the cell. When solely green fluorescent areas were analyzed, the typical rapid time course of an agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+signal could be registered in the green detection channel, whereas the fluorescence signal captured in the red detection channel remained more or less constant (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, when a brightly red fluorescent area was selected, there was an increase in the red fluorescence signal, whereas the green fluorescence signal was almost unchanged (Fig. 1 C). When larger regions enclosing both red and green fluorescence were selected, changes in the fluorescence signals could be observed in both detection channels (Fig. 1 D). The time course of the fluorescence signal registered in the green detection channel was identical to the time course of the fluorescence signal of a purely green fluorescent region, whereas the time course of the fluorescence signal registered in the red detection channel corresponded to the much slower time course of the signal from a purely red fluorescent spot. The data indicate that there is only little interference of the two signals and thereby confirm that the bulk of fluo-3 and rhod-2 accumulated in distinct intracellular compartments. Since accumulation of rhod-2 in mitochondria could be demonstrated by double-staining with rhod-2 and MitoTrackerTM Green FM, we can conclude that our loading procedure for staining pancreatic acinar cells with rhod-2 and fluo-3 is suitable for monitoring changes in both [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mat the same time. Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the secretagogues ACh, cholecystokinin, or bombesin at supramaximal concentrations induces cytosolic Ca2+ signals that start in the luminal cell pole and subsequently spread to the basolateral cell membrane (6Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Schulz I. Krause E. González A. Göbel A. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The propagation rate of Ca2+ waves depends on sequential release of Ca2+ from stores in series involving Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Furthermore, it has been shown that thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+re-uptake into Ca2+ stores can slow down the propagation of cytosolic Ca2+ waves (8Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular organelles, which are also known to take up Ca2+ in response to elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels, are mitochondria (12Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether in pancreatic acinar cells spreading of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals is also modulated by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, we measured [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]min cells double-loaded with fluo-3 and rhod-2. Fig. 2 shows a representative experiment in which fluo-3 fluorescence was measured in small areas in the cytosol near the luminal and basal cell membrane, respectively, whereas rhod-2 fluorescence was captured from a red spot located in the middle of the cell near the zymogen granules. After stimulation of the cell with 500 nm ACh, [Ca2+]cyt first rose in the luminal (lum) and then in the basal (bl) cell region, indicating propagation of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal from the luminal to the basal cell pole. During spreading of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal, there was no significant increase in the rhod-2 fluorescence. An increase in rhod-2 fluorescence could only be recognized when [Ca2+]cyt had already reached its maximal value. After removal of ACh, [Ca2+]cyt slowly declined to prestimulation level, whereas rhod-2 fluorescence still increased for several seconds and then also slowly declined to prestimulation level. Statistical analysis of the time courses of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals revealed that the rhod-2 fluorescence started to rise 10.7 ± 0.4 s (n = 36; 333 mitochondria) later than the fluo-3 fluorescence in the surrounding area of the respective mitochondrion. The fluo-3 fluorescence reached its maximum 8.4 ± 0.4 s after [Ca2+]cyt started to rise. This means that in most experiments an increase in rhod-2 fluorescence could be observed only when [Ca2+]cyt had already reached its maximal value. A similar delay between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals could be observed when cells were stimulated with ACh at low concentration (20 nm), which causes oscillation in [Ca2+]cyt (n = 7; 63 mitochondria). Since during prolonged Ca2+ spiking successive Ca2+ spikes in the cytosol occurred before [Ca2+]m returned to resting level, long term accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix could be observed under such conditions. These data argue against an active role of mitochondria in short term regulation of Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acinar cells but suggest a regulatory function in long term regulation of [Ca2+]cyt during sustained hormonal stimulation. There are in principle two ways to explain the delay of the rhod-2 fluorescence signals in comparison to the fluo-3 signals. One possible explanation is that under resting conditions the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter is maintained in an inactive mode and requires activation before Ca2+ can be taken up efficiently into the mitochondrial matrix (12Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other possibility is that under in vitro conditions in the mitochondrial matrix rhod-2 could have a much lower affinity to Ca2+ than in the cell-free systems used for determination ofKd (Kd 570 nm). Under resting conditions [Ca2+]m is similar to or only slightly higher than [Ca2+]cyt (24Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goddwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 31Brandenburger Y. Kennedy E.D. Python C.P. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Wollheim C.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5544-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If in the mitochondrial matrix the Kd of rhod-2 would be in the 10 μm range, it is imaginable that rhod-2 fluorescence increases only when a considerable amount of Ca2+ has already been taken up into the mitochondrial matrix. Since the Kd for Ca2+ binding of rhod-2 in intact mitochondria within intact cells is difficult to determine, we decided to investigate the possibility that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake already occurs during spreading of agonist-evoked Ca2+ waves in a more indirect way. If significant Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria takes place during Ca2+ wave propagation, inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake should lead to an acceleration of Ca2+ waves traveling through the cell, similar as shown before for inhibition of"
https://openalex.org/W1988522975,"LIGHT is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and is the ligand for LT-βR, HVEM, and decoy receptor 3. LIGHT has a cytotoxic effect, which is further enhanced by the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Although LIGHT/IFN-γ can activate caspase activity, neither benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone nor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone can completely inhibit LIGHT/IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-2 further enhances LIGHT/IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis. It appears that LIGHT and IFN-γ act synergistically to activate caspase-3, with the resultant cleavage of Bcl-2, removal of the BH4 domain, leading to conversion of Bcl-2 from an antiapoptotic to a proapoptotic form in p53-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3BT2 cells. Thus, LIGHT seems to be able to override the protective effect of Bcl-2 and induce cell death. Although benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone can prevent the cleavage of Bcl-2 by LIGHT/IFN-γ, they only partially inhibit apoptosis in Hep3BT2 cells that are overexpressing Bcl-2. In contrast, both LIGHT/IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis and Bcl-2 cleavage are inhibited by free radical scavengers, indicating that free radicals may play an essential role in LIGHT/IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis at a step upstream of caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that LIGHT signaling may diverge into multiple, separate processes."

In this study, we investigated the processing of the PC2 propeptide and its function in the regulation of PC2 activity. By using purified pro-PC2 and directed mutagenesis, we found that the propeptide is first cleaved at the multibasic site separating it from the catalytic domain (primary cleavage site); the intact propeptide thus generated is then sequentially processed at two internal sites. Unlike the mechanism described for furin, our mutagenesis studies show that internal cleavage of the propeptide is not required for activation of pro-PC2. In addition, we identified a point mutation in the primary cleavage site that does not prevent the folding nor the processing of the zymogen but nevertheless results in the generation of an inactive PC2 species. These data suggest that the propeptide cleavage site is directly involved in the folding of the catalytic site. By using synthetic peptides, we found that a PC2 propeptide fragment inhibits PC2 activity, and we identified the inhibitory site as the peptide sequence containing basic residues at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the primary cleavage site. Finally, our study supplies information concerning the intracellular fate of a convertase propeptide by providing evidence that the PC2 propeptide is generated and is internally processed within the secretory granules.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A family of mammalian serine proteases responsible for these proteolytic maturation events, termed the prohormone/proprotein convertases (PCs),1 has been identified in the last 10 years (for reviews see Refs. 2Seidah N.G.

The PCs are structurally homologous to subtilisin and kexin and belong to the enzymatic superfamily of subtilases. All of the PCs contain the following five domains: an amino-terminal signal peptide that directs them to the secretory pathway; a propeptide of approximately 80–100 residues; a catalytic domain and a P domain, which are well conserved between PCs; and a carboxyl-terminal domain (which is specific for each PC). The P domain, only present within the eukaryotic subtilisin-like enzymes, is apparently required for activation (5Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and may be responsible for regulation of enzymatic activity (6Zhou A. Martin S. Lipkind G. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain is not required for activation but contains structural determinants necessary for the membrane attachment and the sorting of the PCs (7Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K.

This domain is specifically required for the activation of the PCs, and its proteolytic processing constitutes part of the mechanism of activation (7Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E.

Propeptides have historically been involved in several different aspects of the post-translational modification and maturation of proproteins, both in the intracellular targeting, stabilization, and activation of proenzymes, as well as inhibition of their cognate enzymes. Propeptides are responsible for the targeting of cytosolic proteins (13Wagner I. van Dyck L. Savel'ev A.S. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7317-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and secreted proteins, including proteases (14Valls L.A. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H.

Cell. 1989; 57: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Propeptides are also responsible for the stabilization of proenzymes, as in the case of cathepsins (19Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13036-13040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another major function of propeptides is their role in the activation of the mature protein they will form (20Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Suter U. Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the case of proteases, propeptides are involved in both the activation of the zymogen and the regulation of the activity of the mature enzyme (for review see Ref. 22Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These features result both from the role of the propeptide as an intramolecular chaperone that controls zymogen folding and from the inhibitory potency of the propeptide. The intramolecular chaperone function of the propeptide was first demonstrated for prosubtilisin and pro-α-lytic protease and has since been extended to a number of proproteins (for reviews see Refs. 23Inouye M. Enzyme ( Basel ). 1991; 45: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 233-256Google Scholar). Among these various functions, little is known concerning the role of the PC propeptides, because the activation mechanism of these zymogens has not yet been completely elucidated. The proposed model for the activation of the subtilases occurs through the following steps. 1) Autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide; 2) binding of the propeptide to the mature enzyme, which results in inhibition of catalytic activity; and 3) inactivation/degradation of the propeptide, which terminates the inhibition by the propeptide (26Shinde U. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A study of the activation of furin provided evidence that this model could also be applicable to the PCs (27Lesage G. Prat A. Lacombe J. Thomas D.Y. Seidah N.G. Boileau G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, the inhibitory potency of the PC1 and PC7 propeptides was also demonstrated (28Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Whereas the activation pathway of furin shares some characteristics with other PCs, the activation of PC2 is unique in the following respects (for review see Ref. 30Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). (i) The PC2 propeptide is not removed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within minutes after synthesis but rather in the acidic compartments of the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/secretory granules with a half-life in the hour range (31Guest P.C.

(ii) Intermediate molecular forms, including a major 71-kDa protein with an amino-terminally truncated propeptide, have been described in addition to pro-PC2 and PC2 (31Guest P.C. Arden S.D. Bennett D.L. Clark A. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22401-22406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shen F.S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Pro-PC2 must interact with the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 in the secretory pathway in order to become competent for activation (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); if 7B2 has not been encountered intracellularly, proteolytic removal of the propeptide leads to the formation of an inactive mature enzyme species, termed unproductive maturation (36Zhu X. Muller L. Mains R.E. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Westphal C.H. Muller L. Zhou A. Zhu X. Bonner-Weir S. Schambelan M. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Leder P. Cell. 1999; 96: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Pro-PC2 thus offers unique opportunities for delineating the role of the convertase propeptide in the activation mechanism of convertases. Indeed, pro-PC2 is the only PC that has been purified as an activable zymogen (38Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thus permitting in vitro analysis of propeptide maturation. In addition, because pro-PC2 is the only PC that exits the ER as a zymogen, it is possible to distinguish between the following two steps in the folding process of its zymogen: global folding required for exit from the ER, and local folding of the catalytic site required for activation. Accordingly, we have been able to identify mutations in PC2 catalytic domain that result in the generation of proenzymes that are processed, in the TGN/secretory granules, into totally inactive PC2s (36Zhu X. Muller L. Mains R.E. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the following four aspects of the function of the propeptide in the activation of pro-PC2: 1) the processing of the propeptide in vitro, using purified recombinant pro-PC2; 2) the processing of the PC2 propeptide in vivo, using mutated pro-PC2s stably transfected in neuroendocrine cells; 3) the inhibitory potency of propeptide fragments using synthetic peptides; and 4) the fate of the propeptide in the TGN/secretory granules. Unless specifically stated, all PC and peptide antisera used were polyclonal antisera raised in rabbits. The antiserum against PC2 (LSU18) was directed against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of mature PC2 (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The antiserum against the PC2 propeptide (LSU26) was directed against residues His58–Asp80 (Fig. 1, hatched gray box) of mouse pro-PC2 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) using 1-ethyl 3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; the peptide contained an amino-terminal tyrosine to enable iodination. The antiserum against α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and was raised in sheep (39Elias C.F. Saper C.B. Maratos-Flier E. Tritos N.A. Lee C. Kelly J.

AtT-20 cells were cultivated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. AtT-20 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% Nuserum IV (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Transfected cell lines were cultivated with either one or both of the following selection agents: 200 μg/ml active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and/or 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma). The AtT-20/PC2 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. R. E. Mains (The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (34Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have already characterized the AtT-20/PC2/7B2 and the Rin/Proenkephalin/7B2 cell lines (40Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to obtain cell lines co-expressing 7B2 and mutated pro-PC2s, AtT-20 cells were first transfected with a pCEP4-derived plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) encoding rat 27-kDa 7B2 (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A high expressing clone was selected using immunoblotting and was supertransfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) encoding mutated mouse pro-PC2 cDNAs. The mutations were obtained by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated primer overlap method as described previously (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For this purpose aHindIII-KpnI fragment of mouse pro-PC2 was amplified and reintroduced into the HindIII vector site and the pro-PC2 KpnI site inHindIII/KpnI-cut pcDNA3/pro-PC2. The mutagenesis primers used were as follows: 5′-GCCAAGCACAAGCACAGCCTACACCATAAGCGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGTGCTTGTGCTTGGCCTTTGCAAGCCCATT-3′ for the M53-56 mutant; 5′-GACAAGCACAAGCACGGGTACAGGGACATCAAT-3′ and 5′-CCCGTGCTTGTGCTTGTCAAATCCTTCTTGTTG-3′ for the M81-84 mutant; 5′-GTCCCTGTACCCGTGCTTTTTACGGTCAAATCC-3′ and 5′-AAGCACGGGTACAGGGACATCAAT-3′ for the R84H mutant; 5′-AAGGCAGGGTACAGGGACATCAAT-3′ and 5′-CCCTGCCTTTTTACGGTCAAATCC-3′ for the R84A mutant; and 5′-AAACACAGAGGGTACAGGGACATC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTACCCTCTGTGTTTACGGTCAAATCCTTC-3′ for the K83H mutant. All cDNA segments generated by polymerase chain reactions were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Three independent clones were analyzed for each mutation. 5 × 105 AtT-20 cells were used 40–48 h after seeding in 6-well plates. They were labeled with either 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Pro-Mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min or 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 8 h. Cells were then directly extracted or chased in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum. For the analysis of the maturation of mutant pro-PC2s, proteins were extracted under denaturing conditions, and immunoprecipitation was conducted at 4 °C as described previously (35Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were first incubated for 1 h in the presence of protein A coupled to Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pre-cleared supernatants were then incubated for 4 h in the presence of PC2 antiserum LSU18. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A coupled to Sepharose CL-4B and washed once with the immunoprecipitation buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline, and twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. They were then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer prior to separation by SDS-PAGE on 8.8% acrylamide gels. Gels were either treated for fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or directly exposed to a phosphoscreen and analyzed using either a PhosphorImager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) or on an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Co.). For the in vitro analysis of pro-PC2 processing, cells were chased in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 2, 4, or 12 h in the presence of 1 μm bafilomycin A1 (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). Proteins were then extracted under native conditions as described previously (41Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and PC2 forms were immunoprecipitated as described above. The beads were then resuspended in 100 mm Bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate at the indicated pH and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed as described above. Pro-PC2 was purified from the medium of CHO cells expressing high levels of pro-PC2 and 7B2 as described previously (42Johanning K. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lazure C. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22672-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pro-PC2 (∼5–15 μg) was incubated in 100 mm Bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate at the indicated pH at 37 °C. In some experiments the incubations were performed in the presence of 1 mm EDTA or 10 μm of the carboxyl-terminal peptide of 7B2 (CT peptide), a PC2-specific inhibitor (43Lindberg I. van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An aliquot was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for Western blotting. Another aliquot was stopped by adding 4 volumes of 8 m urea and boiled for 5 min for the HPLC analysis of the fragments generated. Samples were fractionated on a C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a 1 ml/min flow rate using a three-step gradient consisting of 0–40% buffer B for 57 min, 40–70% B for 37 min, 70–100% B for 27 min, with buffer B being 80% acetonitrile with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid and buffer A being 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid. 100-μl duplicate aliquots of each fraction were dried in the presence of carrier bovine serum albumin (BSA) and analyzed for PC2 propeptide content using a novel radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the LSU26 antiserum (see below). Amino-terminal peptide sequencing of the immunoreactive fractions was performed by the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-mass spectroscopy was performed by the LSU Core Labs (LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA). PC2 activity was measured using 0.2 mm pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA (Peptides International, Lexington, KY) (final concentration) as a substrate as described previously (39Elias C.F. Saper C.B. Maratos-Flier E. Tritos N.A. Lee C. Kelly J. Tatro J.B. Hoffman G.E. Ollmann M.M. Barsh G.S. Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Elmquist J.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 402: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.4% octyl glucoside, in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture composed of 1 μm pepstatin, 0.28 mm tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm trans-epoxysuccinic acid, and 0.14 mm tosyl-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (this inhibitor mixture was omitted when purified recombinant PC2 was used). In order to determine the enzymatic activity of the wild type and mutant PC2s, intracellular pro-PC2/PC2 was immunopurified from cell extracts (obtained by nondenaturing lysis from triplicate plates) using antiserum LSU18 bound to protein A-coupled Sepharose CL-4B. An aliquot of these same cell extracts was saved for protein determination using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and similar amounts of cellular protein were subjected to Western blotting using antiserum against PC2 (LSU18). The activity of immunopurified enzymes prepared from the various cell lines was assessed under standard conditions for a 2-h reaction time and was normalized to the total intracellular content of PC2 forms expressed in that cell line. The entire experiment was repeated independently with similar results, and the results were also confirmed using overnight conditioned media from each cell line. For analysis of inhibition by propeptide-related peptides, duplicate reactions were used, consisting of 7 nm mouse recombinant pro-PC2, 0 to 0.1 mm of the peptide to be tested, and 0.2 mm fluorogenic substrate. Prior to addition to the reaction mixture, purified recombinant mouse pro-PC2 was diluted in the assay buffer and preactivated by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C to obtain the 66-kDa form. Peptides corresponding to residues 57–84, 57–80 (containing an S57Y substitution), and 35–56 of mouse pro-PC2 were synthesized by LSU Health Sciences Center Core Labs. After preactivated PC2 was mixed with the peptide, the reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding substrate followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The amount of released aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) was measured with a microtiter plate fluorometer (Ascent, Labsystems) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. The amount of released product was calculated by reference to the fluorescence of free AMC standard. IC50 values were calculated by applying nonlinear regression to the data using the GraphPad Prism program. The values were determined from four independent experiments using two different PC2 preparations. Purified pro-PC2 was activated at pH 5.0 for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition of 0.2 mm Glu(P)-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA and varying (0–1 μm) quantities of decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) under conditions such thatET ≫ Kiapp. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Least square regression was used to calculateET from the resulting quasi-linear plots as described by the Morrison equation (44Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Brains from wild type mice or from PC2 knockout mice (45Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.

Extracts were frozen, thawed, and centrifuged before lyophilization. Dried samples were then made up to 1.5 ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged, and 500 μl of the clear supernatant was fractionated by HPLC. The propeptide was assayed in duplicate aliquots of each fraction by RIA, as described below. AtT-20 cells, expressing PC2 alone or PC2 and 7B2, or Rin5f cells, expressing proenkephalin alone or with 7B2, were plated in 35-mm wells. Confluent cells were first incubated for 2 h under basal conditions. The medium was replaced for 3 more h, with fresh medium containing 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Collected media were spun to remove floating cells and directly assayed for propeptide immunoreactive by RIA. Cells were homogenized in 1m acetic acid, 20 mm HCl, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The extracts were frozen, thawed, centrifuged, and lyophilized before being subjected to the propeptide and α-MSH/ACTH-(1–13)-NH2 or Met-enkephalin RIAs. In some experiments, the cell extracts or the stimulated medium were separated by HPLC as described above. Media were first concentrated using SepPak C18 columns (Waters, Milford, MA) eluted with 60% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and diluted in buffer A prior to application to the HPLC column. Aliquots of the HPLC fractions were dried together with 50 μl of 0.05% carrier BSA, and the propeptide content was measured by RIA. Propeptide RIAs were carried out using 100 μl of a 1:40,000 dilution of antiserum LSU26, 100 μl of sample or standard, and 100 μl of iodinated peptide containing 10,000 cpm in RIA buffer consisting of 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% heat-treated BSA, 0.1% sodium azide, and 50 mm sodium chloride. In order to enable iodination, the peptide to be radiolabeled (pro-PC2 58–80) was synthesized with the addition of an amino-terminal Tyr. This Tyr57-substituted peptide was also used to generate the standard curve. The IC50 of the assay was 60 fmol, and the range of the standard curve was from 1 to 500 fmol. Other details of the RIA procedure were as described previously (46Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to carboxypeptidase B digestion prior to propeptide assay (42Johanning K. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lazure C. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22672-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Met-enkephalin RIA has already been described (46Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The α-MSH/ACTH-(1–13)-NH2 RIA was accomplished using a 1:120,000 final dilution of antiserum (raised in sheep against α-MSH conjugated to thyroglobulin; Chemicon AB5087) and a standard curve of 1–250 fmol. Due to the specificity of the antibody for the amide moiety, cross-reaction was negligible for either intact ACTH, α-MSH-free acid, or ACTH-(1–10) (39Elias C.F. Saper C.B. Maratos-Flier E.

We analyzed the functional consequences of the PHHI missense mutation R1420C, which lies in the second nucleotide-binding fold (NBF2) of SUR1. Mild tryptic digestion of SUR1 after photoaffinity labeling allowed analysis of the nucleotide-binding properties of NBF1 and NBF2. Labeling of NBF1 with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was inhibited by MgATP and MgADP with similar Ki for wild-type SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C. However, the MgATP and MgADP affinities of NBF2 of SUR1-R1420C were about 5-fold lower than those of wild-type SUR1. MgATP and MgADP stabilized 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1 of wild-type SUR1 by interacting with NBF2, but this cooperative nucleotide binding was not observed for SUR1-R1420C. Studies on macroscopic currents recorded in inside-out membrane patches revealed that the SUR1-R1420C mutation exhibits reduced expression but does not affect inhibition by ATP or tolbutamide or activation by diazoxide. However, co-expression with Kir6.2-R50G, which renders the channel less sensitive to ATP inhibition, revealed that the SUR1-R1420C mutation increases the EC50 for MgADP activation from 74 to 197 μm. We suggest that the lower expression of the mutant channel and the reduced affinity of NBF2 for MgADP may lead to a smaller KATP+ current in R1420C-PHHI β-cells and thereby to the enhanced insulin secretion.

It is believed that metabolic regulation is mediated by changes in ATP and Mg2+-nucleotides (such as MgADP), which inhibit and activate the channel, respectively. In pancreatic β-cells, metabolically induced changes in KATP+ channel activity play a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. At substimulatory glucose concentrations, KATP+ channels are open, and their activity serves to maintain the resting membrane potential at a hyperpolarized level. Elevation of blood glucose concentration increases glucose uptake and metabolism by the β-cell producing changes in cytosolic nucleotide concentrations that result in closure of the KATP+ channels. This leads to depolarization of the β-cell membrane potential and thus to activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and Ca2+influx. The resulting rise in the intracellular Ca2+concentration triggers insulin release. The β-cell KATP+ channel is a hetero-octamer composed of pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) subunits that coassemble with 4:4 stoichiometry (5Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

Like other members of this family, SUR1 has two intracellular nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs),1 each containing a Walker A and a Walker B motif that is involved in Mg2+-nucleotide binding and hydrolysis.

Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by inappropriate insulin secretion despite severe hypoglycemia. In the absence of clinical treatment, PHHI may be lethal or result in irreversible neurologic sequelae.

Some of theSUR1 mutations are nonsense or frameshift mutations that produce a truncated form of SUR1. Others are missense mutations, many of which are found within the NBFs of SUR1 and impair KATP+ channel activity by affecting Mg2+-nucleotide interactions with SUR1 (1Nichols C.G. Shyng S.-L.

As a consequence, the KATP+ channel remains closed even in the absence of glucose, which results in persistent and unregulated insulin secretion. Recently, we identified a missense SUR1 mutation (R1420C) in Japanese PHHI patients (31Tanizawa Y. Matsuda K. Matsuo M. Ohta Y. Ochi N. Adachi M. Koga M. Mizuno S. Kajita M. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K.

An 86Rb+ efflux study revealed that KATP+ channels composed of SUR1-R1420C and Kir6.2 are not activated by metabolic inhibition as much as wild-type channels. This may be related to the fact that the expression level of SUR1-R1420C was only about half that of the wild-type channel when it was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (31Tanizawa Y. Matsuda K. Matsuo M. Ohta Y. Ochi N. Adachi M. Koga M. Mizuno S. Kajita M. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K. Inoue H. Furukawa S. Amachi T. Ueda K. Oka Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also reported that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2, stabilizes the binding of 8-azido-ATP at NBF1 of wild-type SUR1 (19Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and that the R1420C mutation impairs this effect without altering high affinity 8-azido-ATP binding to NBF1 (31Tanizawa Y.

However, it is not clear whether the mutation lowers the affinity of NBF2 for nucleotides or if it affects cooperative interactions between the two NBFs. In this study, we examined the nucleotide-binding properties of the two NBFs of SUR1-R1420C by photoaffinity labeling experiments and studied the properties of Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C channels by electrophysiological analysis. Our results suggest that the R1420C mutation increases the EC50 for MgADP-dependent channel activation by reducing the nucleotide-binding affinity of NBF2. This property, together with the lower expression of the mutant channel, may be responsible for PHHI. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP were purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Membranes from COS-7 cells expressing mouse SUR1 were prepared as described (17Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Crude membranes, containing similar amounts of wild-type SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C as determined by Western blotting, were incubated with 50 μm8-azido-[32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 0.1–1000 μm ATP or ADP in 3 μl of TEM buffer (40 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSO4) containing 2 mm ouabain. Proteins were UV-irradiated for 5 min (at 254 nm, 5.5 milliwatts/cm2) on ice. Ice-cold TEM buffer was then added to the sample, and the supernatant was removed after centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 5 min, 2 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.1 mmEGTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 10 μg/ml trypsin to 10 μg of membrane proteins/μl and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride was added to the samples to terminate proteolysis, and membrane proteins were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using an antibody raised against NBF1 or NBF2 of hamster SUR1 as described previously (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Bound 8-azido-[32P]ATP in NBF1 or NBF2 was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film Co.). Membranes (20 μg of proteins) were incubated with 10 μm8-azido-[32P]ATP in 3 μl of TEM buffer containing 2 mm ouabain for 3 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold TEM buffer, and free 8-azido-[32P]ATP was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 2 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of TEM buffer containing 2 mm ouabain and 0–1000 μm ATP or ADP. The mixture was UV-irradiated immediately after the resuspension or after postincubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Bound 8-azido-[32P]ATP in SUR1 was measured by radioimaging analyzer as described above. Wild-type or mutant Kir6.2 was coexpressed with wild-type or mutant SUR1 inXenopus oocytes as described previously (33Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, immature stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were incubated for 60 min with 1.0 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type V) and manually defolliculated. They were then coinjected with ∼0.1 ng of mouse Kir6.2 and ∼2 ng of mouse SUR1, giving a 1:20 ratio. Isolated oocytes were maintained in Barth's solution and studied 1–4 days after injection (33Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp (33Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in a high potassium extracellular solution containing (mm): 90 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH) at 20–24 °C. The holding potential was −10 mV and current amplitudes were measured in response to a −100-mV, 300-ms voltage pulse. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz. Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant excised inside-out patches at a holding potential of 0 mV and at 20–24 °C in response to 3-s voltage ramps from −110 mV to +100 mV (33Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The pipette (external) solution contained (mm): 140 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The standard intracellular (bath) solution contained (mm): 107 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH; final [K+] ∼140 mm), and nucleotides as indicated. Tolbutamide was made up as a 0.05 m stock solution in 0.1 m KOH and diazoxide as a 0.02 m stock solution in 0.1 mKOH. Rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent inflow pipes placed in the bath. Single-channel currents were recorded from small inside-out patches, filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 3 kHz. Macroscopic currents were filtered at 0.5 kHz, digitized at 1 kHz using a Digidata 1200 Interface, and analyzed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the current-voltage relation between −20 mV and −100 mV; the average of five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution. Nucleotide concentration-response relationships were measured by alternating the control solution with a test concentration of nucleotide. The conductance (G) was expressed as a fraction of the mean of the value obtained in the control solution before and after application of the nucleotide (Gc). Concentration-response curves for ATP inhibition were fit by the Hill equation (Equation 1),G/Gc=1/(1+([ATP]/IC50) h)Equation 1 where [ATP] is the ATP concentration, IC50 is the concentration at which inhibition is half-maximal, and h is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). Concentration-response curves for ADP activation were fitted to a modified version of the Hill equation (Equation 2),G/Gc=a/(1+(EC50/[ADP])h)+1Equation 2 where [ADP] is the ADP concentration, EC50 is the concentration at which activation is half-maximal, a is the maximal conductance (relative to control), and h is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). Data are given as mean ± S.E., and thesymbols in the figures indicate the mean and thevertical bars indicate S.E. To examine the biochemical properties of SUR1-R1420C, we investigated 8-azido-[32P]ATP photoaffinity labeling of NBF1 and NBF2 (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Crude membranes from COS-7 cells expressing SUR1 or SUR1-R1420C were incubated with 50 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP followed by mild trypsin digestion. Labeled tryptic fragments containing NBF1 or NBF2 of both wild-type and mutant SUR1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-NBF1 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3) or NBF2 antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4), respectively. This indicates that both NBFs of SUR1-R1420C can bind 8-azido-ATP, as is found for wild-type SUR1.Figure 1Photoaffinity labeling of the NBFs of SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP. Membrane proteins (10–20 μg) from COS-7 cells expressing wild-type SUR1 (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or SUR1-R1420C (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lanes 1–4) or 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (lanes 5–8) for 10 min at 37 °C and then UV-irradiated. Photoaffinity-labeled proteins were subject to mild trypsin digestion. The tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-NBF1 (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or anti-NBF2 (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) antibody and separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2 and a 35-kDa fragment containing NBF1 are indicated. Experiments were performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously suggested that NBF2 of SUR1 might hydrolyze ATP, because NBF2 of SUR1 is photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP but not with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (20Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether SUR1-R1420C is photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP. Both NBF1 of SUR1 and of SUR1-R1420C were photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and7), indicating that NBF1 either does not have ATPase activity or has little ATPase activity under our experimental conditions. In contrast, NBF2s of SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C were not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1,lanes 6 and 8), although they were photoaffinity-labeled by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 1,lanes 2 and 4). These results suggest that the γ-phosphate dissociates from 8-azido-[32P]ATP bound at NBF2 and thus that NBF2 of SUR1-R1420C might have ATPase activity as is found for wild-type SUR1. To characterize the biochemical properties of SUR1-R1420C further, we investigated the affinities of both NBF1 and NBF2 for ATP and ADP. When crude membranes from COS-7 cells expressing SUR1 or SUR1-R1420C were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of ATP or ADP followed by mild trypsin digestion, photoaffinity labeling of tryptic fragments containing either NBF1 or NBF2 was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). This indicates that SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C can bind ATP and ADP. The data were fit by the Hill equation, and the Ki values obtained are shown in Table I. The Ki values of NBF1 of SUR1 for ATP and ADP were 1.6 ± 0.64 (n = 3) and 17 ± 7.9 μm(n = 3) respectively, and those of SUR1-R1420C were 1.5 ± 0.26 (n = 3) and 13 ± 6.8 μm (n = 3), respectively. This indicates that the affinity of NBF1 for nucleotides is not significantly different between wild-type SUR1 and SUR1-R1420C and that the affinity for ATP is significantly higher than that for ADP. We have shown previously that the Ki values for ATP and ADP binding to NBF1 of hamster SUR1 are 4.4 ± 3.7 and 26 ± 8.6 μm, respectively, and those of NBF2 are 60 ± 26 μm and 100 ± 26 μm, respectively (34Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These values are in good agreement with the affinities obtained in this study for mouse SUR1, indicating that there are no significant differences between hamster and mouse SUR1. However, theKi values of NBF2 of SUR1-R1420C for ATP and ADP (350 ± 36 (n = 3) and 290 ± 66 μm (n = 3), respectively) were significantly higher than those of wild-type SUR1 (64 ± 4.7 (n = 3) and 65 ± 16 μm(n = 3), respectively). These results demonstrate that the R1420C mutation decreases the affinity of NBF2 for both ATP and ADP.Table IKi values for interaction of ATP and ADP with the NBFs of SUR1 and SUR1-R1420CKiWild-typeR1420CμmμmNBF1-ATP1.6 ± 0.641.5 ± 0.26NBF1-ADP17 ± 7.913 ± 6.8NBF2-ATP64 ± 4.7350 ± 36NBF2-ADP65 ± 16290 ± 66The data of Fig. 2 were fit by the Hill equation, andKi values were obtained. Open table in a new tab The data of Fig. 2 were fit by the Hill equation, andKi values were obtained. To explore the possibility that the impaired cooperative nucleotide binding observed for SUR1-R1420C is due to the low nucleotide-binding affinity of NBF2, we examined the dependence of cooperative binding on nucleotide concentration. As we have shown previously (19Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), prebound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at NBF1 of wild-type SUR1 gradually dissociated during postincubation at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+ without nucleotide, and MgATP or MgADP stabilized 8-azido-ATP binding in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 3). This cooperative nucleotide binding was also observed when SUR1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). EC50values for the stabilization effect of MgATP and MgADP were 59 ± 2.9 and 50 ± 18 μm, respectively, for SUR1 and are in good agreement with the binding affinities of MgATP and MgADP at NBF2 (64 ± 4.7 and 65 ± 16 μm, respectively) (Table I). This supports the idea that MgATP and MgADP bind at NBF2 to stabilize 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1. In contrast, neither ATP nor ADP (1 mm) stabilized 8-azido-[32P]ATP binding at NBF1 of SUR1-R1420C despite the fact that 1 mm MgATP and MgADP inhibited photoaffinity labeling of NBF2 (68 ± 3.2 (n = 3) and 76 ± 2.9% (n = 3), respectively) as efficiently as that of wild-type SUR1 (74 ± 10 (n = 3) and 73 ± 1.5% (n = 3), respectively) (Fig. 2). These results suggest that neither MgATP nor MgADP bound at NBF2 can stabilize 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1 of SUR1-R1420C. To examine the functional properties of the mutant KATP+ channels, we coexpressed SUR1-R1420C with Kir6.2 in Xenopus oocytes. As observed for the wild-type channel (Kir6.2/SUR1), no significant current was detected for Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C channels in the cell-attached configuration, but large currents developed following patch excision into nucleotide-free solution. The mean current amplitude at −100 mV was 3.0 ± 1.0 nA (n = 10) for Kir6.2/SUR1 and 1.5 ± 0.6 nA (n = 15) for Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C channels. The smaller currents observed with the mutant channel are probably due to reduced expression of the mutant SUR (31Tanizawa Y. Matsuda K. Matsuo M. Ohta Y. Ochi N. Adachi M. Koga M. Mizuno S. Kajita M. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K. Inoue H. Furukawa S. Amachi T. Ueda K. Oka Y. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A quantitatively similar reduction in SUR1-R1420C protein expression was observed in COS-7 cells, indicating that the lower expression of mutant SUR1 is confined to the oocyte expression system. We first examined the effect of the R1420C mutation on the activation of the channel by the potassium channel opener diazoxide (Fig. 4) and its inhibition by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide. Diazoxide was tested in the presence of MgATP because its stimulatory action is dependent upon the presence of intracellular hydrolyzable nucleotides (35Kozlowski R.Z. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm ATP, both 200 μmdiazoxide and 100 μm ADP led to a pronounced increase in both wild-type and mutant KATP+currents. Diazoxide increased Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by 694 ± 40% (n = 4) and Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C currents by 499 ± 126% (n = 7). The sulfonylurea tolbutamide blocked Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by 53 ± 2% (n = 3) and Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C currents by 68 ± 7% (n = 3). Thus the R1420C mutation does not affect the pharmacological properties of the channel. Inhibition of the channel by ATP was not affected by the R1420C mutation. Kir6.2/SUR1 currents were inhibited with an IC50 of 13 ± 2 μm and a Hill coefficient of 0.99 ± 0.18 (n = 5), whereas Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C currents were blocked with an IC50 of 12 ± 2 μm and a Hill coefficient of 0.90 ± 0.14 (n = 6; Fig. 5). ADP produced a mean current increase of 402 ± 82% (n = 3) and 347 ± 52% (n = 6) for Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR1-R1420C, respectively, when tested in the presence of 100 μm MgATP. ADP and GDP also activated both mutant and wild-type KATP+ channels when applied in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4); surprisingly, the extent of this activation was somewhat greater for mutant than for wild-type channels. It is well known that nucleotides such as ADP exert two opposing effects on the KATP+ channel: they stimulate channel activity by interacting (in a magnesium-dependent fashion) with the NBFs o"
https://openalex.org/W1984055805,"Downstream regulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway is mediated by anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that sequester PKA to specific subcellular locations through binding to PKA regulatory subunits (RI or RII). The RII-binding domain of all AKAPs forms an amphipathic α-helix with similar secondary structure. However, the importance of sequence differences in the RII-binding domains of different AKAPs is unknown, and mechanisms that regulate AKAP-PKA affinity are not clearly defined. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we measured real-time kinetics of RII interaction with various AKAPs. Base-line equilibrium binding constants (Kd) for RII binding to Ht31, mAKAP, and AKAP15/18 were 10 nm, 119 nm, and 6.6 μm, respectively. PKA stimulation of intact Chinese hamster ovary cells increased RIIα binding to AKAP100/mAKAP and AKAP15/18 by ∼7- and 82-fold, respectively. These results suggest that differences in primary sequence of the RII-binding domain may be responsible for the selective affinity of RII for different AKAPs. Furthermore, RII autophosphorylation may provide additional localized regulation of kinase anchoring. In cardiac myocytes, disruption of RII-AKAP interaction decreased PKA phosphorylation of the PKA substrate, myosin-binding protein C.

Different AKAPs accumulate in distinct locations in the cell, based on a unique targeting motif that directs the complex to the appropriate subcellular compartment (reviewed in Ref. 3Colledge M.

Recently, much information has been obtained on the structural features that are required for stabilization of PKA-AKAP complexes. PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits (4Taylor S. Buechler J. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). AKAPs bind with high affinity to the NH2 terminus of the R dimer. The RII-binding region of typical AKAPs comprises 16–20 contiguous amino acids that have a predicted propensity to fold into an amphipathic α-helix (5Carr D. Stofko-Hahn R. Fraser I. Bishop S. Acott T. Brennan R. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This amphipathic α-helix is thought to form a hydrophobic face for interaction with a complementary surface on RII dimers (6Hausken Z. Dell A.M. Coghlan V. Scott J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The classical RII-selective AKAPs contain a hydrophobic dipeptide composed of Leu, Val, or Ile residues that is crucial for the generation and maintenance of the RII-binding site (8Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dong F. Feldmesser M. Casadevall A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6533-6541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, there is little overall primary sequence similarity in the RII-binding domains of different AKAP family members. Some AKAPs can also bind PKA type I (RI) regulatory subunits. The first evidence of RI binding to an AKAP was found by co-immunoprecipitation assays, where RIα bound to AKAPs with a ∼500-fold lower affinity compared with RIIα (10Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two novel anchoring proteins,d-AKAP1 and d-AKAP2 (for dual specificity AKAPs), were isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen and shown to bind both types of regulatory subunits (11Huang L.J.

Moreover, RIα was shown to be tightly sequestered (Kd ∼ 10 nm) to AKAPCE (an AKAP identified from Caenorhabditis elegans) in vitro and in the intact cell (14Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies have elucidated several criteria for the selectivity of AKAPs between PKA isoforms (RI versus RII) (15Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29057-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Angelo R.G. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 298: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Scanning mutagenesis of the RIα-specific domain of FSC1/AKAP82 and the RII-specific domain of Ht31 showed that single amino acid residues in these domains determine RI and RII binding specificity (15Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29057-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, point mutations introduced into the RIα/RIIα dual specificity domain of FSC1/AKAP82 converted it into an RI or RII preferential binding domain, suggesting that the size of the aliphatic side chain at consensus positions within the amphipathic α−helix determines RI/RII selectivity (15Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29057-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RII-tethering sequence of AKAPCE contains three large aliphatic amino acids (Leu236, Ile248, and Leu252) that generate an apolar surface for RI dimer binding (16Angelo R.G. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4351-4362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This motif was determined to be essential for selective binding of RCEand exclusion of RII isoforms. Although distinctive features of RI and RII tethering domains are being revealed, little is known about determinants of the selectivity of RII or RI for different AKAPs. It is estimated that any cell contains ∼5–10 distinct AKAPs to adapt PKA for specialized functions (18Scott J.D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, for example, at least two AKAPs have been identified, AKAP15/18 and AKAP100/mAKAP (or mAKAP, for muscle-specific AKAP). AKAP15 (independently identified as AKAP18) is a low molecular weight AKAP that associates with the plasma membrane via NH2-terminal lipid modifications (19Fraser I. Tavalin S. Lester L. Langeberg L. Westphal A. Dean R. Marrion N. Scott J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Gray P. Johnson B. Westenbroek R. Hays L. Yates J.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30280-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). mAKAP (previously called AKAP100) was originally identified in embryonic cardiac H9c2 cells (22McCartney S. Little B.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9327-9333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mAKAP has been localized to the t-tubule/junctional SR in rat cardiomyocytes and cryostat sections of rat papillary muscle (23Yang J. Drazba J.A. Ferguson D.G. Bond M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is found concentrated at the nuclear membrane in frozen sections of rat cardiac ventricle (24Kapiloff M.S. Schillace R.V. Westphal A.M. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKA regulates a broad range of cellular responses in the cardiac myocyte, AKAP-dependent PKA compartmentalization is an important mechanism for controlling the specificity of substrate phosphorylation. However, there is a serious lack of information on factors that underlie the ability of PKA to interact specifically with different anchoring proteins, in any cell type. We previously demonstrated that autophosphorylation of RII is one mechanism involved in regulating binding to Ht31 (the prototypical human thyroid AKAP) (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine whether cardiac isoforms of PKA regulatory subunits (RIα and RIIα) have preferential binding characteristics for distinct AKAPs expressed in the heart, and to examine the role of β-adrenergic stimulation in regulating PKA anchoring and distribution in the intact cell. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate a role for AKAP targeting in regulating substrate phosphorylation in vivo. All peptides were synthesized and NH2-terminally biotinylated by the Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. AKAP peptides corresponding to known RII-binding regions were synthesized according to the following sequences: mAKAP-(391–408) peptide, VHNFVKEIIDMASTALKS; AKAP15/18-(25–48) peptide, DDAELVRLSKRLVENAVLKAVQQY; and Ht31-(492–514) peptide, DLIEEAASRIVDAVIEQVKAAGA. Substitution of Ile for Pro residues (I501P, I506P) of the Ht31 peptide (Ht31P) disrupts the amphipathic helix, thereby rendering the peptide unable to bind RII (5Carr D. Stofko-Hahn R. Fraser I. Bishop S. Acott T. Brennan R. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were prepared as described previously (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), then probed with excess AKAP peptides (100 μm). Fluorescence corresponding to RII-bound peptide was quantified by StormImager™ analysis using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as described previously (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant RIIα was prepared as described (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the RIIα recombinant plasmid (RII-pET11d), a gift of Dr. John D. Scott (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), was used to transform Escherichia coli bacteria strain BL21(DE3). RII recombinant protein was expressed under 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction followed by cAMP-agarose affinity purification (26Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and characterized as described (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Vectors for the expression of the GFP-tagged proteins RII-EYFP, Ht31-ECFP, and Ht31P-ECFP were constructed as described previously (27Ruehr M.L. Zakhary D.R. Damron D.S. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33092-33096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CHO cells were stably transfected with Ht31-ECFP or HT31P-ECFP and then transiently transfected with RII-EYFP as described (27Ruehr M.L. Zakhary D.R. Damron D.S. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33092-33096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and expression of Ht31-ECFP, HT31P-ECFP, and RII-EYFP was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The cDNA for RIα was a gift of Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA encoding RI was excised using NheI andMluI, then ligated into pIRES (CLONTECH). CHO cells were transiently transfected with RI-pIRES using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection using trypsin-EDTA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20). Expression of RI was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Recombinant adenovirus directing the expression of either HA-tagged Ht31 peptide or HA-tagged Ht31P peptide was generated using standard procedures (28Hitt M. Bet A.J. Addison C.L. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 7: 13-30Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding either Ht31 or Ht31P, a gift of Dr. John D. Scott (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), was amplified via polymerase chain reaction to contain an NH2-terminal HA tag and 5′ and 3′ NotI sites. These constructs were cloned into the NotI site of pXCX2 (28Hitt M. Bet A.J. Addison C.L. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 7: 13-30Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) between the cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Plaques were screened using polymerase chain reaction and verified by DNA sequencing. Each viral clone was amplified in HEK 293 cells, purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. All procedures involving animals follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Animal Care Facility of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation is accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Care. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the left ventricle of adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) at 20–30 weeks of age, by collagenase digestion using a modified Langendorff perfusion, according to methods previously described (29McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Morano I. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1440-H1451PubMed Google Scholar). Myocytes were plated onto tissue culture plates coated with laminin (4 μg/cm2) at a density of 1×105 cells/ml, as described previously (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The viability of the isolated ventricular myocytes prepared in this manner was typically greater than 90%, as determined by rod-shaped morphology and lack of granulation or blebs. Adenovirus was diluted in serum-free DMEM plus 0.5× penicillin/streptomycin to 1 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml for a multiplicity of infection of 100. Myocytes were infected for 1 h, then cultured for 48 h in viral-free medium. Proteins were backphosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAcat) and [γ-32P]ATP according to the method of Zakhary (30Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Stewart R.W. Bond M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this procedure, 32P incorporation into proteins is inversely related to the extent of protein phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, lighter bands on an autoradiogram represent proteins more highly phosphorylated in vivo. For peptide overlays and SPR experiments, RII was autophosphorylated by PKAcat using cold ATP. Whole-cell lysates and myofibrillar fractions were prepared from rat ventricular cardiac myocytes as described (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Stewart R.W. Bond M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Proteins were backphosphorylated, denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1.5% dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, then separated by 6% SDS-PAGE at 125 V, 90 mA for 1 h. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V, 370 mA, for 1 h 45 min. The membranes were blocked in 3% fish gelatin (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. After two 10-min washes in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated overnight with anti-Ti II mAb Ti104 (1:1000 dilution). This antibody was made against the immunoglobulin domain of titin and cross-reacts with the MBP-C, which contains a homologous immunoglobulin domain (31Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (antibody kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Jin, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). An alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-mouse IgG was the secondary antibody, and the membranes were developed using Vistra™ ECF substrate. Fluorescence corresponding to the bands was quantified by StormImager™ analysis. Radiolabeled proteins on the same membrane were then exposed to storage phosphor screens and detected by StormImager™ analysis (phosphor mode). SPR was measured by a BIAcore 1000 instrument using streptavidin (SA) sensor chips (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Samples of recombinant RIIα or CHO cell lysates were diluted in HBS buffer. Samples were injected at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min over the active SA surface on which the Ht31, mAKAP, or AKAP15/18 peptides (active surfaces) or Ht31P (control surface) had been immobilized to ∼30 resonance units (RU). Remaining SA sites were blocked with free biotin. AKAP peptide surfaces were not limited by mass transport effects. Binding surfaces were regenerated to remove bound analyte by injection of 10 mm NaOH (1-min contact). Regeneration conditions did not result in loss of SA surface binding capacity. At saturating analyte concentration, the maximum response (Rmax) was equal among the active AKAP surfaces used. Kinetic constants were calculated by global fitting of the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, after subtracting the control surface, using the BIAevaluation software, version 3.0, according to the pseudo-first order rate equation below. dR/dt=kaCRmax−(kaC+kd)RtEquation 1 ka is the association rate,kd is the dissociation rate, C is the concentration of the injected analyte, and R is the response. Plots of dR/dt versus Rt have a slope of ks. When ks is plotted against C, the resulting slope is equal toka. The dissociation rate,kd, was calculated by integrating the rate equation when C = 0, yielding ln(Rt1/Rtn) =kd (tn −t1). The equilibrium binding constants were calculated from the equation Kd =kd/ka. The Ht31 peptide is widely used to mimic AKAP-RII interactions (6Hausken Z. Dell A.M. Coghlan V. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or to inhibit them in intact cells (22McCartney S. Little B.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Ht31 forms an amphipathic helix that binds RII with nanomolar affinity and competes with full-length AKAPs for RII binding (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Carr D. Hausken Z. Fraser I. Stofko-Hahn R. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative RII-binding region of AKAP15/18 (residues 29–42) was shown to be sufficient for RII binding, since corresponding peptides effectively blocked all RII binding when used as antagonist in RII overlay assays (19Fraser I. Tavalin S. Lester L. Langeberg L. Westphal A. Dean R. Marrion N. Scott J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence suggests that the putative RII-binding domain of mAKAP (residues 2055–2072) can bind RII in overlays and function to anchor PKA holoenzyme inside cells, as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-mAKAP antibody and assessment of kinase activity (24Kapiloff M.S. Schillace R.V. Westphal A.M. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RII-binding region of the full-length mAKAP is identical to the previously cloned AKAP100 (residues 392–408). The RII-binding domain sequences of these anchoring proteins are given in Fig. 1. The amphipathic α-helical region of AKAP15/18, mAKAP, and Ht31 each differed in the size of the hydrophobic portion of the helix (TableI). Furthermore, within this region, each AKAP contained a distinctive number of hydrophobic residues with long aliphatic side chains (Leu, Ile, or Val).Table IProperties of the RII-binding amphipathic α-helix of various AKAPsProportion of helix that is hydrophobicNo. of residues with long aliphatic side chains%AKAP15/18573 Leu, 3 ValAKAP100/mAKAP441 Leu, 2 Ile, 2 ValHt31352 Ile, 1 ValRII-binding domains of these AKAPs as determined from the published sequence were projected as α-helices with 3.6 amino acid residues/turn. Open table in a new tab RII-binding domains of these AKAPs as determined from the published sequence were projected as α-helices with 3.6 amino acid residues/turn. To confirm the specificity of AKAP-RII interactions, we first used a solid phase overlay assay with AKAP15/18 and mAKAP peptides (6Hausken Z. Dell A.M. Coghlan V. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RII or autophosphorylated RII (RII-P) was transferred to nitrocellulose, and the amount of bound AKAP15/18 or mAKAP peptide was determined by densitometric scanning, as described. Both peptides recognized RII-P and RII specifically at ∼57 and ∼55 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, autophosphorylation of RII increased binding of AKAP15/18 and mAKAP both by ∼140% (Fig. 2 B), consistent with our previous results for Ht31 (25Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although semiquantitative, this assay has limited sensitivity for measuring binding events; further determination of rate and affinity constants for AKAP:RII and AKAP:RII-P interactions was performed by SPR spectroscopy. SPR analysis allowed us to measure real-time binding kinetics of RIα and RIIα interactions with various AKAPs in solution. In the first series of experiments, samples of recombinant cardiac RIIα at the same concentration (120 nm) were injected over three different chip surfaces, each containing an equivalent amount of Ht31, mAKAP, or AKAP15/18 peptide. Nonspecific binding to the Ht31P control surface was subtracted from each trace. Fig. 3 illustrates the differential binding of RIIα to these different AKAPs, in terms of amount bound (RU) after similar injections. Next, for kinetic measurements, a concentration series of RIα or RIIα was injected over each AKAP peptide surface. Kinetic constants (ka, kd, andKd) were calculated by global fitting of the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, as described (Equation 1). The equilibrium binding constants (Kd) for RIIα binding to Ht31, mAKAP, and AKAP15/18 were determined to be 10 nm, 119 nm, and 6.6 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, TableII). The Kd for RIα-Ht31 interaction was 1.0 μm (Table II). There was no measurable binding of RIα to mAKAP or AKAP15/18. These data are in agreement with previously reported Kd values for RI-Ht31 and RII-Ht31 interaction by us and others using SPR (7Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D.

Type II PKA regulatory subunits have an autophosphorylation site, serine 95, in the primary sequence, which is the only residue phosphorylated by C, whereas type I regulatory subunits have a pseudophosphorylation site (4Taylor S. Buechler J. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Recombinant cardiac RIIα was autophosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAcat), as described. Autophosphorylation of recombinant RIIα resulted in ∼2-, 16-, and 250-fold increases in binding to Ht31, mAKAP, and AKAP15/18, respectively, by SPR (Fig. 5, A–C). There was no difference between RII and RII-P binding (association or dissociation rates) to the Ht31P control surface, although RII-P samples consistently showed a positive bulk shift effect, which was most likely due to the presence of a high refractive index component in the PKAcat buffer (Fig. 5 D). Similarly, autophosphorylation of RIIα in living CHO cells enhanced AKAP binding. CHO cells expressing RIIα fusion proteins were stimulated with forskolin plus 8-Br-cAMP to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway. These conditions resulted in a significant (77%) increase in RIIα autophosphorylation. Binding of RIIα in CHO cell lysates to Ht31, mAKAP, and AKAP15/18 peptide surfaces was then measured by SPR. We previously demonstrated that RII-GFP fusion proteins behave in kinetically similar manner to purified RII in this system (27Ruehr M.L. Zakhary D.R. Damron D.S. Bond M. J. Biol.

The two mammalian members of this family, CP2 (LBP-1c/LSF) and LBP-1a (NF2d9), are highly related proteins sharing an overall amino acid identity of 72%. CP2, the best characterized of these factors, is a ubiquitously expressed 66-kDa protein that binds the regulatory regions of many diverse genes. Consequently, a role for CP2 has been proposed in globin gene expression, T-cell responses to mitogenic stimulation, and several other cellular processes. To elucidate the in vivo role of CP2, we have generated mice nullizygous for the CP2 allele. These animals were born in a normal Mendelian distribution and displayed no defects in growth, behavior, fertility, or development. Specifically, no perturbation of hematopoietic differentiation, globin gene expression, or immunological responses to T- and B-cell mitogenic stimulation was observed. RNA and protein analysis confirmed that the nullizygous mice expressed no full-length or truncated version of CP2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from multiple tissues demonstrated loss of CP2 DNA binding activity in the −/− lines. However, a slower migrating complex that was ablated with antiserum to NF2d9, the murine homologue of LBP-1a, was observed with these extracts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recombinant LBP-1a can bind to known CP2 consensus sites and form protein complexes with previously defined heteromeric partners of CP2. These results suggest that LBP-1a/NF2d9 may compensate for loss of CP2 expression in vivo and that further analysis of the role of the NTF family of proteins requires the targeting of the NF2d9 gene.

This is particularly evident during development where biochemical and genetic studies have identified numerous proteins essential for the processes that govern embryogenesis. Many of these factors are highly conserved in evolution, playing critical roles in organisms as diverse as Drosophilaand man. One family of transcription factors that typifies these principles is the NTF-like group of proteins. The founding member of this family is the developmentally programmed Drosophilafactor, NTF-1 (neurogenic element bindingtranscription factor) (1Bray S.J. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1672-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NTF-1 (also known as Grainyhead or Elf-1) was first identified through its ability to bind acis element critical for expression of the Dopa decarboxylase gene (2Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequently, NTF-1 was shown to bind to promoters of other developmentally regulated genes includingUltrabithorax, fushi tarazu, andengrailed (2Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NTF-1 has also been linked to dorsal/ventral and terminal patterning through the formation of multiprotein complexes that influence transcription from the decapentaplegic andtailless genes (4Liaw G.-J. Rudolph K.M. Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Lengyel J.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3163-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Liaw G.-J. Bai Y. Valentine S.A.

More recently, tissue-specific isoforms of the protein have been described in Drosophila, and mutation of these isoforms or the ubiquitously expressed gene results in pupal lethality with gross developmental defects (1Bray S.J.

In humans they are known as LBP-1a and CP2 (LBP-1c/LSF), whereas the mouse homologues are referred to as NF2d9 and CP2, respectively (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The human genes are 72% identical in overall amino acid sequence but share higher sequence identity (88%) in the N-terminal halves of the proteins than the C-terminal halves (52%). The homology with the NTF gene is also in the N-terminal region with three amino acid stretches, 148 to 159, 205 to 216, and 233 to 246 showing 66, 75, and 79% identity, respectively. The NTF-like gene family has been shown to have a variety of cellular and developmental functions in human and murine cells. The best characterized member of the family, CP2, was initially identified as a factor that binds to, and stimulates transcription from, the murine γ-fibrinogen promoter and the viral SV40 major late promoter (11Kim C.H. Heath C. Bertuch A. Hansen U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Binding sites for CP2 have also been defined in regulatory regions of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 where it acts in concert with YY1 to repress transcription (9Yoon J.-B. Li G. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Wu F.K. Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9375-9382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of non-viral gene regulation, CP2 has been shown to bind homomerically to the human c-fos, ornithine decarboxylase, c-myc, and DNA polymerase promoters and the murine α-globin and fibrinogen promoters and activate transcription in vitro (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Shirra M.K. Hansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19260-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding to the regulatory elements in thefos and ornithine decarboxylase promoters is modulated by cell growth signals. Mitogenic stimulation of resting T-cells is associated with rapid phosphorylation of CP2 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pp44 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) and a consequent increase in its DNA binding activity (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This modulation suggests that CP2 contributes to the regulation of early response genes and therefore plays a role as a cell growth regulator. A developmental role for CP2 has been identified in studies of globin gene regulation. In this context, CP2 binds to the stage selector element in the proximal γ-gene promoter as a heteromeric complex with a recently cloned fetal/erythroid-specific partner protein, NF-E4 (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2J. M. C. and S. M. J., submitted for publication. This complex, known as the stage selector protein (SSP), contributes to the preferential recruitment of the β-globin locus control region to the γ-promoter during fetal erythropoiesis (20Amrolia P.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SSP binding sites have also been defined in the ε-promoter and in the regions of DNase1 hypersensitivity that constitute the locus control region (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Gumucio D.L. Shelton D.A. Bailey W.J. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the extensive literature examining CP2 function in vitro and in cell lines, the in vivo role of this factor remains unknown. To address this, we have generated a CP2 null mutation in mice by homologous recombination. Mice lacking CP2 expression were examined for defects in growth and development, with a particular emphasis on hematopoiesis, immune, and neural function. We observed no significant abnormality in CP2−/− mice compared with wild type littermates. We have shown through DNA binding and protein-protein interaction studies that the lack of a discernible phenotype may be due to a complete rescue by NF2d9, the murine homologue of LBP1a. We isolated eight CP2 genomic clones by screening a 129-derived ES cell phage library with a full-length mouse CP2 cDNA probe. Duplicate lifts screened with a probe specific for exon two, containing the initiation ATG, identified one clone with a 12-kb insert that encodes the first two exons and the 5′ untranslated region. Detailed restriction endonuclease mapping of this fragment confirmed the previously reported genomic structure of murine CP2 with the exception of an EcoRI polymorphism detected in the 5′ untranslated region (see Fig. 1 A) (24Swendeman S.L. Spielholz C. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11663-11671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 6.6-kbNcoI fragment containing the 5′ untranslated region and a portion of the first exon was subcloned into pSL301. AXhoI-SalI fragment containing a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-regulated hygromycin resistance expression cassette was cloned into a downstream SalI site. Finally, a 3.4-kbSalI-NotI fragment containing 2.4 kb of the second intron of CP2 and a 1-kb HSV-TK expression cassette fragment (a kind gift of Dr. J. vanDeursen) was cloned downstream of this region to provide 3′ homology and a negative selectable marker. This construct, pK01HygTK, was linearized with NotI and transfected by electroporation into RW8 embryonic stem cells (Genomic Systems Inc). The cells were cultured on primary irradiated embryonic STO feeder cells in the presence of 140 fg/ml hygromycin and 0.2 fm FIAU. Resistant clones were screened by Southern blot analysis using a unique 0.5-kbSalI-NcoI fragment located 5′ to the targeted sequence. Four karyotypically normal CP2+/− clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, of which three clones were transmitted through the germ line. Embryo sections were prepared as described previously (25Zindy F. Soares H. Herzog K.H. Morgan J. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1139-1150PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C57/BL6 mice, overdosed with ketamine and rhompin, were perfused intracardially with paraformaldehyde, and the embryos from timed matings were postfixed in a similar solution. Sections of 10–14 μm were cut with a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, and stored at −20 °C. These slides were subsequently probed with sense and antisense riboprobes generated by [33P]UTP labeling from Bluescript plasmids encoding the complete cDNAs of CP2 and NF2d9 (the latter were a kind gift of Dr. M. Negishi) (10Sueyoshi T. Kobayasi R. Nishio K. Aida K. Moore R. Wada T. Handa H. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specific signals were developed by dipping the slides in NTB2 emulsion (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) and exposed at 4 °C for two weeks. The sections were counterstained using 0.1% toluidine blue in distilled water and analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. Tissues from normal and age-matched heterozygote and homozygote knockout mice were removed and fixed in formalin, and embedded paraffin sections were prepared. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. Peripheral blood (150 μl) was obtained by retro-orbital puncture and blood cell counts, and erythrocyte parameters were determined utilizing an automated analyzer (Coulter). In addition an aliquot was stained with Wright's Giemsa or methylene blue to study hematopoietic cell morphology and reticulocytes, respectively. Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors were cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of IL3, erythropoeitin, and stem cell factor (Terry Fox Laboratories, Vancouver, Canada). For immunological studies, single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen, lymph node, thymus, and bone marrow and stained with cell type-specific markers for granulocytes (Gr1), T-cells (CD8 and CD4), B-cells (B220 and IAb), and NK cells (NK1.1). Fluorescence analysis was performed utilizing a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Similar cellular suspensions were utilized to assess the proliferative potential of T- and B-cells, culturing 105 cells in the presence of anti-CD3ε +/− phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, concanavalin A, lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagluttinin, ionomycin, or a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phytohemagluttinin, and ionomycin for 48 h as described previously (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from various tissues and from peripheral blood and bone marrow cells using RNAzol B or RNASTAT 60. Murine CP2 and NF2d9 cDNA fragments spanning exons 2 and 3 and a portion of exon 4 were subcloned into pSP73. RPA studies were performed using the Ambion RPAII kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. For studies of murine and transgenic human globin gene expression RPA was performed utilizing probes specific for the murine ζ, α, εy, βh1, and βmajor transcripts and the human ε-, Gγ-, and β-globin transcripts (a kind gift of Dr. K. Gaensler). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from various primary tissues (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar, 27Lim L.C. Fang L. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18008-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay system as per the manufacturer's instructions. EMSAs were performed by incubating varying amounts of nuclear extract with 105 cpm of [32P]dCTP end-labeled double stranded oligonucleotides encoding the CCAAT box region of the murine α-globin promoter, the γ-fibrinogen promoter, or the SV40 major late promoter in a 20-μl reaction containing 500 ng of poly[d(I·C)], 6 mm MgCl2, 16.5 mm KCl, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin (21Jane S.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18008-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For antibody studies, 3 μl of preimmune serum or rabbit anti-mouse CP2 antibody were preincubated for 10 min with the binding reaction prior to addition of the probe. Polyclonal antiserum against NF2d9 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Negishi. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and 25 °C for 20 min, samples were electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 90 min at 10 V/cm. Recombinant CP2 and NF2d9 were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described previously (19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding the C-terminal 250 amino acids (amino acids 250–500) of CP2 and the corresponding region of LBP-1a were inserted into the yeast expression vector pGBT9. The resultant plasmids encode hybrid proteins containing the DNA binding domain of GAL4 fused to CP2 or LBP-1a residues. The yeast reporter strain, HF7C, was transformed with this vector and a second plasmid encoding a hybrid protein of the GAL4 transactivation domain and either the NF-E4 cDNA or RING1B cDNA. The yeast were plated on leucine/tryptophan/histidine plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days (28Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). Protein interactions are indicated by growth on these plates. Transfection efficiency was monitored by plating of an aliquot of the transformation on leucine/tryptophan plates (data not shown). CP2−/− mice were bred with mice transgenic for a single copy of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing 250 kb of the human β-globin locus (β-YAC) (a kind gift of Karin Gaensler, University of California, San Francisco, CA) (29Gaensler K.M. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Timed pregnancies were set up utilizing CP2+/− females and CP2+/−YAC+males, where the day of plug formation was taken as 0.5 days post-coitum (E0.5 dpc). Embryos were collected on days E9.5 dpc, E10.5 dpc, E11.5 dpc, and E14.5 dpc and genotyped by standard methodologies utilizing the CP2 probes described above and a probe specific for IVSII of the human Aγ-globin gene (a kind gift of Dr. Karin Gaensler). RNA from yolk sac and fetal liver was prepared, and RPA analysis was performed as described above. To disrupt the murine CP2 gene, a targeting vector was designed that replaced the first untranslated exon and the entire second exon containing the initiation codon and the trans-activation domain with a hygromycin expression cassette (Fig. 1 A). In addition, this cassette introduced termination codons in all open reading frames. RW8 embryonic stem cells were electroporated with this construct and selected in hygromycin and FIAU. Southern analysis of resistant clones demonstrated a 9.0-kb EcoRI fragment in addition to the 10.5-kb wild type allele, at a mean frequency of one in 25 clones (data not shown). Four independently targeted clones, with normal karyotypes, were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, three of the clones being transmitted through the germ line. Interbreeding of mice heterozygous for the CP2 allele (CP2+/−) resulted in litters of normal size with the expected Mendelian frequency of genotypes. Of 256 total offspring tested, 72 were CP2+/+(28%), 125 were CP2+/− (49%), and 60 animals (23%) were nullizygous (CP2−/−) for the CP2 allele. To confirm the loss of CP2 gene expression in nullizygous animals, RNA was prepared from various tissues of both wild type and CP2−/− mice and analyzed by RNase protection analysis. A specific band of 380 nucleotides was observed in all tissues derived from wild type animals utilizing a riboprobe that hybridizes to exons 2–4 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, no signal was observed utilizing RNA derived from the brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen of CP2−/− mice (Fig.1 B, lanes 7–11). An actin probe controlled for the integrity of the RNA (Fig. 1 C). To confirm the loss of CP2 expression, and to rule out a cryptic splicing event that might produce a functional CP2 transcript, RNA from wild type and CP2−/− tissues was assayed by RT polymerase chain reaction utilizing primers specific to the 3′ end of the mRNA transcript. Although a CP2-specific signal was observed in all wild type tissues tested, no signal was detected from RNA derived from CP2−/− animals (data not shown). Male and female knockout mice grew normally and were healthy up to 18 months of age. No abnormal behavioral patterns were observed. The fertility of CP2−/− animals was normal, and no increase in morbidity was observed when compared with littermate controls. Careful histopathological examination of brain, spleen, kidney, liver, thymus, lymph nodes, heart, skin, muscle, and bone from CP2−/−animals, performed at 3, 9, and 15 months, was identical to wild type littermate controls (data not shown). CP2 has been implicated in the regulation of several hematopoietic genes, particularly those of the globin loci (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether loss of CP2 expression resulted in changes in hematopoiesis, the hematological parameters of CP2−/−mice were assayed and compared with those of wild type littermates. No significant difference in total cell counts, hematocrits, reticulocytes, differential white cell counts, or the α-/β-globin ratio was observed (Table I). In addition, the numbers of bone marrow progenitors, as measured by colony-forming unit activity, were similar in CP2+/+ and CP2−/− animals (data not shown). Similar studies of lymphopoiesis were stimulated by recent studies implicating CP2 in the modulation of T-cell proliferative responses (17Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, extensive analysis of T, B, and NK phenotypes, as well as functional assays of B- and T-cell function, failed to identify a difference between CP2+/+ and CP2−/− cells (data not shown).Table IHematological analysis of 18 CP2+/+ and 18 CP2−/− animalsParameter measuredCP2+/+ miceCP2−/− miceRCC × 109 cells/ml9.52 ± 0.209.44 ± 0.20Hematocrit48.13 ± 4.6750.83 ± 4.00Reticulocytes (%)2.63 ± 0.472.77 ± 0.63MCV52.3 ± 4.755.6 ± 5.46MCH16.49 ± 0.7316.67 ± 0.99RCC, red cell count; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Open table in a new tab RCC, red cell count; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin. It is possible that despite normal adult erythropoiesis, the loss of CP2 expression may affect either α- or β-globin gene expression during hematopoietic ontogeny. CP2 was initially identified as an α-globin CCAAT box binding activity, suggesting a possible role in α-globin gene expression. However, neither ζ- nor α-globin gene expression was perturbed in yolk sac or fetal liver cells (Fig.2 A). We have demonstrated that CP2 is a component of the γ-globin promoter-binding SSP complex and suggested that the γ to β switch in the β-globin subtype may be perturbed in a CP2 null environment. To test this hypothesis, we bred CP2−/− animals with mice transgenic for a 240-kb YAC containing the human β-globin locus (βYAC). Subsequently, we bred male progeny transgenic for the βYAC with CP2+/− females and examined the expression of both human and mouse β-globin-like genes at several developmental stages. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both human and murine β-globin-like gene expression in yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow were identical in CP2+/− and CP2−/− embryos and adult mice, respectively. To examine CP2 DNA binding site occupancy in the null mice, we prepared crude nuclear extracts from lung, kidney, heart, and liver of wild type and CP2−/− animals and performed EMSA using a double stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the α-globin CCAAT box (7Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing equal amounts of protein in each lane, a band of similar electrophoretic mobility was observed in all wild type tissues (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). In contrast, extracts from CP2−/− tissues failed to show the band seen with wild type extract and instead showed a DNA-protein complex with a slower migration pattern (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 with 1,3, 5, and 7, respectively). This result was not dependent on the amount of protein added, as 2- to 8-fold more protein from CP2−/− liver extract incubated with the probe generated an identical band shift (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 7 with lanes 8–11). The lack of an obvious phenotype in the CP2−/− animals coupled with the persistent DNA site occupancy observed with extracts from nullizygous tissues suggested the presence of a ubiquitous CP2-like factor that could compensate for the lack of CP2. One candidate factor was Nf2d9, the murine homologue of the human NTF-like gene, LBP-1a (10Sueyoshi T. Kobayasi R. Nishio K. Aida K. Moore R. Wada T. Handa H. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis was obtained by studying the relative electrophoretic mobilities of CP2 and NF2d9. Both molecules bound the α-globin CCAAT box and γ-fibrogen probes, the NF2d9-DNA complex having a perceptibly slower mobility (Fig.3 B and data not shown). To determine whether the protein-DNA complex generated with CP2−/− extracts contained NF2d9, we performed competition experiments utilizing excess concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides that have been previously shown to bind CP2 and/or NF2d9(7, 10). These oligonucleotides were capable of ablating both wild type and mutant binding activity (data not shown). We also investigated the ability of monoclonal antisera generated against recombinant NF2d9 to disrupt binding activity. This antisera does not cross-react with CP2 as assessed by immunoblotting. 3A. T., J. M. C., and S. M. J., unpublished information. Addition of the antibody induced a partial supershift of wild type binding activity (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, mutant activity was completely supershifted (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 2 and 4). These data suggest that NF2d9 can maintain DNA site occupancy at CP2 binding sites. To determine whether the distribution of expression of CP2 and NF2d9 was similar, we performed in situ hybridization on embryo sections using antisense and sense probes specific for each mRNA transcript. Normal embryos were examined at E9.5, E11.5, and E13.5 dpc. Probes were of similar specific activity, and sense probes produced little background signal from embryos probed at all developmental stages (Fig. 4, A andC). However, utilizing an antisense probe, we observed CP2 expression in most tissues at similar levels at E13.5 dpc (Fig.4 B). In contrast, although expression of NF2d9 was observed in all tissues, it was markedly higher in the fetal liver (Fig.4 D, arrow). It is possible that loss of CP2 expression results in up-regulation of NF2d9 expression. To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression of NF2d9 in the brain, kidney, and heart of CP2+/+ and CP2 null animals. As shown in Fig. 4 E, no significant change in the relative expression of NF2d9 was observed in any of these tissues when compared with the actin control. The DNA binding, transactivation, and expression patterns of LBP-1a/NF2d9 suggested that this protein could potentially compensate for the loss of CP2. To evaluate this further, we examined whether LBP-1a could fulfill the protein-protein interaction role of CP2. We have recently defined two transcription factors that specifically interact with CP2. 4S. M. J. and J. M. C., submitted for publication."

In no case is the mechanism of importation of RNA into mitochondria fully understood, and there appear to be differences in the importation process in different organisms. The trypanosomatids Leishmania tarentolae andTrypanosoma brucei represent an extreme situation in which no tRNAs are encoded in the mitochondrial genome; and therefore, all tRNAs for mitochondrial translation must be encoded in the nucleus and imported from the cytosol (10Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting of specific tRNAs to the mitochondrion in trypanosomatids has been studied in vivo by transfection techniques (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar) andin vitro by importation into isolated mitochondria (12Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S.

RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The specificity of targeting as well as the mechanism of transport are still obscure, but the specificity appears to involve, at least in part, the tertiary structure of the RNA molecule (16Rubio M.A. Liu X. Yuzawa H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was previously proposed, on the basis of the detection of precursor tRNAs in T. brucei mitochondria, that the substrate for importation is a 5′-precursor species that is processed by an RNase P-like activity within the organelle (17Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Aphasizhev et al. (18Aphasizhev R. Karmarkar U. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) could not obtain any evidence for the existence of such mitochondrion-localized precursors in L. tarentolae orT. brucei. In addition, the presence of a genomic 5′-flanking sequence was not required for mitochondrial targeting of tRNAIle in L. tarentolae (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar) or for mitochondrial targeting of tRNATyr in T. brucei(8Hauser R. Schneider A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Google Scholar). However, evidence was recently presented that a dicistronic tRNA transcript in T. brucei is the preferred substrate for importation into isolated mitochondria, but no evidence was presented for intramitochondrial processing of this transcript (19LeBlanc A.J. Yermovsky-Kammerer A.E. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21071-21077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Yermovsky-Kammerer A.E. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6253-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the question of the nature of the in vivosubstrate for tRNA importation into the mitochondrion, we have used RT-PCR1 to analyze the intracellular localization of 5′- and 3′-end processing and an in vitro assay to analyze the importation properties of several specific tRNAs in L. tarentolae. We have also investigated the subcellular localization of the C to U editing of the anticodon of the tRNATrp. L. tarentolae cells were grown at 27 °C in brain/heart infusion medium (Difco) supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin (Calbiochem). Mitochondria were prepared from cultures at ∼1 × 108 cells/ml by the hypotonic breakage method as described previously (21Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were isolated in a 20–35% Renografin (Bracco) gradient. Isolated mitochondria were treated with micrococcal nuclease to remove any RNA bound to the outside of the vesicles. Nuclei were prepared from cultures at ∼5 × 107cells/ml. Cells were washed in 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02m NaPO4 (pH 7.4); resuspended in 0.5m hexylene glycol (Sigma), 1 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm CaCl2 (22Shapiro S.Z. Doxsey S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); and broken using a Stansted Fluid Power apparatus at 60 p.s.i. A portion of this cell lysate was cleared by two successive centrifugations at 15,000 ×g for 25 min each to obtain the cytosolic cell fraction. Nuclei were isolated from the cell lysate in a density gradient created by centrifugation of 35% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 60,000 × g for 35 min. Each step of the cell fractionation was monitored by phase and fluorescence microscopy. RNA was isolated from whole cells and from each cell fraction using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar). RNA (1.5 μg) from each cell fraction was separated on an 8 m urea and 6% acrylamide gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide for RNA visualization and photography, and the RNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's directions. The membranes were hybridized with the appropriate oligonucleotides, which were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 7 μg of mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of 4 m urea and electrophoresed in the first dimension on a 4 m urea and 15% polyacrylamide gel (200 × 350 × 0.75 mm) at 750 V for 24 h at room temperature. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, and the tRNA portion of the gel was excised and layered on top of a second dimension 8 m urea and 20% polyacrylamide gel (180 × 250 × 0.75 mm). The second dimension was electrophoresed at 400 V for 48 h at room temperature. The separated tRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide staining for photography and transferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane for Northern analysis as described above. L. tarentolae genomic DNA blocks were prepared as describe previously (24Rovai L. Tripp C. Stuart K. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Gomez-Eichelmann M.C. Holz Jr., G. Beach D. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and separated on 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA-containing 1.5% agarose using the CHEF-DR II apparatus (Bio-Rad). The chromosome bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and the gel was photographed using a C-80 UV Darkroom system (Ultra-Violet Products). The DNA was transferred to Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), which were hybridized with the different tRNA PCR products labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used for Northern analysis of RNA. S-3434 (5′-TTATCGGATTCAGAGTCCGAGGTG-3′) was used to detect tRNAGln(CUG); S-3442 (5′-CCTGGATTTGGAATCCAATGCT-3′) was used to detect tRNATrp(CCA); S-3444 (5′-TCCGGTTCATAAGACCAGCGTC-3′) was used to detect tRNAIle(UAU); S-3443 (5′-ACGAGGTTAAAAGCCACGCGCT-3′) was used to detect tRNALys(UUU); S-3437 (5′-ATCTCTCGCGTGTGAGGCGAATGTC-3′) was used to detect tRNAVal(CAC); S-3313 (5′-CAACGTCCATCTGCGACGGCTTTA-3′) was used to detect the 92-nucleotide small nucleolar RNA; U6-1 (5′-TCTTCACTGTTGAATTTCC-3′) was used to detect the U6 snRNA; S-3315 (5′-GTTCCGGAAGTTTCGCATAC-3′) was used to detect the spliced leader RNA; and S-3316 (5′-GTCTTCCTCTGAATGCGTAAGCG-3′) was used to detect the RPS12-I guide RNA. The following oligonucleotides (based on GenBankTM/EBI accession number L20948 (33Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) were used for RT-PCR of mature and precursor tRNATrp. S-3213 (5′-ATCGAAAATGCGCTGTGACTTGTGG-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNATrp 5′-leader; S-2820 (5′-AGCTCAGTGGTAGAGCATTGG-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNATrp 5′-end; S-3215 (5′-CCAAAAAGGGCCCCCAGCGCGAAAACC-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNATrp 3′-trailer; and S-2819 (5′-TGAGAGCTGCAGGGATTGAAC-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNATrp 3′-end. The following oligonucleotides (based on GenBankTM/EBI accession number L20948 (33Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) were used for RT-PCR of mature and precursor tRNAIle: S-3478 (5′-CCTACATCCATATTCGCAGTATGT-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNAIle 5′-leader; S-3479 (5′-GCTCCCGTGGTCTAGTTGGTTAGG-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAIle 5′-end; S-3480 (5′-TTGGGGATTTTGGGGGCGGAAAAG-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNAIle 3′-trailer; and S-3385 (5′-GGCTCGAACCCGCGACATCCGGTTC-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAIle 3′-end. The following oligonucleotides (based on GenBankTM/EBI accession number X68207 (34Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) were used for RT-PCR of mature and precursor tRNAGln. S-3475 (5′-TCACCTTCATCATCCTTGTATGAT-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNAGln 5′-leader; S-3476 (5′-GCTCCTATA-GTGTAGCGGTTATCA-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAGln 5′-end; S-3477 (5′-GCCGCTTTTTGGTGGGGGGGTAAA-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNAGln 3′-trailer; and S-3387 (5′-GGACTCGAACCAGGGTTATCGGATT-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAGln 3′-end. The following oligonucleotides (based on based on GenBankTM/EBI accession number L20948 (33Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) were used for RT-PCR of mature and precursor tRNALys. S-3864 (5′-TGGAGTAGCAATACGAATTCC-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNALys 5′-leader; S-3865 (5′-GCACTTCTAGCTCAGTTGGTAG-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNALys 5′-end; and S-3866 (5′-CGCACTCCGTGGGGCTCGAAC-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNALys 3′-end. The following oligonucleotides (based on GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF016249 (37Suyama Y. Wong S. Campbell D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) were used for RT-PCR of mature and precursor tRNAVal. S-3861 (5′-TTGTAGCTCACATCCAGTAGC-3′) was used for amplification of the tRNAVal 5′-leader; S-3862 (5′-GCGATGGTCGTCTAGTGGTTAG-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAVal 5′-end; and S-3863 (5′-TACGACGGGCGGGGATTGAAC-3′) was used for amplification of the mature tRNAVal 3′-end. The following oligonucleotides were used for 3′-RACE of tRNATrp. S-3122 (5′-TTGAATTCGCATTGAGCACCTGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) was used for reverse transcription of polyadenylated RNA, and S-3123 (5′-TTGAATTCGCATTGAGCACCTGC-3′) was used for PCR amplification of the resulting cDNA. For reverse transcription reactions, 40 pmol of the appropriate oligonucleotide primer were combined with 2 μg of each RNA in a 20-μl reaction using 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the directions of the manufacturer. Identical reactions were performed without the addition of Superscript II for the no-reverse transcriptase control. 1 μl of each reverse transcription reaction was used as a template for PCR amplification. Each 50 μl of PCR contained 40 pmol of each of the appropriate oligonucleotide primers and 1× PCR buffer (Promega) with 2 mmMgCl2, 500 μm each dNTP, and 5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase. Thermal cycling was performed with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2.5% Metaphor-agarose gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts). PCR products were cloned using the pCR-2.1-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Precursor tRNATrp RT-PCR products were purified from a 2.5% Metaphor-agarose gel to separate the PCR product from unincorporated primers and nucleotides. The PCR products were digested withHinfI. After digestion, the reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a 2.5% Metaphor-agarose gel. The in vitro RNA importation assay (16Rubio M.A. Liu X. Yuzawa H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 50,000 cpm radioactively labeled RNA, 1 mg of mitochondria (∼40 μg of protein), 1 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.63 mm creatine phosphate, and 22.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After incubation at 27 °C for 5–30 min, 100 units of micrococcal nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 mm CaCl2were added to digest the RNAs that were not imported into the mitochondria. Micrococcal nuclease was then inhibited by the addition of 10 mm EGTA (pH 8). To isolate imported RNAs, the mitochondria were pelleted and suspended in 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS and extracted with phenol; and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The radioactively labeled RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 7m urea and 8% acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the nuclease-protected radioactively labeled RNAs were visualized and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To map the 3′-end of tRNATrp by RT-PCR, 15 μg of RNA from each cell fraction were polyadenylated using a combination of yeast poly(A) polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Escherichia colipoly(A) polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to previously established protocols (26Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 384-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting polyadenylated RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis in a 20-μl reaction using 200 units of Superscript II and primer S-3122. A 5-μl portion of the cDNA reaction was used as a template in PCR using primers S-2820 and S-3123. Several methods exist for the isolation of kinetoplast-mitochondrial fractions fromL. tarentolae cells with <5% contamination with cytosolic rRNA (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). Cells can be ruptured in hypotonic (21Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or isotonic (27Hauser R. Pypaert M. Häusler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) media, and mitochondria can be isolated by isopycnic sedimentation in Renografin (21Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or Percoll (28Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gradients. The hypotonic rupture/Renografin method yields mitochondrial fractions of the highest purity and yield (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). These methods cannot, however, be used to obtain nuclear fractions due to the presence of chelating agents, which cause the nuclei to rupture during isolation. We have modified the method of Shapiro and Doxsey (22Shapiro S.Z. Doxsey S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which was developed for T. brucei, by disrupting cells in the Stansted Fluid Power cell disruption apparatus in the presence of 0.5 m hexylene glycol and CaCl2 and banding nuclei in a Percoll gradient. As shown in the micrograph in Fig.1 A, this method produces a high yield of morphologically intact nuclei with essentially no intact cells or contaminating debris visible at the level of light microscopy. Furthermore, since the kinetoplast-mitochondrion remains intact and associated with the flagellum and cell ghost after cell rupture, clarification of the lysate yields a cytosolic cell fraction with little apparent mitochondrial or nuclear contamination.Figure 1Separation of L. tarentolaeinto nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions. A, microphotography of isolated nuclei. The purified nuclei were photographed at 1000× under both phase-contrast and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained (with ultraviolet light) conditions (as indicated). B, Northern analysis of RNA isolated from different cell fractions. 1.5 μg of RNA isolated from whole cells (total), the cytosolic fraction (cyto), purified nuclei (nuc), or purified mitochondria (mito) were separated on an 8 murea and 6% acrylamide gel. The ethidium bromide-stained gel is shown with the results of Northern hybridizations using oligonucleotide probes specific for several marker RNAs (as indicated). U6 snRNA, U6 small nuclear RNA; SL RNA, spliced leader RNA; gRNA RPS12-I, RPS12 block I guide RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ascertain the purity of the subcellular fractions, equal amounts of RNA isolated from each cell fraction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 1 B. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions show, in addition to tRNA, the predominant five small rRNAs characteristic of trypanosomatids (29Campbell D.A. Kubo K. Clark C.G. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial fraction shows only the 9 S and 12 S mitochondrial rRNAs (30Simpson L. Simpson A. Cell. 1978; 14: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and tRNA. In addition, Northern analysis was performed using hybridization probes for marker RNAs specific for the nucleolus (92-nucleotide small nucleolar RNA) (31Roberts T.G. Sturm N.R. Yee B.K., Yu, M.C. Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the nucleus (U6 snRNA), and the mitochondrion (RPS12-I guide RNA) (32Maslov D.A. Sturm N.R. Niner B.M. Gruszynski E.S. Peris M. Simpson L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The probe for the 92-nucleotide small nucleolar RNA showed specific hybridization to the nuclear fraction. The probe for the U6 snRNA showed a large enrichment in the nuclear fraction with some hybridization to the cytosolic fraction; it is unclear whether the latter represents leakage from the nucleus during cell fractionation or the presence of transient U6 snRNA traversing the cytosol during normal RNA maturation and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein assembly. The guide RNA probe showed strong hybridization to the mitochondrial fraction and weak hybridization to the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The probe for the SL RNA showed hybridization to both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, but not to the mitochondrial fraction. The fact that the small nucleolar RNA, U6 RNA, and SL RNA probes showed no hybridization to the mitochondrial fraction indicates a high level of purity of this cell fraction, which was confirmed by the guide RNA hybridization results. Quantitation of these blots indicated that the mitochondrial fraction had undetectable levels of nuclear or cytosolic contamination, the cytosolic fraction had 0.3% nuclear contamination and <0.1% mitochondrial contamination, and the nuclear fraction had <0.1% mitochondrial contamination. The intracellular distributions of specific tRNAs were examined using the above cell fractionation procedures. Equal amounts of tRNA from the mitochondrial and cytosolic cell fractions were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). Comparison of the patterns of the ethidium bromide-stained gels indicated that ∼24 tRNAs are shared between the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, 20 are mainly cytosolic, and 9 are mainly mitochondrial. However, it should be noted that compartment-specific nucleotide modifications may alter the mobility of a given tRNA and may lead to the erroneous assignments of import phenotypes on ethidium bromide-stained gels. Therefore, proper assessment of import phenotype must include Northern analysis. To establish the intracellular distribution of the five specific tRNAs, gels were blotted and hybridized with labeled oligonucleotide probes. The tRNAGln probe detected a tRNA spot that was more intense in the cytosolic RNA fraction. The tRNATrp and tRNAVal probes detected single spots of approximately equal intensity in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial RNA fractions. The tRNAIle probe detected a single spot of low relative intensity in the mitochondrial RNA fraction, and the tRNALys probe detected a single spot of high relative intensity in the mitochondrial RNA fraction. From these results, we operationally define the distribution of tRNATrp(CCA) and tRNAVal(CAC) as a “shared” pattern, the distribution of tRNAGln(CUG) as a “mainly cytosolic” pattern, and the distribution of tRNAIle(UAU) and tRNALys(UUU) as a “mainly mitochondrial” pattern. These are relative operational designations and do not include corrections for the relative amounts of tRNA in the cytosol and mitochondrion on a per cell basis. The genes for the tRNAs examined in this study were analyzed by clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting (Fig. 2 B). The tRNAIle and tRNATrp genes localized to the same chromosome of ∼700 kb. This is consistent with the observations that these two tRNA genes are contained in the same genomic tRNA cluster (33Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and are single-copy. 2J. D. Alfonzo, S. T. Kapushoc, and L. Simpson, unpublished data. The tRNALys probe also showed hybridization to the same chromosome of ∼700 kb, which is consistent with the fact that this tRNA is in the same gene cluster as tRNAIle and tRNATrp. In addition, the tRNALys probe also showed hybridization to a chromosome of ∼680 kb, which may indicate another copy of the same tRNA gene or hybridization of the probe to a different tRNA gene of similar sequence. The probe for tRNAGln hybridized to three chromosomes of ∼1500, 850, and 650 kb. The hybridization pattern of this probe is consistent with the previous observation that this gene is multicopy (34Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The tRNAVal probe hybridized to a single chromosome band of ∼560 kb. To address the question of whether 5′-precursors are in vivo substrates for import into the mitochondrion (17Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RT-PCR of the mitochondrial and shared tRNAs (tRNATrp, tRNAIle, tRNALys, and tRNAVal) was performed with RNAs isolated from the nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial cell fractions using primers specific for the flanking genomic sequences (Fig.3, A–E). For comparison, cytosolic tRNAGln was also assayed. Control amplifications using internal primers yielded products corresponding to the mature tRNA sequences in each case. We found that 5′-precursors of each tRNA could be amplified only from the nuclear fraction, a result consistent with 5′-end processing occurring prior to export from the nucleus, as is the case in other eukaryotic cells (35Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Three tRNAs (tRNATrp, tRNAIle, tRNAGln) were assayed in addition by RT-PCR for the subcellular localization of 3′-precursors, and these also localized solely to the nuclear fraction. These data suggest that both 5′- and 3′-end processing of the mitochondrial tRNAs occurs prior to export from the nucleus. To analyze the subcellular localization of 3′-CCA addition to a tRNA targeted to the mitochondrion, 3′-RACE of tRNATrp was performed using RNAs isolated from the nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial cell fractions. Of the clones obtained from the nuclear RNA fraction, 58 had mature 3′-CCA ends, and two had unprocessed 3′-ends (Fig.4 B). One of the latter sequences terminated at an oligo(T) stretch just downstream of the 3′-end of the mature tRNA (Fig. 4 A, Nuc-1), and the other terminated at another oligo(T) stretch 14 nucleotides farther downstream (Nuc-2). The positions of these unprocessed 3′-ends are indicated in Fig. 5 (♦). This lack of precise transcription termination may provide an explanation for the observed PCR amplification of 3′-extended precursor molecules in the tRNATrp RT-PCR experiment (Fig.3 A). Similar analysis of RNAs isolated from the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions revealed that tRNAs in these fractions contained mature 3′-CCA ends (Fig. 4). This evidence suggests that 3′-CCA addition occurs in the nucleus, even in the case of tRNAs that eventually localize in the mitochondrion. The data presented so far are consistent with a model in which the mature tRNAGln, tRNAIle, tRNATrp, tRNAVal, and tRNALysmolecules are the in vivo substrates for importation into the mitochondrion. Rubio et al. (16Rubio M.A. Liu X. Yuzawa H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that in vitro importation of synthetic tRNAs into isolated mitochondria shows a high level of selectivity that, at least in the case of tRNAIle and tRNAGln, is correlated with thein vivo subcellular localization. We therefore assayed thein vitro importation efficiency of T7-transcribed tRNAIle with and without a 50-nucleotide 5′-leader. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that mature tRNAIle is the preferred substrate for mitochondrial importation. This selective in vitro importation is probably not due to the pre-tRNA folding into an unusual structure since digestion of 5′-extended tRNAIle with E. coliRNase P RNA (44Waugh D.S. Green C.J. Pace N.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1569-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was shown to cleave the 5′-leader at the expected position (Fig. 6). The C34 to U34 editing event of mitochondrial tRNATrp can be detected by resistance to digestion of the edited cDNA with HinfI since editing destroys a HinfI site (36Alfonzo J.D. Blanc V. Estevez A.M. Rubio M.A. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7056-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, the amplified cDNAs from each of the tRNATrp precursors were completely digested byHinfI. The HinfI-digested precursor tRNATrp RT-PCR products were further analyzed for possibleHinfI-resistant molecules by extracting the region of the gel that would contain undigested amplification products and using this as a template for additional cycles of PCR. No amplification products were obtained in this second PCR (data not shown), indicating that the initial RT-PCR of tRNATrp precursors did not amplify any molecules with edited anticodons. This indicates that editing occurs after 5′- and 3′-end maturation and is consistent with an intramitochondrial localization of this reaction. Since mature unedited tRNATrp appears to represent the in vivo substrate for importation into the mitochondrion, we decided to analyze the specificity of the in vitro import system for unedited versus edited tRNA. A comparison of the in vitro importation of T7-transcribed unedited and edited tRNATrp is shown in Fig. 8. Unedited tRNATrp reached a higher saturation level than edited tRNATrp, indicating that the import mechanism can distinguish between these two isoforms. There appear to be at least three overlapping classes of tRNAs inL. tarentolae in terms of subcellular localization: 1) mainly cytosolic, 2) mainly mitochondrial, and 3) shared between the two compartments. This is based on two-dimensional gel analysis of cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs and on Northern blot analysis of five specific tRNAs: tRNATrp, tRNAIle, tRNAGln, tRNALys, and tRNAVal. We showed in this study that tRNALys represents a second mitochondrion-localized tRNA in addition to the previously identified tRNAIle. This differs from the previous result of Suyama and co-workers (33Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Suyama Y. Wong S. Campbell D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), who classified tRNALys as having a shared phenotype. The signals for mitochondrial targeting are not known, although we have shown previously that swapping the D-arm between mitochondrion-localized tRNAIle and cytosolic tRNAGln reversed the importation phenotypes of these molecules both in vivo and in vitro (5Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rubio M.A. Liu X. Yuzawa H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tertiary structure of the molecule is involved in the specificity of targeting. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis of Hancock et al. (17Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the signal for mitochondrial importation resides within the 5′-flanking region and that 5′-extended precursor tRNAs are the native substrates for mitochondrial importation. We have shown that 5′- and 3′-end processing of tRNAs of all three classes occurs in the nucleus prior to export to the cytosol. These results imply that the substrates for importation into the mitochondrion are the mature tRNAs, at least in terms of end processing. The proposal that mature tRNAs are the import substratesin vivo is further supported by the finding that a T7-transcribed mature tRNAIle is imported into isolated mitochondria more efficiently than the 5′-extended precursor molecule. The lack of editing at nucleotide 34 of the tRNATrpprecursor molecules is consistent with a mitochondrial localization of this editing reaction and also with the importation of mature unedited tRNATrp. This observation is in contrast with the editing of tRNAAsp in marsupials (38Borner G.V. Morl M. Janke A. Paabo S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 15: 5949-5957Google Scholar, 39Morl M. Dorner M. Paabo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial tRNA editing in plants (40Kunzmann A. Brennicke A. Marchfelder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), where editing precedes tRNA 3′-processing. This difference might reflect the fact that in L. tarentolae, the edited tRNA is encoded in the nucleus and thus required for translation in both the cytosol and the mitochondria, whereas in plants and marsupials, the edited tRNAs are encoded in the mitochondria and only function in intra-organellar translation. In addition, tRNA editing in plants leads to stabilization of the acceptor stem and may be responsible for providing the proper recognition substrate for the 3′-processing activity. The finding that edited L. tarentolae tRNATrp is poorly imported in vitro compared with unedited tRNATrp suggests a subtle molecular discrimination of isoacceptors by the transport apparatus. This discrimination of a single nucleotide change in the anticodon is reminiscent of the results of Rusconi and Cech (2Rusconi C.P. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2870-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Rusconi C.P. Cech T.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 15: 3286-3295Google Scholar) in Tetrahymena, in which a single nucleotide change in a tRNAGln anticodon conferred a mitochondrial importation phenotype in vivo. The presence of an intramitochondrial RNase P-like activity and a ATP/CTP:tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity (16Rubio M.A. Liu X. Yuzawa H. Alfonzo J.D. Simpson L. RNA. 2000; 6: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is not inconsistent with importation of mature tRNAs since the former activity could be involved in other aspects of RNA metabolism (41Gold H. Topper J. Clayton D. Craft J. Science. 1989; 245: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Reddy R. Shimba S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 22: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 43Topper J.N. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 16-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the latter activity could play a role in the repair of the 3′-ends of tRNAs. It should be noted, however, that our results with the mitochondrion-localized tRNAs we have examined do not eliminate the possibility that there are alternate pathways for importation of other tRNAs into the mitochondrion in these cells (19LeBlanc A.J. Yermovsky-Kammerer A.E. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21071-21077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Yermovsky-Kammerer A.E. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6253-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A complete cataloging of all mitochondrial tRNAs in the cell is required to address this question. The data presented in this report suggest a model for a tRNA import pathway in L. tarentolae, which is diagrammed in Fig.9. The tRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus as precursors with extended 5′- and 3′-ends, and the precursors are end-processed prior to export from the nucleus. The mature tRNAs are then exported to the cytosol, where a fraction is retained for cytosolic translation, and another fraction is imported into the mitochondrion for organellar translation.

Although this family of enzymes is regulated by nuclear receptors, few hormone-responsive elements have been demonstrated in MMP promoters. In order to identify regulatory elements and/or factors that control the expression of the mousest3 gene, we have analyzed genomic sequences encompassing 5 kilobase pairs of the ST3 promoter. Analysis of these sequences revealed several CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) and retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs), as well as one thyroid-responsive element. However, in contrast to most MMP promoters, no AP-1-binding sites were identified. Specific binding activities were demonstrated for all elements. Consistent with previous reports, retinoid X receptor is required for maximal binding to the ST3 RAREs and the TRE. The ST3-C/EBP element was shown to mediate dose-dependent promoter activation by C/EBPβ. Among the RAREs, the proximal DR1-RARE was shown to be sufficient for ST3 promoter activation by ligand-bound retinoid receptors, whereas the two distal DR2-RAREs appear to be involved more in the control of base-line promoter activity. Accordingly, ST3 expression was induced by retinoic acid and was reduced in cells where specific retinoic acid receptors had been inactivated. The involvement of these conserved regulatory elements is discussed in the context of physiological or pathological situations associated with st3 expression. Our findings therefore assign to C/EBP, retinoids, and thyroid hormone important roles in the regulation of ST3 gene expression.

Since then, stromal expression ofST3 has been identified during the progression of most types of human carcinomas, including basal cell carcinomas (4Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Bruce K. Hedblad M.

Consistent with these observations, experimental models of tumorigenesis have shown that st3 promotes both tumor uptake in nude mice (8Noël A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. Van Hoorde L. Chenard M.P.

Furthermore,ST3 expression has been observed in atherosclerotic vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages present in human atherosclerotic lesions, whereas no expression is detected in normal aortic specimens (10Schönbeck U.

Like other MMP family members,st3 is expressed during normal physiological processes such as wound healing (11Okada A. Tomasetto C. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Basset P. J.

Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all of which are associated with intense tissue remodeling.Although certain physiological processes associated with MMP expression are controlled by hormones, few hormone-responsive elements have been characterized in MMP promoters (16Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of st3, several experimental observations suggest that it may be regulated by hormones in vivo. For example, in Xenopus laevis, tissues such as the intestine and the tail express high levels of st3 during metamorphosis, a process that is controlled by thyroid hormone (17Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In human endometrium, which undergoes monthly cycles of rapid growth and remodeling in response to ovarian steroid hormones, ST3 is transiently expressed during the proliferative stage, and there is evidence for its repression by progesterone (18Osteen K.G. Rodgers W.H. Gaire M. Hargrove J.T. Gorstein F. Matrisian L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10129-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).The expression of st3 is also observed during post-lactating involution of the mammary gland, an apoptotic process associated with intense extracellular matrix remodeling (13Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.M. Hutin P. Wendling C. Le Meur M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, during development, st3 expression has been detected in the fetal interdigital mesoderm of limb bud in human (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and mouse (15Lefebvre O. Régnier C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) embryos, an area associated with programmed cell death. Interestingly, the formation of interdigital necrotic zones during digit separation has been shown to be controlled by RA (19Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which retinoic acid regulates the mouse ST3 gene in this process has not been addressed.The expression pattern of mouse st3 suggests that it may be under either the direct or indirect control of hormones and/or vitamin A derivatives. In order to identify regulatory elements and/or factors controlling the expression of st3 in both physiological and pathological conditions, we first isolated and characterized its promoter. We have identified a number of responsive elements and provide evidence for direct control of st3 by C/EBPβ, thyroid hormone, and retinoid receptors. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the mechanism by which st3 can be regulated in response to stimuli from hormones or vitamin A derivatives in physiological and/or pathological situations associated with tissue remodeling processes.DISCUSSIONThe mouse st3 gene has been shown to be induced in various tissue remodeling processes that are characterized by extracellular matrix turnover and/or apoptosis and that are controlled by hormones (18Osteen K.G. Rodgers W.H. Gaire M. Hargrove J.T. Gorstein F. Matrisian L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10129-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and/or retinoic acid (19Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which its expression is regulated have not been addressed. In the present study, the mouse st3 promoter was isolated and analyzed to investigate this question. The transcription initiation site was mapped, and minimal promoter sequences driving transcription were identified between positions −121 and +15. This minimal promoter activity was shown to be modulated through elements contained within various upstream regions. The analysis of 5 kb of st3promoter led to the identification of a number of regulatory elements including TRE, RAREs, and C/EBPs that are conserved between human, mouse, and/or X. laevis. We have shown that these elements are functional in binding assays and/or promoter studies and are likely to participate in the in vivo control of mousest3 expression.In normal physiological conditions, the X. laevis st3 has been shown to be tightly regulated by the thyroid hormone during tadpole metamorphosis. However, although a TRE of the DR4 type has been recently identified in both the X. laevis 2Y. B. Shi, personal communication. and the human ST3 gene (Fig. 4), this element has not yet been characterized. With respect to the mouse TRE, we have shown here that it binds thyroid hormone receptors in the presence of RXRα. This finding supports previous studies that have described RXRs as being members of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins and that the binding affinity of TR/RXR heterodimers to TRE is higher than that of TR alone (33Schrader M. Carlberg C. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, although the conservation of this element suggests a physiological relevance, no target mouse or human cells that express st3 in response to T3 have been reported thus far. Expression of the X. laevis st3 in response to T3 during tadpole metamorphosis therefore remains the only example of the physiological expression of st3 in T3-controlled apoptotic processes (31Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Damjanovski S. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4738-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).In pathological situations, a number of clinical and experimental studies suggest an involvement for T3 and its receptors in carcinogenesis. Amplification or deletion of erbA genes has been described in breast cancer (39van de Vijver M. van de Bersselaar R. Devilee P. Cornelisse C. Peterse J. Nusse R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 40Ali I.U. Lidereau R. Callahan R. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2624-2627PubMed Google Scholar), and there is experimental evidence for an increased number of thyroid receptors in spontaneous rat mammary tumors (42Sellitti D.F. Tseng Y.C. Latham K.R. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1030-1038PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, it is interesting to note that the expression and secretion of stromelysin-1, which promotes mammary carcinogenesis (43Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), is actually regulated by thyroid hormone in cells derived from the mammary gland (44Lopez-Barahona M. Fialka I. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Asuncion M. Gonzalez M. Iglesias T. Bernal J. Beug H. Munoz A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As st3 was originally isolated from breast cancer tissue, the possible role for thyroid hormone in the regulation of this gene in vivo cannot be excluded.As with most MMP genes, both the human and mouse st3 genes are induced by TPA (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 9Masson R. Lefebvre O. Noël A. Fahime M.E. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Kebers F. Le Meur M. Dierich A. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Such TPA activation is normally mediated through TPA-responsive elements or AP-1-binding sites. However, while the position of this element is very well conserved in most MMP promoters, no AP-1-binding site was found within the mousest3 gene 5′-flanking sequences studied here, suggesting either that this element is located elsewhere in the promoter or that an alternative mechanism is involved in st3 transcriptional activation by TPA. A recent report has demonstrated that st3can still be induced by TPA in vivo, in transgenic mice in which a c-jun transactivation mutant dramatically represses TPA-induced AP-1 activation (45Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This observation implies that alternative regulatory element(s) exist that could mediatest3 transcriptional activation by TPA. In this respect, the conserved C/EBP element that we have identified in the mousest3 promoter appears to be a good candidate, as other studies have shown that C/EBP-binding sites mediate the activation of a number of TPA-responsive genes (46Doyle G.A.R.

Indeed, we have shown that this element can bind efficiently to the C/EBPβ transcription factor, which in turn activates transcription. Interestingly, among the various physiological processes in which C/EBPβ has been reported to play a role (48Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1999; 189: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, in conjunction with data from these studies, our data suggest that the requirement of C/EBPβ in the control of stromelysin-3 expression may be physiologically relevant.Another aspect of st3 regulation that differs from other MMPs is its positive regulation by RA. RA has been shown to repress the expression of AP-1-regulated genes and, consistent with this observation, the expression of various MMP genes is repressed by RA (16Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). The present study supports further our previous findings that demonstrated that expression of the human ST3 gene is induced by RA (21Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found indeed that the human DR1- and DR2-RAREs are highly conserved in the mouse promoter. Furthermore, we have shown that all RAREs present in the mouse st3 promoter are capable of binding RA receptors. This binding occurred preferentially with RAR/RXR heterodimers and is consistent with what we and others (36Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have observed for the human ST3 gene and for several RA-responsive genes, as these heterodimers are considered to be the functional units controlling RARE-dependent promoter transactivation. However, although multiple RAREs present in several gene promoters have been shown to be required for promoter activation and to cooperate for an optimal response to RA (54Astrom A. Pettersson U. Chambon P. Voorhees J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22334-22339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the proximal DR1-RARE of ST3 alone was sufficient to mediate promoter activation by RA and that this response was not further induced in promoter constructs including the two additional DR2-RAREs. When we evaluated st3 expression in cells exposed to RA, we found that it was indeed induced by both 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA. In addition, the base-line expression ofst3 was significantly reduced in cells in which RA receptors were inactivated by homologous recombination. Together, these observations support that RA receptors contribute to the regulation ofst3 base-line expression and suggest furthermore that whereas the DR1 is required for the st3 response to RA, the DR2-RAREs contribute to the base-line expression of ST3.Certain observations in vivo are supportive of physiological relevance in the regulation of st3 expression by RA. For example, the process of interdigital cell death in digit separation during embryogenesis is controlled by RA (19Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar) and is associated with the expression of the human (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and mouse st3 (15Lefebvre O. Régnier C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other genes such as bone morphogenic proteins and tissue transglutaminase that have previously been shown to play a role in apoptosis (13Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.M. Hutin P. Wendling C. Le Meur M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 55Rodriguez-Leon J. Merino R. Macias D. Ganan Y. Santesteban E. Hurle J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This process does not occur in mice in which RA receptors such as RARβ and RARγ have been inactivated (19Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, since the expression level of both the st3and bmp-7 genes is almost undetectable in these knock-out mice, certain authors (56Dupe V. Ghyselinck N.B. Thomazy V. Nagy L. Davies P.J.A. Chambon P. Mark M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have suggested that RA might increase cell death in interdigital necrotic zones through a modulation of both of these genes, thereby contributing directly to this tissue remodeling process. With respect to st3, by showing for the first time that RA receptors bind to st3-RAREs and that their inactivation alters st3 expression and response to RA, our data provide evidence for the direct transcriptional control ofst3 by RA in vivo. Furthermore, one should note that certain physiological processes such as tail resorption controlled by T3 during frog metamorphosis, and mouse interdigital separation controlled by RA, are associated with cell death suggesting a role forst3 in apoptosis that has been conserved across evolution.In summary, we have isolated the mouse st3 promoter in order to provide further insight into the regulation of the expression of this gene. As discussed here, although st3 expression has been detected in a variety of tissues (see Introduction), very little was known about the molecular mechanisms controlling its induction. Although homology between the human and the mouse st3promoters is restricted to a limited proximal region, we have identified and characterized distal regulatory elements such as a TRE, C/EBPs, and RAREs that are well conserved and whose corresponding binding factors are known to be involved in the regulation tissue remodeling processes associated with st3 expression. Therefore, we can speculate that the direct control of st3expression by these factors may also be of importance in vivo. Determining how the st3 gene is regulatedin vivo in a cell-specific manner represents a future challenge that will be not only of basic interest but may also have interesting applications in the context of gene therapy directed against the tumor stroma. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 are a family of structurally related proteinases that play a central role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix during both normal and pathological tissue remodeling processes. ST3, a member of this family, was originally identified in the stromal compartment of a range of human invasive carcinomas of the breast (1Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P.

Poulsom R. Smith P. Barnes D. Rubens R. Anglard P. Hart I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, stromal expression ofST3 has been identified during the progression of most types of human carcinomas, including basal cell carcinomas (4Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Bruce K. Hedblad M.

Pract. 1993; 189: 1052-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggesting that it contributes to tumor progression. Consistent with these observations, experimental models of tumorigenesis have shown that st3 promotes both tumor uptake in nude mice (8Noël A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. Van Hoorde L. Chenard M.P.

Furthermore,ST3 expression has been observed in atherosclerotic vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages present in human atherosclerotic lesions, whereas no expression is detected in normal aortic specimens (10Schönbeck U.

Like other MMP family members,st3 is expressed during normal physiological processes such as wound healing (11Okada A. Tomasetto C. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), trophoblast implantation (12Maquoi E. Polette M. Nawrocki B. Bischof P. Noël A. Pintiaux A. Santavicca M. Schaaps J.P.

Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all of which are associated with intense tissue remodeling. Although certain physiological processes associated with MMP expression are controlled by hormones, few hormone-responsive elements have been characterized in MMP promoters (16Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of st3, several experimental observations suggest that it may be regulated by hormones in vivo. For example, in Xenopus laevis, tissues such as the intestine and the tail express high levels of st3 during metamorphosis, a process that is controlled by thyroid hormone (17Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In human endometrium, which undergoes monthly cycles of rapid growth and remodeling in response to ovarian steroid hormones, ST3 is transiently expressed during the proliferative stage, and there is evidence for its repression by progesterone (18Osteen K.G.

To elicit its functions, Glu activates two types of receptors: ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic receptors coupled to G-proteins (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). Kainate-binding proteins (KBPs)1 are members of the ionotropic Glu receptors' gene family, the expression of these proteins is enriched in non-mammalian vertebrates (2Henley J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the chick, KBP is expressed as a 49-kDa glycosylated polypeptide that is restricted to the cerebellum. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have shown that KBP is expressed exclusively in Bergmann glia (3Gregor P. Eshhar N. Ortega A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Somogyi P. Eshhar N. Teichberg V.I. Roberts D.B. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 9-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The chick KBP is the best characterized of the non-mammalian vertebrate KBPs and is the major binding site for kainate within the cerebellum. Several lines of evidence suggest a functional role of chick KBP; for example, the expression of KBP follows by several days the onset of Bergmann glia development and matches the time of migration of granular cells (2Henley J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, KBP expression is up-regulated by an imprinting stimulus in ducks (5Kimura N. Kurosawa N. Kodo K. Tsukada Y. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 17: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, with the exception of toad KBP, no functional properties have been reported for this protein. No ligand-gated ion channel activity is observed, even when chick KBP is coexpressed with other ionotropic receptor subunits. Interestingly, when the transmembranal domain of the chick KBP is linked to the Glu binding site of membrane α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) receptors in a chimera construction, this transmembranal domain can function as an ionic pore (6Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bergmann glia extends processes through the molecular layer, ensheathing Purkinje cell dendrites and the excitatory synapses between Purkinje cells and the parallel and climbing fibers. Because of this specific localization, it has been suggested that these cells participate in the modulation of the efficacy of excitatory synapses surrounded by them (4Somogyi P. Eshhar N. Teichberg V.I. Roberts D.B. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 9-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Bergmann glia cells (BGC) carry in their membranes AMPA/KA, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and metabotropic receptors (7López T. López-Colomé A.M. Ortega A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activation of these receptors promotes calcium influx, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, PKC translocation to the membrane, activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, increase in DNA binding activity of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and changes in Glu receptors expression (8López T. López-Colomé A.M. Ortega A. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 58: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Parallel fiber stimulation induces depolarization of Bergmann glia, an effect mediated by AMPA/KA receptors and by the Na+-dependent Glu transporter (9Clark B.A. Barbour B. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These responses suggest that long term changes within Bergmann glial cells occur as a consequence of synaptic activity. In this sense, chick KBP could be an important molecule related to long term changes in glial function, glia-neuron communication, or synaptic plasticity. The relative expression of the various Glu receptors is not static but is remodeled during development, isquemia, seizures, repetitive activation of afferents, or chronic administration of a variety of drugs (10Myers S.J. Dinglidine R. Borges K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known of the molecular identity of the promoter regions involved in such regulation, mainly because in the promoter regions reported thus far, none of them predicts the interaction of inducible transcription factors. An interesting exception is the chkbp promoter, in which a putative AP-1 binding site has been reported (11Gregor P. Yang X. Mano I. Takemura M. Teichberg V.I. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1992; 16: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present work, we provide evidence for a Glu-induced transcriptional regulation of KBP expression mediated through an AP-1 site. Chick cerebellar BGC were prepared as detailed elsewhere (8López T. López-Colomé A.M. Ortega A. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 58: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14-day-old chick embryos were used, and the cerebellum was dissected and homogenized mechanically. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 ml−1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and used after 5–6 days in culture. Confluent monolayers were exposed to the indicated concentrations of agonists for varying periods of time; antagonists were added 10 min before the agonists. Incubation was stopped by removing the medium, and samples were processed as detailed below. The cells were harvested and washed several times with 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS). Cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml leupepetin), and aliquots of this suspension were used for protein concentration determination and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein (approximately 50 μg) were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were stained with Ponceau S to confirm that protein loading was equal in all lanes. Filters were soaked in PBS to remove the Ponceau S and incubated in PBS containing 5% dried skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h to block the excess of nonspecific protein binding sites. Filters were then incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS buffer followed by secondary antibodies. The antibodies used were: polyclonal anti-KBP, polyclonal anti-c-Jun, polyclonal anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Finally, the proteins were detected using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, reverse-transcription was performed as described previously (7López T. López-Colomé A.M. Ortega A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from confluent monolayers as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, and 40 pmol of oligo(dt) as primer. The coamplification of an internal control housekeeping S17 chick ribosomal protein mRNA was performed. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, by 24 cycles. Equal aliquots of each PCR reaction were removed and analyzed by 1.2% agarose-gel electrophoresis. Data were quantified by scanning the labeled bands, and the optical densities of KBP were normalized to the S17 signal. The oligonucleotides used as primers were: KBP sense, 5′-GCGAATTCGTGGGAGATGGGAAGTATGGC-3′; KBP antisense,: 5′-GCGGTACCTATGGTGAAGAGCCACCA-3′; S17 sense, 5′-TACACCCGTCTGGGAACGAC-3′; S17 antisense, 5′-CCGCTGGATGCGCTTCATCAG-3′. Linear amplification was found between 24 and 30 cycles as determined by scanning of the ethidium bromide staining of the electrophoresed PCR products (data not shown). The pKS-KBPNet plasmid that contains the entire 1.7 kilobase pairs of chKBP cDNA (a gift of Prof. V. I. Teichberg, Weizman Institute) was labeled by the random primer method and used as probe. Approximately 15 μg of total RNA from cultured BGC were electrophoresed, transferred by capillarity to nitrocelluose membranes, hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C, and exposed to x-ray films. The specific amount of KBP mRNA was normalized against the quantification of RNA on Nothern membranes using ethidium bromide staining and optical scanning as described by Eykholtet al. (14Eykholt R.L. Mitchell M.D. Marvin K.W. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 868-870Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed and sequenced using standard techniques. The plasmid p435kbpCAT contains the entire chick KBP 5′-noncoding region cloned in the pCAT-Basic vector (Promega) amplified by PCR using the primers kbpup (5′-ACATGCATGCAAAGGCCTTTCTTTCAGC-3′) and kbplow (3′-CTAGTCTAGAAAACTTCAGCAATTCCTTCA-5′) and chick cerebellum DNA. Serial deletions of p435kbpCAT were made by cuts in the appropriated sites to generate p250kbpCAT (HindIII) and p170kbpCAT (BspMI) constructs. For AP-1 site mutagenesis, three point mutations were introduced in the context of p435kbpCAT (p435kbpAp1M), using a QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following oligonucleotides were used to generate mutations in AP-1 control element: 5′-CCCCAACTGATCTGACttcATCACGGAG-3′; 5′-CTTTCTCCGTGATgaaGTCAGATCAGTTGGGG-3′. The lowercase letters indicate the mutated bases. PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume withPfu polymerase (Stratagene), 5 ng of DNA template and 125 ng of each oligonucleotide using the manufacturer's conditions. The PCR product was treated with DpnI (10 units) for 60 min at 37 °C and DNA-transformed in Escherichia coli DH5α. Plasmids were prepared from individual colonies and sequenced to confirm the introduced mutations. The double-stranded wild type (see below) and mutant chAP-1 (same as used for mutagenesis) oligonucleotides were cloned in PstI site upstream of the SV40 promoter (in sense and antisense orientations) of the pCAT-Promoter vector (Promega) that contains theCAT gene, resulting in the plasmids pchAp1kbpCAT-S, pchAp1kbpCAT-AS, pchApMkbpCAT-S, and pchApMkbpCAT-AS. The chAP-1 wild type oligonucleotide was also cloned in the p250kbpCAT construct. All clones were screened for the correct orientation and sequenced to check wild type or mutated bases (Sequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Dr.Yuspa (NCI, National Institutes of Health) kindly donated the expression plasmids pSG5/c-jun and pSG5/c-fos used in cotransfection experiments. Transient transfections and CAT assays were done in 60% confluence BGC cultures using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 3 μg of reporter plasmid. Treatment with glutamatergic ligands was performed 24 h post-transfection for the indicated time periods and concentrations. Protein lysates were obtained as follows. Cells were harvested in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm NaCl), lysed with three freeze-thaw cycles in 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 3 min. Equal amount of protein lysates (∼80 μg) were incubated with 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.8 mmacetyl-CoA (Sigma) at 37 °C. Acetylated forms were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified using an AMBIS 4000 Scanalytics radioactive image analyzer. CAT activities were expressed as the acetylated fraction corrected for the activity in the pCAT-Basic vector and are expressed as relative activities to non-treated control cell lysates. Cotransfection experiments were done under the same protocol using the indicated amounts of the expression vectors. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (15López-Bayghen E. Vega A.

All of the buffers contained complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to prevent nuclear factor proteolysis. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (approximately 15 μg) from control or agonist-treated BGC (1 mm, 2 h, for indicated times) were incubated on ice with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 ng of 32P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides as follows: chAP-1, 5′-AAGCTTGATCTGACACAATCAGCTT-3′; AP1SV, 5′-CTAGTTCCGGCTGAGTCATCAAGC-3′; APSVM, 5′-CTAGTTCCGGCTAAGTAATCAAGC-3′; Sp1, 5′-CTAGATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGAGC-3′; SIEm67STAT3, 5′-GTCGACAGTTCCCGTCATC-3′. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and electrophoresed in 7 or 8% polyacrylamide gels using a low ionic strength 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to an autoradiographic film. For competitive studies, the reaction mixtures were pre-incubated with the indicated amount of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide before the addition of labeled DNA. For gel supershift experiments, reactions with the DNA·protein complexes were incubated at 4 °C with anti-c-Jun (sc-45, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p53 (sc-123, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h prior to electrophoresis. Treatment of cultured chick BGC with 1 mm Glu elicits a time-dependent accumulation of the characteristic 49-kDa KBP polypeptide as detected with an antiserum raised against the purified protein (Fig. 1 A). The maximal response is obtained after 12 h of Glu exposure and is still present after 24 h of agonist treatment. The dose dependence of the effect was explored, and an EC50 of 200 μm was determined (Fig. 1 B). A pharmacological profile of the receptors involved in chick KBP accumulation was undertaken. Exposure of the cultures for 12 h to a concentration of 500 μm kainate (KA), as well as to 200 μm N-methyl-d-aspartate plus 10 μm glycine, 100 μm1-amino-4,5-ciclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylate, or 100 μm quisqualate, led to a similar increase in KBP levels as in treatment with 1 mm Glu (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the involvement of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in the phenomena. This puzzling result was further confirmed when specific antagonists were used to block the Glu effect. Preincubation with the specific antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione at a concentration of 50 μm, 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-cyclohapten-5,10-imine (MK-801) at 5 μm, orl-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid at 500 μmresulted in a reduction in the Glu-mediated increase in KBP.Figure 2Pharmacological profile of KBP induction. Panel A, cells were incubated for 12 h with the indicated analogues, Glu (glu) 1 mm, KA 500 μm, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 200 μm, plus Gly 10 μm, 1-amino-4,5-ciclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylate (tACPD) 100 μm, or quisqualate (Quis) 100 μm. Panel B, the antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) 50 μm, 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-cyclohapten-5,10-imine (MK801) 5 μm, andl-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (LAP3) 500 μm were added 30 min before Glu. KBP levels were quantified as in Fig. 1. Values are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To gain insight into the level of regulation being modified to Glu exposure, we first measured chick KBP mRNA levels by means of semiquantitative RT-PCR from control and Glu-treated cells, using the small ribosomal protein 17 (S17r) as an internal control (17Leonard M.W. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Development. 1993; 119: 519-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Linear amplification was found between 24 and 30 cycles, as demonstrated by scanning of the ethidium bromide staining of the electrophoresed PCR products (not shown). Treatment of the cells with 1 mm Glu resulted in a time-dependent increase in chKBP mRNA (Fig. 3 A). These results were further confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the increased amount of KBP in Glu-treated cells may result from a transcriptional regulation of the kbp gene elicited by Glu receptor activation in BGC. The sequence previously reported as the putative promoter of chick KBP had not been functionally characterized (11Gregor P. Yang X. Mano I. Takemura M. Teichberg V.I. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1992; 16: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further explore the transcriptional regulation of KBP, we isolated chick DNA and performed PCR experiments with specific primers to amplify the putative promoter sequence (12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The predicted band of around 500 bp was cloned into a pBluescript II plasmid and sequenced. As depicted in Fig. 4, the sequence obtained showed only minor changes in comparison with the sequences previously reported (11Gregor P. Yang X. Mano I. Takemura M. Teichberg V.I. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1992; 16: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To perform functional assays, the putative promoter sequence was subcloned into the reporter plasmid pCATBasic, and BGC cultures were transfected in basal conditions (cells not stimulated with Glu). The p435kbpCAT construct (nt −435 to +88) shows a lower expression of the CAT reporter gene in comparison with p250kbpCAT or p170kbpCAT constructs (Fig. 5 A). Deletion of 185 or 265 bp of the 5′ region significantly increased the promoter activity after deletion, suggesting that the region upstream nt 170 could contain several negative regulatory elements. Maximal transcriptional activity in nonstimulated conditions can be defined in the −170/+88 region. Treatment with 1 mm Glu of cultured BGC transfected with the p435kbp construct resulted in a time-dependent increase in activity (Fig. 5 B). Exposure to 1 mm KA mimicked this effect (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, when the deleted constructions p250kbpCAT and p170kbpCAT were tested for Glu induction, none of them responded to the agonist treatment (Fig. 5 C). These results clearly suggest that the −435/−250 region confers the response to Glu treatment, constituting a Glu-responsive element (gluRE). The promoter sequence of chkbp includes several putative binding sites for inducible transcription factors (Fig. 4; Refs. 11Gregor P. Yang X. Mano I. Takemura M. Teichberg V.I. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1992; 16: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and 12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that Glu promotes an increase in the binding activity of AP-1 in Bergmann glial cells (18Sánchez G. Ortega A. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 2109-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it was tempting to speculate that Glu might be regulating KBP expression through the putative AP-1 binding sequences within its promoter. Interestingly, an AP-1-like sequence is present at nt 337–329 (within the gluRE). We therefore decided to explore and detect nuclear factors capable of interacting with the gluRE, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays as well as functional experiments with several new generated constructs. A 180-bp gluRE fragment containing the putative chick AP-1 site was labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from control or stimulated BGC. As depicted in Fig. 6 A, KA induces both an increase in the intensity of two retarded bands (solid arrows) as well as the appearance of a new retarded complex (open arrows). As expected, a significant increase in binding to the SV40 AP-1 site (AP1SV oligonucleotide) is elicited by KA (8López T. López-Colomé A.M. Ortega A. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 58: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Sánchez G. Ortega A. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 2109-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Note that treatment with KA does not result in an increase on STAT3 binding to the SIS-inducible element (SIE) (19Aguilera P. Ortega A. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The characterization of the chick AP-1 site was performed using an end-labeled 25-bp double-stranded nucleotide (chAP-1). Several specific complexes were retarded with nuclear extracts of Glu-exposed BGC. Binding activity was increased in BGC treated with the agonist (Fig. 6 A, right, complex a). An excess of 100- or 150-fold of AP1SV completely abolishes the radioactive signal corresponding to the slowest migrating band (complex a). The same concentrations of a mutated form of AP1SV or a heterologous oligonucleotide (Sp-1) do not compete for complex a binding (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5–9). Interestingly enough, an excess of unlabeled chAP-1 is able to compete for AP1SV binding (Fig. 6 B, lanes 12 and13), thus suggesting that indeed the AP-1 family members are bound to the chAP-1 site in the gluRE. Supershift experiments with anti-c-Jun polyclonal antibodies result in a reduction of the mobility of the upper chAP-1 complex and a new super-retarded one. These results suggest that c-Jun is part of the transcription complex bound to thechkbp promoter upon Glu exposure. With anti-Fos antibodies, the reduction was as shown in Fig. 6 C. A mutational approach was used to define the role of the chAP-1 site in the gluRE. Several changes in essential bases for AP-1 binding were introduced in the context of p435kbpCAT. As depicted in Fig. 7 A, mutation of chAP-1 abolishes the Glu response, demonstrating that chAP-1 mediates the Glu effect. Furthermore, the chAP-1 element is also capable of conferring Glu-induced transcriptional activity to a heterologous promoter, the SV40, that is present in the pCAT-Promoter vector (Fig. 7 B). This activity is dependent on both the integrity and orientation of the chAP-1 sequence; mutated or antisense versions do not confer Glu-responsiveness. Interestingly, when the chAP-1 site is fused to the −250/+88 chkbp region, a dramatic transcriptional increase (∼30-fold) is obtained upon exposure to Glu (Fig. 7 C). In line with the mentioned results, a Western blot analysis of BGC nuclear extracts from Glu-stimulated cells shows a time-dependent increase in c-Jun and c-Fos levels (Fig. 8 A). Accordingly, when the amount of c-Jun or c-Fos is artificially augmented by co-transfection of the pSG5/c-Jun, or pSG5/c-Fos expression vectors along with the p435kbpCAT construct, a concentration-dependent increase in CAT activity is observed (Fig. 8). Thus, c-Jun and c-Fos are implicated in the increased levels of AP-1 binding to the chkbp gluRE upon stimulation of Glu receptors. It has become clear that Glu does not confine its excitatory actions to neurons but also interacts with glia cells. Because neurons and glia share the same subtypes of Glu receptors, an active role for glia cells in neurotransmission is now evident. Applied on cultured glial cells, Glu regulates the opening of receptor channels, activates second messenger cascades, causes the release of neuroactive substances, and triggers the binding to DNA of inducible transcription factors (20Condorelli D.F. Conti F. Gallo V. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Steinhauser C. Verkhratsky A. Yuan X. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468: 49-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pechan P.A. Chowdhury W. Gerdes W. Seifert W. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 153: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In astrocytic cultures, Glu produces changes these in gene expression: induces the expression of neuronal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, and the transcriptional factors c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun, Jun B, zif/268, and NF-κB (22Otori Y. Shimada S. Tanaka K. Ishimoto I. Tano Y. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 310-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In situ, Glu-mediated gene expression has also been reported in astrocytes, for example following transient ischemia, the expression of the Glu transporter, GLAST, is up-regulated (23Davis H.P. Squire L.R Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Requirement for protein and mRNA synthesis has been documented for long term memory (24Latchman D.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, the analysis of regulatory mechanisms of Glu-induced gene expression in glial cells is a prerequisite to postulate long-lasting modulation of glial cells in neuronal communication or function. A stimulus-transcription coupling elicited by Glu has been documented in cultured BGC (18Sánchez G. Ortega A. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 2109-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, an imprinting stimulus leads to an increase in Bergmann glia-specific KBP mRNA levels in ducks (5Kimura N. Kurosawa N. Kodo K. Tsukada Y. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 17: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fact that Glu receptor activation is involved in the acquisition of a wide variety of learning paradigms suggests that Glu receptors might play a role in KBP gene expression regulation. This is indeed the case; Glu receptor activation results in increased levels of KBP. Apparently, the effect is mediated through ionotropic as well as metabotropic receptors, suggesting that the signaling cascades activated by these receptors either converge or that the level of regulation modified is different each receptor subtype. This issue remains to be determined. As mentioned, downstream targets for ionotropic receptor-activated signaling pathways in cultured BGC include an increase in AP-1 DNA binding (18Sánchez G. Ortega A. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 2109-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that an AP-1 site is present in the putative promoter region of chkbp (12Eshhar N. Hunter C. Wenthold R.J. Wada K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we speculated that the increase in KBP levels detected upon Glu exposure was the result of a transcriptional regulation through this AP-1 site. First, it was important to demonstrate that the reported putative promoter region could drive the transcription of a reporter gene. Second, the reporter activity should be inducible by Glu. Third, deletion or mutation of this AP-1 site would necessarily abolish the Glu effect. Not only these conditions were fulfilled, but also three main regions could be defined: 1) the promoter region, nt −170/+88, containing the characteristic TATA and GC boxes, with a higher transcriptional activity but not inducible by Glu; 2) a region containing negative regulatory elements (nt −250/−170), strongly acting over the promoter but unaffected by Glu; 3) a Glu-responsive region, in which the AP-1 site is present, functional, and essential for response. A major role for the Fos/Jun heterodimer in Glu-mediated transcription is possible for a number of reasons. Nuclear extracts prepared from Glu-treated cells are able to reduce the eletrophoretic mobility of a bona fide AP-1 site, the SV40 AP-1 site. Moreover, this oligonucleotide sequence competes with the AP-1 containing a 25-bp fragment of the putative Glu-responsive element ofchkbp (chAP-1) for the binding of nuclear proteins of Glu exposed cells. Anti c-Jun antibodies as well as anti-c-Fos antibodies supershifted the chAP-1 complex. One could argue that, in addition to an increase in AP-1 binding, Glu favors the binding of other putative elements predicted to interact within this region (OCT1,CAAT, CEBP/B) that might mediate the activating effect. Because over-expression of c-Jun or c-Fos results in a concentration-dependent increase in promoter activity that reproduces the Glu effect, additional cooperativity with other activating factors may be less important. Site-directed mutagenesis of chAP-1 rules out this possibility (Fig. 8). Furthermore, when chAP-1 was fused to the SV40 promoter, it was able to confer Glu inducibility. It is important to note that when chAP-1 is fused to the p250kbpCAT construct, which is not responsive to Glu (Fig. 5 A), a 30-fold increase in transcriptional activity is obtained after Glu treatment (Fig. 7 C). A plausible explanation of this increased response to Glu is that within the −435/−250 region, the binding of other transcription factors might be modulating the AP-1 response (Fig. 9). In fact, this might be the case, because p250kbpCAT displays a 4-fold increase in promoter activity as compared with p435kbpCAT (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, several putative transcription binding sites have been mapped to the −435/−250 region (Fig. 4). A detailed analysis of this possibility is currently in progress in our laboratory. It is important to recall that any negative regulatory element(s) must be located in the −250/−170 region, because deletion of this fragment results in a 60-fold increase in activity in p170kbpCAT construct compared with the p250kbpCAT construct. Careful analysis of putative DNA-protein interactions in the negative regulatory region did not reveal a well known repressor binding site. Nevertheless, octamer binding sites are recurrent in this region, and interestingly, Oct-2 has been reported to act as an ambivalent transcription factor, acting either as activator or repressor in epithelial and neural cells (21Pechan P.A. Chowdhury W. Gerdes W. Seifert W. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 153: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A detailed study is needed to establish the interaction and functional role of each factor in the context of Glu-induced transcriptional activity. In summary, the present study results identify, for the first time, a gluRE and provide a major input to our present understanding of Glu-mediated gene expression regulation. Concomitantly, they suggest that whatever the function of KBP may be, it may play a significant role in long term changes in glia physiology.

https://openalex.org/W2016562281,"The citrate transporter of Leuconostoc mesenteroides (CitP) catalyzes exchange of divalent anionic citrate from the medium for monovalent anionic lactate, which is an end product of citrate degradation. The exchange generates a membrane potential and thus metabolic energy for the cell. The mechanism by which CitP transports both a divalent and a monovalent substrate was the subject of this investigation. Previous studies indicated that CitP is specific for substrates containing a 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif, HO-CR2-COO−. CitP has a high affinity for substrates that have a “second” carboxylate at one of theR groups, such as divalent citrate and (S)-malate (Bandell, M., and Lolkema, J. S. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 10352–10360). Monovalent anionic substrates that lack this second carboxylate were found to bind with a low affinity. In the present study we have constructed site-directed mutants, changing Arg-425 into a lysine or a cysteine residue. By using two substrates, i.e.(S)-malate and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, the substrate specificity of the mutants was analyzed. In both mutants the affinity for divalent (S)-malate was strongly decreased, whereas the affinity for monovalent 2-hydroxyisobutyrate was not. The largest effect was seen when the arginine was changed into the neutral cysteine, which reduced the affinity for (S)-malate over 50-fold. Chemical modification of the R425C mutant with the sulfhydryl reagent 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, which restores the positive charge at position 425, dramatically reactivated the mutant transporter. The R425C and R425K mutants revealed a substrate protectable inhibition by other sulfhydryl reagents and the lysine reagent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonate, respectively. It is concluded that Arg-425 complexes the charged carboxylate present in divalent substrates but that is absent in monovalent substrates, and thus plays an important role in the generation of the membrane potential.

These transporters have been termed precursor-product exchangers since they catalyze the uptake of a substrate into the cell coupled to the exit of a metabolic end product into the medium (for a review see Ref. 1Lolkema J.S. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1996: 229-260Google Scholar). An example of such a transporter is the citrate transporter (CitP) found in Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2Bandell M. Lhotte M.E. Marty Teysset C. Veyrat A. Prevost H. Dartois V. Divies C. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marty-Teysset C. Lolkema J.S. Schmitt P. Divies C. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25370-25376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the uptake of divalent citrate into the cell coupled to the exit of monovalent lactate, a metabolic end product of citrate degradation in lactic acid bacteria (4Marty Teysset C. Posthuma C. Lolkema J.S. Schmitt P. Divies C. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The net charge movement over the membrane during the exchange results in a membrane potential of physiological polarity. This, in combination with the consumption of a cytoplasmic proton in the breakdown of citrate, results in a proton motive force and thus generates metabolic energy for the cell. Recovery from acidic stress and resistance against lactate toxicity have recently been suggested as alternative roles for the metabolic pathway (5Magni C. de Mendoza D. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of CitP to transport two such different substrates as citrate and lactate is associated with a high specificity for the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif present in both substrates (i.e.HO-CR2-COO−), in combination with a high promiscuity toward the two R groups (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, next to the physiological substrates, CitP is able to transport a wide range of 2-hydroxycarboxylates containing various R groups. The ability to accept both a neutral as well as a negatively chargedR group is the basis for membrane potential generation by CitP. CitP is known to have a high affinity for divalent di- and tricarboxylates like citrate and (S)-malate, which have a “second” carboxylate at one of the R groups (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Monocarboxylates like lactate and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (2-HIB),1 which lack this second carboxylate, were found to bind with a low affinity but were still transported efficiently. The high affinity of CitP for substrates with a second carboxylate was explained by postulating a strong, possibly electrostatic, interaction between the protein and the second carboxylate. Positively charged residues such as arginine, lysine, or histidine were thought to be able to participate in such an interaction. CitP belongs to the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter (2-HCT) family (7Bandell M. Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that contains members found in several lactic acid bacteria as well as in Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae(8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The family contains precursor-product exchangers like CitP and the malate transporter MleP of Lactococcus lactis, but also the Na+/citrate symporter CitS of K. pneumoniae, suggesting that precursor-product exchangers are “normal” secondary transporters that have been optimized to catalyze exchange. Transporters of the 2-HCT family are believed to consist of 11 transmembrane segments (TMSs), based on topology studies of CitS of K. pneumoniae (9van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29705-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the proteins resides in the periplasm. A recent study of chimeras between the citrate transporter CitP and the malate transporter MleP indicated that the C-terminal region including TMS XI forms part of the substrate-binding site that interacts with the R groups of the substrates (8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region contains two conserved arginine residues, one of which is located in TMS XI. The latter residue was thought to be a good candidate for an interaction with the second carboxylate of divalent substrates. In the present study Arg-425 in TMS XI of CitP was replaced by lysine and cysteine residues. The mutant transporters were analyzed for their affinity toward the divalent and monovalent substrates (S)-malate and 2-HIB, respectively. In addition, the effect of chemical modification of residues at position 425 and the ability of substrate to protect against modification was investigated. It is concluded that Arg-425 is located in the substrate-binding site where it is responsible for a high affinity interaction with the second carboxylate of di- and tricarboxylates. L. lactisstrain NZ9000 is an MG1363 derivative (pepN::nisRnisK; (12De Ruyter P.-G.-G.-A. Kuipers O.-P. De Vos W.-M. Appl. Environ.

The nisR andnisK genes were inserted in the chromosome to allow induced expression of plasmid-encoded genes under control of the tightly regulated nisA promoter (12De Ruyter P.-G.-G.-A. Kuipers O.-P. De Vos W.-M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells harboring the expression vector pNZcitP containing the citP gene (see below) were grown at 30 °C in closed serum bottles and without shaking in M17 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Unless otherwise stated, expression of the transporter was induced by growing the cells to an optical density of 0.6 measured at 660 nm (OD660), followed by addition of a 1000-fold dilution of the supernatant of an overnight culture of the nisin producing L. lactis strain NZ9700 into the cultures (14Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. De Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The supernatant contained approximately 10 ng of nisinA/ml (15Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Growth was continued for 1 h followed by harvesting of the cells by centrifugation. In some cases a lower level of induction was required to allow kinetic analysis (see “Results”). Then, cells expressing CitP were grown in the presence of a 30,000-fold dilution of the nisin containing supernatant for 0.5 h. General procedures for cloning and DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrooket al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression vector pNZcitP codes for the CitP protein with 10 additional histidine residues at the N terminus (8Bandell M.

R425C and R425K mutations were introduced in the citP gene in two steps by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (17Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). All polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced to confirm the nucleotide sequence. Ligation mixtures were transformed toL. lactis NZ9000 by electroporation as described by Holo and Nes (18Holo H. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Right-side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles of NZ9000 cells expressing wild type or mutant CitP were prepared by the osmotic shock lysis procedure in the presence of 5 mm(S)-malate, essentially as described previously (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were washed once with 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6, containing 5 mm(S)-malate and concentrated by centrifugation in an Eppendorf table top centrifuge operated at full speed for 5 min. The internal pool of (S)-malate was labeled with (S)-[14C]malate by incubating the concentrated membranes with 186.7 μml-[1,4(2, 3)14C]malate for 1 h in the presence of 1 mm valinomycin and 0.5 mm nigericin. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Lowry et al.(19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In case the vesicles were used for chemical modification studies, (S)-malate was omitted in the preparation procedure, and loading of the vesicles with (S)-[14C]malate was done as described under “Chemical Modification.” Aliquots of 2 μl of (S)-[14C]malate-loaded vesicles were diluted into 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, containing substrates at the indicated concentrations at 20 °C. Internal radioactivity was determined at different time points by dilution with ice-cold LiCl followed by rapid filtration, as described (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Final membrane protein concentrations in the assays were between 250 and 350 μg/ml. To evaluate the data, initial rates of exchange were determined by fitting the data to an exponential decay using nonlinear fitting procedures provided by the Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), as described previously (7Bandell M. Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The rate of efflux in the absence of external substrate was subtracted from the observed rates. Exchange rates were determined at different external substrate concentrations to estimate the affinity constant Kmapp. The data were fitted to an equation describing competitive inhibition, taking into account the effect of (S)-[14C]malate in the external buffer caused by the dilution of the (S)-[14C]malate-loaded membrane vesicles (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RSO membrane vesicles (10 mg protein/ml) prepared in the absence of (S)-malate were incubated for the indicated times in 50 mm potassium phosphate containing 5 mm of the lysine-specific reagent TNBS (Fluca) or 1 mm of the sulfhydryl reagents MTSEA, MTSES, MTSET (Anatrace), pCMB, and pCMBS (Sigma) at 23 °C. Reactions with the sulfhydryl reagents were performed at pH 6 and with TNBS at a range of pH values. Following incubation, the vesicles were diluted 15 times in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and concentrated by centrifugation in an Eppendorf table top centrifuge operated at full speed for 5 min. The membranes were washed 3 times using the same procedure. To load the vesicles with (S)-[14C]malate, the concentrated vesicles were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 5 mm(S)-malate, 186.7 μml-[1,4(2,3)14C]malate, 1 mmvalinomycin, and 0.5 mm nigericin. Exchange activity was determined as described above. To test the effect of substrate on chemical modification, RSO membranes were preincubated for 2 h with and without the substrate in the presence of 1 mm valinomycin and 0.5 mmnigericin followed by reaction with 0.1 mm pCMB for 0.5 min or with 30 mm TNBS for 2 h at pH 7. The membranes were washed twice with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, in the presence of substrate and 4 times in the absence of substrate. The concentrated vesicles were loaded with 5 mm radiolabeled (S)-malate, and exchange activity was determined as described above. To evaluate the efficiency of the washing procedure for removing internal substrate, vesicles were equilibrated with 60 mm 2-HIB, butyrate, (S)-malate, (S)-citramalate, or succinate and were washed four times. In all cases exchange rates were not significantly different from vesicles that were incubated in the absence of substrate (data not shown). Right-side-out membrane vesicles were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel matrix (15 μg protein/lane). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes and analyzed using monoclonal antibodies directed against a His tag (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Antibodies were visualized using the Western light chemiluminescence detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). l-[1,4(2,3)-14C]Malic acid (51 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other compounds were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) or Sigma. Arg-425 is conserved in the transporters of the 2-HCT family and located in the C-terminal putative TMS XI (Fig. 1). The involvement of Arg-425 in the interaction with the second carboxylate present in divalent substrates was investigated by constructing site-directed mutants of the citrate transporter CitP of L. mesenteroides. Arg-425 was replaced with Lys, a conservative mutation that retains the positive charge, and with the neutral Cys residue. Mutant and wild type transporters were N-terminally tagged with 10 histidines and expressed in L. lactis NZ9000 cells using the inducible nisApromoter system. The expression levels in the membrane were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against the His tag. The apparent molecular mass of the proteins was about 40 kDa, and under the same induction conditions, the expression levels were similar for CitP and both mutants (Fig. 2).Figure 1Membrane topology and amino acid sequence of the C-terminal part of CitP. The topology model is based on studies of the Na+-dependent citrate transporter CitS of K. pneumoniae which is homologous to CitP (11van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol.

Mutant transporters were assayed for homologous exchange in right-side-out membrane vesicles, using the high affinity substrate (S)-malate. Vesicles loaded with 5 mmradiolabeled (S)-malate were diluted 100-fold into buffer. In the absence of external substrate, efflux of (S)-malate from the membranes down the concentration gradient was a slow process for both wild type and mutant transporters (Fig. 3 (●)). Only when measured for a prolonged period (Fig. 3 C) significant efflux could be observed. The rate of efflux seemed not significantly different for the wild type and mutant transporters. Dilution of the membranes containing the wild type transporter in buffer containing 5 mmunlabeled (S)-malate resulted in very rapid release of the label from the membranes due to CitP-mediated exchange (Fig. 3 A (▪)). Exchange catalyzed by the R425K and R425C mutant was considerably slower but significantly faster than efflux (Fig. 3,B and C (▪)). The Arg to Cys mutation had a more drastic effect on the exchange rate than the conservative Arg to Lys mutation. The kinetic characteristics of the mutant transporters were analyzed with 2-HIB and (S)-malate, a mono- and a divalent substrate of CitP, respectively (see Fig. 4). Under standard induction conditions, exchange catalyzed by wild type CitP was so fast that initial rates of transport could not be measured (Fig. 3 A). To allow the analysis, CitP expression levels were reduced by varying the inducer concentration in the growth medium (see “Experimental Procdures”). The Kmapp for external (S)-malate at an internal concentration of 5 mm(S)-malate was 90 μm for wild type CitP in fair agreement with previous reports (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In heterologous exchange using the same concentration of internal (S)-malate, the Kmapp for external 2-HIB was 5 mm (Fig. 5 A and Table I). Replacing Arg-425 by Lys, thus conserving the positive charge at position 425, reduced the affinity for (S)-malate about 10-fold (Fig. 5 B and TableI). Substitution for the neutral Cys residue had a much more dramatic effect on affinity. No saturation was observed up to a concentration of 10 mm (Fig. 5 C). In contrast to the decrease in the affinity for divalent (S)-malate, the R425K and R425C mutants revealed an increased apparent affinity for monovalent 2-HIB. The affinity of R425K increased 4-fold, whereas R425C had a 20-fold higher affinity for 2-HIB compared with wild type CitP. The maximal rates of exchange decreased in the order CitP > R425K > R425C for both (S)-malate and 2-HIB (Fig. 5 and TableI).Table IKinetic parameters for CitP, R425K, and R425C in exchange(S) -Malate2-HIBKmappVmaxKmappVmaxmmmm/smmmm/sCitP1-aExpression level for CitP was lower than for R425K and R425C (see text).0.09 ± 0.022.4 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.65.8 ± 0.8R425K1.4 ± 0.30.67 ± 0.081.2 ± 0.30.76 ± 0.1R425C>10 1-bLower limit; no significant saturation was observed.>0.07 1-bLower limit; no significant saturation was observed.0.22 ± 0.050.049 ± 0.004Values were evaluated from the data shown in Fig. 5 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Expression level for CitP was lower than for R425K and R425C (see text).1-b Lower limit; no significant saturation was observed. Open table in a new tab Values were evaluated from the data shown in Fig. 5 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results suggest that Arg-425 is specifically involved in the high affinity toward the divalent (S)-malate. The positive charge of the Arg seems to play an important role in the interactions since the changes in (S)-malate affinity were much less pronounced when Arg-425 was replaced with the positively charged Lys residue. The methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives MTSEA, MTSES, and MTSET are small, charged, water-soluble, and cysteine-specific reagents (20Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). They form a mixed disulfide with the thiol of the cysteine via the addition of –SCH2CH2 X groups where Xis SO3−, N(CH3)3+, or NH3+ for MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA, respectively. Right-side-out membrane vesicles containing the transporters were treated with the MTS reagents, and (S)-malate exchange was measured using non-saturating external (S)-malate concentrations (21Ramamoorthy S. Melikian H.E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 347-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Wild type CitP contains one Cys residue at position 361 in putative TMS X. Treatment of RSO membranes containing CitP with the MTS reagents had no effect on the exchange activity (TableII). Apparently Cys-361 is not accessible to the reagents or the modification does not affect activity. In contrast, exchange catalyzed by the R425C mutant was severely affected indicating a specific modification of the Cys at position 425 (TableII). The most striking effect was seen upon incubation with MTSEA which restores a positive charge at position 425 (Fig. 6). The homologous exchange rate increased about 50-fold under the conditions of the experiment. In fact, the exchange catalyzed by MTSEA-treated R425C was faster than observed for the R425K mutant (compare Figs. 6 and 3 B). In contrast to MTSEA, the more bulky positively charged reagent MTSET and the negatively charged MTSES reduced the (S)-malate transport activity of the mutant to undetectable levels. The results indicate that the introduction of a small positive group at position 425 in the R425C mutant can largely restore exchange activity.Table IIExchange (% of control) catalyzed by R425C and CitP after treatment with sulfhydral reagentsR425CCitP10 min150 min10 min150 minNo addition100100100100MTSEA4800100MTSET10049105MTSES9840110PCMB2103PCMBS20295RSO membrane vesicles containing R425C CitP were treated with 1 mm of the reagents for the indicated times.

Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Grubmeyer C. Segura E. Dorfman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) introducing a covalently linked trinitrophenyl group in the protein. Increased reactivity at higher pH values is characteristic for a specific reaction with an amino group (23Grubmeyer C. Segura E. Dorfman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of right-side-out membrane vesicles containing R425K with 5 mmTNBS at pH 6 did not reduce the exchange activity of the transporter. However, the same treatment at pH values of 7 and 8 resulted in the loss of 35 and 80% exchange activity, respectively (Fig. 7 A). Under the same reaction conditions, TNBS had no effect on wild type CitP (Fig. 7 B) indicating a specific modification of the lysine at position 425 in the R425K mutant. Apparently, modification of Lys-425 in the R425K mutant renders an inactive transporter. The localization of the Cys residue at position 425 in the R425C mutant with respect to the membrane was investigated by the reactivity with membrane-permeable and -impermeable thiol reagents. MTSET is a strong base and MTSES a strong acid, and both are generally regarded to be poorly membrane-permeable. On the other hand, MTSEA is a weak base that equilibrates across the membrane in its undissociated form (24Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Chemical modification of the R425C mutant by membrane-impermeable MTSES and MTSET was incomplete even after long incubation times (Table II). The incomplete inactivation was due to low inactivation rates as higher reagent concentrations increased inactivation (not shown). In contrast, the time course of activation with membrane-permeable MTSEA was much shorter. The stimulatory effect was saturated within 10 min. pCMB and its sulfonic acid derivative pCMBS are organomercurial reagents that react with high specificity with cysteine residues. pCMB is membrane-permeable, and pCMBS is not. Treatment of right-side-out membrane vesicles containing R425C with either pCMB or pCMBS eventually resulted in complete inhibition of homologous (S)-malate exchange (Table II). The same treatment had no effect on exchange catalyzed by the wild type transporter, indicating that the Cys at position 425 was modified. Inactivation of the R425C mutant by pCMBS was much slower than observed for of pCMB which fully inactivated the transporter within 3 min (Table II). In fact, 0.5 min of incubation with 0.1 mm pCMB resulted in 80% inhibition (see below), while the same level of inhibition by pCMBS required 10 min of incubation at a 10-fold higher concentration. Taken together these results indicate that Cys-425 reacts much faster with membrane-permeable reagents, suggesting that the residue is accessible at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The R425C mutant revealed a relatively high affinity for external 2-HIB in heterologous exchange ( Kmapp = 0.22 mm; Table II) and, therefore, this substrate was selected to see whether the presence of substrate could protect the mutant against inactivation by pCMB. Right-side-out membrane vesicles were incubated with 2-HIB to equilibrate the substrate over the membrane, followed by treatment with pCMB, and subsequent removal of the substrate and unreacted pCMB (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of 2-HIB, the treatment resulted in 80% inhibition of exchange activity (Fig. 8 A). 2-HIB protected R425C against pCMB inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner, but much higher concentrations were required than anticipated. Protection of R425C by 2-HIB was incomplete even at 60 mm which is far above the Kmapp for external 2-HIB. In the control experiment, 2-HIB was replaced by butyrate, which is very similar to 2-HIB but lacks the hydroxyl group and therefore is not a substrate of CitP (7Bandell M. Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presence of butyrate did not affect the inactivation by pCMB (Fig. 8 A), indicating that the protection by 2-HIB is specific. (S)-Malate and another high affinity substrate of CitP (S)-citramalate (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were tested for their potency to protect the R425K mutant against inactivation by TNBS (Fig. 8 B). In the presence of 60 mm (S)-malate, the 70% inhibition observed in the absence of substrate was reduced to 30%, whereas 60 mm (S)-citramalate completely protected against inactivation under the conditions of the experiment. Similarly as observed for 2-HIB above, much higher concentrations of the substrates were required than would be expected based on the affinity constants for external (S)-malate in the homologous exchange reaction. In the control experiment, succinate which lacks the 2-hydroxy group of (S)-malate, and therefore is not a substrate of CitP, had no effect on the inhibition by TNBS. In this study, the mechanism by which CitP transports both divalent and monovalent substrates, which is crucial to the physiological function of membrane potential generation by the transporter, was investigated. Previous substrate specificity studies showed that CitP is specific for substrates containing a 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif, HO-CR2-COO−, in which the R groups can vary. These R groups were defined as RR and RS to discriminate between different positions of the R groups around the asymmetric C-2 atom in chiral substrates (Fig. 4,inset). CitP is known to have a high affinity for substrates that have a second charged carboxylate at the RSposition, like citrate and (S)-malate (6Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10352-10360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Monovalent substrates that lack this second carboxylate, like lactate and 2-HIB, were found to bind with low affinity but were still transported efficiently. A non-essential interaction between the protein and the second carboxylate of the divalent substrates was postulated that would increase affinity for these substrates. Arg-425 was selected to be a good candidate for the site on the protein involved in this interaction because of the following. (i) Arg-425 is located in the stretch of 46 residues at the C terminus, which has been suggested to be involved in the interaction with the R groups (8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). (ii) Arg-425 is located in a transmembrane segment of the transporter. (iii) Arg-425 is conserved in the 2-HCT family (8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is concluded that Arg-425 indeed interacts with the second carboxylate of the divalent substrates, based on the following observations. First, mutation of Arg-425 decreased the affinity for divalent (S)-malate but not for monovalent 2-HIB. Second, Arg-425 is not essential for transporter activity. Third, a positive charge at position 425 resulted in improved transport activity. Fourth, chemical modification of the residue at position 425 significantly affected transporter activity. Finally, the presence of substrate protected the residue at position 425 against chemical modification. The combination of the results strongly suggests that Arg-425 is in the substrate-binding pocket where it interacts with the second carboxylate. The involvement of TMS XI in the binding site is in line with the behavior of chimeric transporters (8Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The affinities of the mutant and wild type transporters were determined by homologous and heterologous exchange using membrane vesicles loaded with a fixed (S)-malate concentration and varying the external substrate concentrations. The determined affinities are for the external substrate. In a ping-pong type exchange mechanism, the apparent affinity for the external substrate is dependent on the affinity and concentration of the internal substrate. Non-saturating conditions at the inside result in higher apparent affinities for the external substrate and lower maximal rates. Consequently, a mutation that lowers the affinity for internal (S)-malate decreases the Kmapp for external substrate and the maximal rate of exchange. The kinetics observed with 2-HIB of the R425K and R425C mutants are consistent with a decrease in internal (S)-malate affinity in the order Arg-425, Lys-425, Cys-425, if the binding affinity for 2-HIB would not change significantly. The kinetic affinity for external 2-HIB increases, and the maximal rate for heterologous 2-HIB/(S)-malate, as well as for homologous (S)-malate exchange, decreases (Fig. 5). The observed decreased affinity of the mutants for external (S)-malate in homologous exchange strongly argues in favor of a decreased binding affinity of the protein for (S)-malate with a subsequent lowering of the kinetic affinity for internal (S)-malate. The guanidinium group of the Arg-425 residue is not absolutely essential for transport function since even a non-conservative substitution for Cys does not abolish the activity of CitP. However, the affinity for divalent (S)-malate was severely affected by this mutation. The drop in affinity was less when Arg-425 was mutated to Lys, and, especially, the reactivation of R425C by MTSEA, which restores a positive charge at position 425, strongly suggests that the positive charge is essential for high affinity binding of divalent substrates. Nevertheless, the positive charge is not the only relevant factor since Arg-425 cannot be replaced with lysine or MTSEA-labeled cysteine without some loss of affinity. The chemistry of the guanidinium group allows for the formation of two hydrogen bonds, which is known to result in an interaction of unusual strength with a carboxylate group (25Mitchell J.B. Thornton J.M. Singh J. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternatively, only an Arg residue can position its charge accurately relative to the substrate for an optimal interaction. In contrast to the stimulation of exchange by MTSEA, positively charged MTSET inhibited the R425C mutant. The three methyl groups of the quaternary ammonium group of the reagent are likely to interfere sterically with substrate binding and thus inactivate the transporter. MTSES, pCMB, and pCMBS inactivated R425C and TNBS R425K most likely because of the presence of a negative charge on the side chains that is expected to repel the carboxylate of the substrate and/or by steric interference with the substrate. In the topology model of CitP, Arg-425 is located at the cytoplasmic side of TMS XI (9van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29705-29711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The present data support this localization. The chemical inactivation of the R425C mutant in right-side-out vesicles was much faster for the membrane-permeable pCMB than for its impermeable counterpart pCMBS (Table II). Since the two probes have similar chemical reactivities, the difference in inactivation rate suggests that the reactive cysteine is only accessible from the inside. Similarly, chemical modification by the membrane-impermeable MTSET and MTSES was very slow, and modification by the permeable MTSEA was fast. These low reaction rates are not due to differences in chemical reactivity with the thiol groups. In fact, MTSET is known to have 2.5-fold higher intrinsic reactivity for sulfhydryls than MTSEA (13Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Thus, these results also suggest that the reaction takes place at the internal face of the membrane. The low rate of modification with pCMBS, MTSES, and MTSET may be explained by a slow permeation through the membrane by these reagents followed by reaction at the cytoplasmic side or by a low accessibility of the Cys residue from the outside. Accessibility of a binding site residue from either side of the membrane is not unlikely since the transporter has to expose the binding site alternately to the two sides of the membrane during turnover. The presence of substrate protected against chemical modification of the residue at position 425, which is consistent with the assignment of Arg-425 as a binding site residue. Interestingly, 2-HIB protected R425C against pCMB inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner, but protection was still incomplete at a concentration of 60 mm, indicating a very low affinity for the substrate. This contrasted with the high apparent affinity for external 2-HIB in the exchange assays, Kmapp = 0.22 mm (Table I). The same situation was observed for the protection of R425K by (S)-malate against inhibition by TNBS. Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy may be the underestimation of the binding affinity for external substrate when deduced from a kinetic experiment as discussed above or, alternatively, the transporter has a much lower affinity for internal substrate than for external substrate. In any case, full protection against chemical modification was shown to be possible by the high affinity substrate (S)-citramalate. In conclusion, the combination of the kinetic characteristics of the mutants and the chemical modification and substrate protection against chemical modification strongly suggest a direct interaction between Arg-425 and the carboxylate at the RS groups of the divalent substrates. The positive charge of Arg-425 seems to be important in this interaction, but the chemistry of the guanidinium groups may play a role as well. Although Arg-425 is not essential for transport by CitP, its role in specifically interacting with the second carboxylate of di- and tricarboxylate substrates makes it essential for the generation of the membrane potential which is the physiological function of CitP.

https://openalex.org/W2170360953,"A 163-base pair enhancer in theCYP2B2 5′ flank confers phenobarbital (PB) inducibility and constitutes a PB response unit (PBRU). By transfection of primary hepatocytes, we analyzed the function of elements comprising the PBRU and evaluated the role of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in PB responsiveness. A 51-base pair PB-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) within the PBRU confers near-maximal PB response when fused to atk promoter. However, replacing the PBRU with the PBREM in the CYP2B2 5′ flank in the natural sequence context reduced PB responsiveness by approximately 4-fold. Mutational analysis also demonstrated that PBRU sequence elements outside the PBREM are essential for maximal PB responsiveness. The PBRU contains two putative nuclear receptor binding sites, NR1 and NR2. CAR binds to retinoic acid β2 response elements (βRARE) and to the NR1 and NR2 sites of the PBRU and activates transcription of reporter genes in cell lines. However, conversion of NR1 into βRARE was the equivalent of an inactivating mutation, indicating that CAR does not activate PB-dependent transcription via NR1 in the natural sequence context. A βRARE×2-tk reporter construct was inducible by all-trans-retinoic acid (at-RA) as expected and also responded to PB. The latter can be attributed to nuclear accumulation of CAR after PB exposure. Exogenous CAR increased both the basal and PB-induced response of βRARE×2-tk but reduced PBRU-dependent PB response. Furthermore, exogenous CAR also reduced the at-RA response of the βRARE×2-tk construct. Thus, CAR acts negatively on PB responsiveness mediated by the CYP2B2PBRU just as it prevents maximal at-RA responsiveness mediated by βRARE.

We identified a 163-bp Sau3AI fragment at coordinates −2317/−2155 in the CYP2B2 5′-flank that confers PB inducibility on the heterologous tk promoter and has the properties of a transcriptional enhancer when cat reporter constructs are transfected into primary rat hepatocytes (1Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The homologous region of the 5′-flank of the PB-inducible mouseCyp2b10 gene was found to contain a 162-bp segment 92% identical to the rat CYP2B2 163-bp fragment (there is a 1-bp deletion in the mouse sequence with respect to the rat; see Fig. 1 A) that also possesses the properties of a transcriptional enhancer and confers PB inducibility on the heterologous tkpromoter in primary mouse hepatocytes (3Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the rat 163-bp Sau3AI fragment led us to conclude that it is a multicomponent enhancer constituting a PB response unit or PBRU (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The localization of the PBRU at coordinates −2317/−2155 in theCYP2B2 5′-flank is in agreement with results obtained from studies with transgenic mice where the sequences necessary for PB responsiveness were localized between CYP2B2 coordinates −2500 and −1700 (15Ramsden R.

In some experiments, the rat CYP2B2PBRU was replaced by the mouse Cyp2b10 PBRU or by the 51-bp rat CYP2B2 PBREM; in others, no enhancer was present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The rat CYP2B2 PBRU contains, among other putative transcription factor recognition sites, a putative glucocorticoid response element (GRE), a nuclear factor 1 (NF1) site, and an accessory site (AF1) (4Stoltz C.

It also contains two direct repeats separated by 4 bp (DR-4) of the nuclear receptor consensus hexamer half-site motif AGGTCA. These DR-4 sites, NR1 and NR2, which flank the NF1 site, were recognized as putative nuclear receptor binding sites by Negishi and co-workers (8Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in the homologous mouseCyp2b10 fragment. Furthermore, Negishi and co-workers have defined a 51-bp PB responsive enhancer module (PBREM) within the mouseCyp2b10 PBRU sequence. The PBREM is limited to the NR1-NF1-NR2 elements (Fig. 1 A) and confers full PB responsiveness on the heterologous tk promoter (8Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Except for a single bp difference in the NR2 spacer, the Cyp2b10PBREM is identical to the corresponding rat CYP2B1 andCYP2B2 sequences (Fig. 1 A). Negishi and co-workers (7Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) also reported that mutation of any one of the four NR1 or NR2 hexamer half-sites in the mouse 51-bp PBREM (i.e.NR1A, NR1B, NR2A, or NR2B) reduced but did not abolish PB responsiveness conferred on the heterologous tk promoter, whereas mutation of one half-site in both NR1 and NR2 completely abolished such activity. In addition, Negishi and co-workers (7Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell.

CAR, in the form of a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) binds to the retinoic acid β2 response element (βRARE) (16Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and activates transcription of reporter genes driven by these enhancers in cultured cell lines (7Honkakoski P. Zelko I.

Recently, it has been shown that the PB-type inducing compound 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) is an agonist ligand for mouse CAR (18Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 19Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G.

However, the agonist activity of TCPOBOP on CAR seems unrelated to PB-type induction of rat or mouseCYP2B genes because TCPOBOP is not a potent inducer ofCYP2B genes in the rat (20Poland A. Mak I. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 442-450PubMed Google Scholar) and because PB itself, at a concentration (1 mm) that induces both nuclear localization and Cyp2b10 expression in primary mouse hepatocytes (9Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), fails to display agonist activity with respect to CAR (18Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 19Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M.

Furthermore, PB at 0.5 mm in fact exhibits antagonist activity with respect to human and mouse CAR (19Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C.

In any event, ligand-independent transcriptional activation by CAR·RXR heterodimers is thought to account for the PB-induced expression ofCYP2B genes (7Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Although the postulated positive role for CAR in the PB-induced expression of CYP2B genes via the 51-bp PBREM (7Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) has gained wide acceptance (12Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 18Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 21Kim J. Rivera-Rivera I. Kemper B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), there are a number of puzzling anomalies in the results reported to this point. One such anomaly is that sequences outside the 51-bp PBREM appear to be important for conferring PB responsiveness. In our previous work (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), deletion and point mutants of the 163-bp CYP2B2 PBRU were subcloned into the EcoRV site of the non-PB-responsive Ev construct, which contains 1681 bp of the CYP2B2 5′-flanking region cloned upstream of a cat reporter (1Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutation of the putative GRE 5′ of the PBREM substantially reduces PB responsiveness conferred by the rat PBRU in this sequence context (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Honkakoski and Negishi (3Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that sequences they referred to as pB′ on the 5′ side of the 51-bp PBREM contribute to the activity of theCyp2b10 PB-dependent enhancer: deletion of pB′ (which removes the putative GRE) reduces but does not abolish PB-dependent induction. In addition, deletion analysis of the CYP2B2 PBRU using transfection into primary rat hepatocytes (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or in situ injection into rat liver (6Liu S. Park Y. Rivera-Rivera I. Li H. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that a central region (consisting in whole or in part of the PBREM) acts together with upstream or downstream elements within the 163-bp Sau3AI fragment to confer full PB responsiveness. Other results of our deletion analyses of the 163-bp CYP2B2PBRU (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the 51-bp PBREM contains all sequence elements necessary to confer full PB responsiveness. One deletion (−2257/−2172) contained the complete PBREM, yet did not confer full PB responsiveness. Another deletion (−2257/−2188) contained the rat equivalent of an NR2B-mutated version (GTGTCA → CCGTCA) of the 51-bp PBREM. Hence, it might have been expected to retain partial activity, but it was completely inactive in conferring PB responsiveness in our system (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8528-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (note that AF1 and NR2B overlap; see Fig. 1 A). Finally, and even more striking, the 5′ ends of two deletions, −2317/−2207 and −2257/−2207, are different, but both possess NR1, and their identical 3′ ends are within the NF1 site such that they both lack NR2 (Fig. 1 A). According to a model wherein the PBREM contains all the sequences necessary for PB responsiveness, they both should be partially active, or perhaps both completely inactive, but in any case they should be identical. However, −2317/−2207 was partially active whereas −2257/−2207 was completely inactive. It seemed possible that the sequence contexts used for the reported studies by transfection into primary hepatocytes of the mouseCyp2b10 PBREM (placed directly upstream of the heterologoustk promoter) versus the rat CYP2B2PBRU (placed at −1681 in the context of the CYP2B2 5′ flank) might explain some of these anomalies. We report here the results of a series of experiments in which the PBRU and the PBREM were tested in primary rat hepatocytes for their capacity to confer PB responsiveness when placed in the sequence contexts mentioned above as well as directly upstream of the basal rat CYP2B2 promoter and in the natural context of the rat CYP2B2 5′ flank (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we report on the effects of a series of mutations on PB responsiveness conferred by the rat CYP2B2PBRU in its natural context, as well as the effect of exogenous CAR on PB responsiveness. The results are compatible with a model in which CAR acts negatively on PB responsiveness mediated by the ratCYP2B2 PBRU. Chee's medium for hepatocyte culture as well as lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. and MBI Fermentas. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) were from Genosys or Life Technologies, Inc. ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenium) was from Sigma, Vitrogen 100 was from Collagen Canada, collagenase type IV was from Sigma, Percoll was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and dexamethasone phosphate was from Sabex. Petri dishes (60 mm, Permanox) were from Nunc. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–180 g) were from Charles River Canada. The methods for hepatocyte isolation and culture in serum-free medium, essentially those of Waxmanet al. (22Waxman D.J. Morrissey J.J. Naik S. Jauregui H.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), as well as those for liposome-mediated transfection (23Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were as described (1Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), except that for hepatocyte culture Matrigel was omitted and dexamethasone was present at 10 nm. Plasmids were purified using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). Unless otherwise noted, 4 × 106 cells were plated in serum-free modified Chee's medium (22Waxman D.J. Morrissey J.J. Naik S. Jauregui H.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) containing gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and incubated for 3 h to permit attachment. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 h in medium without antibiotic and then transfected and incubated for 36 h (the medium was changed once during that period, typically after 12 h) before adding PB (1 mm), all-trans-retinoic acid (at-RA) (10 μm), or vehicle. After an additional 24 h of incubation, cells were harvested and luciferase activity (Promega Dual Luc) was assayed by luminometry. For transfection, each 60-mm plate received 1 μg of luc reporter plasmid and 1 ng of internal control plasmid (the Renilla luc gene under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer) in 30 μl of lipofectin reagent. When CMV promoter/enhancer-driven expression vectors for CAR or RXR were present, total expression vector plasmid DNA was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of an empty CMV vector (pCMX). Results of luciferase assays presented in a given figure panel were obtained with hepatocytes isolated from individual rats and typically are representative of experiments with hepatocytes from at least two rats. The 177-bp Cyp2b10 fragment (3Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14943-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) homologous to the rat 163-bp CYP2B2 fragment (PBRUr) was obtained by PCR amplification from mouse genomic DNA and subsequently trimmed bySau3AI digestion to yield the 162-bp mouse PBRU. The mouseCyp2b10 51-bp PBREM was obtained by PCR amplification as described by Honkakoski et al. (8Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the corresponding rat PBREM, identical but for a single bp substitution (Fig. 1 A), was prepared similarly. The upstream PCR primer used to amplify the PBREM had a BglII site near its 5′ end and the downstream primer had a BamHI site at its 5′ end to facilitate subsequent cloning. The pGL3 basic vector (Promega) was used forluc reporter constructions. Four different sequence contexts (Fig. 1 B) were used for the mouse or rat PBRUs and PBREMs. The murine enhancers were cloned directly upstream of the enhancerlesstk promoter (tk context), or of the 120-bp CYP2B2basic promoter (−120 context), or of the EcoRV site at −1681 of the CYP2B2 5′ flank (Ev context), or in the natural sequence context (between −2317 and −2155 for the rat BRRU) of the CYP2B2 5′ flank (X context). This latter context was so named because an XhoI site at −2.5 kb (1Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A.

A rat PBRU in which the flanking Sau3AI sites were converted by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis into BglII sites was used to facilitate subcloning. The mutagenesis was performed with the wild type X construct using−2331CCAATGCCTTTCTaGATCtTGGACACAACCTTC and−2172CTGCCAGGCTGGGAgATCTGGCACTG as the upstream and downstream mutant oligo respectively (only the upper strand is shown; mutated bases are in lowercase characters). The plasmid so obtained was used for the transfection analyses and to generate the various PBRU mutants. Cleavage of the X construct with BglII followed by religation generated the enhancerless X construct. The PBREM-X construct was obtained by subcloning the PBREM into theBglII site of the enhancerless X construct. PBREM mutants were generated in the PBREM-X construct. The −120 constructs were obtained by first creating a BglII restriction site at −122 of the CYP2B2 5′ flank by site-directed mutagenesis of the pBSCAT-Ev construct (1Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A.

The basal CYP2B2promoter was then subcloned as a BglII-HindIII fragment into pGL3, and the PBRU and the PBREM were subsequently subcloned upstream of this. The PCR-based QuikChange system (Stratagene) system was used for site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of the expected mutated bases and no others was confirmed by sequencing of the PBRU or PBREM within the reporter plasmid prior to use. With the exception of the GRE mutation, the mutations used for functional analysis of the PBRU or PBREM (Table I) were generated in the reporter plasmid in the natural sequence context. The GRE mutation was that of Stoltz et al. (4Stoltz C. Vachon M.-H. Trottier E. Dubois S. Paquet Y. Anderson A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1988956690,"Coenzyme A (CoA-SH), a cofactor in carboxyl group activation reactions, carries out a function in nonribosomal peptide synthesis that is analogous to the function of tRNA in ribosomal protein synthesis. The amino acid selectivity in the synthesis of aminoacyl-thioesters by nonribosomal peptide synthetases is relaxed, whereas the amino acid selectivity in the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is restricted. Here I show that isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase aminoacylates CoA-SH with valine, leucine, threonine, alanine, and serine in addition to isoleucine. Valyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes aminoacylations of CoA-SH with valine, threonine, alanine, serine, and isoleucine. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase aminoacylates CoA-SH with lysine, leucine, threonine, alanine, valine, and isoleucine. Thus, isoleucyl-, valyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases behave as aminoacyl-S-CoA synthetases with relaxed amino acid selectivity. In contrast, RNA minihelices comprised of the acceptor-TψC helix of tRNAIle or tRNAVal were aminoacylated by cognate synthetases selectively with isoleucine or valine, respectively. These and other data support a hypothesis that the present day aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases originated from ancestral forms that were involved in noncoded thioester-dependent peptide synthesis, functionally similar to the present day nonribosomal peptide synthetases."

In the male, these steroids are primarily metabolized into two oxidized (16α-hydroxyl and 6β-hydroxyl) products mainly by the respective, male-specific cytochrome P450 subforms, CYP2C11 and CYP3A2, while they are primarily metabolized into the 5α-reduced products by female-predominant 5α-reductase in the female.

Expressions of these sexually differentiated enzyme activities are largely regulated at the transcription level under endocrine control, with the secretory pattern of GH playing a major role. Intermittent and pulsatile (i.e. male pattern) GH secretion induces CYP2C11 gene expression, whereas a more continuous female pattern repressesCYP2C11 and CYP3A2 gene expressions and conversely induces 5α-reductase gene expression (6Legraverend C.

In the course of our investigation on structural requirements of substrates and/or inhibitors for active sites of CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 in male rat liver microsomes (to be published elsewhere), we unexpectedly found that male-specific products, 16α-OH-P and 6β-OH-P, inhibited female-predominant [3H]PROG 5α-reductase activity without significantly inhibiting the CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 activities producing themselves, while 3α-OH-5α-P and 5α-P, female-predominant products by the 5α-reductase, not only stimulated this enzyme activity but also inhibited the male-specific oxidative [3H]PROG metabolism. In the present paper, we extend these findings and suggest a novel self-augmentation effect of the male-specific products on sexually differentiated steroid metabolism in adult male rat liver microsomes, not involving gene expressions of the related enzymes. [1,2-3H]PROG (specific activity, 49.2 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and purified by a paper chromatographic system of hexane, saturated with formamide. Unlabeled steroids were purchased from Sigma and Steraloids Inc. (Wilton, NH). Goat anti-rat NADPH P450 reductase antiserum and rat CYP3A2 supersomes were purchased from Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), and Whatman No. 1 filter papers used for paper chromatographies were from Whatman Ltd. Other reagents were of analytical grade. Male Wistar rats, originally provided by Japan Charles River K. K., were bred in our colony. They were castrated on the 70th day after birth and used 3–4 weeks later. The liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (11Yamada M. Nishigami T. Nakasho K. Nishimoto Y. Miyaji H. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Effects of various unlabeled steroids on [3H]PROG metabolism by liver microsomes were examined, according to our previously described procedure (12Yamada M. Indo K. Nishigami T. Nakasho K. Miyaji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the microsomal suspension (400–600 μg of protein/2.2 ml, total volume of the reaction mixture) was preincubated with [3H]PROG (20 nm) in the absence or presence of an unlabeled steroid (0.0316–10 μm) at 36 °C for 30 min. Then NADPH (3.16 μm) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 5 min. After the incubation, two identical samples were mixed and extracted with toluene. In some cases, before the above described incubation procedure, microsomal suspension (250 μg of protein/1.1 ml, total volume of the reaction mixture) was preincubated with goat anti-rat NADPH P450 reductase antiserum (50 μl) at 25 °C for 30 min in order to inhibit P450-dependent oxidative [3H]PROG metabolism. The toluene-extractable [3H]PROG metabolites (more than 98%) were isolated by various paper chromatographic systems and then identified by the recrystallization method (13Yamada M. Matsumoto K. Endocrinology. 1974; 94: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because of the limited expense, the amounts of various [3H]PROG metabolites were estimated, based on the mean values of purified efficiencies obtained from the recrystallization method in the first 10 and several important experimental batches. The mean ± S.D. values of purified efficiencies were as follows: unchanged [3H]PROG (99.26 ± 2.59%), [3H]16α-OH-P (88.22 ± 4.14%), [3H]6β-OH-P (75.39 ± 3.95%), [3H]2α-OH-P (69.15 ± 5.11%), [3H]17α-OH-P (53.74 ± 9.72%), [3H]20α-OH-P (92.86 ± 2.92%), [3H]5α-P (92.97 ± 6.83%) and [3H]3α-OH-5α-P (97.45 ± 3.81%). In order to examine the direct effects of some unlabeled steroids on the oxidative [3H]PROG metabolism, we used rat CYP3A2 supersomes, microsomes (82.5 μg of protein/1.1 ml, total volume of the reaction mixture) of insect cells (BTI-TN-5B1-4) containing the cDNA-expressed rat CYP3A2, rat NADPH P450 reductase, and human cytochrome b 5. Other experimental conditions were the same as those using the rat liver microsomes. The purified efficiency of [3H]6β-OH-P, exclusively formed by the supersomes, was 95.31 ± 3.81%. Other procedures are described in our previous papers (11Yamada M. Nishigami T. Nakasho K. Nishimoto Y. Miyaji H. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Yamada M. Indo K. Nishigami T. Nakasho K. Miyaji H. J. Biol.

In the present study, the respective final concentrations of [3H]PROG and NADPH were adjusted to be 20 nmand 3.16 μm, although these were approximately 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than those of customary enzyme assay systems (4Swinney D.C. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1990; 18: 859-865PubMed Google Scholar, 5Murray M. Cantrill E. Martini R. Farrell G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Chang T.K.H. Bellward G.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1383-1391PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shimada M. Murayama N. Nagata K. Hashimoto H. Ishikawa H. Yamazoe Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reasons are as follows. 1) When the final concentration of ethanol (used for solubilizing [3H]PROG and an unlabeled steroid) exceeded 2% (v/v), this induced aggregation of the microsomes, 2A. Yamada, M. Yamada, Y. Fujita, T. Nishigami, K. Nakasho, and K. Uematsu, unpublished results. and Wiebel et al. (14Wiebel F.J. Leuts J.C. Diamond L. Gelboin H.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 144: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) have shown that some P450-dependent enzyme activities could be affected by more than 1% (v/v) of ethanol. Therefore, ethanol concentration was fixed to be 0.68% (v/v) in the present study, by which some unlabeled steroids became insoluble in the reaction mixture at their final concentrations over 1.0 μm. 2) The [3H]PROG concentration of 20 nm used seems physiological rather than those of the customary systems, since the plasma PROG concentration is estimated to be about 10 nm in adult male rats (15Corpéchot C. Young J. Calvel M. Wehrey C. Veltz J.N. Touyer G. Mouren M. Prasad V.V.K. Banner C. Sjövall J. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 16Lancel M. Faulhaber J. Holsboer F. Rupprecht R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E763-E772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The yields of unidentifiable [3H]PROG metabolites, included in both the water-soluble and toluene-extractable fractions, increased in a dose-dependent manner when either lower concentrations of [3H]PROG or higher concentrations of NADPH were used.2 The [3H]PROG metabolism of the representative result for the 37 experimental batches performed in the present study is shown in Table I. In the microsomes alone, without additions of NADPH and an unlabeled steroid (the second column), only [3H]20α-OH-P and 5α-reductase-dependent metabolites, [3H]5α-P and [3H]3α-OH-5α-P, were formed in small amounts. However, the addition of 3.16 μmNADPH (the third column), a common cofactor of P450-dependent and 5α-reductase-dependent metabolisms induced larger formations of the respective male-specific CYP2C11- and CYP3A2-dependent oxidized metabolites, [3H]16α-OH-P (rather than [3H]2α-OH-P) and [3H]6β-OH-P, as compared with small increases of the 5α-reduced metabolites. The mean ± S.D. values of these products obtained from the 37 experimental batches were as follows: [3H]16α-OH-P (7.37 ± 1.30 pmol/mg protein/5 min), [3H]6β-OH-P (2.87 ± 0.62), [3H]5α-P (4.85 ± 1.75), and [3H]3α-OH-5α-P (1.35 ± 0.63). The ratio of [3H]16α-OH-P to [3H]6β-OH-P agreed well with that of CYP2C11 to CYP3A2 content in adult male rat liver microsomes (1Dannan G.A. Guengerich F.P. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10728-10735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shimada M. Murayama N. Nagata K. Hashimoto H. Ishikawa H. Yamazoe Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the ratio of the sum of oxidized to 5α-reduced products seemed to be severalfold to 10-fold lower than those of other investigators' data (1Dannan G.A. Guengerich F.P. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10728-10735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chang T.K.H. Bellward G.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1383-1391PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H.

This discrepancy may be partly related to the fact that we used adult male rats castrated for 3–4 weeks (in order to decrease endogenous steroids and increase [3H]5α-reduced metabolites), because such a postpubertal castration is known to induce a partial feminization of liver microsomal steroid metabolisms by repressing theCYP2C11 and CYP3A2 gene expressions and conversely stimulating the 5α-reductase gene expression (2Blanck A.

Open table in a new tab The microsomal suspension was preincubated with [3H]progesterone (20 nm) in the absence or presence of a 1 μm concentration of an unlabeled steroid at 36 °C for 30 min. Then NADPH (3.16 μm) was added or not, and the mixture was incubated for a further 5 min. The dose-dependent effects of representative, unlabeled steroids on the P450-dependent oxidative (sum of formed [3H]16α-OH-P and [3H]6β-OH-P) and 5α-reductive (sum of formed [3H]5α-P and [3H]3α-OH-5α-P) metabolisms of [3H]PROG were examined (Fig.1). Both PROG and 16α-OH-P effectively inhibited the formation of [3H]5α-reduced metabolites in a very similar, dose-dependent manner. The former steroid inhibited also the oxidative metabolism, but the latter did not inhibit it. Most interestingly, 3α-OH-5α-P and 3α,11β-(OH)2-5α-P, compared with PROG, not only showed stronger inhibitory effects on the oxidative metabolism but also conversely stimulated the 5α-reductive metabolism. We found that various unlabeled steroids used could be divided into six groups, A, B, C, D, E, and F, based on their respective effects on the oxidative and 5α-reductive [3H]PROG metabolisms (Fig.2 and Table I). The group A steroids such as 3α-OH-5α-P and 5α-P showed inhibitory effects on the oxidative metabolism, while having stimulatory effects on the 5α-reductive metabolism producing themselves. The group B steroids, PROG and TEST, inhibited both metabolisms as probably alternative substrates. The group C steroids, 5β-A-17β-ol and 3β-OH-P, showed inhibitory effects on the oxidative metabolism with no effect on the 5α-reductive metabolism, and conversely, the group D steroids, COR and 11β-OH-P, showed stimulatory effects on the 5α-reductive metabolism with no effect on the oxidative metabolism, despite possessing a 3-keto-4-ene structure that might be catalyzed by the 5α-reductase. Other 3-keto-4-ene steroids (group E), 16α-OH-P and 6β-OH-P, inhibited only the 5α-reductive metabolism without the product inhibition effects on the oxidative metabolism producing themselves. It is noteworthy that 16α-OH-P, as well as 20α-OH-P and 4-AN-CA already reported by other investigators (19Kinoshita Y. Endocr. J. 1981; 28: 499-513Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Monsalve A. Blaquier J.A. Steroids. 1977; 30: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), were of the 3-keto-4-ene steroids showing the strongest inhibitory effect on the 5α-reductase activity. Finally, the group F steroids, 11α-OH-P and cholesterol, showed a slight effect or no effect on both of the metabolisms. For additional interesting information, 3α,11β-(OH)2-5α-P, a group A steroid, containing both a 3α-OH-5α-reduced structure and a C-11β-OH structure, showed an additively stimulatory effect on the 5α-reductive metabolism, as compared with its parental steroids, 3α-OH-5α-P and 11β-OH-P, and thus this steroid, although not actually produced in the liver, was the highest stimulator of the 5α-reductase activity. By the way, one may envisage a possibility that such a stimulatory effect of group A steroids on the 5α-reductive metabolism may result from the increasing utilizations of free [3H]PROG and NADPH, left over by their inhibitory effects on the oxidative [3H]PROG metabolism and vice versa. However, this possibility may be largely refuted by the results of the following two experiments using the anti-rat NADPH P450 reductase antiserum and rat CYP3A2 supersomes. We examined the direct effects of representative steroids on the 5α-reductive [3H]PROG metabolism, using the rat liver microsomes pretreated with goat anti-rat NADPH P450 reductase antiserum (Fig.3). By this means, more than 85% of the P450-dependent, oxidative [3H]PROG metabolism was inhibited, irrespective of the absence or presence of an unlabeled steroid. Under such an experimental condition, PROG and 16α-OH-P inhibited the 5α-reductive metabolism, while 11β-OH-P, 3α-OH-5α-P, and 3α,11β-(OH)2-5α-P stimulated it, as the intact microsomes did (see Fig. 2). This result clearly shows that the effects of these steroids on the 5α-reductive metabolism could be brought about by their intrinsic properties, not affected by the co-existence of P450-dependent metabolism in intact rat liver microsomes. For additional information, an addition of normal goat serum, as compared with the 130 mm KCl-based buffer (12Yamada M. Indo K. Nishigami T. Nakasho K. Miyaji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induced a tendency to decrease the oxidative metabolism and increase the 5α-reductive metabolism. Although the mechanism inducing such a tendency is wholly unclear at present, this may have been associated with lower stimulatory effects of 11β-OH-P, 3α-OH-5α-P, and 3α,11β-(OH)2-5α-P on the 5α-reductive metabolism by the antiserum-treated microsomes, compared with the intact microsomes. In order to examine also the direct effects of representative steroids on the male-specific P450-dependent [3H]PROG metabolism, we used rat CYP3A2, but not CYP2C11, supersomes, which were composed of the microsomes of insect cells containing the cDNA-expressed rat CYP3A2, rat NADPH P450 reductase, and human cytochrome b 5, since a recombinant CYP2C11 expression system has not come into the market, and we found that various unlabeled steroids showed a similar inhibitory pattern on rat liver microsomal [3H]PROG 6β-oxidation and 16α-oxidation, mainly catalyzed by CYP3A2 and CYP2C11, respectively (Fig. 4).2 When the CYP3A2 supersomes were incubated with [3H]PROG, an exclusively formed product was [3H]6β-OH-P (data not shown), and the inhibitory pattern of unlabeled steroids on the [3H]6β-OH-P formation resembled that obtained from the intact rat liver microsomes (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effects of representative unlabeled steroids on the [3H]progesterone 6β-oxidizing activity by rat CYP3A2 supersomes. Rat CYP3A2 supersomes (82.5 μg of protein/1.1 ml, total volume of the reaction mixture) were used instead of rat liver microsomes, and the concentration of an unlabeled steroid was fixed to be 1.0 μm in this experiment. Other experimental conditions were the same as shown in Fig. 1. The data are means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. The percentage of formation of exclusively formed [3H]6β-OH-P was estimated to be 13.98 ± 1.80% (37.28 pmol/mg of protein/5 min) in the control experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we examined the types of inhibition and the inhibitor constant (K i) values of unlabeled PROG and 3α-OH-5α-P against [3H]6β-OH-P formation by rat CYP3A2 supersomes, according to a simple graphic method using two [3H]PROG concentrations (21Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). From this graphic presentation (so-called Dixon's plot) shown in Fig.6, it turned out that both of the unlabeled steroids behaved like a competitive inhibitor, theK i value of 3α-OH-5α-P was about 10-fold lower than that of PROG, and this K i value ratio agreed well with the IC27.5 (against [3H]6β-OH-P formation) and IC40 (against 16α-OH-P formation) value ratios obtained using rat liver microsomes (TableII). Since not only unlabeled PROG but also 3α-OH-5α-P (22Heinrichs W.L. Feder H.H. Colás A. Steroids. 1966; 7: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) must be metabolized into 6β-OH- and/or 16α-OH-products, it is most likely that these unlabeled steroids compete with [3H]PROG as alternative substrates, but not as true competitive inhibitors, for rat CYP3A2 and/or CYP2C11 with 3α-OH-5α-P possessing about 10-fold higher affinity for the substrate-binding pockets of these enzymes and that the effects of these unlabeled steroids on the CYP3A2 (and probably CYP2C11) activity also can be brought about by their intrinsic properties, independent of a difference of the microsomal structures between the rat liver and insect cells.Table IIThe quantitative parameters of inhibitory effects of unlabeled progesterone and 3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one against oxidative [3H]progesterone metabolismUnlabeled steroidRat liver microsomesRat CYP3A2 supersomes, [3H]6β-OH (K i)2-bThe K i values are estimated from three experiments.[3H]6β-OH (IC27.5)2-aThe IC27.5 and IC40 values, estimated from at least four experiments for separate rats, were defined as the molar concentrations (×10−6m) of unlabeled PROG or 3α-OH-5α-P causing a 27.5 and a 40% inhibition against the respective [3H]PROG 6β-oxidizing ([3H]6β-OH) and 16α-oxidizing ([3H]16α-OH) activities, and these inhibitory percentages were conveniently created as showing half-maximal inhibitions by the concentrations up to 1.0 μm, a maximally solubilizable concentration, of unlabeled 3α-OH-5α-P.[3H]16α-OH (IC40)2-aThe IC27.5 and IC40 values, estimated from at least four experiments for separate rats, were defined as the molar concentrations (×10−6m) of unlabeled PROG or 3α-OH-5α-P causing a 27.5 and a 40% inhibition against the respective [3H]PROG 6β-oxidizing ([3H]6β-OH) and 16α-oxidizing ([3H]16α-OH) activities, and these inhibitory percentages were conveniently created as showing half-maximal inhibitions by the concentrations up to 1.0 μm, a maximally solubilizable concentration, of unlabeled 3α-OH-5α-P.×10−6mPROG0.710.760.983α-OH-5α-P0.080.060.12The experimental conditions were the same as shown in Fig. 1 for rat liver microsomes and Fig. 6 for rat CYP3A2 supersomes.2-a The IC27.5 and IC40 values, estimated from at least four experiments for separate rats, were defined as the molar concentrations (×10−6m) of unlabeled PROG or 3α-OH-5α-P causing a 27.5 and a 40% inhibition against the respective [3H]PROG 6β-oxidizing ([3H]6β-OH) and 16α-oxidizing ([3H]16α-OH) activities, and these inhibitory percentages were conveniently created as showing half-maximal inhibitions by the concentrations up to 1.0 μm, a maximally solubilizable concentration, of unlabeled 3α-OH-5α-P.2-b The K i values are estimated from three experiments.

In conclusion, the present study clearly shows that the male-specific products, 16α-OH-P and 6β-OH-P, inhibited the female-predominant 5α-reductase activity without significantly inhibiting the male-specific CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 activities producing themselves. On the other hand, the female-predominant products, 5α-P and 3α-OH-5α-P, not only inhibited the male-specific P450 activities but also stimulated the 5α-reductase activity producing themselves, and such effects can be brought about by the intrinsic properties of these steroids. Thus, we can propose a novel hypothesis, as described under “Discussion,” on the regulation system of sexually differentiated steroid metabolisms in adult male rat liver. It is well known that various 3-keto-4-ene steroids such as PROG, TEST, and 4-AN are primarily metabolized into 16α- (in some cases, 2α- also) and 6β-oxidized products mainly by the respective, male-specific P450 subforms, CYP2C11 and CYP3A2, in male rat liver microsomes, whereas they are primarily metabolized into the 5α-reduced products by female-predominant 5α-reductase in the female (1Dannan G.A.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is known that expressions of these sexually differentiated enzyme activities are largely regulated in transcription level under endocrine control of which GH plays a major role (6Legraverend C. Mode A. Wells T. Robinson I. Gustafsson J-Å. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,8Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. Mol.

In the present in vitro study using adult male rat liver microsomes (Tables I and II; Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and rat CYP3A2 supersomes (Figs. 5 and 6; Table II), we showed for the first time that two major male-specific oxidized PROG metabolites, 6β-OH-P and especially 16α-OH-P, strongly inhibited the female-predominant 5α-reductase activity without significantly showing the inhibitory effects on the CYP3A2 and CYP2C11 activities producing themselves, and these events may be further enhanced by high levels of CYP2C11 andCYP3A2 gene expressions in the male (6Legraverend C.

Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 5α-P and especially 3α-OH-5α-P not only inhibited both the CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 activities but also stimulated the 5α-reductase activity producing themselves. However, such adverse effects of the 5α-reduced products on the male pattern metabolism may be attenuated by a scanty expression of the 5α-reductase gene in the male (8Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1148-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our results compel us to propose a very interesting hypothesis, summarized in Fig. 7, that adult male rat liver microsomes may possess a self-augmentation system by the male-specific products on sexually differentiated steroid-metabolizing activities, coupled with the regulation system by gene expressions of the related enzymes under endocrine control. In other words, the results may also explain the reason why adult male rat liver should preserve not only much higher levels of CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 gene expressions but also lower 5α-reductase gene expression, as compared with the female. Furthermore, it is of great interest and importance to investigate whether the female rat liver also possesses such a self-augmentation system, although the present results strongly suggest that at least female-predominant 5α-reductase activity (1Dannan G.A. Guengerich F.P. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10728-10735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Waxman D.J. Morrissey J.J. LeBlanc G.A.

As regards these, an important question for future study is to elucidate the reason why adult male rat liver microsomes must metabolize PROG first into more hydrophilic products, 16α-OH-P and 6β-OH-P, while the female must metabolize it into more hydrophobic products, 5α-P, under the strictly regulated systems described above. By the way, a similar scenario may occur on the androgen metabolism, since 3-keto-4-ene androgens such as TEST and 4-AN are also known to be catalyzed sex-dependently by the same enzyme systems (1Dannan G.A. Guengerich F.P. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10728-10735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blanck A. Åström A. Hansson T.

Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 2103-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the effects of various 3-keto-4-ene and 5α-reduced androgens, especially TEST and 5α-A-3α,17β, on the [3H]PROG metabolism showed a similar pattern to those of various 4-pregnene and 5α-pregnane steroids described here (Fig. 2).2 As regards another interesting finding obtained from the present study, it has been reported that endogenous COR production in rat adrenal cortex is suppressed by exogenously administrated COR or cortisol inin vivo and in cell culture systems and that this inhibition probably results from the various effects of these steroids, namely inhibiting ACTH secretion from the pituitary, decreasing ACTH sensitivity of adrenal cortex (23Birmingham M.K. Kurlents E. Endocrinology. 1958; 62: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and stimulating the adrenal 5α-reductase activity metabolizing COR into its 5α-reduced products (24Carsia R.V. Scanes C.G. Malamed S. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 2464-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have clearly shown that the two 11β-OH corticosteroids, COR and cortisol, are of the poorest substrate group for 5α-reductases of various organs probably including the adrenal cortex itself (19Kinoshita Y. Endocr. J. 1981; 28: 499-513Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Monsalve A. Blaquier J.A. Steroids. 1977; 30: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Normington K. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19548-19554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we showed in the present study that COR and 11β-OH-P, but not 11α-OH-P, rather stimulated [3H]PROG 5α-reductase activity of rat liver microsomes (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the C-11β-OH group of a steroid molecule may strongly disturb access of the steroid to the active site of the 5α-reductase, and we can propose another possibility that adrenal cortex may possess a short negative feedback system of which the excessively produced COR (and probably cortisol) inhibits its own production by stimulating the 5α-reduction of PROG (but not COR itself), the major precursor of COR. In conclusion, we can propose two novel hypotheses on 1) the self-augmentation system on sexually differentiated steroid metabolism in adult male rat liver and 2) a short negative feedback system of COR production in adrenal glands. Although the action mechanisms operating these regulatory systems are largely unclear at present, an attempt to clarify them is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

To investigate the role of this autolysis loop in fX function, a recombinant variant with a new site for asparagine-linked glycosylation has been produced by changing glutamine 333 to asparagine. Q333N fX is activated normally by factor VIIa and tissue factor, factors IXa and VIIIa, and Russell's viper venom. Proteolysis of the loop is prevented by the mutation. Reactivity of the free enzyme toward substrates and inhibitors is attenuated 4–20-fold; relative to wild type fXa, Spectrozyme XaTMhydrolysis is 25%, inhibition by antithrombin III and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor is ∼20%, and prothrombin activation in the absence of the cofactor Va is only 5%. Surprisingly, activities of the variant and wild type enzymes are equivalent when part of the prothrombinase complex. N-Glycanase cleaves the new oligosaccharide from Q333N fXa leaving aspartic acid. Q333D fXa is ∼1.6-fold more reactive with Spectrozyme XaTM, antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and prothrombin than its glycosylated counterpart, Q333N fXa, but still quite abnormal relative to wild type fXa. Like Q333N fXa, Q333D fXa is fully functional as part of the prothrombinase complex. We conclude that Gln-333 is geographically close to a site of proteolytic degradation but not to activator, cofactor, or membrane binding sites. Mutation of Gln-333 impairs catalytic function, but given normal prothrombin activation by the complexed enzyme, the importance of Gln-333 for catalysis is not manifest in the prothrombinase assembly, suggesting a conformational change in complexed fXa.

Reactivity of the free enzyme toward substrates and inhibitors is attenuated 4–20-fold; relative to wild type fXa, Spectrozyme XaTMhydrolysis is 25%, inhibition by antithrombin III and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor is ∼20%, and prothrombin activation in the absence of the cofactor Va is only 5%. Surprisingly, activities of the variant and wild type enzymes are equivalent when part of the prothrombinase complex. N-Glycanase cleaves the new oligosaccharide from Q333N fXa leaving aspartic acid. Q333D fXa is ∼1.6-fold more reactive with Spectrozyme XaTM, antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and prothrombin than its glycosylated counterpart, Q333N fXa, but still quite abnormal relative to wild type fXa. Like Q333N fXa, Q333D fXa is fully functional as part of the prothrombinase complex. We conclude that Gln-333 is geographically close to a site of proteolytic degradation but not to activator, cofactor, or membrane binding sites. Mutation of Gln-333 impairs catalytic function, but given normal prothrombin activation by the complexed enzyme, the importance of Gln-333 for catalysis is not manifest in the prothrombinase assembly, suggesting a conformational change in complexed fXa. factor X antithrombin III tissue factor pathway inhibitor X-coagulant protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine Human coagulation factor X (fX),1 a glycoprotein zymogen of Mr ∼58,000, has a pivotal role in blood coagulation. The enzyme (fXa) is a trypsin-like serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The protein can be activated by factor VIIa/tissue factor (fVIIa/TF), factor IXa/factor VIIIa (fIXa/fVIIIa), or the snake venom-derived X-coagulant protein (XCP). Its subsequent catalytic activity has been well characterized using highly purified components. Similarly, inhibition of fXa (by antithrombin III (ATIII) and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) among others) is well documented. Prothrombin activation by fXa is accelerated up to 300,000-fold by its cofactor, factor Va, on a suitable lipid surface (1Miletich J. Jackson C. Majerus P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets constitute this assembling surface in vivo, whereas synthetic liposomes can provide a convenient model in experimental systems. To identify the regions of the fX(a) molecule that mediate biologic interactions of the protein, we have optimized an expression system to produce recombinant fX and systematically probe specific functional consequences of natural and directed mutations. Herein, we report the properties of a fX protein (RTHEKGRQSTR→ RTHEKGRNSTR) designed to have a newN-linked carbohydrate at residue 333 (151 in chymotrypsin numbering) in the serine protease domain. Targeted glycosylation offers a number of features as a mutational approach: 1) a carbohydrate side chain is a convenient size to mask selected regions of the fX molecule, 2) the success of the intended mutation is easily evaluated by altered migration on SDS/PAGE, and 3) the carbohydrate can be removed with the enzyme N-glycanase, allowing an assessment of the contribution of the new carbohydrate itself to any functional consequences. Human fXa catalyzes the cleavage of at least two peptide bonds in its own heavy chain in reactions that are accelerated by negatively charged phospholipid surfaces. The faster cleavage liberates a 2.3-kDa glycopeptide from the carboxyl terminus creating a smaller enzyme, fXaβ, that is functionally very similar to the intact enzyme, fXaα (2Di Scipio R. Hermodson M. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The slower cleavage is within the 326–336 autolysis loop and produces fXaγ, a species that is an additional 11–12 kDa smaller by SDS/PAGE analysis and that has little or no catalytic activity (3Sabharwal A. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a new carbohydrate side chain at residue 333 might prevent degradation within the autolysis loop. Additionally, we predicted that an added carbohydrate residue in this region might impair catalytic activity based on the proximity of the region to the active site of the enzyme (3Sabharwal A. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Park C. Bode W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29988-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This last prediction proved true for the free enzyme, but we did not anticipate that the enzymatic efficiency of the mutant enzyme toward prothrombin would be normalized when the mutant enzyme is in the prothrombinase complex. Others have shown that mutations designed to induce N-linked glycosylation at selected residues can be a useful means of surveying molecular regions of proteins (6Ueda T. Iwashita H. Hashimoto Y. Imoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Inui Y. Orihashi T. Nakagawa T. Ebihara A. Suzuki F. Nakamura Y. Biosci. Biotechnol.

We herein demonstrate that induced glycosylation is useful in characterizing the contribution to the function of a specific region of fX(a). Spectrozyme THTM(H-d-hexahydrotyrosyl-l-alanyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide diacetate) and Spectrozyme fXaTM(methoxycarbonyl-d-hexahydrotyrosyl-l-alanyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide diacetate) were obtained from American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT. Organic solvents were high pressure liquid chromatography grade. All other reagents and chemicals were of highest quality available commercially. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) and bovine brain phosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Sigma. PC:PS (3:1) vesicles of nominal 100-nm diameter were made by membrane extrusion (9MacDonald R.

Affinity-purified caprine anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Murine monoclonal antibodies specific for human fX have been developed by standard methods and used for identification, quantitation, and purification of fX and are described elsewhere (10Rudolph A.

Prothrombin was purified from human plasma by barium citrate adsorption/elution followed by column chromatography using QAE-SepharoseTM (11Broze Jr., G. Miletich J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), sulfated dextran beads (12Miletich J. Broze Jr., G. Majerus P. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and Mono QTM FPLC. Following purification, prothrombin was concentrated (>1 mm) and immunodepleted of residual fX (<1 nm) by passage through a column of immobilized antibody 3448.1D7.20. ATIII was purchased from Kabi Pharmacia Diagnostics (Piscataway, NJ). Factors V, Va, VIIa, and IXa from human plasma were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Thrombin was prepared by cation exchange chromatography after activation of human prothrombin with Taipan snake (Oxyuranus scutellatus) venom. Porcine fVIII was obtained from Porton Products (Agoura Hill, CA) and was further purified (13Fass D. Knutson G. Katzmann J. Blood. 1982; 59: 594-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an immobilized antibody (W-3, a generous gift from Dr. David Fass). Innovin™, a lipidated, recombinant tissue factor, was obtained from Baxter Diagnostics (Deerfield, IL). XCP was purified from Russell's viper venom (14Kisiel W. Hermodson M. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recombinant TFPI was a gift from The Monsanto/Searle Company (St. Louis, MO). SDS/PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained directly using Coomassie Blue or were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm), probed using antibodies described above, and visualized with an immunochemiluminescent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). fX was purified from either plasma or culture media as described previously (16Rudolph A. Mullane M. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The construction, transfection, and expression of wild type and mutant fX in human kidney cells (293 cells, American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1573) have been described elsewhere (10Rudolph A. Mullane M. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28601-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Graham F. Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). The expression vector (ZMB3) was a gift from Dr. Don Foster. fX was labeled with 125I using prelabeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a modified procedure. After evaporation of the organic solvent, a buffered solution of fX (∼10.0 μm, pH 8.5) was added to the vial and reacted with the Bolton-Hunter reagent for 15 min on ice. The unbound reagent was then reacted with 0.2 m glycine in the same buffer for 5 min on ice. Specific activity was typically ∼5 × 1016 Bq mol−1. As detailed elsewhere (10Rudolph A. Mullane M. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28601-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both wild type and Q333N fX (150 nm in reaction buffer, 100 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5) were tested as substrates for three different activators: 1) 20 pm fVIIa and InnovinTM (500 pm lipidated recombinant tissue factor); 2) 400 pm fIXa, 2 units ml−1 fVIIIa (activated with 1.0 unit ml−1 thrombin exactly 5 min before the start of the assay), and 20 μm PC:PS vesicles; or 3) 50 pm XCP. These conditions represent subsaturating concentrations of activators. Wild type and Q333N fX (150 nm in reaction buffer) were fully activated to the enzyme form with excess XCP (1.0 nm). The enzyme (diluted 300-fold to 0.5 nm) was then co-reacted with Spectrozyme XaTM (100 μm) and either ATIII or TFPI, and appearance of the chromophore, p-nitroanilide acetate, was monitored over time at 405 nm. ATIII concentrations were varied from 0 to 8 μm. Primary data were fitted using the Marquardt-Levy algorithm (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) to an exponential equation of the form, A=Af(1−e−kobst)+A0Equation 1 where A is the absorbance, Af is the amplitude of the curve, kobs is the apparent first order rate constant with units of s−1,t is time in seconds, and A0 is the initial absorbance. Each calculated apparent rate constant (kobs) was then plotted as a linear function of the effective inhibitor concentration, and the resulting slope was calculated as the apparent second order rate constant. Experiments designed to monitor the inhibition of fXa by ATIII (0–10 nm) in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of heparin (2.5 milliunits ml−1) or by TFPI (0–50 nm) were similar except that the primary data were fitted to an equation that accounts for the terminal rate attributed to uninhibited enzyme (18Stone S. Nick H. Hofsteenge J. Monard D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Rovelli G. Stone S. Guidolin A. Sommer J. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar),A=vst+((v0−vs)/kobs)(1−e−kobst)+A0Equation 2 where v0 and vsrepresent the initial and the terminal rates of hydrolysis, respectively. The rates at which wild type and Q333N fXa can activate prothrombin to thrombin in reaction buffer were compared using established methods (10Rudolph A. Mullane M. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28601-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and several different reagent compositions. The general conditions tested included: 1) 10 nm fXa with 0–450 μm prothrombin, 2) 0–1.0 nm fXa with 1.0 μm prothrombin and 108 ml−1 washed platelets (preactivated with 0.5 unit ml−1 thrombin), and 3) 0–200 pm fXa with 1.0 μm prothrombin, 500 pm fVa, and 20 mm PC:PS vesicles. For each series of reactions, initial rates of thrombin generation were plotted as a function of the component being varied. These data were fitted (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) to the hyperbolic equation, v=Vmax[S]/(K+[S])Equation 3 where v is the observed initial rates of thrombin formation, Vmax is the maximal initial rate of thrombin formation, [S] is the concentration of the component being varied in the experiment, and K is the apparent concentration of the variable component required to reach half-maximal thrombin formation under the conditions specified. To test activity against the synthetic substrate, 1.0 nm wild type or Q333N fXa was reacted with Spectrozyme XaTM at concentrations from 0 to 500 μm. The initial rate of hydrolysis of Spectrozyme XaTM was related to the substrate concentration using the hyperbolic function described above to estimate Kmand Vmax and to calculatekcat (Vmax/[fXa]). One-quarter unit of recombinantN-glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) was incubated with wild type or Q333N fXa (0.7 μm) at 27 °C for 18 h, after which the proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for immunodetection. The N-glycanase-treated enzymes were also tested for activity against Spectrozyme XaTM and prothrombin and for inhibition by ATIII and TFPI as described above. Q333N fX has decreased electrophoretic mobility on SDS/PAGE compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 1 A), consistent with the additional mass of a new oligosaccharide side chain. Under reducing conditions the difference between wild type and mutant proteins is more evident, as is the increased microheterogeneity of its heavy chain. A small fraction of the mutant protein co-migrates with wild type fX and may not be glycosylated at position 333.N-Glycanase (peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, EC 3.5.1.52) hydrolyzes the β-aspartyl-glycosamine bond ofN-linked oligosaccharides, which results in deamination of the asparagine residue to aspartic acid (20Tarentino A. Gomez C. Plummer Jr., T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 21Elder J. Alexander S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Following treatment with N-glycanase, wild type and Q333N fXa co-migrate (Fig. 1 B). There is no change in wild type fXa withN-glycanase treatment because all of its N-linked carbohydrate is on the 52-amino acid peptide released by activation. The activation peptide itself is >50% carbohydrate and migrates anomalously slow on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a diffuse band that does not stain with Coomassie Blue. Both wild type and Q333N fX (150 nm) quantitatively release their activation peptides when incubated with XCP (2.0 nm) as assessed by a two-site (light chain/activation peptide) immunoassay (data not shown). Further, no residual wild type or mutant fX zymogen is detectable by immunoblot after 60 min (sensitivity <0.5%, data not shown). Both enzymes hydrolyze Spectrozyme XaTM (Fig. 2), but the overall catalytic efficiency of Q333N fXa is only 25% of the wild type enzyme with equal impact onKm and kcat (131 μm and 3.1 min−1 for Q333N fXa compared with 65 μm and 6.2 min−1 for the wild type enzyme). Initial rates of hydrolysis of Spectrozyme XaTM, corrected for the catalytic efficiency, were used to calculate initial rates of activation of fX by submaximal concentrations of three different activators, fVIIa/TF, fIXa/fVIIIa, and XCP. In each case there was no significant difference between wild type and Q333N fX with regard to either the rate or the extent of activation (data not shown). We conclude that activation of the mutated protein is normal. When 150 nm125I-labeled wild type fX is activated by 2 nm XCP in the presence of 20 μm PC:PS vesicles for 45 min, autolysis at the β and γ cleavage sites (>90% and 30–40%, respectively) is readily apparent (Fig. 3, lane d). When 125I-labeled Q333N fX is treated in the same manner, no autolysis is seen. To distinguish whether Q333N fXa is a less efficient autolytic enzyme, a poorer substrate for autolysis, or both, 150 nm125I-labeled Q333N fXa was first activated by XCP for 15 min in the presence of 40 μmPC:PS vesicles. It was then mixed with an equal volume of 150 nm unlabeled wild type or Q333N fXa, each having been fully activated just before use with XCP in the absence of phospholipid to minimize autolysis of wild type fXa. After an additional 45-min incubation, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample treatment buffer, and the effects on the 125I-labeled Q333N fXa were analyzed by autoradiography following SDS/PAGE. The increase in migration that results from cleavage at the β site is very similar in magnitude to the decrease in migration caused by addition of a carbohydrate side chain at residue 333; i.e. fXa glycosylated at position 333 and cleaved at the β site (Xaβ*) migrates the same as fXa not glycosylated at position 333 and not degraded (Xaα). The 125I-labeled Q333N fXa was not appreciably affected by the additional 45-min incubation with unlabeled Q333N fXa and PC:PS vesicles (Fig. 3, lanes a andc). In contrast, the added wild type fXa readily cleaved the125I-labeled Q333N fXa at the β site but was not able to cleave at the γ site (Fig. 3, lane b). Mutation to Q333N results in 1) reduced activity of the mutant toward itself as a substrate at the β-cleavage site and 2) protection of the γ-cleavage site in the autolysis loop from proteolytic attack by either wild type or mutant enzyme. ATIII reacts much faster with wild type fXa than with Q333N fXa (Fig. 4). The second order rate constants, calculated as described under “Materials and Methods” for inhibition by ATIII in the absence of heparin, are 1.3 × 103m−1s−1 for wild type and 0.17 × 103m−1s−1 for Q333N fXa (13%). This reduced interaction of ATIII with the mutant enzyme is independent of heparin, and heparin accelerates the inhibition of both to roughly the same extent. In the presence of 2.5 milliunits ml−1heparin (less than half-saturating) the rate constants are 6.5 × 105m−1s−1 for wild type versus 1.6 × 105m−1s−1 for Q333N fXa (25%). In reactions with TFPI, the mutated enzyme is also inhibited more poorly than wild type; 1.1 × 105m−1s−1 for wild type versus 0.22 × 105m−1s−1 for Q333N fXa (20%). The ability of fXa to biologically process a native substrate, prothrombin, is also affected by the Q333N mutation. Prothrombin activation by wild type fXa is very slow in the absence of accessory factors (the protein cofactor, fVa, and a negatively charged phospholipid surface), but Q333N fXa is 20 times slower still (Fig. 5), a substantial disruption in catalytic capacity. Platelets provide both a focusing surface and the cofactor (fVa) to accomplish a 300,000-fold increase in thrombin formation by fXa (1Miletich J. Jackson C. Majerus P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expected the added oligosaccharide to similarly impair the enzyme's ability to activate prothrombin in this system. However, in the presence of activated platelets, Q333N fXa activates prothrombin as well as the wild type enzyme with overall kinetics that are very similar (Fig. 6). Using 1.0 μm prothrombin and 108 platelets per ml, both the maximal rate of activation at saturating fXa (1.86 nms−1 for wild type versus 2.01 nm s−1 for Q333N fXa in the experiment shown) and the concentration of enzyme required for half-maximal velocity (115 pm for wild typeversus 91 pm for Q333N fXa in the experiment shown) are essentially the same and indistinguishable from plasma fXa tested under the same conditions (data not shown). The activities of both enzymes toward prothrombin are dramatically increased by the activated platelets, but the mutant is actually accelerated about 20 times more to reach that same level. Exhaustive immunodepletion of the prothrombin reagent as described was necessary to prevent thrombin formation from traces of plasma fX. A control, containing no added fXa but with the same amount of XCP used as the fX activator, was carried through the experiment in parallel and demonstrated no detectable thrombin activity.Figure 6Thrombin generation by wild type and Q333N fXa in the presence of activated platelets. Initial rates of activation of 1.0 μm prothrombin by 0–1.0 nmwild type (closed circles and solid line) or Q333N (open circles and broken line) fXa in the presence of 108 ml−1thrombin-activated platelets are shown. Data points are duplicate measurements. Lines represent the best fit to the hyperbolic equation described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To eliminate the possibility that some unidentified species derived from, or co-purified with, the platelets was responsible for nullifying the effect of the mutation on enzymatic activity, thrombin formation was measured using defined phospholipid vesicles and purified fVa (1.0 μm prothrombin, 20 μm PC:PS vesicles, 500 pm fVa). Again, the two enzymes have equivalent activities (Fig. 7). Neither the maximal rate of activation at saturating fXa (1.30 nms−1 for wild type versus 1.27 nm s−1 for Q333N fXa) nor the concentration of enzyme required for half-maximal velocity (128 pm for wild type versus 113 pm for Q333N fXa) are detectably different. After activation, wild type fXa, in contrast to Q333N fXa, has no N-linked sugars. Treatment withN-glycanase should affect only the mutant enzyme and might restore function. The rates of hydrolysis of Spectrozyme-XaTM, inhibition by TFPI, and activation of prothrombin (without phospholipid or cofactor) are not changed by treatment of wild type fXa with N-glycanase. In contrast,N-glycanase treatment of Q333N fXa increases the same rates 1.6-, 1.4-, and 1.6-fold, respectively. Still, the catalytic efficiency of deglycosylated Q333N fXa is only 40%, 30%, and 8% for Spectrozyme-XaTM hydrolysis, inhibition by TFPI, and prothrombin activation, respectively. Because theN-glycanase-catalyzed deglycosylation of asparagine leaves aspartic acid (Q333D fXa), this partial recovery suggests that there is specificity involved in modulation of the active site cleft by the autolysis loop in general and by residue Gln-333 in particular. Replacement of Gln-333 by Asp is, quantitatively, almost as detrimental as the addition of an entire N-linked carbohydrate side chain. Q333D fXa, like its glycosylated precursor, activates prothrombin completely normally in the presence of activated platelets or fVa and phospholipid. The side chain of this residue appears to have no specific role in regulating the activity of the prothrombinase complex despite its importance to the activity of the enzyme outside that context. Insight into the disrupted function that results from mutation of residue 333 can be gained from structural changes that occur when the enzyme is reacted with the fXa-specific inhibitor, DX-9065a. Because this synthetic amidino acid abates the activity of fXa but not thrombin (22Katakura S. Takayasu N. Tsuyoshi H. Masahiro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we speculated that the autolysis loop might be implicated, both in functional differences between fXa and thrombin and in structural differences between native and inhibitor-bound fXa. Indeed, the autolysis loop in the DX-9065a-bound fXa structure reported by Brandstetter et al. (5Brandstetter H. Kuhne A. Bode W. Huber R. vonderSaal W. Engh K.W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29988-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) adopts a conformation distinct from the partially ordered autolysis loop of the native enzyme (4Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Park C. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D. Cardin A. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 depicts interactions of the autolysis loop with the serine protease domain of the enzyme. Similar to the interactions present in thrombin and factor VIIa, the N terminus of Ile-16 in the uninhibited fXa structure (4Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Park C. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D. Cardin A. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) forms an ion pair with the carboxylate of Asp-194. The autolysis loop of inhibitor-bound fXa is well ordered because of stabilizing interactions within the loop as well as those within the main body of the enzyme (TableI). A significant number of these associations involve the participation of the main chain nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms of the autolysis loop residues. As a result of these interactions, the immediate environment of the N terminus (Ile-16) is altered somewhat. The ion pair that is observed between the positive charge on the N terminus and the carboxylate of Asp-194 in most of the other known serine proteases is slightly weakened, and new interactions with residues of the autolysis loop are present. In the presence of the inhibitor and likely in the mutated enzyme as well, critical associations between the N terminus of Ile-16 and the side chain of Asp-194 are absent, preventing proper orientation of the catalytic Ser-195 residue and the oxyanion hole. Taken together, all evidence suggests that the conformational changes induced by the DX-9065a inhibitor might be replicated in the Q333N mutant and the Q333D deglycosylation product. Further, it appears that certain interactions between Gln-333 and regions of the heavy chain are essential for normal catalysis and that these interactions are altered, both in the inhibitor-bound enzyme and in Q333N. If true, this could explain the dramatically reduced catalytic efficiency of both 333 variants.Table IInternal hydrogen bonds in the autolysis loop unique to active site-inhibited factor Xa and interaction of the autolysis loop with the main body of the enzymeDonorAcceptorDistanceÅNη1-Arg-143O-Gly-1492.85N-Thr-144O-Gln-1513.10N-Arg-154O-Ser-1522.83N-Ile-16Oγ1-Thr-1443.70Oγ1-Thr-144O-Ile-163.21N-Cys-220Oɛ1-Glu-1473.05Nɛ2-Gln-151O-Gly-402.80Nη2-Arg-222Oɛ2-Glu-1473.15Data are from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (1HCG) and References 4 and 5.

We targeted the autolysis loop of fX for glycosylation because it 1) has high surface accessibility, 2) is composed of unique amino acids compared with otherwise highly homologous serine proteases, 3) is susceptible to degradation, and 4) is spatially near and influences the activity of the catalytic cleft (3Sabharwal A.

The expectations that addition of a carbohydrate side chain to residue 333 would both impair the activity of the enzyme and prevent degradation at the autolysis loop were borne out. Because Q333D fXa is functionally quite similar to the glycosylated Q333N fXa, most of the change in specificity seems to be due to the loss of the glutamine side chain at residue 333 rather than to constraints imposed by the new carbohydrate side chain. Thus, the conformation of the autolysis loop that was observed by Brandstetter et al. (5Brandstetter H. Kuhne A. Bode W. Huber R. vonderSaal W. Engh K.W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29988-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) might represent a physiologically suboptimal conformation of fXa. It is also plausible that binding of the appropriate cofactors (e.g. fVa) in the region of the autolysis loop could induce a more favorable geometry to the catalytic site. fXa-catalyzed activation of prothrombin is completely normalized in the presence of platelets or fVa/lipid. We speculate that thrombin generation can occur by two mechanistically different pathways depending on presence of cofactor/lipid. Further, the availability of fVa/lipid may be the main determinate for which pathway of prothrombin hydrolysis becomes important. We have presented evidence that the rate-limiting step in prothrombin hydrolysis in either of our replica biologic systems is not overall affinity for the substrate; fVa/lipid promotes equal activation of wild type and mutant. Rather, the rate of thrombin generation seems to be governed by the particular “presentation” of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. As part of the prothrombinase complex, the mutant enzyme is no longer limited because the carbohydrate does not interfere with fVa-assisted prothrombin hydrolysis by this pathway. Whatever rate-limiting step now exists is equally restrictive for wild type and mutant enzymes. Why should the presence of fVa/lipid equalize the enzymatic activity of the wild type and mutant enzymes? One possibility is that the conformation of the active site region changes when fXa binds to fVa/lipid in a manner that nullifies the effect of the added carbohydrate. Our data do not support this as the sole mechanism, however, as these studies failed to show enhanced hydrolysis of Spectrozyme XaTM in the presence of fVa/lipid. Because the normalization of activity is restricted to prothrombin as the substrate, it is possible that prothrombin is made a better substrate by association with fVa/lipid such that the negative influence of the added carbohydrate is inconsequential. Consider fVa-bound prothrombin to be in a more restricted orientation with regard to the active site of fXa. In this more optimal orientation, contact of prothrombin with the catalytic site of fXa is a less random event than when fVa is not present, and the hindering effect of the added oligosaccharide is insignificant. Without fVa, however, there exists no “tether” to maximize and exploit fXa-prothrombin interactions. Only when fXa and fVa join as a complex on an immobilizing lipid surface are the synergistic effects of a focusing interface and the conformational induction of fVa-prothrombin realized. The mutant Q333N fX is activated normally. Because the enzyme is resistant to proteolytic degradation and is inhibited about 5 times more slowly by ATIII and TFPI but still generates thrombin normally as part of the prothrombinase complex, it might have potential as a hemostatic agent based on an anticipated longer in vivosurvival. Mutations in homologous regions of other serine proteinases, particularly coagulation and complement factors that interact with cofactors that change their catalytic efficiency toward protein substrates, might well have similar consequences making it possible to further narrow their specificity and to extend their durability."

One important property of these complexes is their often remarkable stability, as demonstrated in solution and in cells following transfection. Although encouraging, these measurements do not necessarily report triplex stability in cellular compartments that support DNA functions such as replication and mutagenesis. We have devised a shuttle vector plasmid assay that reports the stability of triplexes on DNA that undergoes replication and mutagenesis. The assay is based on plasmids with novel variant supF tRNA genes containing embedded sequences for triplex formation and psoralen cross-linking. Triple helix-forming oligonucleotides were linked to psoralen and used to form triplexes on the plasmids. At various times after introduction into cells, the psoralen was activated by exposure to long wave ultraviolet light (UVA). After time for replication and mutagenesis, progeny plasmids were recovered and the frequency of plasmids with mutations in the supF gene determined. Site-specific mutagenesis by psoralen cross-links was dependent on precise placement of the psoralen by the triple helix-forming oligonucleotide at the time of UVA treatment. The results indicated that both pyrimidine and purine motif triplexes were much less stable on replicated DNA than on DNA in vitro or in total transfected DNA.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Many of the biochemical and biophysical properties of triplexes appear to support this application. Triplex formation following the encounter between an appropriate third strand and duplex target has long been recognized as a fundamental structural option of nucleic acids and is not dependent on enzymes or proteins (12Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The most stable triplexes are formed on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences. However, there is considerable stringency with respect to the specific sequence such that single interruptions in a polypurine run can be destabilizing (13Mergny J.L. Sun J.S. Rougee M. Montenay-Garestier T. Barcelo F. Chomilier J. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9791-9798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Struct. 1995; 24: 319-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Depending on the actual sequence of the purine:pyrimidine run, triplexes can be formed by third strands composed of either purines or pyrimidines (16Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which offers some flexibility in TFO design. Once formed, triplexes can be quite stable under appropriate conditions. This was demonstrated some time ago with a pyrimidine triplex with a dissociation half-life of many hours (17Maher III, L.J. Dervan P.B. Wold B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8820-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Some purine TFOs form even more stable complexes, with melting temperatures equivalent to or greater than the target duplex (18Alunni-Fabbroni M. Pirulli D. Manzini G. Xodo L.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16361-16369Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and with half-lives of days under optimal conditions (19Svinarchuk F. Bertrand J.R. Malvy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Svinarchuk F. Paoletti J. Malvy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14068-14071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The persistence of purine motif triplexes formed on DNA fragments and then introduced into mammalian cells has also been measured. A footprinting assay to measure triplexes on transfected fragments as a function of time after transfection reported that the triplexes were stable over a 24-h period (21Svinarchuk F. Debin A. Bertrand J.R. Malvy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Debin A. Malvy C. Svinarchuk F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Another assay, based on radiofootprinting, came to a similar conclusion (23Sedelnikova O.A. Panyutin I.G. Luu A.N. Neumann R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3844-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data implied that triplexes were quite stable in cells, similar to the situation under optimal laboratory conditions. On the other hand, there are limitations to the activity of TFOs and triplex stability. Triplexes formed by pyrimidine third strands containing cytosines are typically unstable under physiological conditions. This is because of the requirement for N3 protonation of cytosines which does not occur at physiological pH. However, the incorporation of 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) (24Lee J.S. Woodsworth M.L. Latimer L.J. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Povsic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3059-3061Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and the 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) substitution of the sugar (26Shimizu M. Konishi A. Shimada Y. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) into TFOs enhance the stability of pyrimidine triplexes in “physiological” buffers. The activity of purine TFOs is compromised by the tendency of guanine-rich oligonucleotides to aggregate or form tetraplex structures in physiological levels of K+, which inhibits triplex formation (27Noonberg S.B. Francois J.C. Garestier T. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Olivas W.M. Maher III, L.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Cheng A.J. Wang J.C. Van Dyke M.W. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Triplex formation in both motifs is dependent on Mg2+, with dramatic differences in affinity apparent over a relatively narrow concentration range (30Rougee M. Faucon B. Mergny J.L. Barcelo F. Giovannangeli C. Garestier T. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Blume S.W. Lebowitz J. Zacharias W. Guarcello V. Mayfield C.A. Ebbinghaus S.W. Bates P. Jones Jr., D.E. Trent J. Vigneswaran N. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The requirement for divalent cation is of concern as triplexes are typically formed in vitro in 5–10 mmMg2+, while the concentration of Mg2+ inside cells is probably less than 1 mm. We are interested in TFOs as reagents for targeting genes in vivo in gene knockout applications (9Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consequently, we are concerned with the stability of triplexes in nuclear compartments, in living cells, in which replication and mutagenesis occur. Given the sensitivity of triplexes to ionic conditions and pH, it is important to note that the measurements of long triplex half-lives in vitro, cited above, were conducted under conditions that were optimal for complex formation and maintenance. These conditions may not accurately reflect those in vivo. Furthermore, although the analysis of triplex stability on the transfected DNA population is informative, it does not necessarily describe the stability of the complexes on biologically active DNA. In the experiments described here, we have used a plasmid-based mutation assay to report the persistence, in vivo, of triplexes formed prior to transfection. We find that preformed triplexes on DNA that replicated following transfection are less stable than would be predicted by analyses of triplexes in vitro, or on total transfected DNA. However, the stability of triplexes can be extended by treatment of cells with certain compounds that stabilize triplexes in vitro. These compounds may have potential for enhancing the activity of TFOs in vivo, particularly if issues of long-term toxicity can be resolved. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Shuttle vector plasmids were constructed as described previously (32Levy D.D. Magee A.D. Namiki C. Seidman M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the early region and origin of replication from SV40 virus, and the β-lactamase gene and replication origin from pBR322. The plasmids also contained variant supFgenes with triplex target and psoralen cross-link sites as described under “Results.” Restriction enzyme sites at the position of the psoralen cross-link in the plasmids (XbaI for thesupF5·TC30; BstBI for thesupFG1·AG30) were used in restriction protection assays. We prepared a 5′-psoralen (C6) linked-TC30 TFO (5′-Pso-TCTTTTTCTTTCTTTTCTTCTTTTTTCTTT) with 5-MeC and 2′-OMe modifications on all bases. The AG30 TFO (5′-Pso- AGGAAGGGGGGGGTGGTGGGGGAGGGGGAG), described previously (33Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also linked (C6) to psoralen at the 5′ end. The three 3′ terminal residues were added as phosphorothioates to provide nuclease protection (34Agrawal S. Jiang Z. Zhao Q. Shaw D. Cai Q. Roskey A. Channavajjala L. Saxinger C. Zhang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Affinity constants were determined by duplex band shift as described (33Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, the Kd of the TC30 TFO was 29 nm, while the Kd of the AG30 TFO was 3 nm. Triplexes were formed by incubation of 3.5 pmol of the appropriate plasmid with 2 μm TFO in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm spermine for 24 h at 37 °C. Triplexes were separated from free oligonucleotide by adjustment of the mixture to 2.5 mammonium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, and precipitated by the addition of two volumes of alcohol. Control experiments showed that the triplexes were stable during this manipulation, which had the added advantage of sterilizing the samples. In experiments in which the complexed plasmids were introduced into cells, they were resuspended in sterile triplex formation buffer prior to electroporation. Psoralen was photoactivated by exposure of the complexes, or cells following transfection, to UVA for 3 min at a dose of 1.8 J/cm2. Measurements of triplex stability in vitro were performed by resuspension of the plasmid-triplex complexes in physiological buffer (145 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), at 37 °C at a concentration of 0.25 nm. The matching TFO without psoralen was added to 2 μm to block reassociation of the Pso-TFO during the incubation. At various times after resuspension aliquots were removed and irradiated with UVA to activate the psoralen. Non-cross-linked oligonucleotide was then removed by filter dialysis (Millipore, 0.025 μm) against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and the samples digested with XbaI (supF5), or BstBI (supFG1) to determine the extent of protection by psoralen cross-links. The digests were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the relative amount of DNA in the protected and non-protected bands quantitated by fluorescence image analysis. The plasmid-triplex complexes were electroporated (Bio-Rad) into cells that were suspended in complete growth medium supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2. At various times the transfected cells were treated with UVA and plasmid extracted and purified withoutDpnI digestion. During the purification the plasmid DNA was suspended in 1 mm EDTA to elute any bound but non-cross-linked TFO, and precipitated with ethanol from 2.5m ammonium acetate. Unbound TFO was not precipitated. The plasmids were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and the digests resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amount of DNA in protected and digested bands was determined by Southern blotting and image analysis. The plasmid-triplex complexes were electroporated as described above into cells, and at various times afterward the cells were treated with UVA. After another 48 h, the plasmids were harvested and then treated with DpnI to remove non-replicated plasmid (35Peden K.W. Pipas J.M. Pearson-White S. Nathans D. Science. 1980; 209: 1392-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The plasmids were then introduced into the Escherichia coliindicator strain MBM 7070, which carries an amber mutation in the β-galactosidase gene (36Seidman M.M. Dixon K. Razzaque A. Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 38: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The bacteria were plated on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the frequency of white or light blue colonies with mutations in thesupF gene was determined. In order to compare the relative stabilities of the two triplexes, the data were normalized to the mutation frequency of the appropriate plasmids in which the psoralen cross-link was fixed immediately after electroporation (0 time point). This value was the same as that recovered from plasmids that had been cross-linked in vitro. The frequency of mutations in thesupF5 plasmid obtained after replication of the plasmid, cross-linked in vitro, was 11%, while that of thesupFG1 plasmid was 6%. The results from the complete time-course measurements were confirmed in independent experiments at a subset of time points. The assays for TFO binding are based on a shuttle vector plasmid described in previous publications (36Seidman M.M. Dixon K. Razzaque A. Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 38: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 37Parris C.N. Seidman M.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 117: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition to elements that support replication in bacterial and primate cells, the plasmid carries a mutation marker gene, the suppressor tRNA gene, supF. The structure of a transfer RNA is a major determinant of correct processing of the pre tRNA transcript and the activity of the mature tRNA molecule. Consequently, it is possible to make substantial changes in tRNA sequence, while retaining function, as long as the structure of the mature molecule is maintained (32Levy D.D. Magee A.D. Namiki C. Seidman M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Smith J.D. Barnett L. Brenner S. Russell R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 54: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 39Kleina L.G. Masson J.M. Normanly J. Abelson J. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this principle to construct variant, but still functional,supF genes containing sequence elements that served as targets for triplex formation and psoralen cross-linking. These functional variants were used as mutation reporter genes. In the supF5 construction, we placed the TC30 triplex target sequence in the pre-tRNA region of the gene immediately adjacent to the start of the 5′ end of the mature gene (Fig. 1). Just inside the mature gene sequence, at the 5′ start of the acceptor stem, we placed a 5′ TA step, the optimal sequence for cross-linking by psoralen. This was at position 99/100 (the numbering was preserved from the original supFscheme) (41Bredberg A. Kraemer K.H. Seidman M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The sequence of the 3′ acceptor stem sequence was adjusted to provide a complement for the new 5′ end. The psoralen cross-link site was embedded in the recognition sequence for theXbaI restriction enzyme. In the supFG1 plasmid, described previously (33Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the AG30 target site was embedded in the 3′ end of the tRNA gene and the post tRNA sequence. A psoralen cross-link directed by the Pso-AG30 TFO is located at position 166/167 and protects a BstBI site in supFG1. The two plasmids were used to measure the persistence of the TC30 or AG30 triplexes following complex formation. The triplex-plasmid complexes were introduced into buffers or cells as described below, and then at various times the psoralen was activated by exposure to long wave UV light (UVA). The precise placement of the cross-link required the association with the plasmid of the relevant TFO in a triple helix. The frequency of cross-links in the plasmid population was then measured by restriction protection, or by mutagenesis of thesupF gene. Many studies of triplex stability in vitro have been performed under conditions in which the triplexes were formed. These include high levels of Mg2+, and, in the case of pyrimidine TFOs, without the 5-MeC and 2′-OMe modifications employed here, at a pH less than 6.0. With purine TFOs physiological levels of K+ have been avoided. However, we were interested in the stability of triplexes in cellular compartments where these conditions would not apply. Consequently, we asked what effect the introduction of preformed triplexes into physiological buffer would have on triplex stability. Triplexes were formed on the supF5 (TC30) andsupFG1 (AG30) plasmids under optimal conditions, and, after separation from unbound oligonucleotide, the complexes were diluted into buffer containing physiological levels of K+ and Mg2+, at pH 7.2 (see “Materials and Methods”) and incubated at 37 °C. At various times, aliquots were UVA-treated and then analyzed for cross-links by restriction enzyme protection. The results showed that virtually the entire TC30 triplex population survived the 8-h incubation, while about 80% of the AG30 triplexes were still intact after 8 h (Fig. 2). These results were consistent with previous reports of triplex stability in vitro (17Maher III, L.J. Dervan P.B. Wold B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8820-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Alunni-Fabbroni M. Pirulli D. Manzini G. Xodo L.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16361-16369Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Svinarchuk F. Paoletti J. Malvy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14068-14071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, we monitored triplex stability after introduction into cells. The requirement for a timed analysis of triplex stability following plasmid transfection dictated the choice of electroporation as a transfection method because it delivered the complex into the cell at a defined time (43Weaver J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We were initially concerned that the process of electroporation might destabilize the triplexes. We found severalfold losses of both TC30·supF5and Ag30·supFG1 complexes when they were electroporated in the medium used for cell suspension. However, if the Mg2+levels in the medium were adjusted to 10 mm, the triplexes were then stable to electroporation. This condition was well tolerated by the cells and was maintained in all experiments with cells. Several recent publications have measured triplex stability inside cells by following the level of triplexes on transfected DNA as a function of time after transfection (21Svinarchuk F. Debin A.

We performed similar experiments with the TC30 and AG30 triplexes. The complexes were formed in vitro, and the triplex-plasmids were electroporated into cells that were incubated at 37 °C. After 0.5, 4, or 8 h, cells were UVA-treated, then washed extensively, and total plasmid harvested, without the DpnI treatment used in subsequent experiments to eliminate nonreplicated plasmid. The extent of psoralen cross-linking was then determined by the restriction protection assay. The plot of the data from the supFG1(AG30) and supF5 (TC30) plasmids is shown in Fig. 3. The t½ of TC30 triplex was 288 min, while that of AG30 triplex was 150 min. These results indicated that both triplexes on total transfected DNA were less stable in cells than in a physiological buffer, and, as before, the TC30 triplex was the more stable of the two. We then measured the stability of triplexes on plasmids that replicated following transfection. Following triplex formation, free TFO was removed (see “Materials and Methods”) and the complexes suspended in medium prewarmed to 37 °C, mixed with cells, and electroporated in prewarmed cuvettes. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and then exposed to UVA to activate the psoralen. The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. During this time, the plasmids replicated and the psoralen cross-links were removed with or without mutational consequences. Then, the plasmids were harvested and treated with DpnI to remove unreplicated plasmid. The plasmids were introduced into MBM7070 and the frequency of colonies with mutations in the supF gene determined. The results showed that, relative to the 0 time point, the TC30 triplex had a t½ of 59 min, while thet½ of the AG30 triplex was 10 min (Fig. 4 A). The results of this experiment were in sharp contrast to the data in the preceding figures. However we repeated complete, and abbreviated (1-, 2-, and 4-h time points), versions of the experiment with both triplexes, with different preparations of TFOs and plasmids. As shown in the figure, there was good agreement between data sets (see legend to Fig. 4 A). Triplex formation by purine motif third strands has been shown to be compromised by competing self-structure formation (G tetraplexes) by the TFO at temperatures below 37 °C (27Noonberg S.B. Francois J.C. Garestier T. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We were concerned that this might be an issue during the manipulation of thesupFG1·AG30 complex prior to electroporation. Accordingly, we repeated the experiment by preparing and maintaining the complex at 37 °C at all times before electroporation, without a precipitation step to remove unbound TFO. The results were the same as before. These data demonstrated that both the pyrimidine and purine motif triplexes were much less stable on DNA that entered the replication pool, than in physiological buffer in vitro, or in total transfected DNA. The data (Fig. 4 A) were analyzed by plotting the natural log of mutation frequency versus time (Fig. 4 B). The plot of the TC30·supF5 complex was approximately linear, indicating first order kinetics with a single exponential decay. This suggested that decline in mutation frequency was due to the simple dissociation of the triplex. The plot of the AG30 data was multi-component, with at least a two-phase exponential decay, indicating a more complicated decay process (Fig. 4 C). The validity of the mutagenesis assay as a measure of triplex stability demanded that the mutation frequency reflected mutagenesis at the site of the cross-link placed by the precise positioning of the psoralen by the TFO. We addressed this issue by analyzing the sequence of mutant supF genes isolated from experiments in which the cells were treated with UVA 3 h after transfection. We found that the pattern of mutations with thesupFG1·AG30 triplexes was the same as that reported earlier from experiments with the complexes that had been cross-linkedin vitro or in vivo (33Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Raha M. Lacroix L. Glazer P.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 67: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasmids with mutant supFG1 genes contained single base substitutions located at the positions of the psoralen cross-link as well as deletions of 5–75 bases of sequence in the triplex target region. We performed the same analysis on mutant supF5 plasmids. Approximately 25% of the plasmids contained deletions in the triplex target and supF gene ranging from 2 to 95 bases. Another 45% contained single base substitutions at position 99, while the remainder had single base substitutions at position 100, the sites of the psoralen cross-link (see Fig. 1). T → C and T → A were the principal mutations. Similar results were obtained withsupF5 plasmids on which the psoralen cross-link was setin vitro prior to transfection. These mutation data with both the supFG1 and supF5 plasmids demonstrated that the mutagenesis of the plasmid in the stability assays was indeed a measure of the precise positioning of the psoralen cross-link by the TFO. The striking differences between our data and the predictions based on the published, and our own (Figs. 2 and 3), in vitro, experiments led us to consider explanations for the results unrelated to triplex stability. Our assay assumed the integrity of the psoralen linkage to the oligonucleotide during the time course. Clearly, if the psoralen were cleaved from the TFO during the experiment, interpretation of the data would not be possible. We repeated the mutagenesis time-course experiment with a version of the Pso-TC30 TFO in which the phosphate linkage of the psoralen was protected from nuclease attack by phosphorothioation (34Agrawal S. Jiang Z. Zhao Q. Shaw D. Cai Q. Roskey A. Channavajjala L. Saxinger C. Zhang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the results were the same as before. Consequently, it seemed unlikely that loss of psoralen was responsible for the loss of mutational signal.
