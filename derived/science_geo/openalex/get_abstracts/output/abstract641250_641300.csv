https://openalex.org/W2964855699,"Public discourse is often caustic and conflict-filled. This trend seems to be particularly evident when the content of such discourse is around moral issues (broadly defined) and when the discourse occurs on social media. Several explanatory mechanisms for such conflict have been explored in recent psychological and social-science literatures. The present work sought to examine a potentially novel explanatory mechanism defined in philosophical literature: Moral Grandstanding. According to philosophical accounts, Moral Grandstanding is the use of moral talk to seek social status. For the present work, we conducted six studies, using two undergraduate samples (Study 1, N = 361; Study 2, N = 356); a sample matched to U.S. norms for age, gender, race, income, Census region (Study 3, N = 1,063); a YouGov sample matched to U.S. demographic norms (Study 4, N = 2,000); and a brief, one-month longitudinal study of Mechanical Turk workers in the U.S. (Study 5, Baseline N = 499, follow-up n = 296), and a large, one-week YouGov sample matched to U.S. demographic norms (Baseline N = 2,519, follow-up n = 1,776). Across studies, we found initial support for the validity of Moral Grandstanding as a construct. Specifically, moral grandstanding motivation was associated with status-seeking personality traits, as well as greater political and moral conflict in daily life."

Standardized submission data and PRRSV real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test results from porcine samples were retrieved from four VDLs representing 95% of all swine samples tested in NAHLN laboratories in the US. Anonymized data were retrieved and organized at the case level using SAS (SAS® Version 9.4, SAS® Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with the use of PROC DATA, PROC MERGE, and PROC SQL scripts. The final aggregated and anonymized dataset comprised of 547,873 unique cases was uploaded to Power Business Intelligence-Power BI® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) to construct dynamic charts. The number of cases tested for PRRSV doubled from 2010 to 2018, with that increase mainly driven by samples typically used for monitoring purposes rather than diagnosis of disease. Apparent seasonal trends for the frequency of PRRSV detection were consistently observed with a higher percentage of positive cases occurring during fall or winter months and lower during summer months, perhaps due to increased testing associated with well-known seasonal occurrence of swine respiratory disease. PRRSV type 2, also known as North American genotype, accounted for 94.76% of all positive cases and was distributed across the US. PRRSV type 1, also known as European genotype, was geographically restricted and accounted for 2.15% of all positive cases. Co-detection of both strains accounted for 3.09% of the positive cases. Both oral fluid and processing fluid samples, had a rapid increase in the number of submissions soon after they were described in 2008 and 2017, respectively, suggesting rapid adoption of these specimens by the US swine industry for PRRSV monitoring in swine populations. As part of this project, a bio-informatics tool defined as Swine Disease Reporting System (SDRS) was developed. This tool has real-time capability to inform the US swine industry on the macroepidemiological aspects of PRRSV detection, and is easily adaptable for other analytes relevant to the swine industry."
https://openalex.org/W2980582213,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its type-2 receptor (V2R) play an essential role in the regulation of salt and water homeostasis by the kidneys. V2R activation also stimulates proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines in vitro. The current studies investigated V2R expression and activity in human RCC tumors, and its role in RCC tumor growth. Examination of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, and analysis of human RCC tumor tissue microarrays, cDNA arrays and tumor biopsy samples demonstrated V2R expression and activity in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). In vitro, V2R antagonists OPC31260 and Tolvaptan, or V2R gene silencing reduced wound closure and cell viability of 786-O and Caki-1 human ccRCC cell lines. Similarly in mouse xenograft models, Tolvaptan and OPC31260 decreased RCC tumor growth by reducing cell proliferation and angiogenesis, while increasing apoptosis. In contrast, the V2R agonist dDAVP significantly increased tumor growth. High intracellular cAMP levels and ERK1/2 activation were observed in human ccRCC tumors. In mouse tumors and Caki-1 cells, V2R agonists reduced cAMP and ERK1/2 activation, while dDAVP treatment had the reverse effect. V2R gene silencing in Caki-1 cells also reduced cAMP and ERK1/2 activation. These results provide novel evidence for a pathogenic role of V2R signaling in ccRCC, and suggest that inhibitors of the AVP-V2R pathway, including the FDA-approved drug Tolvaptan, could be utilized as novel ccRCC therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2980641456,"Subterranean ecosystems host highly adapted aquatic invertebrate biota which play a key role in sustaining groundwater ecological functioning and hydrological dynamics. However, functional biodiversity studies in groundwater environments, the main source of unfrozen freshwater on Earth, are scarce, probably due to the cryptic nature of the systems. To address this, we investigate groundwater trophic ecology via stable isotope analysis, employing δ13C and δ15N in bulk tissues, and amino acids. Specimens were collected from a shallow calcrete aquifer in the arid Yilgarn region of Western Australia: a well-known hot-spot for stygofaunal biodiversity. Sampling campaigns were carried out during dry (low rainfall: LR) and the wet (high rainfall: HR) periods. δ13C values indicate that most of the stygofauna shifted towards more 13C-depleted carbon sources under HR, suggesting a preference for fresher organic matter. Conversion of δ15N values in glutamic acid and phenylalanine to a trophic index showed broadly stable trophic levels with organisms clustering as low-level secondary consumers. However, mixing models indicate that HR conditions trigger changes in dietary preferences, with increasing predation of amphipods by beetle larvae. Overall, stygofauna showed a tendency towards opportunistic and omnivorous habits—typical of an ecologically tolerant community—shaped by bottom-up controls linked with changes in carbon flows. This study provides baseline biochemical and ecological data for stygofaunal trophic interactions in calcretes. Further studies on the carbon inputs and taxa-specific physiology will help refine the interpretation of the energy flows shaping biodiversity in groundwaters. This will aid understanding of groundwater ecosystem functioning and allow modelling of the impact of future climate change factors such as aridification."
https://openalex.org/W2980467043,"Rational design-guided improvement of protein thermostability typically requires identification of residues or regions contributing to instability and introduction of mutations into these residues or regions. One popular method, B-FIT, utilizes B-factors to identify unstable residues or regions and combines them with other strategies, such as directed evolution. Here, we performed structure-based engineering to improve the thermostability of the subtilisin E-S7 (SES7) peptidase. The B-value of each residue was redefined in a normalized B-factor calculation, which was implemented with a refined bioinformatics analysis strategy to identify the critical area (loop 158-162) related to flexibility and to screen for suitable thermostable motif sequences in the Protein Data Bank that can act as transplant loops. In total, we analyzed 445 structures and identified 29 thermostable motifs as candidates. Using these motifs as a starting point, we performed iterative homologous modeling to obtain a desirable chimera loop and introduced five different mutations into this loop to construct thermostable SES7 proteins. Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed increases of 7.3 °C in the melting temperature of an SES7 variant designated M5 compared with the WT. The X-ray crystallographic structure of this variant was resolved at 1.96 Å resolution. The crystal structure disclosed that M5 forms more hydrogen bonds than the WT protein, consistent with design and molecular dynamics simulation results. In summary, the modified B-FIT strategy reported here has yielded a subtilisin variant with improved thermostability and promising industrial applications, supporting the notion that this modified method is a powerful tool for protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2980967562,"This study aimed to identify factors significantly associated with recent depressive mood with respect to health-related behavioral patterns at the individual level, perceived safety in the school environment, and willingness to share concerns with family and social networks. Self-reported responses to questions regarding recent feelings of depression, health-related behaviors in physical, psychological, and spiritual subdomains, school refusal and perceived safety at school, and perceived social support were obtained from 1,991 in-school adolescents (mean [SD] age = 15.3 [1.7] years; male/female = 936/1055). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify explanatory factors significantly associated with recent depression, defined as feelings of sadness or hopelessness for more than 2 weeks (during the last 12 months) that interfered with everyday functioning. Of the 1,991 students, 271 (13.6%) reported recent depression. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed higher odds of recent depression in adolescents with frequent thoughts of school refusal (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 3.25 [2.44-4.32]) and those who engaged in regular physical exercise (1.57 [1.19-2.07]), whereas a positive mindset (0.65 [0.49-0.86]), perceived safety at school (0.62 [0.47-0.82]), and perceived social support from one's mother (0.54 [0.40-0.72]) were associated with lower odds of recent depression. Taken together, our findings suggest that parents and teachers should talk regularly with adolescents about recent life (dis)satisfaction and stressors, particularly when they report frequent thoughts of school refusal. Perceived social support would increase perceived safety on school grounds and make it easier for teenagers to share their concerns with parents, thereby reducing the risk for depressive symptoms. School-based programs that promote a positive mindset would be helpful in preparing students for the challenges of adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2980912163,"Abstract Targeting Notch signaling has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), particularly in NOTCH1 -mutated patients. We provide first evidence that the Notch ligand DLL4 is a potent stimulator of Notch signaling in NOTCH1 -mutated CLL cells while increases cell proliferation. Importantly, DLL4 is expressed in histiocytes from the lymph node, both in NOTCH1 -mutated and -unmutated cases. We also show that the DLL4-induced activation of the Notch signaling pathway can be efficiently blocked with the specific anti-Notch1 antibody OMP-52M51. Accordingly, OMP-52M51 also reverses Notch-induced MYC, CCND1 , and NPM1 gene expression as well as cell proliferation in NOTCH1 -mutated CLL cells. In addition, DLL4 stimulation triggers the expression of protumor target genes, such as CXCR4 , NRARP , and VEGFA , together with an increase in cell migration and angiogenesis. All these events can be antagonized by OMP-52M51. Collectively, our results emphasize the role of DLL4 stimulation in NOTCH1 -mutated CLL and confirm the specific therapeutic targeting of Notch1 as a promising approach for this group of poor prognosis CLL patients."
https://openalex.org/W2980349755,"One hundred human-derived coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were screened for antimicrobial activity using agar-based deferred antagonism assays with a range of indicator bacteria. Based on the findings of the screen and subsequent well assays with cell free supernatants and whole cell extracts, one strain, designated CIT060, was selected for further investigation. It was identified as Staphylococcus capitis and herein we describe the purification and characterisation of the novel bacteriocin that the strain produces. This bacteriocin which we have named capidermicin was extracted from the cell-free supernatant of S. capitis CIT060 and purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis revealed that the capidermicin peptide has a mass of 5,464 Da. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments showed that capidermicin was active in the micro-molar range against all the Gram-positive bacteria that were tested. Antimicrobial activity was retained over a range of pHs (2-11) and temperatures (10-121°C x 15 mins). The draft genome sequence of S. capitis CIT060 was determined and the genes predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of capidermicin were identified. These genes included the predicted capidermicin precursor gene, and genes that are predicted to encode a membrane transporter, an immunity protein and a transcriptional regulator. Homology searches suggest that capidermicin is a novel member of the family of class II leaderless bacteriocins."
https://openalex.org/W2980510470,"Compressive force during orthodontic tooth movement induces osteoclast formation in vivo. TNF-α plays an important role in mouse osteoclast formation and bone resorption induced by compressive force during orthodontic tooth movement. Stromal cells, macrophages and T cells take part in TNF-α-induced osteoclast formation in vitro. Root resorption caused by odontoclasts is a major clinical problem during orthodontic tooth movement. In this study, we determined the cell type targeted by TNF-α during compressive-force-induced osteoclast and odontoclast formation to elucidate the mechanism of bone and root resorption in vivo. An orthodontic tooth movement mouse model was prepared with a nickel-titanium closed coil spring inserted between the maxillary incisors and the first molar. Using TNF receptor 1- and 2-deficient (KO) mice, we found that osteoclast and odontoclast formation was mediated by TNF-α in orthodontic tooth movement. We generated four types of chimeric mice: wild-type (WT) bone marrow cells transplanted into lethally irradiated WT mice (WT>WT), KO bone marrow cells transplanted into lethally irradiated WT mice (KO>WT), WT bone marrow cells transplanted into lethally irradiated KO mice (WT>KO), and KO marrow cells transplanted into lethally irradiated KO mice (KO>KO). Using anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies, T cells were eliminated from these mice. We subjected these chimeric mice to orthodontic tooth movement. Orthodontic tooth movement was evaluated and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells along the alveolar bone (osteoclasts) and along the tooth root (odontoclasts) were counted after 12 days of tooth movement. The amount of orthodontic tooth movement, and the number of osteoclasts and odontoclasts on the compression side were significantly lower in WT>KO and KO>KO mice than in WT>WT and KO>WT mice. According to these results, we concluded that TNF-α-responsive stromal cells are important for osteoclast and odontoclast formation during orthodontic tooth movement."
https://openalex.org/W2980826553,"Tidal inlets are extremely dynamic environments that are often strongly modified by anthropogenic intervention. In this study, we describe the rapid evolution of a highly human-impacted tidal inlet, studied through repeated high-resolution multibeam surveys and geomorphometric analysis. We document the rapid change induced by new hard coastal structures built to protect the historical city of Venice (Italy). A new breakwater erected between 2011 and 2013 induced the formation of large scour holes with the consequent erosion of about 170 · 103 ± 15.6% m3 of sediment until 2016. The construction of a new island in the middle of the inlet and the restriction of the inlet channel caused a general change of the inlet sedimentary regime from depositional to erosive with a net sediment loss of about 612 · 103 ± 42.7% m3, a reduction of the dune field area by more than 50% in about five years, and a coarsening in the sediment distribution. Our results give new insight on the tidal inlet resilience to changes, distinguishing two different phases in its recent evolution: (i) a very rapid response (from 2011 to 2013) of the seafloor morphology with scour-hole erosion at the new breakwater tips at a rate of about 45⋅103 m3/year and the disappearing of dune fields at a rate of 104⋅103 m2/year; and (ii) a general slowdown of the erosive processes from 2013 to 2016. Nevertheless, the erosion continues at the breakwater, though at a reduced rate, possibly representing a threat to the hard structure. In view of global mean sea level rise and consequent proliferation of hard structures along the coast all over the world, the combined use of very high resolution multibeam surveys and repeatable geomorphometric analysis proposed in this study will be crucial for the monitoring and future management of coastal environments."
https://openalex.org/W2981168685,"Future land-use development has the potential to profoundly affect the health of aquatic ecosystems in the coming decades. We developed regression models predicting the loss of sensitive fish (R2 = 0.39) and macroinvertebrate (R2 = 0.64) taxa as a function of urban and agricultural land uses and applied them to projected urbanization of the rapidly urbanizing Piedmont ecoregion of the southeastern USA for 2030 and 2060. The regression models are based on a 2014 investigation of water quality and ecology of 75 wadeable streams across the region. Based on these projections, stream kilometers experiencing >50% loss of sensitive fish and invertebrate taxa will nearly quadruple to 19,500 and 38,950 km by 2060 (16 and 32% of small stream kilometers in the region), respectively. Uncertainty was assessed using the 20 and 80% probability of urbanization for the land-use projection model and using the 95% confidence intervals for the regression models. Adverse effects on stream health were linked to elevated concentrations of contaminants and nutrients, low dissolved oxygen, and streamflow alteration, all associated with urbanization. The results of this analysis provide a warning of potential risks from future urbanization and perhaps some guidance on how those risks might be mitigated."
https://openalex.org/W2981228894,"Several mammalian species exhibit complex, nested social organizations, termed multi-level or modular societies. Multi-level societies comprise stable core units that fission and fuse with one another in a hierarchical manner, forming groups that vary in size over time. Among nonhuman primates, these social systems have been confirmed in several African papionin and Asian colobine species. We use data from August 2017 to July 2018 on individually-recognized Rwenzori Angolan colobus living near Lake Nabugabo, Uganda to document the first multi-level society in an African colobine. The study band comprised up to 135 individuals organized into 12 socially and spatially distinct core units that ranged in size from 4 to 23 individuals. These core units showed a strong affinity to one another, spending roughly 75% of their time together. Core units fissioned and fused non-randomly with one another throughout the day, leading to different combinations of core units being observed. Using association indices between core units, we employed hierarchical cluster analyses and permutation tests to show that some core units associated preferentially into clans. Thus, we confirm three tiers of social organization for Rwenzori Angolan colobus: core unit, clan, and band. The social organization of this subspecies is unlike any reported previously in a nonhuman primate, with about half the core units containing a single adult male and the others containing multiple reproductive adult males. The discovery of a unique primate multi-level society in a novel lineage could allow for a better understanding of the evolution of these complex social systems across the Animal Kingdom. Preliminary data show males transfer within the band and females transfer outside of the band, which is proposed for hominin multi-level societies. This subspecies could thus also provide insight into the selective pressures underlying multi-level societies in our own lineage."

This is a pilot of an innovative data collection tool using mobile technology to collect patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) selected from the International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) Pregnancy and Childbirth Standard Set in Nairobi, Kenya.Pregnant women in the third trimester were recruited at three primary care facilities in Nairobi and followed prospectively throughout delivery and until six weeks postpartum. PROMs were collected via mobile surveys at three antenatal and two postnatal time points. Outcomes included incontinence, dyspareunia, mental health, breastfeeding and satisfaction with care. Hospitals reported morbidity and mortality. Descriptive statistics on maternal and child outcomes, survey completion and follow-up rates were calculated.In six months, 204 women were recruited: 50% of women returned for a second ante-natal care visit, 50% delivered at referral hospitals and 51% completed the postnatal visit. The completion rates for the five PROM surveys were highest at the first antenatal care visit (92%) and lowest in the postnatal care visit (38%). Data on depression, dyspareunia, fecal and urinary incontinence were successfully collected during the antenatal and postnatal period. At six weeks postpartum, 86% of women breastfeed exclusively. Most women that completed the survey were very satisfied with antenatal care (66%), delivery care (51%), and post-natal care (60%).We have demonstrated that it is feasible to use mobile technology to follow women throughout pregnancy, track their attendance to pre-natal and post-natal care visits and obtain data on PROM. This study demonstrates the potential of mobile technology to collect PROM in a low-resource setting. The data provide insight into the quality of maternal care services provided and will be used to identify and address gaps in access and provision of high quality care to pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2980814356,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are important product quality attributes (PQAs) that can potentially impact drug stability, safety, and efficacy. The PTMs of a mAb may change remarkably in the bloodstream after drug administration compared to in vitro conditions. Thus, monitoring in vivo PTM changes of mAbs helps evaluate the criticality of PQAs during the product risk assessment. In addition, quantitation of the subject exposures to PTM variants helps assess the impact of PTMs on the safety and efficacy of therapeutic mAbs. Here, we developed an immunocapture-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method to quantify in vivo PTM changes a therapeutic mAb overtime in single- and multiple-dose monkey pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. We also built mathematical models to predict the in vivo serum concentrations of PQAs, the subject exposures to PQAs, and the relative abundance of PQAs in single- and multiple-dose regimens. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. The immunocapture-LC/MS method and mathematical models enable bioanalytical chemists to quantitatively assess the criticality of PQAs during drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2980822619,"Background Timely data is key to effective public health responses to epidemics. Drug overdose deaths are identified in surveillance systems through ICD-10 codes present on death certificates. ICD-10 coding takes time, but free-text information is available on death certificates prior to ICD-10 coding. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning method to classify free-text death certificates as drug overdoses to provide faster drug overdose mortality surveillance. Methods Using 2017–2018 Kentucky death certificate data, free-text fields were tokenized and features were created from these tokens using natural language processing (NLP). Word, bigram, and trigram features were created as well as features indicating the part-of-speech of each word. These features were then used to train machine learning classifiers on 2017 data. The resulting models were tested on 2018 Kentucky data and compared to a simple rule-based classification approach. Documented code for this method is available for reuse and extensions: https://github.com/pjward5656/dcnlp. Results The top scoring machine learning model achieved 0.96 positive predictive value (PPV) and 0.98 sensitivity for an F-score of 0.97 in identification of fatal drug overdoses on test data. This machine learning model achieved significantly higher performance for sensitivity (p<0.001) than the rule-based approach. Additional feature engineering may improve the model’s prediction. This model can be deployed on death certificates as soon as the free-text is available, eliminating the time needed to code the death certificates. Conclusion Machine learning using natural language processing is a relatively new approach in the context of surveillance of health conditions. This method presents an accessible application of machine learning that improves the timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance. As such, it can be employed to inform public health responses to the drug overdose epidemic in near-real time as opposed to several weeks following events."
https://openalex.org/W2981239130,"Objective We aim to explore the relationship between nocturnal sleep duration (NSD) and midday nap duration (MND) with body composition among Southwest Chinese adults. Methods Data on sleep duration of 3145 adults in Southwest China (59.4% women) were obtained between 2014 and 2015 through questionnaires. Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured to calculate body composition (body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat (%BF), and fat mass index (FMI)). Linear regression models were used to assess gender-specific associations between NSD and body composition. The relationship between MND with the odds of overweight and central obesity has been evaluated by logistic regression models. Results NSD has the inverse relation with males’ BMI, WC, %BF and FMI after adjusting for all covariates (all P <0.0007), exclusive of females’ (all P >0.4). After adjustment for potential confounders, compared to the subjects in the no midday nap group, the subjects who napped 0.1–1 hour were independently associated with a less prevalence of overweight in both women (OR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.55–0.95) and men (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.52–0.98). MND was not associated with central obesity. Conclusions Among Southwest Chinese adults, lower NSD might be related to higher BMI, WC, %BF and FMI among men. Additionally, MND is associated with overweight in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2980762388,"Invasive pneumococcal infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the availability of pneumococcal vaccines. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical syndromes, prognostic factors and outcomes for pneumococcal disease in adults and children in Singapore during the period before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine. We retrospectively analyzed a large cohort of patients admitted to the four main public hospitals in Singapore with S. pneumoniae infection between 1997 and 2013. A total of 889 (64% of all isolates identified in the clinical laboratories) cases were included in the analysis; 561 (63.1%) were adult (≥16 years) cases with a median age of 62 years and 328 (36.9%) were paediatric cases with a median age of 3 years. Bacteraemic pneumonia was the most common syndrome in both groups (69.3% vs. 44.2%), followed by primary bacteraemia without pneumonia (14.3% vs. 13.4%), meningitis (6.4% vs. 7.6%) and non-bacteraemic pneumonia (5.2% vs. 21%). The major serotypes in adults were 3, 4, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F whereas in children they were 14, 6B and 19F, accounting both for nearly half of pneumococcal disease cases. No particular serotype was associated with mortality or severity of the pneumococcal disease. Overall mortality rate was 18.5% in adults and 3% in children. Risk factors for mortality included acute cardiac events in adults, meningitis in children and critical illness and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in both adults and children. Penicillin resistance was not associated with increased mortality. Our results agree with global reports that the course of pneumococcal disease and its clinical outcome were more severe in adults than in children. The main serotypes causing invasive disease were mostly covered by the vaccines in use. The high mortality rates reflect an urgent need to increase vaccination coverage in both adults and children to tackle this vaccine-preventable infection."
https://openalex.org/W2980330254,"Objectives Hot environmental conditions can result in a high core-temperature and dehydration which can impair physical and cognitive performance. This study aimed to assess the effects of a hot operating theatre on various performance, physiological and psychological parameters in staff during a simulated burn surgery. Methods Due to varying activity levels, surgery staff were allocated to either an Active (n = 9) or Less-Active (n = 8) subgroup, with both subgroups performing two simulated burn surgery trials (CONTROL: ambient conditions; 23±0.2°C, 35.8±1.2% RH and HOT: 34±0°C, 28.3±1.9% RH; 150 min duration for each trial), using a crossover design with four weeks between trials. Manual dexterity, core-temperature, heart-rate, sweat-loss, thermal sensation and alertness were assessed at various time points during surgery. Results Pre-trials, 13/17 participants were mildly-significantly dehydrated (HOT) while 12/17 participants were mildly-significantly dehydrated (CONTROL). There were no significant differences in manual dexterity scores between trials, however there was a tendency for scores to be lower/impaired during HOT (both subgroups) compared to CONTROL, at various time-points (Cohen’s d = -0.74 to -0.50). Furthermore, alertness scores tended to be higher/better in HOT (Active subgroup only) for most time-points (p = 0.06) compared to CONTROL, while core-temperature and heart-rate were higher in HOT either overall (Active; p<0.05) or at numerous time points (Less-Active; p<0.05). Finally, sweat-loss and thermal sensation were greater/higher in HOT for both subgroups (p<0.05). Conclusions A hot operating theatre resulted in significantly higher core-temperature, heart-rate, thermal sensation and sweat-loss in staff. There was also a tendency for slight impairment in manual dexterity, while alertness improved. A longer, real-life surgery is likely to further increase physiological variables assessed here and in turn affect optimal performance/outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2980504844,"With the growing availability of high-resolution imaging there has been increased interest in developing new metrics for integrity of the retinal nerve fiber layer. In particular, it has been suggested that measurement of width of retinal nerve fiber bundles (RNFBs) may be useful in glaucoma, due to low between-subject variability in mean RNFB width. However, there have also been reports of substantial within-subject variability in the width of individual RNFBs. To assess within-subject variability as a potential source of selection bias in measurements of RNFB width, we used an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to measure widths of individual RNFBs in one eye each of 11 young adults in good ocular health. In a pilot study we analyzed a large AOSLO image of RNFL in one participant then, based on those findings, in the main study we used AOSLO to image a smaller region in 10 additional healthy young adults. The pilot study of one eye found RNFB widths ranging from 10 μm to 44 μm. This suggested that biological variability was too high for measuring small changes arising from disease processes. This was confirmed in measurements of 10 eyes in the main study, RNFB widths ranged from 9 μm to 55 μm and every eye had large within-subject variability (exceeding 19 μm in all eyes) in RNFB width for nearby bundles. The within-subject variability in RNFB width, as well as variation in the width of single RNFBs over relatively short distances (<300 um) depending on the precise location of measurement, suggests that bundle width measurements would be highly susceptible to selection bias and therefore of limited clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2980678740,"Our objective was to determine the efficacy and feasibility of a new approach for identifying candidate biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis (OA), based on selecting promising candidates from a range of high-frequency acoustic emission (AE) measurements generated during weight-bearing knee movement. Candidate AE biomarkers identified by this approach could then be validated in larger studies for use in future clinical trials and stratified medicine applications for this common health condition. A population cohort of participants with knee pain and a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) score between 1-4 were recruited from local NHS primary and secondary care sites. Focusing on participants’ self-identified worse knee, and using our established movement protocol, sources of variation in AE measurement and associations of AE markers with other markers were explored. Using this approach we identified 4 initial candidate AE biomarkers, of which “number of hits” showed the best reproducibility, in terms of within-session, day to day, week to week, between-practitioner, and between-machine variation, at 2 different machine upper frequency settings. “Number of hits” was higher in knees with KL scores of 2 than in KL1, and also showed significant associations with pain in the contralateral knee, and with body weight. “Hits” occurred predominantly in 2 of 4 defined movement quadrants. The protocol was feasible and acceptable to all participants and professionals involved. This study demonstrates how AE measurement during simple sit-stand-sit movements can be used to generate novel candidate knee OA biomarkers. AE measurements probably reflect a composite of structural changes and joint loading factors.

For mimics, such deception can range from precise (near-perfect mimicry) to only subtle resemblance (imperfect mimicry) and such strategies often differ by sex because of differing ecological selection pressures. In this field study, we examine variation in behavior and ecology that may be linked with sex differences in dorsal color pattern in three sympatric species of Habronattus jumping spiders (H. clypeatus, H. hallani, H. pyrrithrix). Males of these species have conspicuous dorsal patterning that is subtly reminiscent of the general color patterns of wasps and bees, while females are cryptic. We show that, compared with females, these conspicuous males exhibited increased leg-waving behavior outside of the context of courtship; such behavior is common in jumping spiders that mimic wasps and bees presumably because a mimic’s waving legs resemble antennae. Males of a fourth sympatric species (H. hirsutus) without conspicuous dorsal patterning did not exhibit increased leg-waving. These results are consistent with and offer preliminary support for the idea that male color and behavior may work together to deceive predators. We also examined whether higher movement rates of males (who must wander to find females) and/or different use of the microhabitat by the sexes could explain sexual dichromatism. We found that microhabitat use was similar for males and females, but males of all three conspicuously-colored species spent more time actively moving than females. To our knowledge, this is the first study to speculate that conspicuous male dorsal coloration in Habronattus may have a deceptive function, and to explore why dorsal coloration differs between the sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2980402337,"Objective A study was conducted to identify metabolic biochemical differences between two chicken genotypes infected with Eimeria acervulina and to ascertain the underlying mechanisms for these metabolic alterations and to further delineate genotype-specific effects during merozoite formation and oocyst shedding. Methods Fourteen day old chicks of an unimproved (ACRB) and improved (COBB) genotype were orally infected with 2.5 x 105 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts. At 4 and 6 day-post infection, 5 birds from each treatment group and their controls were bled for serum. Global metabolomic profiles were assessed using ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (metabolon, Inc.,). Statistical analyses were based on analysis of variance to identify which biochemicals differed significantly between experimental groups. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify significant pathways associated with response to E. acervulina infection. Results A total of 752 metabolites were identified across genotype, treatment and time post infection. Altered fatty acid (FA) metabolism and β-oxidation were identified as dominant metabolic signatures associated with E. acervulina infection. Key metabolite changes in FA metabolism included stearoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine and linoleoylcarnitine. The infection induced changes in nucleotide metabolism and elicited inflammatory reaction as evidenced by changes in thromboxane B2, 12-HHTrE and itaconate. Conclusions Serum metabolome of two chicken genotypes infected with E. acervulina demonstrated significant changes that were treatment-, time post-infection- and genotype-dependent. Distinct metabolic signatures were identified in fatty acid, nucleotide, inflammation and oxidative stress biochemicals. Significant microbial associated product alterations are likely to be associated with malabsorption of nutrients during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2980571513,"We aimed to investigate the effects of genome, age, and soil factors on cultivated Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (CPG) compounds under identical climate and agronomic practices. Eight populations of CPG from different years and rhizosphere soils were collected from garden and cropland in the city of Ji’an, China. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers were used to detect genetic diversity and identity, and soil microbial community diversity. Soil enzyme activities and nutrients were also measured. The contents of total ginsenosides (TG), Rg1, Re, Rf, Rd, and ginsenoside extractions of CPG were analyzed by spectrophotometry and HPLC. The relative importance of each factor was analyzed by mathematical methods such as correlation analysis, stepwise line regression, and path analysis. Regression equations of similarity values of HPLC fingerprint (SVHF), richness index of HPLC fingerprint (RIHF) and the TG, Rg1, Re, Rf, and Rd contents with their respective significant correlation factors were obtained. For SVHF, the relative importance is age>microbial community diversity>genetic diversity. For RIHF, the relative importance is age>genetic diversity>microbial community diversity. For TG, Rg1, and Rf contents, the relative importance is age>microbial community diversity. Ginseng age and genetic identity influenced Rd content, and age was more important. Total phosphorus was the only directly negative effect on Re. According to regression equations and path analysis, increasing age and decreasing Shannon (H') could improve the TG, Rg1, and Rf contents, with little effect on SVHF. Adding age, genetic diversity, and decreasing Shannon (H’) increased RIHF. Adding age and genetic identity could also improve Rd content. Appropriate decreases in total phosphorus might increase Re content. These findings are significant for CPG scientific cultivation methods, through which CPG bioactive ingredients could be finely controlled via regulation of genotypes and cultural conditions."

IRR gene was originally found in cloning experiments with the DNA of the insulin receptor (IR) as a probe (1Shier P. Watt V.M. Primary structure of a putative receptor for a ligand of the insulin family.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2768234): 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since this discovery in 1989, no endogenous ligands for IRR have been identified (2Dissen G.A. Garcia-Rudaz C. Tapia V. Parada L.F. Hsu S.Y. Ojeda S.R.

Recently, it was determined that IRR can be activated merely by an increase in the extracellular pH, and it was postulated that IRR is a regulator of the acid–base balance (3Petrenko A.G.

Because IR and type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) cannot be activated by either alkali or acid, the IRR activation is quite specific. Upon alkali treatment, IRR shows a dose-dependent response with positive cooperativity that is quickly reversible when the media pH is neutralized. The IRR activation triggers intracellular signaling that starts with IRR autophosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of intracellular signaling adapters IRS-1 and AKT-1. The IRR activation leads to intense blebbing and actin stress fiber rearrangement in transfected CHO cells. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement was also observed in beta pancreatic MIN6 cells where IRR is expressed endogenously (4Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A.

Finally, analyses of several chimeras of IR and IRR revealed the key importance of the IRR extracellular region in its pH sensitivity (5Deyev I.E. Popova N.V. Petrenko A.G.

The IRR tissue expression profile distinguishes it from its relatives of the IR minifamily (3Petrenko A.G. Zozulya S.A. Deyev I.E. Eladari D. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular pH sensor involved in the regulation of acid-base balance.Biochim. Biophys.

Whereas IR and IGF-IR are essentially ubiquitous, detectable concentrations of IRR were only found in some specialized cells of kidney, pancreatic, stomach, ovary, and nervous tissues. The physiological importance of IRR was also addressed by gene targeting. Unexpectedly, IRR-knockout mice appeared to be quite healthy under normal conditions, whereas IR and IGF-IR knockouts were not viable (8Kitamura T. Kido Y. Nef S. Merenmies J. Parada L.F. Accili D. Preserved pancreatic β-cell development and function in mice lacking the insulin receptor-related receptor.Mol.

However, upon experimental alkali challenge, the IRR-knockout mice showed defects in their renal function and behavioral abnormalities (9Shayahmetova D.M. Zhevlenev E.S. Mozhaev A.A. Deyev I.E. Petrenko A.G. Genetic link between IRR-receptor and Ly6/PLAUR protein.Russ. J. Bioorg. Chem. 2016; 42: 449-45210.1134/S1068162016040166Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Zubkov E.A. Morozova A.Y.

Pavlova. 2017; 67 (30695555): 106-112PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the obvious functional differences between the IR family members, their structural features are similar. Unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases that dimerize upon their ligand binding (a key step in their activation), IRR, IR, and IGF-IR are expressed as disulfide-linked dimers of two subunits, αβ half-receptors, which are derived from proteolytic cleavage but stay complexed due to covalent disulfide bonds. Thus, one can assume that transmembrane signaling by IRR and its homologs is not based on ligand-induced dimerization per se but should involve allosteric structural changes within the existing receptor dimer (4Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N.

This kind of structural transition can occur at both global and local levels. In the extracellular part, the local structural transition can possibly be limited by a local rotation of the domains due to flexible linkers between them (11Whitten A.E. Smith B.J. Menting J.G.

The amino acid sequences of IRR, IR, and IGF-IR are highly homologous with about 50% identity and 65% similarity. They also have identical domain structures. Their large N-terminal extracellular regions contain two leucine-rich repeat domains, named L1 and L2, joined by the cysteine-rich C-domain and three C-terminal fibronectin type III repeats (FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3). The one transmembrane hydrophobic segment is followed by the C-terminal intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain (12De Meyts P.

SAXS was also used to analyze structural changes of IR and IGF-IR ectodomains induced by ligand binding with the conclusion that structural movements within the ectodomain upon ligand binding are small and limited to local rotation of domains (11Whitten A.E.

Another structural method, AFM, can provide direct real-space information about the size and shape of particles and electrochemical properties of a macromolecule based on its binding with surfaces. Complementarity between SAXS and AFM allows cross-validation of models, thereby increasing the reliability and confidence in the results (28Shtykova E.V. Baratova L.A. Fedorova N.V. Radyukhin V.A.

On the basis of SAXS and AFM analyses of the IRR ectodomain, we propose its asymmetrical droplike model. To obtain structural information, samples of recombinant ectoIRR were analyzed by SAXS. Because IRR is an alkali sensor, the measurements were made in parallel at pH 7.0 and 9.0. The processed experimental scattering patterns from ectoIRR are displayed in Fig. 1. Concentration-dependent effects on the measured scattering intensities were not observed for samples spanning 0.5–3 mg/ml. Fig. 1 shows scattering curves from 3 mg/ml protein solution. The scattering profiles of ectoIRR, measured at pH 7.0 and 9.0, do not show dramatic differences and almost coincide when the data are scaled relative to each other (Figs. 1a, curves 1 and 4, and S2). Their similarity is emphasized by the superposition of the bell-shaped Kratky plots, which indicates that the protein is mostly folded (30Mertens H.D. Svergun D.I. Structural characterization of proteins and complexes using small-angle X-ray solution scattering.J. Struct.

The slope of the Guinier plots is also similar (Fig. 1b), yielding a very close radius of gyration from Guinier (Rg) of ectoIRR at pH 7.0 (Rg = 5.30 nm) and pH 9.0 (Rg = 5.25 nm). The experimental molecular mass (MM) estimates obtained from the data are consistent with the MM calculated from the electrophoresis of ectoIRR (Fig. S3) and indicate that ectoIRR forms a dimer in solution. A summary of the experimental structural parameters (Rg, Dmax, Porod volume (Vp) estimate, calculated molecular mass from the amino acid sequence without the contribution of glycosylation of the ectoIRR dimer (MMaa), molecular mass from Porod volume (MMPorod), and molecular mass by the Bayesian inference approach (MMBayesian)) extracted from the SAXS data are reported in Table 1.Table 1SAXS-derived overall structural parameters of the ectoIRR dimer in solutionSampleRgDmaxVpMMaaMMPorodMMBayesiannmnmnm3kDakDakDaectoIRR, pH 7.05.30 ± 0.0219.5 ± 0.3460 ± 20201.5280 ± 15243 credibility interval: 221–373ectoIRR, pH 9.05.25 ± 0.0219.0 ± 0.2455 ± 20201.5270 ± 15243 credibility interval: 221–373 Open table in a new tab As revealed by the SAXS data analysis, the integral structural characteristics of the protein in solution remain the same despite changes in pH. These results are in some degree similar to the data obtained in the work of Whitten et al. (11Whitten A.E. Smith B.J. Menting J.G. Margetts M.B. McKern N.M. Lovrecz G.O. Adams T.E. Richards K. Bentley J.D. Trewhella J. Ward C.W. Lawrence M.C.

The authors suggest that structural changes of the IR and the homologous IGF-IR induced by ligand binding are small and possibly limited to local rotation of domains. Typical ab initio shape reconstructions of the ectoIRR dimer at both pH values are presented in Fig. 1, d and e. At the given resolution, the ectodomain shape does not change significantly with a pH increase (Fig. S2b); the normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) in this case is 0.50. The second-order symmetry was not used for DAMMIN shape reconstruction to obtain a model independent of artificially introduced symmetry because the use of any restrictions dramatically narrows the area of resulting models. Moreover, due to flexibility of the links between domains, the protein can achieve slightly different coexisting conformations in solution. Thus, ab initio reconstruction without symmetry more adequately reflects an average structure of the sample. Nevertheless, because the macromolecule of the protein is a dimer consisting of two identical monomers, P2 symmetry was also used for the shape reconstruction. However, a comparison of the obtained low-resolution models demonstrates their overall similarity. In contrast, reconstructions with P2 symmetry yield systematically worse fits to the experimental data through multiple runs of the program, whereas scattering patterns computed from the ab initio models obtained by DAMMIN without symmetry yield good fits to the experimental data: χ2 = 1.3 for pH 7.0 and 1.4 for pH 9.0 (Fig. 1a). Therefore, at this stage of the SAXS data analysis, one can conclude that the overall low-resolution shape of the ectoIRR does not change at the alkalization. Given the availability of flexible links between protein domains, it should be assumed that pH changing leads to some local changes that occur at the level of rotation of the individual domains. This assumption is supported by small but detectable differences in the structural characteristics of the protein (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To obtain more detailed structural organization of the ectoIRR in solution, hybrid modeling was performed using CORAL. The available high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the insulin receptor ectodomain (derived from Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 4ZXB) as the closest IRR homolog was split into individual subdomains. The splitting was done between the head and tail domains such that the first subdomain contained amino acids 1–465 and the second contained amino acids 472–910. Amino acids 466–471 constitute the flexible linker, as this loop contains only several contacts with the rest of the monomer structure (Fig. 2). Usage of only two intact domains per polypeptide chain was chosen to keep the number of free parameters low with a reasonable number of degrees of freedom to avoid overfitting. First, the modeling was performed for pH 9.0. The resulting model yields good fit to the experimental data with χ2 = 1.27 (Fig. 3a). Given the similarity of the SAXS experimental data at pH 7.0 and 9.0, further CORAL modeling (against pH 7.0 data) was performed starting from the rigid-body model obtained for pH 9.0. This refineme"
https://openalex.org/W2980377944,"The black sheep effect (BSE) describes the evaluative upgrading of norm-compliant group members (ingroup bias), and evaluative downgrading of deviant (norm-violating) group members, relative to similar outgroup members. While the BSE has been demonstrated extensively in human groups, it has yet to be shown in groups containing robots. This study investigated whether a BSE towards a 'deviant' robot (one low on warmth and competence) could be demonstrated. Participants performed a visual tracking task in a team with two humanoid NAO robots, with one robot being an ingroup member and the other an outgroup member. The robots offered advice to the participants which could be accepted or rejected, proving a measure of trust. Both robots were also evaluated using questionnaires, proxemics, and forced preference choices. Experiment 1 (N = 18) manipulated robot grouping to test our group manipulation generated ingroup bias (a necessary precursor to the BSE) which was supported. Experiment 2 (N = 72) manipulated the grouping, warmth and competence of both robots, predicting a BSE towards deviant ingroup robots, which was supported. Results indicated that a disagreeable ingroup robot is viewed less favourably than a disagreeable outgroup robot. Furthermore, when interacting with two independent robots, a ""majority rule"" effect can occur in which each robot's opinion is treated as independent vote, with participants significantly more likely to trust two unanimously disagreeing robots. No effect of warmth was found. The impact of these findings for human-robot team composition are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2980818822,"Financial inclusion is an area of growing global interest in women's empowerment policy and programming. While increased economic autonomy may be expected to reduce the prevalence of intimate partner violence, the mechanisms and contexts through which this relationship manifests are not well understood. This analysis aims to assess the relationship between women's financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence using nationally-representative data from 112 countries worldwide. Levels of both financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence varied substantially across countries (ranging from 2-100%, and 1-46%, respectively), and across regions. In multivariate global analyses, increased levels of women's financial inclusion were associated with lower levels of recent intimate partner violence after accounting for asset-based enablers of economic autonomy and gender norms; this relationship was lost upon the inclusion of measures of national context (i.e., development and fragility). These results underscore that the relationship between financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence is complex, follows many pathways, and is affected by context. In low and middle income countries, asset-based enablers of economic autonomy, gender norms and national context explained much of the relationship between financial inclusion and recent intimate partner violence. In those low and middle income countries with high levels of controlling behavior by male spouses, financial inclusion was associated with higher levels of recent intimate partner violence. These findings further suggest that initiatives that aim to prevent intimate partner violence by way of increased economic autonomy may be ineffective in the absence of broader social change and support, and indeed, as seen in countries with higher levels of men's controlling behavior, backlash may increase the risk of violence. Efforts to improve women's financial inclusion need to recognize that its relationship with intimate partner violence is complex, and that it requires an enabling environment supportive of women's rights and autonomy."
https://openalex.org/W2980467083,"Neisseria meningitidis is the primary cause of bacterial meningitis in many parts of the world, with considerable mortality rates among neonates and adults. In Saudi Arabia, serious outbreaks of N. meningitidis affecting several hundreds of pilgrims attending Hajj in Makkah were recorded in the 2000–2001 season. Evidence shows increased rates of bacterial resistance to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents that are used in the treatment of the meningococcal disease. The host’s immune system becomes unable to recognize the polysialic acid capsule of the resistant N. meningitidis that mimics the mammalian cell surface. The biosynthetic pathways of sialic acid (i.e., N-acetylneuraminic acid [NANA]) in bacteria, however, are somewhat different from those in mammals. The largest obstacle facing previously identified inhibitors of NANA synthase (NANAS) in N. meningitidis is that these inhibitors feature undesired chemical and pharmacological characteristics. To better comprehend the binding mechanism underlying these inhibitors at the catalytic site of NANAS, we performed molecular modeling studies to uncover essential structural aspects for the ultimate recognition at the catalytic site required for optimal inhibitory activity. Applying two virtual screening candidate molecules and one designed molecule showed promising structural scaffolds. Here, we report ethyl 3-benzoyl-2,7-dimethyl indolizine-1-carboxylate (INLZ) as a novel molecule with high energetic fitness scores at the catalytic site of the NmeNANAS enzyme. INLZ represents a promising scaffold for NmeNANAS enzyme inhibitors, with new prospects for further structural development and activity optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2980742068,"Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are becoming more frequent as climate changes wildlife communities at unprecedented rates, driving population declines and raising concerns for species conservation. One critical disease is the global pandemic of chytridiomycosis in frogs, which can be caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Although there is clear evidence for Bd-induced mortality across high-elevation frog communities, little attention is given to the role of lowlands in Bd's persistence and spread because low elevations are assumed to be too warm to harbor significant levels of Bd. Here, we report widespread Bd infection across 80 frog species from three sites in the lowland Peruvian Amazon, an area with no documented Bd-related amphibian declines. Despite observing no clinical signs of infection in the field, we found that 24-46% of individuals were infected per site (up to ≈105,000 zoospore equivalents per frog) by three Bd strains from the global pandemic lineage (Bd-GPL). We also found collection site and seasonal effects to be only weak predictors of Bd prevalence and load, with lower elevation and drier habitats marginally decreasing both prevalence and load. We found no further effect of host phylogeny, ecotype, or body size. Our results showing high and widespread prevalence across a lowland tropical ecosystem contradict the expectations based on the global pattern of pathogenicity of Bd that is largely restricted to higher elevations and colder temperatures. These findings imply that the lowlands may play a critical role in the spread and persistence of Bd over time and space."
https://openalex.org/W2980819124,"In neural computation, the essential information is generally encoded into the neurons via their spiking configurations, activation values or (attractor) dynamics. The synapses and their associated plasticity mechanisms are, by contrast, mainly used to process this information and implement the crucial learning features. Here, we propose a novel Turing complete paradigm of neural computation where the essential information is encoded into discrete synaptic states, and the updating of this information achieved via synaptic plasticity mechanisms. More specifically, we prove that any 2-counter machine—and hence any Turing machine—can be simulated by a rational-weighted recurrent neural network employing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules. The computational states and counter values of the machine are encoded into discrete synaptic strengths. The transitions between those synaptic weights are then achieved via STDP. These considerations show that a Turing complete synaptic-based paradigm of neural computation is theoretically possible and potentially exploitable. They support the idea that synapses are not only crucially involved in information processing and learning features, but also in the encoding of essential information. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the field of neural computation."

The current inconsistencies may hinder the development of clear guidelines on the prevention and treatment of oral conditions among ALHIV. This study provides an update on oral conditions and their associated factors in a cohort of South African ALHIV and receiving routine HIV treatment services at a Johannesburg HIV wellness clinic. Methods Decayed Teeth (DT), Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) and Oral HIV/AIDS Research Alliance case definitions were used for caries examination and reporting of the Oral Mucosal Lesions (OML) respectively. Data analyses were stratified by the study main outcomes; chi-squared tests were performed to determine the associations; and multiple logistic regressions were also used to identify associated factors after adjusting for other exposure variables. In addition to fitting logistic regressions, we explored the data for potential confounders and effect modifiers. Results A total of 407 ALHIV were assessed, of which 51.0% were females. The mean age of the ALHIV was 14.75 years (SD 2.43) while the median age of their parents was 43 years (IQR 37–48 years). Regardless of sex, age group and other socio-demographic characteristics, participants had high count of dental caries (DMFT>0). The overall prevalence of dental caries was 56.76% (n = 231) with mean DT score of 2.0 (SD 2.48) and mean DMFT score of 2.65 (SD 3.01). Dental caries prevalence (DT>0) was significantly associated with the HIV clinical markers. HIV RNA viral loads more than 1000 copies/ml and CD4 cell counts less than 200 count cells/mm3, increased the likelihood of having dental decay among ALHIV (p 0), age category 13–15 years, WHO staging of IV and viral load of more than 1000 copies/ml significantly predicted the outcome of oral lesions as assessed using the OHARA case definitions (p<0.05). The odds of developing dental caries was also 1.5 times more among ALHIV who brush their teeth less frequently and those who reported more frequent eating of sugar sweetened diets (p<0.05). Conclusions There is high prevalence of dental caries and OML among ALHIV in Johannesburg. The reported prevalence was associated with high HIV RNA viral loads, shorter duration on antiretroviral treatment and high WHO staging of HIV disease on crude analysis. Additionally, caries experience contributed to the prevalence of OML. Our study acknowledges the protective effect of HIV treatment and positive oral health practices on the presence of oral conditions among ALHIV in Johannesburg."

A kinetic analysis using stopped-flow spectrometry with (R)- or (S)-staphylopine and kinetic and structural analysis with (R)- and (S)-pseudopaline confirmed catalysis in the reverse direction for only (R)-staphylopine and (R)-pseudopaline, verifying the stereochemistry of these two opine metallophores.

Three techniques have been considered in a case study: adding steel or carbon fibre reinforced polymer grids in the walls and steel encirclements in the openings. The performance-based method has been used to that purpose. Nonlinear static analyses have been performed to obtain the capacity and fragility curves, the performance point and the damage level states. Moreover, an analysis of the cost-benefit ratio has been carried out. Results have shown that the three techniques have produced considerable improvements. The addition of encirclements has reduced the deformation resulting in a slight increase of the structure's stiffness. Adding steel grids has produced the maximum peak strength increase while adding polymer grids has produced the largest ultimate displacements. Adding encirclement has had the best cost-benefit ratio."

In this study, we demonstrated the role of novel exonuclease 5 (EXO5) gene in androgen-induced double strand breaks repair via homology-directed repair pathway and prostate tumorigenesis. Using whole-exome sequencing of samples from 20 PCa families, with three or more siblings diagnosed with metastatic PCa, we identified mutations in 31 genes involved in DSB response and repair. Among them, the L151P mutation in the exonuclease 5 (EXO5) gene was present in all affected siblings in three PCa families. We found two other EXO5 SNPs significantly associated with risk of PCa in cases-controls study from databases of genotype and phenotype (dbGaP), which are in linkage disequilibrium (D′ = 1) with Exo5 L151P found in PCa family. The L151 residue is conserved across diverse species and its mutation is deleterious for protein functions, as demonstrated by our bioinformatics analyses. The L151P mutation impairs the DNA repair function of EXO5 due to loss of nuclease activity, as well as failure of nuclear localization. CRISPR elimination of EXO5 in a PCa cell line impaired homology-directed recombination repair (HDR) and caused androgen-induced genomic instability, as indicated by frequent occurrence of the oncogenic fusion transcript TMPRSS2-ERG. Genetic and functional validation of the EXO5 mutations indicated that EXO5 is a risk gene for prostate tumorigenesis, likely due to its functions in HDR."

However, due to the diversity of factors and mechanisms involved in adipocyte differentiation, the full complement of key transcriptional regulators that orchestrate adipogenesis remains to be elucidated. The NKX family of homeodomain (HD)-containing TFs includes numerous members that display diverse functions in cell fate determination, development (especially of the nervous system), and tumorigenesis (35Muhr J.

NKX6-2 regulates axon–glia interactions, and its mutation causes a form of spastic ataxia (49Chelban V. Patel N. Vandrovcova J. Zanetti M.N. Lynch D.S. Ryten M. Botía J.A. Bello O. Tribollet E.

Finally, NKX2-1 (also called thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)) is essential for development of the thyroid, lung, and brain (50Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. The T/ebp null mouse: thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein is essential for the organogenesis of the thyroid, lung, ventral forebrain, and pituitary.Genes Dev. 1996; 10 (10.1101/gad.10.1.60, 8557195): 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). As noted above, PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenesis. Although PPARγ is expressed at very low levels in the normal thyroid and has no known function in normal thyroid biology (51Yu J. Koenig R.J. Thyroid-specific PPARγ deletion is benign in the mouse.Endocrinology. 2018; 159 (10.1210/en.2017-03163, 29420754): 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), a subset of thyroid cancers is caused by a chromosomal translocation that fuses the genes PAX8 and PPARG, resulting in expression of an oncogenic PAX8–PPARγ fusion protein (PPFP) (52Kroll T.G. Sarraf P. Pecciarini L. Chen C.J. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. Fletcher J.A. PAX8-PPARγ1 fusion oncogene in human thyroid carcinoma.Science. 2000; 289 (10.1126/science.289.5483.1357, 10958784; Correction (2000) 289, 1474): 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). We previously found that pioglitazone, a synthetic agonist ligand for PPARγ, also binds to PPFP and turns it into a strongly PPARγ-like protein, resulting in adipogenic trans-differentiation of PPFP-expressing thyroid cancer cells (53Dobson M.E. Diallo-Krou E. Grachtchouk V. Yu J. Colby L.A. Wilkinson J.E. Giordano T.J. Koenig R.J. Pioglitazone induces a proadipogenic antitumor response in mice with PAX8-PPARγ fusion protein thyroid carcinoma.Endocrinology. 2011; 152 (10.1210/en.2011-1178, 21952241): 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also found that NKX2-1 physically interacts with PPFP and inhibits PPFP/pioglitazone-mediated adipogenic trans-differentiation (54Xu B. O'Donnell M. O'Donnell J. Yu J. Zhang Y. Sartor M.A. Koenig R.J. Adipogenic differentiation of thyroid cancer cells through the Pax8-PPARγ fusion protein is regulated by thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1).J. Biol.

These data led us to test whether NKX family members may play a role in normal adipogenesis. We found that the transcriptional repressor NKX1-2 promotes the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, at least in part by repressing the expression of the negative adipogenic regulator chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP)-TF II (55Okamura M. Kudo H. Wakabayashi K. Tanaka T. Nonaka A. Uchida A. Tsutsumi S. Sakakibara I. Naito M. Osborne T.F. Hamakubo T. Ito S. Aburatani H. Yanagisawa M. Kodama T. et al.COUP-TFII acts downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signal to silence PPARγ gene expression and repress adipogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, not only does NKX1-2 promote the adipogenic differentiation of ST2 cells, a bone marrow–derived mesenchymal precursor cell line, it also inhibits the differentiation of those cells into osteoblasts. Overall, our data suggest a novel role for NKX1-2 in adipogenesis and possibly in bone homeostasis. We recently found that thyroid cancer cells expressing the PAX8–PPARγ fusion oncogene trans-differentiate into adipocyte-like cells in the presence of the PPARγ agonist ligand pioglitazone, but that this trans-differentiation is inhibited by the homeodomain TF NKX2-1/TTF-1 (54Xu B.

This led us to hypothesize that NKX family members may play a role in normal adipogenesis. To begin to test this hypothesis, we stably overexpressed NKX2-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and found that this inhibits differentiation to mature adipocytes, as indicated by reduced formation of lipid droplets and decreased expression of markers of mature adipocytes, including PPARγ, C/EBPα, and FABP4 (Fig. S1). However, we found that, prior to and throughout differentiation, endogenous NKX2-1 is expressed at negligible levels in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1), calling into question the physiological relevance of the overexpression data. This led us to test whether other NKX family members may play a role in adipogenesis. The endogenous expression of all 14 NKX family members was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. We found that most Nkx genes, including Nkx2-1, are expressed at very low levels throughout differentiation. However, the related family member Nkx1-2 is induced during adipocyte differentiation at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B). We next evaluated the effect of NKX1-2 depletion on adipogenesis. Two independent shRNAs targeting different regions of Nkx1-2 (Fig. 2A) were used to knock down endogenous Nkx1-2 at both the protein and RNA levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 2, C and D). Importantly, knockdown of endogenous NKX1-2 almost completely blocked adipocyte differentiation as indicated by decreased Oil Red O (ORO) staining of neutral lipid (Fig. 2B) and reduced protein and/or RNA expression of adipocyte markers PPARγ, C/EBPα, FABP4, and adiponectin (Figs. 2, C and D, and S2, A and B). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous NKX1-2 using the same shRNAs also inhibited the differentiation of cultured murine ear mesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into mature adipocytes, as demonstrated by reduced ORO staining (Fig. 3A) and reduced expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and FABP4 (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Depletion of endogenous NKX1-2 inhibits cultured murine EMSC adipocyte differentiation. A, cultured EMSCs expressing shControl, shNkx1-2-1, or shNkx1-2-2 were induced to differentiate into adipocytes with the hormone mixture MDI. At the end of differentiation (Day 6), cells were stained with ORO to assess neutral lipid accumulation. All micrographs are the same magnification; a 100-μm scale bar is shown in the lower right panel. B, immunoblotting (IB) for NKX1-2 protein and the mature adipocyte marker proteins PPARγ, C/EBPα, or FABP4 was performed on lysates harvested at Day 0 before differentiation and Day 6 at the end of differentiation. β-Actin served as a loading control. These results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether NKX1-2 overexpression could promote adipogenesis.

The chi-square and z of proportions (p <0.05) statistical tests were conducted.Esthetics was the main motivation associated with AS intake, leading to satisfactory results. The information about the form in which to use AS was provided by doctors and AS were either purchased at the pharmacy with a prescription or illegally. Current users reported a higher number of cycles and doses, a longer duration of use, as well as larger economical investments into AS. This shows a higher consumption of such drugs, regardless of the medical follow-up and post-cycle therapy.Given that a change in the usage pattern was observed when increasing the AS consumption, this should be considered in the elaboration of public policies to inhibit such a trend."

According to car2go booking record data in Seattle area. Firstly, influence of time and location on the free-floating car-sharing usage pattern is analyzed, which reveals an apparent doublet pattern for time and dependence usage amount on population. Then, on the basis of the long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN), hourly variation in short-term traffic characteristics including travel demand and travel distance are modeled. The results were also compared with other different statistical models, such as support vector regression (SVR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), single and second exponential smoothing. It showed that (LSTM-RNN) shows better performance in terms of statistical analysis and tendency precision based on limited data sample."
https://openalex.org/W2981198403,"The Machiavellian IV [1] instrument, developed almost 50 years ago to measure trait Machiavellianism and still in wide use in personality research, uses item wording that is not gender-neutral, makes use of idiomatic expressions, and includes archaic references. In this two-sample study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on one sample to examine the structure of responses to the Mach IV. In an independent second sample the resulting EFA structure was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis-based measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) tests in a control group with the original archaic items and a treatment group with eight items rewritten in a more modern vernacular. Specific model testing steps [2] and statistical tests [3] were applied in a bottom-up approach [4] to ME/I tests on these two versions of the Mach IV. The two versions were found to have equal form, equal factor loadings, but unequal indicator error variances. Subsequent item-by-item tests of error invariance resulted in substantial decrements to fit for three revised items suggesting that the error associated with these items was not equal across the two versions."
https://openalex.org/W2981292755,"We report the development of system for packaging critical components of the traditional collection kit to make an integrated fingerstick blood collector for self-collecting blood samples of 100 μl or more for radiation countermeasures. A miniaturized vacuum tube system (VacuStor system) has been developed to facilitate liquid reagent storage, simple operation and reduced sample contamination. Vacuum shelf life of the VacuStor tube has been analyzed by the ideal gas law and gas permeation theory, and multiple ways to extend vacuum shelf life beyond one year have been demonstrated, including low temperature storage, Parylene barrier coating and container vacuum bag sealing. Self-collection was also demonstrated by healthy donors without any previous fingerstick collection experience. The collected blood samples showed similar behavior in terms of gene expression and cytogenetic biodosimetry assays comparing to the traditionally collected samples. The integrated collector may alleviate the sample collection bottleneck for radiation countermeasures following a large-scale nuclear event, and may be useful in other applications with its self-collection and liquid reagent sample preprocessing capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2980563901,"The present study mainly consists of a re-evaluation of the rate at which C12E8, a typical non-ionic detergent used for membrane studies, is able to dissociate from biological membranes, with sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane vesicles being used as an example. Utilizing a brominated derivative of C12E8 and now stopped-flow fluorescence instead of rapid filtration, we found that the rate of dissociation of this detergent from these membranes, merely perturbed with non-solubilizing concentrations of detergent, was significantly faster (t1/2 < 10 ms) than what had previously been determined (t1/2 ~300-400 ms) from experiments based on a rapid filtration protocol using 14C-labeled C12E8 and glass fiber filters (Binding of a non-ionic detergent to membranes: flip-flop rate and location on the bilayer, by Marc le Maire, Jesper Møller and Philippe Champeil, Biochemistry (1987) Vol 26, pages 4803-4810). We here pinpoint a methodological problem of the earlier rapid filtration experiments, and we suggest that the true overall dissociation rate of C12E8 is indeed much faster than previously thought. We also exemplify the case of brominated dodecyl-maltoside, whose kinetics for overall binding to and dissociation from membranes comprise both a rapid and a sower phase, the latter being presumably due to flip-flop between the two leaflets of the membrane. Consequently, equilibrium is reached only after a few seconds for DDM. This work thereby emphasizes the interest of using the fluorescence quenching associated with brominated detergents for studying the kinetics of detergent/membrane interactions, namely association, dissociation and flip-flop rates."
https://openalex.org/W2980725671,"Education outreach in schools has been identified as a critical route to influence children’s perceptions and capabilities for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics careers. Evidence suggests that providing non-teaching professionals like engineers with training programmes and structured experience can boost perceived self-efficacy to perform education outreach, which in turn means better quality and more frequent public engagement. A validated measure of the construct of perceived self-efficacy for engineering education outreach will be useful for effective science communication participation, research, and practise. This article presents the methods used to develop the Engineering Outreach Self-efficacy Scale (EOSS), along with initial reliability and validation results to support the scale’s use. The 10-item scale was found to have good internal consistency and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha α = .92) with a sample of 160 engineers. The scale had convergent validity with general self-efficacy. Engineers with more experience of education outreach had higher self-efficacy for engineering education outreach. There were no significant differences between male and female engineers. Initial test-retest results showed engineers receiving training in education outreach significantly improved their EOSS scores, indicating capability to detect change over time. It is hoped this scale will prove useful for further evaluation of engineering education outreach and public engagement with science activities."
https://openalex.org/W2981180701,"The land iguanas, Conolophus pallidus and Conolophus subcristatu are large and charismatic lizards endemic to the Galápagos archipelago, but little information exists on their normal health parameters. The former is restricted to Santa Fe island, while C. subcristatus inhabits the islands of the central and western region of the archipelago. Both species are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. As part of a population health assessment authorized by the Galápagos National Park, wild adult iguanas from three islands (North Seymour, South Plazas, and Santa Fe) were captured in July 2018. Data from a single C. subcristatus X Amblyrhynchus cristatus hybrid captured on South Plazas is also included. We analyzed blood samples drawn from 52 healthy wild adult land iguanas captured on three islands. An iSTAT portable blood analyzer was used to obtain values for pH, lactate, pO2, pCO2, HCO3-, sO2%, hematocrit, packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin Na, K, iCa, and glucose. Standard laboratory hematology techniques were employed for PCV determination; resulting values were also compared to the hematocrit values generated by the iSTAT. Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body measurements were also recorded and compared to previously published data for the marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), which shares a common ancestor with the land iguana. The data reported here provide preliminary baseline values that may be useful in comparisons between captive and wild populations, between wild populations, and in detecting changes in health status among Galápagos land iguanas affected by anthropogenic threats, climate change, or natural disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2980735747,"PlGoxA from Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea is a glycine oxidase that utilizes a protein-derived cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ) cofactor. A notable feature of its catalytic mechanism is that it forms a stable product-reduced CTQ adduct that is not hydrolyzed in the absence of O2. Asp-678 resides near the quinone moiety of PlGoxA, and an Asp is structurally conserved in this position in all tryptophylquinone enzymes. In those other enzymes, mutation of that Asp results in no or negligible CTQ formation. In this study, mutation of Asp-678 in PlGoxA did not abolish CTQ formation. This allowed, for the first time, studying the role of this residue in catalysis. D678A and D678N substitutions yielded enzyme variants with CTQ, which did not react with glycine, although glycine was present in the crystal structures in the active site. D678E PlGoxA was active but exhibited a much slower kcat. This mutation altered the kinetic mechanism of the reductive half-reaction such that one could observe a previously undetected reactive intermediate, an initial substrate-oxidized CTQ adduct, which converted to the product-reduced CTQ adduct. These results indicate that Asp-678 is involved in the initial deprotonation of the amino group of glycine, enabling nucleophilic attack of CTQ, as well as the deprotonation of the substrate-oxidized CTQ adduct, which is coupled to CTQ reduction. The structures also suggest that Asp-678 is acting as a proton relay that directs these protons to a water channel that connects the active sites on the subunits of this homotetrameric enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2981044482,"The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of acute cocaine injection or dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gamma oscillations and their relationship to short term neuroadaptation that may mediate addiction. For this purpose, optogenetically evoked local field potentials (LFPs) in response to a brief 10 ms laser light pulse were recorded from 17 mice. D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390 or D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride, or both, were administered either before or after cocaine. A Euclidian distance-based dendrogram classifier separated the 100 trials for each animal in disjoint clusters. When baseline and DA receptor antagonists trials were combined in a single trial, a minimum of 20% overlap occurred in some dendrogram clusters, which suggests a possible common, invariant, dynamic mechanism shared by both baseline and DA receptor antagonists data. The delay-embedding method of neural activity reconstruction was performed using the correlation time and mutual information to determine the lag/correlation time of LFPs and false nearest neighbors to determine the embedding dimension. We found that DA receptor antagonists applied before cocaine cancels out the effect of cocaine and leaves the lag time distributions at baseline values. On the other hand, cocaine applied after DA receptor antagonists shifts the lag time distributions to longer durations, i.e. increase the correlation time of LFPs. Fourier analysis showed that a reasonable accurate decomposition of the LFP data can be obtained with a relatively small (less than ten) Fourier coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W2980945530,"General surgical operations on patients with cirrhosis have historically been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This study examines a contemporary series of patients with cirrhosis undergoing general surgical procedures.A retrospective evaluation of 358 cirrhotic patients undergoing general surgical operations at a single institution between 2004-2015 was performed. Thirty- and 90-day mortality along with complications and subsequent transplantation rates were examined.358 cirrhotic patients were identified. The majority were Child-Turcotte-Pugh class (CTP) A (55.9%) followed by class B (32.4%) and class C (11.7%). Mean MELD score differed significantly between the groups (8.7 vs. 12.1 vs. 20.1; p<0.001). The most common operations were herniorrhaphy (29.9%), cholecystectomy (19.3%), and liver resection (14.5%). The majority of cases were performed semi-electively (68.4%), however, within the CTP C patients most cases were performed emergently (73.8%). Thirty and 90-day mortality for all patients were 5% and 6%, respectively. Mortality rates increased from CTP A to CTP C (30 day: 3.0% vs. 5.2% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.01; 90 day: 4.5% vs. 6.9% vs. 16.7%; p = 0.016). Additionally, 30-day mortality (12.8% vs. 2.3%; p<0.001), 90 day mortality (16.0% vs. 3.4%; p<0.001) were higher for emergent compared to elective cases. A total of 13 (3.6%) patients underwent transplantation ≤ 90 days from surgery. No elective cases resulted in an urgent transplantation.Performing general surgical operations on cirrhotic patients carries a significant morbidity and mortality. This contemporary series from a specialized liver center demonstrates improved outcomes compared to historical series. These data strongly support early referral of cirrhotic patients needing general surgical operation to centers with liver expertise to minimize morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2981141902,"Guertu virus (GTV) is a tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) which belongs to the genus Banyangvirus in the family of Phenuiviridae. In vitro and in vivo studies of GTV demonstrated that it was able to infect animal and human cell lines and could cause pathological lesions in mice. Glycoproteins (GP, including Gn and Gc) on the surface of Guertu virus (GTV) could bind to receptors on host cells and induce protective immunity in the host, but knowledge is now lacking on the information of B cell epitopes (BCEs) present on GTV-GP protein. The aim of this study was to identify all BCEs on Gn of the GTV DXM strain using rabbit pAbs against GTV-Gn. Seven fine BCEs and two antigenic peptides (APs) from nine reactive 16mer-peptides were identified, which are EGn1 (2PIICEGLTHS11), EGn2 (135CSQDSGT141), EGn3 (165IP EDVF170), EGn4 (169VFQEL K174), EGn5 (187IDGILFN193), EGn6 (223QTKWIQ228), EGn7 (237CHKDGIGPC245), AP-8 (299GVRVRPKCYGFSRMMA314) and AP-9 (355CASH FCSSAESGKKNT370), of which six of mapped BCEs were recognized by the IgG-positive sheep serum obtained from sheep GTV-infected naturally. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) based on each mapped BCE motif identified that the most of identified BCEs and APs are highly conserved among 10 SFTSV strains from different countries and lineages that share relatively close evolutionary relationships with GTV. The fine epitope mapping of the GTV-Gn would provide basic data with which to explore the GTV-Gn antigen structure and pathogenic mechanisms, and it could lay the foundation for the design and development of a GTV multi-epitope peptide vaccine and detection antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2980675893,"cAMP acts as a second messenger in many cellular processes. Three protein types mainly mediate cAMP-induced effects: PKA, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), and cyclic nucleotide–modulated channels (cyclic nucleotide–gated or hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide–modulated (HCN) channels). Discrimination among these cAMP signaling pathways requires specific targeting of only one protein. Previously, cAMP modifications at position N6 of the adenine ring (PKA) and position 2′-OH of the ribose (Epac) have been used to produce target-selective compounds. However, cyclic nucleotide–modulated ion channels were usually outside of the scope of these previous studies. These channels are widely distributed, so possible channel cross-activation by PKA- or Epac-selective agonists warrants serious consideration. Here we demonstrate the agonistic effects of three PKA-selective cAMP derivatives, N6-phenyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (N6-Phe-cAMP), N6-benzyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (N6-Bn-cAMP), and N6-benzoyl-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (N6-Bnz-cAMP), on murine HCN2 pacemaker channels. Electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes revealed that these derivatives differ in apparent affinities depending on the modification type but that their efficacy and effects on HCN2 activation kinetics are similar to those of cAMP. Docking experiments suggested a pivotal role of Arg-635 at the entrance of the binding pocket in HCN2, either causing stabilizing cation–π interactions with the aromatic ring in N6-Phe-cAMP or N6-Bn-cAMP or a steric clash with the aromatic ring in N6-Bnz-cAMP. A reduced apparent affinity of N6-Phe-cAMP toward the variants R635A and R635E strengthened that notion. We conclude that some PKA activators also effectively activate HCN2 channels. Hence, when studying PKA-mediated cAMP signaling with cAMP derivatives in a native environment, activation of HCN channels should be considered."
