https://openalex.org/W1829589101,"Despite being surrounded by diverse nutrients, mammalian cells preferentially metabolize glucose and free amino acids. Recently, Ras-induced macropinocytosis of extracellular proteins was shown to reduce a transformed cell's dependence on extracellular glutamine. Here, we demonstrate that protein macropinocytosis can also serve as an essential amino acid source. Lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins can sustain cell survival and induce activation of mTORC1 but fails to elicit significant cell accumulation. Unlike its growth-promoting activity under amino-acid-replete conditions, we discovered that mTORC1 activation suppresses proliferation when cells rely on extracellular proteins as an amino acid source. Inhibiting mTORC1 results in increased catabolism of endocytosed proteins and enhances cell proliferation during nutrient-depleted conditions in vitro and within vascularly compromised tumors in vivo. Thus, by preventing nutritional consumption of extracellular proteins, mTORC1 couples growth to availability of free amino acids. These results may have important implications for the use of mTOR inhibitors as therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1575194766,"Deciphering the neural mechanisms of social behavior has propelled the growth of social neuroscience. The exact computations of the social brain, however, remain elusive. Here we investigated how the human brain tracks ongoing changes in social relationships using functional neuroimaging. Participants were lead characters in a role-playing game in which they were to find a new home and a job through interactions with virtual cartoon characters. We found that a two-dimensional geometric model of social relationships, a ""social space"" framed by power and affiliation, predicted hippocampal activity. Moreover, participants who reported better social skills showed stronger covariance between hippocampal activity and ""movement"" through ""social space."" The results suggest that the hippocampus is crucial for social cognition, and imply that beyond framing physical locations, the hippocampus computes a more general, inclusive, abstract, and multidimensional cognitive map consistent with its role in episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W1654207600,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior. Although a variety of task-related signals have been observed in the PFC, whether they are differentially encoded by various cell types remains unclear. Here we performed cellular-resolution microendoscopic Ca(2+) imaging from genetically defined cell types in the dorsomedial PFC of mice performing a PFC-dependent sensory discrimination task. We found that inhibitory interneurons of the same subtype were similar to each other, but different subtypes preferentially signaled different task-related events: somatostatin-positive neurons primarily signaled motor action (licking), vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive neurons responded strongly to action outcomes, whereas parvalbumin-positive neurons were less selective, responding to sensory cues, motor action, and trial outcomes. Compared to each interneuron subtype, pyramidal neurons showed much greater functional heterogeneity, and their responses varied across cortical layers. Such cell-type and laminar differences in neuronal functional properties may be crucial for local computation within the PFC microcircuit."
https://openalex.org/W1579352208,"Turnover and exchange of nucleosomal histones and their variants, a process long believed to be static in post-replicative cells, remains largely unexplored in brain. Here, we describe a novel mechanistic role for HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) and proteasomal degradation-associated histone dynamics in the regulation of activity-dependent transcription, synaptic connectivity, and behavior. We uncover a dramatic developmental profile of nucleosome occupancy across the lifespan of both rodents and humans, with the histone variant H3.3 accumulating to near-saturating levels throughout the neuronal genome by mid-adolescence. Despite such accumulation, H3.3-containing nucleosomes remain highly dynamic-in a modification-independent manner-to control neuronal- and glial-specific gene expression patterns throughout life. Manipulating H3.3 dynamics in both embryonic and adult neurons confirmed its essential role in neuronal plasticity and cognition. Our findings establish histone turnover as a critical and previously undocumented regulator of cell type-specific transcription and plasticity in mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1573279341,"The large (L) proteins of non-segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, a group that includes Ebola and rabies viruses, catalyze RNA-dependent RNA polymerization with viral ribonucleoprotein as template, a non-canonical sequence of capping and methylation reactions, and polyadenylation of viral messages. We have determined by electron cryomicroscopy the structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L protein. The density map, at a resolution of 3.8 Å, has led to an atomic model for nearly all of the 2109-residue polypeptide chain, which comprises three enzymatic domains (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp], polyribonucleotidyl transferase [PRNTase], and methyltransferase) and two structural domains. The RdRp resembles the corresponding enzymatic regions of dsRNA virus polymerases and influenza virus polymerase. A loop from the PRNTase (capping) domain projects into the catalytic site of the RdRp, where it appears to have the role of a priming loop and to couple product elongation to large-scale conformational changes in L."
https://openalex.org/W1682697190,"Argonaute proteins play a central role in mediating post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). Argonautes use the nucleotide sequences in miRNAs as guides for identifying target messenger RNAs for repression. Here, we used single-molecule FRET to directly visualize how human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) searches for and identifies target sites in RNAs complementary to its miRNA guide. Our results suggest that Ago2 initially scans for target sites with complementarity to nucleotides 2-4 of the miRNA. This initial transient interaction propagates into a stable association when target complementarity extends to nucleotides 2-8. This stepwise recognition process is coupled to lateral diffusion of Ago2 along the target RNA, which promotes the target search by enhancing the retention of Ago2 on the RNA. The combined results reveal the mechanisms that Argonaute likely uses to efficiently identify miRNA target sites within the vast and dynamic agglomeration of RNA molecules in the living cell."
https://openalex.org/W1526796115,"Stimuli that possess inherently rewarding or aversive qualities elicit emotional responses and also induce learning by imparting valence upon neutral sensory cues. Evidence has accumulated implicating the amygdala as a critical structure in mediating these processes. We have developed a genetic strategy to identify the representations of rewarding and aversive unconditioned stimuli (USs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have examined their role in innate and learned responses. Activation of an ensemble of US-responsive cells in the BLA elicits innate physiological and behavioral responses of different valence. Activation of this US ensemble can also reinforce appetitive and aversive learning when paired with differing neutral stimuli. Moreover, we establish that the activation of US-responsive cells in the BLA is necessary for the expression of a conditioned response. Neural representations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli therefore ultimately connect to US-responsive cells in the BLA to elicit both innate and learned responses."
https://openalex.org/W1547768454,"Protective vaccines elicit high-affinity, neutralizing antibodies by selection of somatically hypermutated B cell antigen receptors (BCR) on immune complexes (ICs). This implicates Fc-Fc receptor (FcR) interactions in affinity maturation, which, in turn, are determined by IgG subclass and Fc glycan composition within ICs. Trivalent influenza virus vaccination elicited regulation of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) IgG subclass and Fc glycans, with abundance of sialylated Fc glycans (sFc) predicting quality of vaccine response. We show that sFcs drive BCR affinity selection by binding the Type-II FcR CD23, thus upregulating the inhibitory FcγRIIB on activated B cells. This elevates the threshold requirement for BCR signaling, resulting in B cell selection for higher affinity BCR. Immunization with sFc HA ICs elicited protective, high-affinity IgGs against the conserved stalk of the HA. These results reveal a novel, endogenous pathway for affinity maturation that can be exploited for eliciting high-affinity, broadly neutralizing antibodies through immunization with sialylated immune complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1506170988,"Histidine phosphorylation (pHis) is well studied in bacteria; however, its role in mammalian signaling remains largely unexplored due to the lack of pHis-specific antibodies and the lability of the phosphoramidate (P-N) bond. Both imidazole nitrogens can be phosphorylated, forming 1-phosphohistidine (1-pHis) or 3-phosphohistidine (3-pHis). We have developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize 1-pHis or 3-pHis; they do not cross-react with phosphotyrosine or the other pHis isomer. Assays based on the isomer-specific autophosphorylation of NME1 and phosphoglycerate mutase were used with immunoblotting and sequencing IgG variable domains to screen, select, and characterize anti-1-pHis and anti-3-pHis mAbs. Their sequence independence was determined by blotting synthetic peptide arrays, and they have been tested for immunofluorescence staining and immunoaffinity purification, leading to putative identification of pHis-containing proteins. These reagents should be broadly useful for identification of pHis substrates and functional study of pHis using a variety of immunological, proteomic, and biological assays."
https://openalex.org/W1590835214,"Odors elicit distributed activation of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB). Crosstalk between co-active glomeruli has been proposed to perform a variety of computations, facilitating efficient extraction of sensory information by the cortex. Dopaminergic/GABAergic cells in the OB, which can be identified by their expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT), provide the earliest opportunity for such crosstalk. Here we show in mice that DAT+ cells carry concentration-dependent odor signals and broadcast focal glomerular inputs throughout the OB to cause suppression of mitral/tufted (M/T) cell firing, an effect that is mediated by the external tufted (ET) cells coupled to DAT+ cells via chemical and electrical synapses. We find that DAT+ cells implement gain control and decorrelate odor representations in the M/T cell population. Our results further indicate that ET cells are gatekeepers of glomerular output and prime determinants of M/T responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1496067884,"Precise temporal control of gene expression or deletion is critical for elucidating gene function in biological systems. However, the establishment of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines with inducible gene knockout (iKO) remains challenging. We explored building iKO hPSC lines by combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing with the Flp/FRT and Cre/LoxP system. We found that ""dual-sgRNA targeting"" is essential for biallelic knockin of FRT sequences to flank the exon. We further developed a strategy to simultaneously insert an activity-controllable recombinase-expressing cassette and remove the drug-resistance gene, thus speeding up the generation of iKO hPSC lines. This two-step strategy was used to establish human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with iKO of SOX2, PAX6, OTX2, and AGO2, genes that exhibit diverse structural layout and temporal expression patterns. The availability of iKO hPSC lines will substantially transform the way we examine gene function in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1890667195,"Macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine with chemokine-like functions and is a mediator in numerous inflammatory conditions. Depending on the context, MIF signals through 1 or more of its receptors cluster of differentiation (CD)74, CXC-motif chemokine receptor (CXCR)2, and CXCR4. In addition, heteromeric receptor complexes have been identified. We characterized the atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 as a novel receptor for MIF. MIF promoted human CXCR7 internalization up to 40%, peaking at 50-400 nM and 30 min, but CXCR7 internalization by MIF was not dependent on CXCR4. Yet, by coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence microscopy, and a proximity ligation assay, CXCR7 was found to engage in MIF receptor complexes with CXCR4 and CD74, both after ectopic overexpression and in endogenous conditions in a human B-cell line. Receptor competition binding and coimmunoprecipitation studies combined with sulfo-SBED-biotin-transfer provided evidence for a direct interaction between MIF and CXCR7. Finally, we demonstrated MIF/CXCR7-mediated functional responses. Blockade of CXCR7 suppressed MIF-mediated ERK- and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP)-70 activation (from 2.1- to 1.2-fold and from 2.5- to 1.6-fold, respectively) and fully abrogated primary murine B-cell chemotaxis triggered by MIF, but not by CXCL12. B cells from Cxcr7(-/-) mice exhibited an ablated transmigration response to MIF, indicating that CXCR7 is essential for MIF-promoted B-cell migration. Our findings provide biochemical and functional evidence that MIF is an alternative ligand of CXCR7 and suggest a functional role of the MIF-CXCR7 axis in B-lymphocyte migration."

We recorded the activity of MTL neurons in neurosurgical patients while they learned new associations. Pairs of unrelated pictures, one of a person and another of a place, were used to construct a meaningful association modeling the episodic memory of meeting a person in a particular place. We found that a large proportion of responsive MTL neurons expanded their selectivity to encode these specific associations within a few trials: cells initially responsive to one picture started firing to the associated one but not to others.

In spite of the major significance of these works in advancing our understanding of episodic memory, their contribution has been limited. On the one hand, human studies have not addressed episodic memory formation at the single neuron level. Animal studies, on the other hand, have relied on extensive reward-driven training with numerous repetitions of non-natural stimuli, thus offering a limited account on how single exposures to natural stimuli can give rise to the rapid encoding of new episodic memories. Neurons in the human MTL have been found to respond to concepts that are related to each other (Quian Quiroga, 2012Quian Quiroga R. Concept cells: the building blocks of declarative memory functions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 587-597PubMed Google Scholar, Quian Quiroga et al., 2005Quian Quiroga R. Reddy L. Kreiman G. Koch C.

Human medial temporal lobe neurons respond preferentially to personally relevant images.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21329-21334Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we designed a paradigm to study how fast these associations can be created and whether this speed is compatible with basic mechanisms of episodic memory creation. We postulate that associations can be formed by partially overlapping cell assemblies encoding related concepts (Quian Quiroga, 2012Quian Quiroga R. Concept cells: the building blocks of declarative memory functions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 587-597PubMed Google Scholar) and show experimental evidence of rapid changes of single-cell responses while contextual associations are learned. As detailed below, in order to gain such evidence, we combined the ability to analyze trial-by-trial changes in the robust firing of highly selective MTL neurons (Quian Quiroga et al., 2005Quian Quiroga R.

Patients first participated in a “screening session” (Quian Quiroga et al., 2005Quian Quiroga R. Reddy L. Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain.Nature. 2005; 435: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) in which a large number of images of people, animals, and places were presented to find out which (if any) of the recorded neurons responded to a picture. Data processing (spike detection, sorting, and identification of responsive cells) was done quickly (typically within 1 hr) and 3 to 8 (median 7) pairs of pictures were selected. Each pair consisted of a picture of a person (or animal) and a picture of a landmark, for which there was a neuron firing to one of them (the preferred “P” stimulus) and not to the other one (the non-preferred “NP” stimulus). For each pair, we created contextual “composite” images, in which each individual was digitally extracted from the original picture and placed in front of the landmark, mimicking a real photo of seeing the individual at that landmark (Figure 1). Using presentations of the single and composite images of each pair, we evaluated changes in neural activity while subjects performed five consecutive tasks (Figure 1). First, to get an estimation of the pre-learning firing to each picture, in Task 1, the screening was repeated showing each of the single pictures for 1 s 6 times in pseudorandom order, and patients were asked to indicate whether the picture contained a human face or not. Then, a block of “learning and evaluation trials” (median of 15 trials) comprising interleaved tasks 2 and 3 were shown. In Task 2, the composite images (each of them being a specific person in a specific place) were presented in pseudorandom order, which were then followed by the presentation of the single pictures, also in pseudorandom order. The instructions were the same as in Task 1 (i.e., indicate presence of a human face). After each run of Task 2, the learning of associations was tested in Task 3 (the patient was presented each face at a time and had to select the landmark corresponding to it). After Task 2 and Task 3, in Task 4 the patient was presented 6 times each landmark in pseudorandom order and had to name the person that was there. Finally, in Task 5 (“re-screening”) all single pictures were presented again in pseudorandom order, to compare with Task 1 (before learning). Typically, the entire experiment lasted between 25 to 30 min. In 14 patients, who participated in 25 experimental sessions (and only 22 for Task 5), we recorded the activity of multiple single neurons using electrodes implanted in the MTL for clinical reasons. Figure 2 shows a neuron in the hippocampus that responded strongly to the picture of a member of the patient’s family (with a mean firing rate of 13.1 spikes/s, SD = 3.9, median = 12.5) but not to the Eiffel tower (3.6 spikes/s on average, SD = 3.4, median = 3.3. The firing to the Eiffel tower during the response period did not differ significantly from the one during baseline (3.9 spikes/s on average, SD = 2.0, median = 4.2), according to a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p = 0.84, W = 40.5, n1 = n2 = 6). With our experimental design, we aimed to establish whether MTL neurons will widen their tuning to encode the formed association by selectively increasing their firing to the associated stimulus. After a single exposure of the composite picture, the subject learned the association (i.e., family member at the Eiffel tower) and the firing rate in response to the Eiffel tower increased to 7.6 spikes/s on average (SD = 5.1, median = 8.3), a 230% increase compared to the presentations of the Eiffel Tower before learning took place (Task 1). This difference was significant (p = 0.002, W = 563, n1 = n2 = 27, Wilcoxon rank-sum test between baseline and response periods, see Experimental Procedures). In contrast, the response to the preferred stimulus (family member) did not change significantly after learning the association (9.4 spikes/s, SD = 4.5, median = 10.8) and it was similar to the response to the composite image of “family member at the Eiffel tower” (7.8 spikes/s, median = 8.3; p = 0.96, W = 325, n1 = 27, n2 = 15, Wilcoxon rank-sum between the response to the Eiffel tower and the composite image). In order to verify that the increase in firing after learning was specific to the associated stimulus pair (NP) and not common to other stimuli used in the experiment, for example, due to an increase in familiarity, we also examined the response to the other stimuli. For each neuron X with a preferred stimulus Px and a non-preferred stimulus NPx, we defined the non-associated (NA) stimuli for neuron X to be all the other pictures used in the association experiment corresponding to the same category of the NPx stimulus (person or landmark). The bottom-right plot of Figure 2 shows the average response to all the NA stimuli, which decreased from a mean of 5.3 spikes/s (SD = 5.6) to 3.8 spikes/s (SD = 4.9) after learning. For some other units, the association was established the other way around, i.e., a neuron initially responding to a landmark changed its firing to the associated person after learning. Figure 3 shows a multi-unit in the parahippocampal cortex that, in Task 1 (before learning), originally fired to an image of the White House (mean = 17.8 spikes/s, SD = 7.2, median = 15) and not to American beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh (mean = 5.0 spikes/s, SD = 3.6, median = 3.3). After the patient learned the association between these two concepts (trial 1 in Task 2, see Experimental Procedures for learning criterion), there was an increase in the firing of the neuron to the picture of Kerri Walsh (mean = 13.8 spikes/s, SD = 9.2, median = 14.2), which was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test between baseline and response periods). This increase in the neuron’s response to Kerry Walsh (NP stimulus) after learning was observed in all tasks: a mean of 12.9 spikes/s in Task 2 (post-learning trials only), 16.7 spikes/s in Task 3, and 9.4 spikes/s in Task 5. The response to the preferred stimulus (the White House) increased slightly after learning to 25.6 spikes/s (SD = 8.9), but this difference was not significant (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additional examples are shown in Figure S1 and Movie S1. We recorded from a total of 613 units (438 multi-units and 175 single units) from the hippocampus (138 units), entorhinal cortex (117 units), amygdala (194 units), and parahippocampal cortex (164 units). We first identified visually responsive units, defined as those that, before learning, showed a significant difference in the response to at least one stimulus using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between baseline and response (see Experimental Procedures). Altogether, we found 51 visually responsive units (31 single units and 20 multi-units) that significantly increased their firing rate in response to the preferred stimulus (P), with P being one individual (27 units) or landmark (24 units). Figure 4 shows the population results for all visually responsive units. Figure 4A shows the increase in response strength (comparing before and after learning) for each of the 51 visually responsive units and for all stimuli. The population averages are shown at the bottom of Figure 4A for all types of stimuli, where we observe a larger increase in firing after learning for the NP compared to the other stimuli. The change in firing rate after learning (see “Visually Responsive Units” in Experimental Procedures) was significantly different for the different stimuli according to a one-way ANOVA F(11,492) = 3.15, MSE = 0.46, p = 0.0001 (n = 42 cells with at least 12 stimuli—9 units that corresponded to sessions where less than 12 stimuli were presented were excluded from this analysis to avoid unbalanced data). This significant difference was largely due to the change in the NP stimuli and not any other non-associated stimulus. In fact, the difference was still significant when excluding the P stimuli (p = 0.01) but not when also excluding the NP stimuli (p = 0.76). Moreover, the only two stimuli that showed a median significantly different from zero were the preferred stimulus (decrease, p = 0.001; see below for interpretation in terms of repetition suppression) and the NP stimulus (increase, p = 0.005). Furthermore, paired t tests showed that the increases in the NP responses were significantly larger than the ones to any other stimulus (all p values between 0.0008 and 0.03). To further validate these results, we performed a permutation test, adjusted for multiple comparisons, by shuffling the labels of the stimuli and taking as test statistic the smallest difference between the activity to the NP stimulus and the one to any other stimuli. We ran 5,000 permutations and found the p value of the NP stimulus to be statistically significant (p = 0.012, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Of all the 613 units that we recorded from, 51 were visually responsive and 562 were non-responsive (i.e., did not have a significant response compared to baseline before learning). Of the 562 non-responsive units, 12 (2.1%) exhibited a significant increase to at least one image (mean = 4.1 images, SD = 1.5) after learning took place, according to a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the baseline and response periods. This number is within what could be expected by chance (n = 28) with a false positive rate of 0.05. Only three of the non-responsive units had a change in response to an association pair (P and NP) that was larger than the one to the other pictures (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05). To further quantify the responses of all visually responsive neurons (to all of the presented stimuli), we calculated a pair-coding index (PCI), a correlation coefficient for each neuron between the mean response to each stimulus and its paired associate (as defined in Higuchi and Miyashita, 1996Higuchi S. Miyashita Y. Formation of mnemonic neuronal responses to visual paired associates in inferotemporal cortex is impaired by perirhinal and entorhinal lesions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This statistic has been used to assess how neurons acquire stimulus selectivity through associative learning and is expected to approach zero for a large number of neurons firing with a pattern independent of the stimulus pairs (Naya et al., 2003Naya Y. Yoshida M. Miyashita Y. Forward processing of long-term associative memory in monkey inferotemporal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2861-2871PubMed Google Scholar). Across the population of visually responsive units, we found that the pair-coding indices after learning (median = 0.35) were significantly higher (median = −0.03, D = 0.36, n1 = n2 = 42, p = 0.007, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, see Figure 4B), thus showing the formation of an association between the P and NP stimulus pairs. To assess the changes that occurred in different tasks, we calculated, for the whole population of visually responsive units, an average differential activity index DAI = (Pr − NPr / Pr + NPr), where Pr, NPr denote the mean activity in the response interval (see Experimental Procedures). The DAI is expected to be positive, since Pr > NPr, and it quantifies the difference in the response to the preferred and non-preferred stimuli. As expected, the largest DAI values were obtained for Task 1 (Figure 4C) before learning took place, indicating a large difference in the response to the P and the NP stimuli. For the following tasks, DAI values were significantly smaller (p < 0.001, see Experimental Procedures). To study the time course of the responses, we separated the normalized population response for all visually responsive neurons according to the type of stimuli (P, NP, and NA) and condition (before and after learning). After learning (Figure 4D), we found a 172% increase in the response strength to the NP stimuli compared to the pre-learning value. This increase was statistically significant (p = 0.05, n = 51, Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the mean response before versus after learning). In contrast, the mean response to the preferred stimuli decreased to 87% of its pre-learning value (p = 0.3, n = 51, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), while the mean response to the non-associated stimuli did almost not change (101% of the pre-learning value, p = 0.9, n = 51, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Given these population results, we next evaluated how many of the visually responsive neurons encoded the enforced associations. For this, we defined “pair-coding neurons” as the ones that: (1) showed a significant response to the NP stimulus after learning, using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing baseline and response periods (with p < 0.05), and (2) the distribution of increases of single-trial responses to the NP stimulus after learning was larger than the distribution of increases of single-trial responses to all the other pictures (excluding P) after learning (see “Pair-Coding Units” under Experimental Procedures). Of the 51 visually responsive units, 21 (41%) were “pair-coding neurons” and selectively increased their response to the NP stimuli after learning. As expected by construction—since based on the screening sessions we chose the NP stimuli to be one that the neuron originally did not fire to—these units showed no significant response to the NP stimuli before learning took place (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The number of neurons encoding the association (pair-coding neurons, n = 21/51) far exceeded the number expected by chance (p < 10−13), according to a binomial test with a chance level of 0.05 (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We also verified that the observed distribution of p values was significantly lower than the one generated by neurons with a Poisson firing probability and the same mean firing rates as the responsive units (p < 0.004; see “Proportion of Pair-Coding Units” under Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In what follows, we concentrate on the 21 neurons that encoded the associations. Among the 21 pair-coding units, 14 (67%) originally fired to a person and started firing to the associated landmark after learning (like the one shown in Figure 2). In the remaining 7/21 cases, the association was established the other way around, i.e., the neuron originally responding to a landmark, changed its firing to the associated individual after learning (like the one shown in Figure 3). Across the population of pair-coding neurons, the responses to the non-preferred stimuli showed an average increase of 281% (from 1.44 ± 0.22 to 4.06 ± 0 0.38, mean ± SEM) after learning, which was statistically significant (p < 10−5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the mean response before versus after learning) (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained when considering only single units (n = 11). In this case, there was a significant increase of 412% in the response to the NP stimuli after learning (p = 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In line with the results for all visually responsive units (Figure 4C), the responses to the P (Figure 5A) and NA (Figure 5C) stimuli did not change significantly after learning (88% of the pre-learning value, p = 0.65 for the P stimulus and 134% of the pre-learning value, p = 0.27 for the NA stimuli). In order to compare on a trial-by-trial basis the neural and behavioral changes, we calculated the neuronal learning curves by rescaling the activity across the population of neurons encoding the association for all trials in all tasks to the range 0–1 (see Experimental Procedures). A direct comparison between the behavioral and neural learning curves exhibited a significant positive correlation for the non-preferred stimulus (r = 0.25, p < 10−11, Pearson’s correlation coefficient r), due to the increase in firing after learning the associations. There was a non-significant correlation for the non-associated stimuli (r = 0.05, p = 0.2) and also a negative correlation for the preferred stimulus (r = −0.08, p = 0.03), consistent with the decrease in firing to the preferred stimulus reported in Figure 4A, which is likely due to repetition suppression in line to a previous work without an association paradigm (Pedreira et al., 2010Pedreira C. Mormann F. Kraskov A. Cerf M. Fried I. Koch C. Quiroga R.Q. Responses of human medial temporal lobe neurons are modulated by stimulus repetition.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether this behavior is due to repetition suppression, or whether it also reflects the formation of associations, we compared the decreases found in pair-coding units with the ones found in the other visually responsive units. For this, for each visually responsive unit, we calculated the percentage change as 100∗(Ppost − Ppre)/Ppre, where Ppost and Ppre indicate the mean activity in the response window. Both populations of pair-coding and non-pair-coding units exhibited similar trends, with a mean percentage decrease of −7% (SD = 40, median = −15%) for the pair-coding units and −11% (SD = 33, median = −20%) for the non-pair-coding units. The median of both populations did not differ significantly (p = 0.64, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and the median of both populations differed significantly from zero (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02 for pair-coding and non-pair-coding, respectively), thus the decreases for the P stimuli seem to reflect repetition suppression rather than an encoding of the association. Given the variability on the number of trials that subjects needed to learn each association pair, to further evaluate how tightly correlated were the observed firing changes to the actual learning of the associations, we realigned the response of each cell to the learning time and compared these neural responses to the ones obtained as a function of the actual trial number in the experimental session. For this, we fitted logistic functions to the average behavioral and neural learning curves to the non-preferred stimulus for both alignments (absolute trials and relative to learning time; see Experimental Procedures for details). In Figure 5D, we first observe that aligning to learning time gives a more accurate matching between the behavioral and the neural learning curves. In fact, for data aligned to learning there were no significant differences between behavioral and scaled neural data (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.59). Additionally, the fits were more accurate for data aligned to learning time, as quantified by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974Akaike H. A new look at the statistical model identification.IEEE Trans. Auto. Contr. 1974; 19: 716-723Crossref Scopus (35875) Google Scholar)—data relative to learning: AICBeh = 142; AICNeu = 298; data not aligned: AICBeh = 175; AICNeu = 325, where smaller values denote higher accuracy. The same logistic model did not fit the data for the preferred and non-associated stimuli as accurately as it did with the non-preferred stimuli (Figure S2). Moreover, both for the P and NA, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was larger for the unaligned (R2 = 0.73/0.04 for P/NA stimuli) than for the learning-aligned data (R2 = 0.46/0.03). When the NP data were aligned to learning time, there was a large increase in the slope of the behavior curve: βBeh = 4.6 after re-alignment, compared to βBeh = 4.2 for the unaligned data. But the interesting fact was that this change in the behavioral learning curve was accompanied by an abrupt increase in firing to the non-preferred stimuli, when re-aligning the neural data to the learning time: βNeu = 3.1 aligned to learning, compared to βNeu = 1.6 without alignment. The slope difference (with and without alignment to learning) was significant, according to a non-parametric bootstrap test (p < 0.05; see Figure S3 and Experimental Procedures for details). Next, to rule out that changes in neuronal responses were just driven by one of the specific tasks we used (as each task varied in complexity and attentional demand) and not by the formation of new associations, we used the differential activity index DAI introduced before for the population of visually responsive units. Altogether, after learning there was a decrease of DAI values by a factor of 5.5 on average (range: 4.2–6.7). Moreover, differences between the tasks after learning were not significant, thus suggesting that these neuronal changes were not task dependent. Supporting this view, a direct comparison of the response to the non-preferred stimuli in the two identical tasks (Task 1, pre-screening and Task 5, re-screening) showed significant differences (p = 0.001, Figure 5E), which can be attributed to the learning of the particular association. There was also an increase in the response during Task 5 when considering all visually responsive units but in this case the difference was not significant (p = 0.14). From a readout viewpoint, the learning of the associations should be accompanied by a decrease in the discriminability between the NP and the P stimulus, given that the neuron originally firing only to the P stimulus starts also firing to the NP after learning. This selective increase in firing to the NP stimuli should also lead to more discriminability between the NP and NA stimuli after learning. This is indeed what we observed using a linear classifier to decode the identity of the stimuli before and after learning (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). When considering the whole population of visually responsive units, the discrimination between P and NP stimuli went down from a 74% average performance before learning to 68% after learning. The decrease was significant according to a paired t test, t(100) = 1.95, p = 0.03. For pair-coding units, the discrimination between P and NP stimuli went down from a 72% average performance before learning to 56% after learning. Altogether, the dec"

One PPARγ motif-altering SNP is associated with HDL levels and other metabolic syndrome parameters. Thus, natural genetic variation in PPARγ genomic occupancy determines individual disease risk and drug response. A major unanswered question is how most genetic variation causes phenotypic differences, as only a small fraction of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect protein sequence (Shastry, 2002Shastry B.S. SNP alleles in human disease and evolution.J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveal a large gap between known causal genes and the observed heritability of common diseases and treatment outcomes (Sadee et al., 2014Sadee W. Hartmann K. Seweryn M. Pietrzak M. Handelman S.K. Rempala G.A. Missing heritability of common diseases and treatments outside the protein-coding exome.Hum. Genet. 2014; 133: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another limitation of GWAS is that each locus nominates a large group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, such that causal and neutral variants cannot easily be distinguished. Non-coding SNPs in regulatory regions may affect transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression, thus contributing to complex phenotypes like disease association and response to drugs (Edwards et al., 2013Edwards S.L. Beesley J. French J.D. Dunning A.M. Beyond GWASs: illuminating the dark road from association to function.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2013; 93: 779-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). There are examples of regulatory variants causing Mendelian syndromes (De Gobbi et al., 2006De Gobbi M. Viprakasit V. Hughes J.R. Fisher C. Buckle V.J. Ayyub H. Gibbons R.J. Vernimmen D.

Genet. 2012; 21: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but such SNPs may be more likely to associate with complex non-Mendelian diseases in GWAS (Sakabe et al., 2012Sakabe N.J. Savic D. Nobrega M.A. Transcriptional enhancers in development and disease.Genome Biol. 2012; 13: 238Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Overall, putative causal GWAS SNPs cluster more in promoters and enhancers than in exons (Andersson et al., 2014Andersson R. Gebhard C. Miguel-Escalada I. Hoof I. Bornholdt J. Boyd M. Chen Y. Zhao X. Schmidl C. Suzuki T. et al.FANTOM ConsortiumAn atlas of active enhancers across human cell types and tissues.Nature. 2014; 507: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), and a recent effort to computationally identify causal GWAS SNPs for autoimmune diseases found that ∼90% were non-coding, with ∼60% in distal immune cell enhancers (Farh et al., 2015Farh K.K.-H. Marson A. Zhu J. Kleinewietfeld M. Housley W.J. Beik S. Shoresh N. Whitton H. Ryan R.J.H. Shishkin A.A. et al.Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants.Nature. 2015; 518: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). A few specific examples have emerged. The causal SNP for an LDL cholesterol and myocardial infarction locus is a regulatory variant altering hepatic SORT1 expression (Musunuru et al., 2010Musunuru K. Strong A. Frank-Kamenetsky M. Lee N.E. Ahfeldt T. Sachs K.V. Li X. Li H. Kuperwasser N. Ruda V.M. et al.From noncoding variant to phenotype via SORT1 at the 1p13 cholesterol locus.Nature. 2010; 466: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Regulatory SNPs in distant enhancers for MYC result in associations with multiple cancers (Sur et al., 2013Sur I. Tuupanen S. Whitington T. Aaltonen L.A. Taipale J. Lessons from functional analysis of genome-wide association studies.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 4180-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and an intronic enhancer SNP in TCF7L2 may mediate type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (Gaulton et al., 2010Gaulton K.J. Nammo T. Pasquali L. Simon J.M. Giresi P.G. Fogarty M.P. Panhuis T.M. Mieczkowski P. Secchi A. Bosco D. et al.A map of open chromatin in human pancreatic islets.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For the PPARG T2D locus, the causal SNP was thought to be a coding Pro12Ala polymorphism, yet recent evidence has implicated a tightly linked regulatory SNP (Claussnitzer et al., 2014Claussnitzer M. Dankel S.N. Klocke B. Grallert H. Glunk V. Berulava T. Lee H. Oskolkov N. Fadista J. Ehlers K. et al.DIAGRAM+ConsortiumLeveraging cross-species transcription factor binding site patterns: from diabetes risk loci to disease mechanisms.Cell. 2014; 156: 343-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PPARγ provides an excellent system to study effects of regulatory variation on TF binding, gene expression, drug response, and phenotype. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor TF required for adipocyte development (Wang et al., 2013Wang F. Mullican S.E. DiSpirito J.R. Peed L.C. Lazar M.A. Lipoatrophy and severe metabolic disturbance in mice with fat-specific deletion of PPARγ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 18656-18661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) that activates many adipocyte genes. PPARγ is genetically implicated in metabolic disease, both through the common SNP associated with T2D (Altshuler et al., 2000Altshuler D. Hirschhorn J.N. Klannemark M. Lindgren C.M. Vohl M.C. Nemesh J. Lane C.R. Schaffner S.F. Bolk S. Brewer C. et al.The common PPARgamma Pro12Ala polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and also through rare ligand binding domain mutations, causing an autosomal dominant syndrome of lipodystrophic insulin resistance (Barroso et al., 1999Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. et al.Dominant negative mutations in human PPARgamma associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and hypertension.Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Since variants affecting the PPARγ TF itself have these consequences, then genetic variation in key PPARγ genomic binding sites may similarly have metabolic effects. PPARγ is also the target of anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs, which have a unique and powerful insulin-sensitizing effect, yet clinical use has declined due to concerns over side effects and adverse events (Soccio et al., 2014Soccio R.E. Chen E.R. Lazar M.A. Thiazolidinediones and the promise of insulin sensitization in type 2 diabetes.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 573-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Individuals differ in drug response, and ∼20%–30% of diabetic patients fail to respond to TZDs (Sears et al., 2009Sears D.D. Hsiao G. Hsiao A. Yu J.G. Courtney C.H. Ofrecio J.M. Chapman J. Subramaniam S. Mechanisms of human insulin resistance and thiazolidinedione-mediated insulin sensitization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18745-18750Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Most pharmacogenomic studies focus on coding or non-coding variants affecting the drug target itself or drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (Mizzi et al., 2014Mizzi C. Peters B. Mitropoulou C. Mitropoulos K. Katsila T. Agarwal M.R. van Schaik R.H.N. Drmanac R. Borg J. Patrinos G.P. Personalized pharmacogenomics profiling using whole-genome sequencing.Pharmacogenomics. 2014; 15: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, regulatory variants may potentially alter downstream transcriptional effects of drugs, either indirectly after signal transduction from a cell surface receptor or directly in the case of DNA-binding nuclear receptors like PPARγ. Here, we set out to determine whether non-coding regulatory variation could affect PPARγ genomic occupancy and whether such SNP-dependent binding could affect gene expression, drug response, and metabolic phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to define genetically determined variation in PPARγ sites genome wide in white adipose tissue (WAT). In mice, sites with inbred strain-selective PPARγ genomic occupancy were highly enriched for SNPs, and in heterozygous F1 mice, these SNPs had allelic imbalance in PPARγ binding. These SNPs often altered TF motifs—not only motifs for PPARγ, but also motifs for other, cooperating TFs. Importantly, some strain-selective binding sites were functional regulating nearby gene expression in WAT, both basal and TZD stimulated. Similar studies were performed in human WAT, in whom SNPs also led to imbalanced PPARγ binding. Remarkably, these human SNPs were enriched in WAT expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as well as in regions linked to metabolic disease in GWAS. Thus, variable PPARγ occupancy due to SNPs determines nearby gene activation by PPARγ and its ligands, and these effects may underlie genetic differences in metabolic phenotypes and drug responses. ChIP-seq was performed in WAT from two inbred mouse strains, C57Bl/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129), which differ in susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance (Almind and Kahn, 2004Almind K. Kahn C.R. Genetic determinants of energy expenditure and insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity in mice.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Since highly polymorphic 129 sequencing reads may not align to the B6 reference genome, the SNP-sensitive alignment tool GSNAP (Wu and Nacu, 2010Wu T.D. Nacu S. Fast and SNP-tolerant detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) was used to eliminate alignment bias and identify truly strain-selective binding (Figures S1A and S1B). Three independent ChiP-seq experiments were performed (Table S1), allowing identification of strain-selective sites at high confidence (3-fold strain difference in reads in at least two out of three experiments) and highest confidence (all three, Figure 1A). Average peak heights in F1 intercross progeny were intermediate between parents, while nonselective sites were equal in all three (Figure 1B), indicating that strain selectivity of adipose genomic PPARγ occupancy was genetically determined. Of note, while WAT PPARγ cistromes include contributions of other cell types that express PPARγ, such as resident macrophages, the great majority of sites overlapped with those in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but not with previously reported macrophage-selective sites (Lefterova et al., 2010Lefterova M.I.

(D) In F1 ChIP-seq, allelic imbalance was assayed in binding sites with SNPs (∗p < 0.0001 versus non-selective sites by Mann-Whitney test, two-tailed). See also Figure S1 and Table S1. The B6 and 129 genomes differ by ∼5.3 million SNPs (Keane et al., 2011Keane T.M. Goodstadt L. Danecek P. White M.A. Wong K. Yalcin B. Heger A. Agam A. Slater G. Goodson M. et al.Mouse genomic variation and its effect on phenotypes and gene regulation.Nature. 2011; 477: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), and strain-selective sites were highly enriched for occurrence of SNPs (Figure 1C). Notably, SNPs falling in B6- or 129-selective sites showed PPARγ binding allelic imbalance in F1 WAT favoring the allele with better parental binding, whereas SNPs in non-selective sites showed equal representation of both alleles (Figure 1D). F1 imbalance shows that cis-acting elements determine PPARγ occupancy, as selectivity is evident even when two alleles are in the same nucleus. To further validate cis-acting PPARγ site SNPs, ChIP-seq was performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cell line derived from outbred NIH Swiss albino mice (Todaro and Green, 1963Todaro G.J. Green H. Quantitative studies of the growth of mouse embryo cells in culture and their development into established lines.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar) and thus heterozygous at many loci. In these cells, PPARγ bound at ∼9,000 sites of B6:129 SNPs, and importantly, at least 18% were heterozygous (Figure S1C). At heterozygous sites where PPARγ binding was strain selective in B6 versus 129 WAT, the predicted allelic imbalance in binding was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure S1D). This is similar to F1 mice and confirms the powerful effect of cis-acting SNPs on PPARγ genomic binding. PPARγ binds DNA at direct repeat 1 (DR1) motifs both in vitro (Tontonoz et al., 1994Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. mPPAR gamma 2: tissue-specific regulator of an adipocyte enhancer.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Lefterova et al., 2008Lefterova M.I. Zhang Y. Steger D.J. Schupp M. Schug J. Cristancho A. Feng D. Zhuo D. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Liu X.S.

To test whether DR1-altering SNPs cause strain-selective binding, all polymorphic DR1 motifs in PPARγ binding regions were identified and assigned motif scores, such that the B6:129 score ratio indicated strain difference in consensus motif agreement. SNPs with large effects on PPARγ/DR1 motifs (ratio >16) were highly likely to show selective binding in the strain with the stronger motif and were unlikely to be selective for the opposite strain (Figure 2B). This discrimination was apparent even when SNPs had medium (8- to 16-fold) or small (2- to 8-fold) motif effects but effectively lost when SNPs had minimal effects (<2-fold). While this analysis used thresholds for motif effects and binding difference, the same pattern emerged in a quantitative scatterplot analysis correlating binding ratio versus motif ratio (Figure S2A). This approach relies on natural B6:129 genetic variation at PPARγ motifs but can be extended to other variants. For instance, 3T3-L1 PPARγ sites have 936 heterozygous SNPs that are non-polymorphic between B6 and 129, and when these SNPs altered PPARγ/DR1 motifs, there was the predicted allelic imbalance in PPARγ occupancy (Figure S2B).Figure S2PPARγ Binding Is Altered by SNPs Affecting Motifs for PPARγ or Other TFs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) 579 WAT PPARγ binding sites had DR1 motifs with B6:129 SNPs, and the strain difference in PPARγ binding (mean log2 fold change in three ChIP-seq experiments) was correlated with allelic difference in motif agreement (log2 motif score ratio, linear regression r2 = 0.29, and p < 0.0001 for a non-zero slope).

(H) Same graph for those motifs with B6:129 SNPs at more than one location in the same 16bp DR1 motif. Individual nucleotide substitutions at each position of the DR1 motif (Figure S2C) were interrogated for PPARγ occupancy effects. Overall, this strongly validated the motif ratio approach, though there were informative exceptions where SNPs at some locations had large occupancy effects despite apparently small motif effects (Figures S2D–S2F). This reinforces a key point about consensus ChIP-seq motifs: they reflect nucleotide frequencies at motifs actually bound by the TF but may not necessarily represent the strongest binding version of the motif. Also, in addition to the core DR1 motif, three upstream bases also determined PPARγ occupancy (Figure S2G), confirming in vivo the importance of 5′ flanking sequence as reported in prior in vitro studies (Juge-Aubry et al., 1997Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. DNA binding properties of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor subtypes on various natural peroxisome proliferator response elements. Importance of the 5′-flanking region.J. Biol.

Rastinejad F. Structure of the intact PPAR-gamma-RXR- nuclear receptor complex on DNA.Nature. 2008; 456: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Finally, the most drastic effects on DR1 motifs and PPARγ binding occurred when multiple SNPs altered the same motif (Figure S2H). PPARγ often binds DNA in close proximity to C/EBP TFs, and the two facilitate each other’s binding by assisted loading (Madsen et al., 2014Madsen M.S. Siersbæk R. Boergesen M. Nielsen R. Mandrup S.

As with DR1, SNPs with large C/EBP motif effects caused the predicted strain selectivity in PPARγ occupancy (Figure 2C). In addition to PPARγ and C/EBP, a motif for the nuclear factor I (NFI) family was also enriched at PPARγ binding sites, consistent with previous reports (Rajakumari et al., 2013Rajakumari S. Wu J. Ishibashi J. Lim H.-W. Giang A.-H. Won K.-J. Reed R.R. Seale P. EBF2 determines and maintains brown adipocyte identity.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 562-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). SNPs with large NFI motif effects also gave strain selectivity in PPARγ binding (Figure 2D), indicating that an NFI TF can modulate PPARγ genomic binding in vivo. Thus, in addition to the well-known PPARγ-cooperating factor C/EBP, this SNP-based method can also suggest functional relevance for novel candidate TFs. The next highest motif found in PPARγ sites was a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) motif, and SNPs altering this inverted repeat 3 (IR3) motif affected PPARγ occupancy (Figure 2E). The effect of IR3 motifs was independent, as an IR3 motif SNP never also affected an overlapping DR1. GR plays a major role in adipocyte biology (Steger et al., 2010Steger D.J. Grant G.R. Schupp M. Tomaru T. Lefterova M.I. Schug J. Manduchi E. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Lazar M.A. Propagation of adipogenic signals through an epigenomic transition state.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). GR ChIP-seq performed in WAT from B6 and 129 mice revealed strain-selective GR binding (Figure S3A) at sites highly enriched for SNPs (Figure S3B), and SNPs in GR motifs had predicted effects on GR occupancy (Figure S3C). Moreover, the majority of PPARγ binding sites in WAT are also occupied by GR, and hundreds of sites had high-confidence strain-selective binding of both factors (Figure S3D). Many had motif-altering SNPs in PPARγ, GR, or C/EBP motifs, and all three types of SNPs could mediate strain-selective binding of both PPARγ and GR (Figures S3E and S3F). Therefore, SNPs altering PPARγ motifs not only affect PPARγ occupancy, but also binding of other TFs like GR. Conversely, PPARγ binding can be altered by SNPs in PPARγ motifs as well as motifs for other TFs, showing the powerful effect of motif SNPs on cooperative binding of multiple TFs. Selective sites with SNPs but not identifiable motifs (Figure S3G), may be due to SNPs affecting degenerate or non-consensus motifs for these TFs or other TF motifs, yet many strain-selective sites are non-polymorphic over 200 bp. Such unexplained strain-selective sites, with or without SNPs, may result from long-range interactions with other sites in the same locus, and this is consistent with the observed clustering of both B6- and 129-selective binding sites near other sites selective for the same strain (Figure S3H). The great majority of PPARγ sites, including the genetically determined sites defined here, reside outside of promoters >5 kb from transcription start sites (TSSs). The function of sites as enhancers correlates with occupancy of cofactors such as Med1 and p300, as well as with transcription of enhancer RNA (eRNA) identified by global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) (Hah et al., 2013Hah N.

GRO-seq was performed in WAT from B6 mice, and eRNA was quantified at PPARγ sites. High eRNA transcription in B6 WAT was present at ∼18% of B6-selective sites, a significant 3-fold enrichment versus the 129-selective sites with little PPARγ binding in B6 mice, the majority of which had no detectable eRNA transcription (Figure 3A). Thus, strain-selective PPARγ binding in WAT correlated with functional enhancer activity defined by eRNA transcription. Moreover, ChIP-seq for coactivators in 3T3-L1 adipocyte"

Liver metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The seeding and the outgrowth of distant metastasis of cancer are dependent on tumor-initiating cells (TICs) (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J.

Understanding cancer stem cell heterogeneity and plasticity.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A specialized microenvironment, referred to as a metastatic niche, is critical for allowing the outgrowth of metastatic nodules from migrating TICs (Oskarsson et al., 2014Oskarsson T. Batlle E. Massagué J. Metastatic stem cells: sources, niches, and vital pathways.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 306-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), but the niche components supporting liver metastasis are mostly unknown. In a previous study, we showed that migrating TICs that drive liver metastasis of CRC express CD110, a thrombopoietin (TPO)-responsive homodimeric receptor (Gao et al., 2013Gao W. Chen L. Ma Z. Du Z. Zhao Z. Hu Z. Li Q. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of colorectal cancer stem cells with organ-specific metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2013; 145: 636-646.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells requires a balance between positive and negative signals downstream of the TPO/CD110 axis (Fox et al., 2002Fox N. Priestley G. Papayannopoulou T. Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin expands hematopoietic stem cells after transplantation.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Considering that TICs and stem cells share many common features and that liver is the major organ producing TPO (Vigon et al., 1992Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Molecular cloning and characterization of MPL, the human homolog of the v-mpl oncogene: identification of a member of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor superfamily.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), we speculated that TPO is a niche component critical for liver metastasis of CRC. TPO recruits CD110+TICs to the liver and promotes their self-renewal in a paracrine manner (Gao et al., 2013Gao W. Chen L. Ma Z. Du Z. Zhao Z. Hu Z. Li Q. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of colorectal cancer stem cells with organ-specific metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2013; 145: 636-646.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such a finding is consistent with the fact that CRC rarely metastasizes to the liver in patients with chronic hepatitis and, therefore, low TPO levels (Martin et al., 1997Martin 3rd, T.G. Somberg K.A. Meng Y.G. Cohen R.L. Heid C.A. de Sauvage F.J. Shuman M.A. Thrombopoietin levels in patients with cirrhosis before and after orthotopic liver transplantation.Ann. Intern.

Colorectal liver metastases rarely occur in patients with chronic hepatitis virus infection.Hepatogastroenterology. 2012; 59: 1390-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Further support for the pro-metastatic role of TPO comes from studies suggesting that interleukin-6 (IL-6) produced in advanced stages of CRC (Knüpfer and Preiss, 2010Knüpfer H. Preiss R. Serum interleukin-6 levels in colorectal cancer patients—a summary of published results.Int. J. Colorectal Dis. 2010; 25: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) could increase hepatic TPO production and cause thrombocytosis (Kaser et al., 2001Kaser A. Brandacher G. Steurer W. Kaser S. Offner F.A. Zoller H. Theurl I. Widder W. Molnar C. Ludwiczek O. et al.Interleukin-6 stimulates thrombopoiesis through thrombopoietin: role in inflammatory thrombocytosis.Blood. 2001; 98: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), which, in turn, is an independent risk factor for CRC metastasis (Voutsadakis, 2014Voutsadakis I.A. Thrombocytosis as a prognostic marker in gastrointestinal cancers.World J. Gastrointest. Oncol. 2014; 6: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the molecular mechanism(s) by which hepatic TPO promotes liver colonization of CD110+TICs. In a previous study using an in vivo model of organ-specific metastasis of CRC, we showed that CD110+TICs are responsible for liver metastasis (Gao et al., 2013Gao W. Chen L. Ma Z. Du Z. Zhao Z. Hu Z. Li Q. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of colorectal cancer stem cells with organ-specific metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2013; 145: 636-646.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the current study, we compared a transcription profile of CD110+ tumor cells derived from the primary xenograft of two CRC liver metastasis cell lines (CRC102-LM and CRC108-LM) with those from liver metastasis, using global transcriptome analysis (Figure 1A). The highest ranking genes were validated by qPCR (Figure S1A). In the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, the top enriched pathways included the p53 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and saccharopine pathway (lysine degradation) (Figure 1B). A pilot experiment that inhibited each of the three pathways showed the most robust reduction in liver colonization by CD110+TICs upon inhibition of lysine catabolism (Figure S1B). Transcripts for most enzymes in lysine catabolism (AASS, AASDH, AADAT, BCKDH, ECHS1, and HMGCL) and for lysine transporters (CAT1 and CAT2B) were increased (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistent with the transcriptome results, lysine degradation was also elevated in CD110+ cells from peripheral blood of mice with CRC102-LM and CRC108-LM tumors (Figure S2A). Next, we tested whether the TPO-CD110 axis initiates the metabolic reprogramming in CD110+TICs. In comparison with differentiated tumor cells, TICs are more dependent on glycolysis (Mao et al., 2013Mao P. Joshi K. Li J. Kim S.H. Li P. Santana-Santos L. Luthra S. Chandran U.R. Benos P.V. Smith L. et al.Mesenchymal glioma stem cells are maintained by activated glycolytic metabolism involving aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 8644-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In our experiments, both CD133+CD110+ and CD133+CD110− subpopulations from primary CRC102 tumors had a higher glycolytic rate than the corresponding CD133− cells. TPO treatment of CD110+ cells decreased lysine concentration in culture medium via increased cellular uptake (Figure 1E), without impairing glycolysis (Figure S2B). A significant increase in the intracellular level of metabolic intermediates in lysine metabolism (e.g., saccharopine, α-ketoadipate, glutamate, and acetyl-coenzyme A [acetyl-CoA]) was observed as early as 6 hr after TPO treatment (Figure 1F). The expression of most enzymes involved in lysine catabolism showed a concurrent increase (Figures 1G and S2C). Differentiating CD110+TICs with serum significantly reduced the amount of lysine consumption following TPO exposure (Figure S2D). This metabolic reprogramming could be reversed by TPO withdrawal (Figure S2E). Similar results were obtained with primary CRC105 tumor (data not shown). Lysine degradation generates acetyl-CoA, which, in turn, serves as a precursor in the citric acid cycle in mitochondria as well as participates in fatty acid synthesis in cytoplasm and histone acetylation in cell nucleus. Upon incubation of CD110+ cells with 13C-Lys and TPO, we observed an increase in cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA (Figure 1H). Unexpectedly, only <5% of lysine was converted to fatty acid (Figure 1I). Expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes (ACC, ACLY, FAS, GPAT, and SCD) was suppressed (Figures 1J and S2C). 13C-Lys metabolism provided 58.3% of the acetyl-CoA for the TPO-treated CD110+ cells, in contrast to 21.6% prior to TPO treatment (Figure 1I). Therefore, acetyl-CoA was the main end product of lysine metabolism. Next, we examined the expression of AASS, the rate-limiting enzyme in the lysine catabolism, in human samples of primary CRC and metastatic nodules. AASS was positive in 82.3% of liver metastatic nodules, 8.2% of primary tumors, and only 2.3% of lung metastatic lesions. No AASS expression was detected in metastatic samples from lymph nodes and peritoneum (Figure 2A). In liver metastatic nodules, AASS staining was more evident at the invasive edge (Figure 2B). Higher AASS expression in liver nodules was associated with shorter time to liver relapse after resection (Figures 2C and S3) and poorer overall survival (Figure 2C). The classic saccharopine pathway predominates in the liver (Papes et al., 1999Papes F. Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Langone F. Arruda P. Lysine degradation through the saccharopine pathway in mammals: involvement of both bifunctional and monofunctional lysine-degrading enzymes in mouse.Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although AASS staining was strongly positive in healthy liver parenchyma, its expression was significantly lower in tumor-adjacent liver tissues (Figure 2D). AASS expression was significantly higher in CD110+ metastatic samples than in CD110− metastases (Figure 2E). Immunofluorescence staining suggested colocalization of AASS with CD110 in liver metastases but not in primary lesions (Figure 2F). These results implied that lysine catabolism is essential for liver colonization by CD110+TICs. In NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgnull) mice orthotopically implanted with CD110+ cells overexpressing GFP, dietary lysine deprivation inhibited 90% of liver metastasis (Figure 2G) but failed to affect tumor growth (Figure S4A), primary tumor entry into circulation (Figure S4B, upper panel), or tumor cell extravasation from blood vessels (Figure S4B, lower panel). In a previous study (Gao et al., 2013Gao W. Chen L. Ma Z. Du Z. Zhao Z. Hu Z. Li Q. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of colorectal cancer stem cells with organ-specific metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2013; 145: 636-646.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we showed that CDCP1+ cells drive CRC metastasis to the lungs. In the current study, we transduced parental CRC102 cells with retroviral vectors expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting AASS under the control of a promoter element responsive to either CD110 (cis-CD110-HSV1-tk/shAASS) or CDCP1 (cis-CDCP1-HSV1-tk/shAASS) and implanted transduced cells orthotopically into NOG mice on a normal diet. AASS knockdown decreased liver metastasis (Figure S4D, upper panel) without affecting primary tumor formation (Figure S4C, upper panel), intravasation (Figure S4C, lower panel), or lung metastasis (Figure S4D, lower panel). To examine the role of lysine metabolism during different phases of liver metastasis, we generated CD110+ cells expressing AASS shRNA under the control of a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent promoter (Figure S5A) and injected these cells via tail vein into mice on a normal diet. Observation of liver colonization for various periods of time prior to Dox administration revealed increased liver metastatic burden (Figures 2H and 2I). CD110+AASS+ cells were uniformly distributed throughout micrometastases soon after liver colonization. As the colonies grew, these cells progressively segregated to the invasive front (Figure 2I). Dox administration starting at 2 days or 7 days after inoculation inhibited micrometastasis outgrowth and increased CD110+ cell apoptosis. In stark contrast, Dox administration starting at 28 days after inoculation, when metastatic nodules were large, did not affect metastatic burden or survival of CD110+ cells (Figures 2H, S5B, and S5C). Therefore, lysine catabolism plays an important role in the formation of micrometastases but not late metastatic foci. TPO promotes CD110+TICs to self-renew, an essential capacity for early metastasis (Gao et al., 2013Gao W. Chen L. Ma Z. Du Z. Zhao Z. Hu Z. Li Q. Isolation and phenotypic characterization of colorectal cancer stem cells with organ-specific metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2013; 145: 636-646.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found increased self-renewal of CD110+TICs in lysine-containing, but not in lysine-free, medium upon TPO treatment. Such effect of lysine deprivation was rescued by adding either lysine or its metabolic intermediates (α-aminoadipate or α-ketoadipate) but not by adding acetoacetate (Figure 3A). The rescuing action of self-renewal by α-aminoadipate or α-ketoadipate was attenuated by knocking down HMGCL (Figure 3B), an enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of HMG-CoA to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA (Figure 1D). Acetyl-CoA is a major acetyl donor in the acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins (Kaochar and Tu, 2012Kaochar S. Tu B.P. Gatekeepers of chromatin: Small metabolites elicit big changes in gene expression.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Considering acetyl-CoA accumulation in cytoplasm (Figure 1H), we spiked the TPO-treated CD110+ cells with 13C-lysine and immunoprecipitated acetylated peptides from cytoplasmic extracts to identify candidates containing 13C-acetyllysine. One of the proteins identified was LRP6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling crucial for self-renewal of colon TICs (Vermeulen et al., 2010Vermeulen L. De Sousa E Melo F. van der Heijden M. Cameron K. de Jong J.H. Borovski T. Tuynman J.B. Todaro M. Merz C. Rodermond H. et al.Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the temporal profile of LRP6 acetylation synchronized with cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA increase (Figure 3C). LRP6 was no longer acetylated in an AASS or HMGCL mutant (Figure 3D). In CRC xenografts derived from CRC102-LM or CRC105-LM cell lines, LRP6 acetylation was detectable in CD110+TICs from liver metastases but not from primary lesions (Figure S6A). Mass spectrometry of co-immunoprecipitated samples revealed an interaction of LRP6 with p300, a histone acetyltransferase (Ogryzko et al., 1996Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. The transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP are histone acetyltransferases.Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). The association between p300 and LRP6 was prominent upon TPO exposure but lost in the absence of TPO (Figure 3E). Transduction of CD110+TICs with either shRNA targeting p300 or a catalytically inactive p300 mutant (ΔHAT) decreased TPO-induced LRP6 acetylation (Figure 3F). P300 has been reported to localize exclusively in the nucleus (Ogryzko et al., 1996Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. The transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP are histone acetyltransferases.Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, p300 moved from the nucleus into the cytoplasm when CD110+ cells were treated with TPO in our experiments (Figure 3G). Protein kinase C (PKC) represses transcriptional activity by phosphorylating p300 on S89 (Yuan and Gambee, 2000Yuan L.W. Gambee J.E. Phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 by protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40946-40951Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The TPO/CD110 axis regulates PKC signaling (Hong et al., 1998Hong Y. Dumènil D. van der Loo B. Goncalves F. Vainchenker W. Erusalimsky J.D. Protein kinase C mediates the mitogenic action of thrombopoietin in c-Mpl-expressing UT-7 cells.Blood. 1998; 91: 813-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated p300 mutants in which S89 was replaced with A or Q and expressed them in CD110+ cells. In the presence of TPO, both S89 mutants showed abundant nuclear localization but no detectable cytoplasmic staining (Figure 3G). The PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 blocked TPO-induced S89 phosphorylation, reduced the amount of p300 that co-immunoprecipitated with LRP6, and inhibited LRP6 acetylation (Figure 3H), suggesting that PKC signaling is required for TPO-induced p300-LRP6 interaction and LRP6 acetylation. To identify the specific site(s) of TPO-induced acetylation on LRP6, we overexpressed flag-tagged LRP6 in CD110+ cells. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified an acetylation site at K802 upon TPO treatment (Figure S6B). To confirm this result, we generated LRP6 mutants in which K802 was replaced with A or R and expressed these mutants in CD110+ cells. Upon TPO treatment, acetylation was evident in wild-type LRP6 but not either K802 mutants (Figure 3I). Next, we transfected wild-type LRP6 or K802 mutants into CD110+ cells and orthotopically implanted these cells into NOG mice. K802 mutation markedly decreased liver colonization (Figure S6D, right panel) but did not affect primary tumor formation (Figure S6C) or intravasation by CD110+TICs (Figure S6D, left panel). Activation of LRP6 in canonical Wnt signaling requires phosphorylation (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C. Wnt induces LRP6 signalosomes and promotes dishevelled-dependent LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 316: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In our experiments with CD110+TICs, TPO led to LRP6 phosphorylation at two key residues (Thr1479 and 1493), whereas no phosphorylation of K802 mutants was detectable (Figure 4A). Consistent with the functional importance of LRP6 phosphorylation, TPO treatment of K802 mutant-expressing cells failed to activate TOP-FLASH reporter expression (Figure 4B) and, therefore, did not affect β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol (Figure 4D) and transcription of Wnt target genes (Figure 4C). Both LRP6 phosphorylation (Figure S6E, left panel) and Wnt signaling activity (Figure S6E, right panel) were higher in CD110+TICs from liver metastases than from primary lesions. Next, we focused on casein kinase (CK), which typically recognizes putative phosphorylation sites of LRP6 (Davidson et al., 2005Davidson G. Wu W. Shen J. Bilic J. Fenger U. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Casein kinase 1 gamma couples Wnt receptor activation to cytoplasmic signal transduction.Nature. 2005; 438: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). TPO induced all four CK1s (CK1α/ε/δ/γ) to co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type but not the K802 LRP6 mutants (Figure 4E). Dominant-negative (DN)-CK1α and DN-CK1γ, but not DN-CK1δ, blocked TPO-induced LRP6 phosphorylation (Figure 4F). To determine the role of acetylated LRP6 on self-renewal of CD110+TICs, we gave mice limiting doses of CD110+ cells that co-express exogenous TPO with wild-type LRP6 or K802 mutants. Tumors generated from a single CD110+ cell (with limiting dilution) were transplanted into secondary recipients (Figure S6F). When compared to the wild-type group, there was a >10-fold decrease in the frequency of self-renewing cells in the K802 mutant groups (Figure 4G). Suppression of LRP6 activity, either by overexpressing Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) (Niehrs, 2006Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) or by knocking down p300 expression (Figure S6G), decreased liver metastatic efficiency (Figure 4H). Immunohistochemistry on liver metastases showed a decreased number of CD110+pLRP6+ cells in mice treated with shp300 (Figure 4I). These results suggest that p300-mediated acetylation is indispensable for LRP6 activation to support metastatic colonization by CD110+TICs. Oxidative stress caused by tumor arrest in hepatic sinusoids and reperfusion limits cancer metastasis (Jessup et al., 1999Jessup J.M. Battle P. Waller H. Edmiston K.H. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Locker J. Skena K. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen radicals formed during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion kill weakly metastatic colorectal cancer cells.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1825-1829PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we induced hepatic ischemia in TPO+/+ or TPO−/− mice by clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 3 min. Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important antioxidant defenses against oxidative stress in cancer cells. Within 3 days, primary CD110+ cultures with TPO−/− ischemic livers showed substantial cell death, with a time-dependent decrease in GSH. Co-culturing these cells with TPO+/+ ischemic livers significantly enhanced cell viability and increased GSH (Figure 5A; Figure 5B, upper panel). Adding TPO to cultured CD110+ cells decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Figure 5C, upper panel), increased GSH (Figure 5C, lower panel), and decreased their sensitivity to exogenous ROS (H2O2) or peroxynitrite (Figure 5D). Wnt/β-catenin signaling protects cells against oxidative stress (Tao et al., 2013Tao G.Z. Lehwald N. Jang K.Y. Baek J. Xu B. Omary M.B. Sylvester K.G. Wnt/β-catenin signaling protects mouse liver against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of forkhead transcription factor FoxO3.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17214-17224Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling activity in CD110+ cells was higher upon co-incubation with TPO+/+ than with TPO−/− ischemic liver (Figure 5B, lower panel). The loss of CD110+ cell viability upon AASS knockdown was rescued by the supplement of glutathione but not Wnt3A (Figure 5E). Consistently, the protective effect of TPO was diminished by GSH depletion and not affected by Wnt pathway inhibition (Figure 5F). Glutamate is a by-product of lysine degradation and upregulates GSH synthesis (Richman and Meister, 1975Richman P.G. Meister A. Regulation of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase by nonallosteric feedback inhibition by glutathione.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In CD110+ cells treated with TPO, intracellular GSH was reduced by knockdown of AASS but not BCKDH, ECHS1, or HMGCL (Figure 5G). System xc− imports cystine into cells in exchange for glutamate to provide cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate in GSH synthesis (Lewerenz et al., 2013Lewerenz J. Hewett S.J. Huang Y. Lambros M. Gout P.W. Kalivas P.W. Massie A. Smolders I. Methner A. Pergande M. et al.The cystine/glutamate antiporter system x(c)(-) in health and disease: from molecular mechanisms to novel therapeutic opportunities.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 522-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Adding the structurally unrelated system xc− inhibitor sulfasalazine or S-4-carboxyphenylglycine abolished TPO-induced GSH production (Figure 5H, upper panel) and sensitized CD110+ cells to TPO+/+ ischemic livers (Figure 5H, lower panel). Many chemotherapeutic agents, including fluorouracil (5-FU), produce antitumor activity by promoting ROS-dependent apoptosis (Sangeetha et al., 1990Sangeetha P. Das U.N. Koratkar R. Suryaprabha P. Increase in free radical generation and lipid peroxidation following chemotherapy in patients with cancer.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this experiment, CRC102-LM cells were transfected with a lentiviral vector in which the shRNA targeting AASS is under the dual control of the CD110-responsive promoter and the Tet-inducible activator rtTA (referred to as pCRTA; Figure 6A) and were orthotopically transplanted into NOG mice. Upon establishment of liver metastases 4 weeks later, mice were treated with 5-FU alone, Tet alone, or 5-FU plus Tet. Treatment with 5-FU alone produced >82% tumor regression at week 6 (Figure 6B) but significantly increased the percentage of CD110+ cells in liver metastases (Figure 6C, lower panel). Recurrence (n = 7 for liver and n = 1 for peritoneum) was noted in 8 out of 10 such mice. In these cases, both GSH level and Wnt activity were higher in CD110+ cells in liver metastases than those in primary lesions (Figure 6D). Next, we examined the relative contribution of GSH versus Wnt signaling. The sensitivity of cultured CD110+ cells to 5-FU was greatly enhanced by GSH depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) but not Wnt inhibition with DKK1 overexpression (Figure 6E, upper panel). Tet treatment alone did not affect the development of tumor burden (Figure 6B), but it decreased GSH level, as well as Wnt activity, in CD110+ cells from liver metastases (Figure 6D). In stark contrast, treatment with 5-FU plus Tet decreased the size of liver metastases (Figure 6B, lower panel) as well as the percentage of CD110+ cells in liver metastatic lesions (Figure 6C, lower panel). In vivo, Tet treatment enhanced the sensitivity of isolated CD110+ cells to 5-FU exposure in a manner dependent on GSH and not Wnt (Figure 6E, lower panel). Therefore, recurrence was not noted in any subject. c-myc is essential in the TPO-CD110 axis in stem cells (Chanprasert et al., 2006Chanprasert S. Geddis A.E. Barroga C. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin (TPO) induces c-myc expression through a PI3K- and MAPK-dependent pathway that is not mediated by Akt, PKCzeta or mTOR in TPO-dependent cell lines and primary megakaryocytes.Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our experiments, c-myc expression was significantly upregulated by TPO, before lysine degradation became detectable (1 hr versus 6 hr) (Figure 7A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) (Figure S7A, upper panel) and qRT-PCR analyses (Figure S7A, lower panel) revealed TPO-induced binding of endogenous c-myc to promoters of most, if not all, genes encoding enzymes involved in lysine degradation and fatty acid synthesis. We examined the effects of TPO treatment on the changes of histone markers. TPO increased H3K14 acetylation in CD110+ cells in a c-myc-dependent manner, without affecting other histone markers (Figure 7B). H3K14 acetylation is a hallmark of active transcription (Koch et al., 2007Koch C.M. Andrews R.M. Flicek P. Dillon S.C. Karaöz U. Clelland G.K. Wilcox S. Beare D.M. Fowler J.C. Couttet P. et al.The landscape of histone modifications across 1% of the human genome in five human cell lines.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 691-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). ChIP-qPCR analysis of c-myc binding sites in two genes involved in lysine metabolism (AASS and BCKDH) and two genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (ACC and FAS) showed that c-myc increased acetylation of H3K14 on these promoters (Figure 7C). This increase was observed regardless of whether the genes were activated or repressed. Confocal imaging showed nearly complete overlap between c-myc and acetylated H3K14 in the nuclei of TPO-treated CD110+ cells (Figure 7D). HBO1 is required for most H3K14 acetylation events in mammals (Kueh et al., 2011Kueh A.J. Dixon M.P. Voss A.K. Thomas T. HBO1 is required for H3K14 acetylation and"

The neural mechanisms underlying the entrainment of neutral sensory stimuli to salient social cues to produce social learning remain unknown. We used odor-driven behavioral paradigms to ask if oxytocin, a neuropeptide implicated in various social behaviors, plays a crucial role in the formation of learned associations between odor and socially significant cues. Through genetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological manipulations, we show that oxytocin receptor signaling is crucial for entrainment of odor to social cues but is dispensable for entrainment to nonsocial cues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oxytocin directly impacts the piriform, the olfactory sensory cortex, to mediate social learning. Lastly, we provide evidence that oxytocin plays a role in both appetitive and aversive social learning. These results suggest that oxytocin conveys saliency of social stimuli to sensory representations in the piriform cortex during odor-driven social learning."
https://openalex.org/W1940455180,"KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer. Despite substantial efforts, no clinically applicable strategy has yet been developed to effectively treat KRAS-mutant tumors. Here, we perform a cell-line-based screen and identify strong synergistic interactions between cell-cycle checkpoint-abrogating Chk1- and MK2 inhibitors, specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-driven cells. Mechanistically, we show that KRAS-mutant cancer displays intrinsic genotoxic stress, leading to tonic Chk1- and MK2 activity. We demonstrate that simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition leads to mitotic catastrophe in KRAS-mutant cells. This actionable synergistic interaction is validated using xenograft models, as well as distinct Kras- or Braf-driven autochthonous murine cancer models. Lastly, we show that combined checkpoint inhibition induces apoptotic cell death in KRAS- or BRAF-mutant tumor cells directly isolated from patients. These results strongly recommend simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of KRAS- or BRAF-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1521011562,"The transition from proliferating precursor cells to post-mitotic differentiated cells is crucial for development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor suppression. To study cell-cycle exit during differentiation in vivo, we developed a conditional knockout and lineage-tracing system for Caenorhabditis elegans. Combined lineage-specific gene inactivation and genetic screening revealed extensive redundancies between previously identified cell-cycle inhibitors and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. Muscle precursor cells missing either SWI/SNF or G1/S inhibitor function could still arrest cell division, while simultaneous inactivation of these regulators caused continued proliferation and a C. elegans tumor phenotype. Further genetic analyses support that SWI/SNF acts in concert with hlh-1 MyoD, antagonizes Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression, and suppresses cye-1 Cyclin E transcription to arrest cell division of muscle precursors. Thus, SWI/SNF and G1/S inhibitors provide alternative mechanisms to arrest cell-cycle progression during terminal differentiation, which offers insight into the frequent mutation of SWI/SNF genes in human cancers."

For example, embryonic-stem-cell (ESC)-based therapies to replace retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells are currently in clinical trials (https://ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT01691261, NCT01344993, and NCT01345006), and preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of similar approaches to replace photoreceptors lost to retinal degeneration (MacLaren et al., 2006MacLaren R.E.

Commun. 2014; 5: 4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), but there are important differences among these stem cell populations that may substantially affect cell transplantation. For example, individual iPSC lines may retain epigenetic marks of the differentiated cells they were derived from, which, in turn, can influence their efficiency to produce different lineages (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Indeed, iPSCs derived from primary human fetal RPE cells retain memory of their previous differentiation state and exhibit a preference to redifferentiate into RPE cells (Hu et al., 2010Hu Q. Friedrich A.M. Johnson L.V. Clegg D.O. Memory in induced pluripotent stem cells: reprogrammed human retinal-pigmented epithelial cells show tendency for spontaneous redifferentiation.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In some iPSC lines, this epigenetic memory decreases with each passage in culture (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), but some forms of epigenetic memory may be more stable and can be exploited in selecting iPSC lines for stem-cell-based therapies (Hargus et al., 2014Hargus G. Ehrlich M. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Hemmer K. Hallmann A.L. Reinhardt P. Kim K.P. Adachi K. Santourlidis S.

To date, most studies of epigenetic memory in iPSCs have focused on DNA methylation, but higher order chromatin organization mediated by insulator elements such as CTCF may also play a role in iPSC epigenetic memory (Narendra et al., 2015Narendra V. Rocha P.P. An D. Raviram R. Skok J.A. Mazzoni E.O. Reinberg D. Transcription.

A more recent study that used a modification of the Sasai protocol showed that human iPSCs derived from fibroblasts can also produce retinae (Zhong et al., 2014Zhong X. Gutierrez C. Xue T. Hampton C. Vergara M.N. Cao L.H. Peters A. Park T.S. Zambidis E.T. Meyer J.S. et al.Generation of three-dimensional retinal tissue with functional photoreceptors from human iPSCs.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the source of stem cells is important for retinal differentiation, functional integration, and survival when transplanted (Assawachananont et al., 2014Assawachananont J. Mandai M. Okamoto S. Yamada C. Eiraku M. Yonemura S. Sasai Y. Takahashi M.

Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the retinal differentiation of iPSCs derived from either murine fibroblasts (f-iPSCs) or rod photoreceptors (r-iPSCs) by using a quantitative protocol for monitoring retinal development in culture called STEM-RET. We discovered that the source of iPSCs had a significant impact on the efficiency and structure of retinae formed in 3D organ cultures. By integrating the retinal differentiation data with epigenetic profiling, we identified a new mechanism that contributes to these differences between iPSC lines. Our results suggest that the source of stem cells for cellular transplantation in the retina may be an important consideration, and we provide a platform for comparing the retinal differentiation and epigenetic memory of different stem cell populations. To quantify retinogenesis from murine ESCs and iPSCs, we incorporated molecular, cellular, and morphologic scoring criteria into a quantitative STEM-RET protocol (Figure 1A). The timeline of STEM-RET corresponded to eye field specification during the first 7 days in culture, optic cup formation from days 7–10, and retinal differentiation from days 10–28 (Figure 1A). As a benchmark for STEM-RET, we used the EB5:Rx-GFP murine ESC line, which efficiently produces eye field, optic cup, and retinae in culture (Figures 1B–1G and S1) (Eiraku et al., 2011Eiraku M. Takata N. Ishibashi H. Kawada M. Sakakura E. Okuda S. Sekiguchi K. Adachi T. Sasai Y. Self-organizing optic-cup morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture.Nature. 2011; 472: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the presence of several hallmarks of normal retinae in the tissue derived from murine ESCs, such as photoreceptor inner segments, outer limiting membranes, photoreceptor terminals, and other cellular features associated with the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (Figures 1H and S1). For eye field specification, we scored eye field induction efficiency (EFE), eye field induction specificity (EFS), and eye field proliferation (EFP) at day 7 (Figure 1I). For optic cup formation, we scored optic cup efficiency (OCE) and optic cup frequency (OCF) at day 10 (Figure 1I). To measure retinal differentiation (days 10–28), we analyzed 15 retinal differentiation genes by qPCR (retinal differentiation qPCR; RDQ), 18 morphologic criteria by TEM (retinal differentiation electron microscopy; RDEM), and 9 proteins by immunofluorescence on cryosections (retinal differentiation immunofluorescence; RDIF) (Figure 1I; Table S1). For the RDQ score, the normalized expression of each gene relative to that in postnatal day 12 (P12) murine retinae was calculated, and then those scores were averaged across all genes so that a score of 1.0 would be equivalent to mature retina. The immunostained sections and electron micrographs were blind scored, and the data were averaged so that a score of 1.0 would be equivalent to mature retina. To combine individual eye field (EFE, EFS, and EFP), optic cup (OCE and OCF), and retinal differentiation (RDQ, RDIF, and RDEM) scores into a single integrated score, we calculated an unweighted average. The EB5:Rx-GFP ESC line had integrated scores of 0.68 on EFS, 0.73 on OCF, and 0.81 on RDIF from six replicate experiments with more than 1,000 individual sphere cultures (Figures 1I and 1J; Table 1; Table S1).Table 1Stem Cell Lines Used for STEM-RETLineSourceMethodTypeEFOCRDTotalEB5RIKENNAESC0.390.310.540.41EB5:RxGFPRIKENNAESC0.680.730.850.75iPS7MEFviraliPSC0.520.630.810.65iPS11MEFNrl−/−viraliPSC0.360.11NANAFDN01MEFOKSM;Nrl−/−OKSMiPSC0.340.540.660.51FDN02MEFOKSM;Nrl−/−OKSMiPSC0.360.420.600.46FNR01MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.430.760.550.58FNR02MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.390.70.520.54FNR03MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.430.680.540.55FNR04MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.440.590.580.54FNR05MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.480.710.660.62FNR06MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.430.540.560.51FNR07MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.420.640.660.57FNR08MEFOKSMOKSMiPSC0.410.770.560.588601(i)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.410.540.760.578602(i)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.440.750.870.698603(i)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.480.510.880.628604(i)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.480.660.780.647601(m)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.420.590.880.637602(m)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.310.610.920.613301(m)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.430.510.960.633302(m)rodOKSMOKSMiPSC0.330.600.860.60SCN150rodNrl-GFPSCNTESC0.420.360.540.44SCN194rodNrl-GFPSCNTESC0.420.480.330.41SCN212rodNrl-GFPSCNTESC0.440.490.190.37Each line is listed along with the type of stem cell, cell source, and method of reprogramming (viral, OKSM, SCNT).

To determine whether the source of stem cells influences retinogenesis, we developed f-iPSC and r-iPSC lines (Table 1). The f-iPSCs were produced with a mixture of retroviruses expressing Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2 or by using a reprogrammable mouse strain (Col1a1-OKSM;Rosa26-M2rtTA) (Stadtfeld et al., 2010Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Borkent M. Hochedlinger K. A reprogrammable mouse strain from gene-targeted embryonic stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We also generated f-iPSCs from Nrl−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Table 1). The Nrl gene encodes the neural retina-specific leucine zipper protein that is required for rod photoreceptor cell fate specification and differentiation (Mears et al., 2001Mears A.J. Kondo M. Swain P.K. Takada Y. Bush R.A. Saunders T.L. Sieving P.A. Swaroop A. Nrl is required for rod photoreceptor development.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We produced Nrl−/− f-iPSCs to determine whether the defects in photoreceptor development could be recapitulated in culture using STEM-RET. The r-iPSCs were generated from Nrl-GFP;Col1a1-OKSM;Rosa26-M2rtTA mice with GFP-labeled rod photoreceptors (Figure 2A). Mature GFP+ rod photoreceptors were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mixed in limiting dilution with 1.5 × 106 P0–P5 C57Bl/6 P0–P5 retinal cells in retinal pellets maintained in culture on polycarbonate filters (Figure 2B; Supplemental Information). This procedure was essential because purified rod photoreceptors do not survive when maintained as single cells (data not shown). Doxycycline (2 μg/ml) was added to the pellet cultures to induce expression of OKSM in the rod photoreceptors for 10 days. Then, individual pellets were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and plated in limiting dilution on irradiated MEFs in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to support the growth of r-iPSC colonies. To directly compare the efficiencies of reprogramming and retinal differentiation of immature and mature rod photoreceptors, we performed the same experiment with P2–P4 Nrl-GFP;Col1a1-OKSM;Rosa26-M2rtTA retinae (Table 1). We also performed somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) with rod photoreceptors isolated from P6–P14 Nrl-GFP mice (Figures 2C–2F) because SCNT can rapidly erase the epigenetic marks of differentiated cells (Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J.H. Saha K. Jaenisch R. Pluripotency and cellular reprogramming: facts, hypotheses, unresolved issues.Cell. 2010; 143: 508-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As controls, we used nuclei isolated from ESCs, Sertoli cells, cumulus cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and other types of immature and mature neurons. The development to late-stage preimplantation embryos (morula/blastocysts) from rod photoreceptors was comparable to that from other neuronal types (Figures 2G and 2H). However, ESCs were produced from those blastocysts at a much lower efficiency than other cell types (Figures 2I and 2J). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the expression of Oct, Nanog, and SSEA1 in individual iPSC colonies (Figures 2K–2M). We also compared the expression of seven genes that are markers of pluripotency to EB5:Rx-GFP ESCs by qPCR (Figure 2N). To directly test the pluripotency of individual iPSC lines, we injected them into the flanks of immunocompromised mice. Immunohistochemical staining of the resulting teratomas showed that the iPSCs can form mesodermal-, endodermal-, and ectodermal-derived lineages (Figure 2O). In total, we selected 12 f-iPSC lines, 8 r-iPSC lines, and 3 SCNT lines that had stable karyotypes and were fully reprogrammed for testing by STEM-RET (Table 1). We performed STEM-RET differentiation on the 23 stem cell lines described earlier. All experiments included the EB5:Rx-GFP ESC line as an internal control, and more than 10,000 individual cultures were scored (Tables 1 and S1). All iPSC lines, except iPS11, underwent eye field specification, optic cup formation, and retinal differentiation (Figures 3A–3D; Tables 1 and S1). However, the EFE, EFS, and OCE scores were lower than that for the EB5:Rx-GFP ESC line (Figures 3E and 3F; Supplemental Information). Early-passage r-iPSCs (passages 7–10) were less efficient than late-passage r-iPSCs (passages 23–27) at producing eye field, optic cup, and retinae (Table S1). Late-passage r-iPSCs from immature rod photoreceptors were 40-fold more efficient than EB5:Rx-GFP ESCs in producing differentiated retinae, and late-passage r-iPSCs from mature rods were 12-fold more efficient than EB5:Rx-GFP ESCs in producing retinae (Figure 3G). The efficient retinal differentiation of immature and mature rod-derived iPSCs was maintained to at least passage 50 (data not shown). Lines 7601, 3301, 3302, and 8604 were as much as 70-fold more efficient than EB5:Rx-GFP and 84-fold more efficient than f-iPSCs at producing differentiated retinae (Figure 3G; Supplemental Information). To determine whether improved retinal development came at the expense of other lineages, we performed cortical and osteogenic differentiation (Supplemental Information). Analysis of Foxg1, Pax6, Tbr1, Tbr2(Eomes), and Reelin expression by qPCR showed a subtle reduction in Pax6 expression and a more pronounced reduction in Tbr1, Tbr2, and Foxg1 gene expression in r-iPSCs relative to that in f-iPSCs (Figure S2). There was slightly higher expression of Spry2 in r-iPSCs in osteogenic differentiation experiments, but none of the other osteoblast genes (Mef2c, Spry2, Sp7, and Runx2) or bone differentiation genes (Bglap and Ibsp) significantly differed between the r-iPSCs and the f-iPSCs (Figure S2). Gene expression and DNA methylation analyses of the iPSC and ESC lines showed that they are very similar, with correlation coefficients between 0.98 and 0.99 for gene expression and between 0.90 and 0.94 for DNA methylation (Figures 3H–3K; Table S2). Integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation identified only 22 genes with statistically significant differences across the f-iPSC and r-iPSC lines (Table S2; data available upon request). Seven of the 22 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in f-iPSCs and had corresponding changes in DNA methylation, including genes implicated in skin development, homeostasis, or disease (Prss8, Grhl2, Krt8, and Raet1e/Ulbp4). Two major classes of genes were expressed at higher levels in r-iPSCs. Genes implicated in retinal/CNS development, homeostasis, and disease were identified (Snord116, Prkca, and Rian), as were those implicated in pathways involved in ocular immune privilege (Ifi27l1, Irgm1, Eif2ak2, Zbp1, and Stat1) (Table S2). The most pronounced differences among r-iPSCs, f-iPSCs, and EB5:Rx-GFP stem cells were associated with retinal differentiation. There were significant differences in RDQ (p = 0.04), RDEM (p = 0.003), and RDIF (p < 0.0001) for r-iPSCs and f-iPSCs (Figures 3E and 3F). Notably, amacrine cells and other INL cells were reduced in f-iPSCs as compared to r-iPSCs or EB5:Rx-GFP stem cells (Table S1). The difference in retinal differentiation was most striking in electron microscopy studies (Figure 4A) and was independently validated by immunofluorescence and qPCR (Figure 4B; Table S1). We performed 3D electron microscopy on retinae derived from r-iPSCs or f-iPSCs, and well-formed synaptic ribbons were present in the photoreceptor terminals (Figures 4C and 4D; Movie S1; data not shown). To determine whether the differences in retinal differentiation between r-iPSCs and f-iPSCs were the result of changes in retinal progenitor cell proliferation, we performed an EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) pulse-labeling experiment on days 14, 21, 23, and 28 for side-by-side cultures of f-iPSC (FNR05 and FNR07) and r-iPSC (8601, 8604, and 7602) lines. The retinal progenitor cells underwent interkinetic nuclear migration with the S-phase at the basal surface of the retina and mitosis at the apical surface in these cultures (Figure 4F). The proportion of S-phase cells on days 14, 21, 23, and 28 was indistinguishable for f-iPSCs and r-iPSCs (Figure 4F). These data were similar to those obtained for EB5:Rx-GFP stem cells at the same time points (data not shown). For the ESC lines derived by SCNT of rod photoreceptor nuclei (Table 1), the eye field score was 0.43 ± 0.02, the optic cup score was 0.44 ± 0.07, and the retinal differentiation score was 0.35 ± 0.17. In the cryosections and electron micrographs, retinal cell types were present but lacked clear laminar organization. It is not known whether EB5:Rx-GFP is typical of ESC lines or whether the inefficient retinal differentiation of SCN194, SCN212, and SCN150 is more representative of murine ESC lines. To distinguish between these possibilities, we obtained the original EB5 ESC line that was used to make the EB5:Rx-GFP knockin line (Figure S3). We performed STEM-RET differentiation with EB5 and EB5:Rx-GFP and found that the EB5 parent line was very similar to that of SCN194, SCN212, and SCN150 and was inefficient at retinal differentiation (Figure S3; Tables 1 and S1). We performed whole-genome sequencing of the EB5 and EB5:Rx-GFP lines and identified single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) that have been acquired by the EB5:Rx-GFP line (Figure S3). However, none of those variations were in genes that are important for neurogenesis (data not shown). DNA methylation analysis of the EB5 and EB5:Rx-GFP lines identified phosphoprotein and alternative splicing as the pathways that differed the most (Figure S3; data not shown). To determine whether Nrl−/− f-iPSCs recapitulate the defect in rod differentiation found in Nrl−/− mice (Mears et al., 2001Mears A.J. Kondo M. Swain P.K. Takada Y. Bush R.A. Saunders T.L. Sieving P.A. Swaroop A. Nrl is required for rod photoreceptor development.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we performed a gene expression array analysis of Nrl−/− and Nrl+/+ f-iPSC-derived retinae (day 28). As expected, rod photoreceptor genes were downregulated, and S-cone genes were upregulated in Nrl−/− f-iPSC-derived retinae (Figure 5A). The downregulation of rhodopsin was verified by immunofluorescence and qPCR (Figures 5B and 5C). Exogenous factors such as retinoic acid (RA) can promote photoreceptor differentiation (Hyatt et al., 1996Hyatt G.A. Schmitt E.A. Fadool J.M. Dowling J.E. Retinoic acid alters photoreceptor development in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 13298-13303Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and RA is included for 4 days in STEM-RET. To determine whether r-iPSCs were responsive to additional RA treatment, we added 0.5 μM RA to the differentiation medium for the entire differentiation period (days 10–28) in STEM-RET, and gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. The expression of photoreceptor genes such as recoverin and Crx increased at the expense of other retinal cell-type-specific genes (Figure 5D). In previous studies on epigenetic memory of iPSCs derived from neural progenitor cells, treatment with 5-azacytidine and trichostatin A (AZA/TSA) improved the cells’ ability to form blood lineages (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). We treated a f-iPSC line (FNR07), an r-iPSC line (8601), and EB5:Rx-GFP cells with AZA/TSA as done previously (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) (Table S1). The AZA/TSA-treated EB5:Rx-GFP cells were very similar to the untreated EB5:Rx-GFP cells (Table S1). For the r-iPSCs, the optic cup score improved, but the eye field and retinal differentiation scores were similar for untreated and AZA/TSA-treated 8601 r-iPSCs (Table S1). For the f-iPSCs, the retinal score improved from 0.67 to 0.90 after AZA/TSA treatment, and the INL defect was partially rescued (Figure 5E; Table S1). We analyzed the correlation between DNA methylation in the different stem cell populations and gene expression in differentiated retinae derived from these lines. Although no annotated genes achieved statistical significance, several trends were consistent with the loss of INL cells in the f-iPSC derived retinae. For example, we found that Lhx9 was hypermethylated in all eight of the f-iPSC lines relative to the r-iPSC lines or the EB5 line (Figure 5F). The hypomethylation of Lhx9 in r-iPSCs was associated with higher expression in retinae derived from those lines (Figure 5G). Lhx9 is expressed in the INL cells of the developing retina and has been implicated in eye morphogenesis (Alunni et al., 2007Alunni A. Menuet A. Candal E. Pénigault J.B. Jeffery W.R. Rétaux S.

Differences in DNA methylation were correlated with changes in protein expression in retinae derived from r-iPSCs or f-iPSCs (Figure 5H). In addition to CpG DNA methylation, we identified several genes involved in retinal development, stress response, and degeneration (Lrrk2, Rbbp7, Ebf1, Cxcl2, Dlx5, Nfasc, and Btrc) that had elevated 5-hmC promoter levels in r-iPSCs. Several genes involved in epithelial cell transport also had elevated 5-hmC levels in f-iPSCs (Slc19a1, Clca5, Yipf4, Shisa2, and Stip1) (Table S3).

https://openalex.org/W1633734463,"Background Antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infection before immunologic decline (early ART) and pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PrEP) can prevent HIV transmission, but routine adoption of these practices by clinicians has been limited. Methods Between September and December 2013, healthcare practitioners affiliated with a regional AIDS Education and Training Center in New England were invited to complete online surveys assessing knowledge, beliefs and practices regarding early ART and PrEP. Multivariable models were utilized to determine characteristics associated with prescribing intentions and practices. Results Surveys were completed by 184 practitioners. Respondent median age was 44 years, 58% were female, and 82% were white. Among ART-prescribing clinicians (61% of the entire sample), 64% were aware that HIV treatment guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services recommended early ART, and 69% indicated they would prescribe ART to all HIV-infected patients irrespective of immunologic status. However, 77% of ART-prescribing clinicians would defer ART for patients not ready to initiate treatment. Three-fourths of all respondents were aware of guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending PrEP provision, 19% had prescribed PrEP, and 58% of clinicians who had not prescribed PrEP anticipated future prescribing. Practitioners expressed theoretical concerns and perceived practical barriers to prescribing early ART and PrEP. Clinicians with higher percentages of HIV-infected patients (aOR 1.16 per 10% increase in proportion of patients with HIV-infection, 95% CI 1.01–1.34) and infectious diseases specialists (versus primary care physicians; aOR 3.32, 95% CI 0.98–11.2) were more likely to report intentions to prescribe early ART. Higher percentage of HIV-infected patients was also associated with having prescribed PrEP (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06–1.34), whereas female gender (aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10–0.71) was associated with having not prescribed PrEP. Conclusions These findings suggest many clinicians have shifted towards routinely recommending early ART, but not PrEP, so interventions to facilitate PrEP provision are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1935883651,"Specific binding proteins are crucial for the correct spatiotemporal expression of mRNA. To understand this process, a method is required to characterize RNA-protein interactions in single living cells with subcellular resolution. We combined endogenous single RNA and protein detection with two-photon fluorescence fluctuation analysis to measure the average number of proteins bound to mRNA at specific locations within live cells. We applied this to quantify the known binding of zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and ribosomes to β-actin mRNA within subcellular compartments of primary fibroblasts and neurons. ZBP1-mRNA binding did not occur in nuclei, contrary to previous conclusions. ZBP1 interaction with β-actin mRNA was enhanced perinuclearly in neurons compared to fibroblasts. Cytoplasmic ZBP1 and ribosome binding to the mRNA were anti-correlated depending on their location in the cell. These measurements support a mechanism whereby ZBP1 inhibits translation of localizing mRNA until its release from the mRNA peripherally, allowing ribosome binding."

Coupling is most probably accomplished via the mechanism of flavin-based electron bifurcation. To understand this process on a structural basis, we heterologously produced the NfnAB complex of Thermotoga maritima in Escherichia coli, provided kinetic evidence for its bifurcating behavior, and determined its x-ray structure in the absence and presence of NADH.

Ferredoxin is presumably docked onto NfnB close to the [4Fe-4S] cluster distal to b-FAD. NAD(H) binds to a-FAD and NADP(H) consequently to b-FAD, which is positioned in the center of the NfnAB complex and the site of electron bifurcation.

https://openalex.org/W1884523196,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are key transcription factors that stimulate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that a prenylated flavonoid in hops, xanthohumol (XN), is a novel SREBP inactivator that reduces the de novo synthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol. XN independently suppressed the maturation of SREBPs of insulin-induced genes in a manner different from sterols. Our results suggest that XN impairs the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi translocation of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)-SREBP complex by binding to Sec23/24 and blocking SCAP/SREBP incorporation into common coated protein II vesicles. Furthermore, in diet-induced obese mice, dietary XN suppressed SREBP-1 target gene expression in the liver accompanied by a reduction of the mature form of hepatic SREBP-1, and it inhibited the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis. Altogether, our data suggest that XN attenuates the function of SREBP-1 by repressing its maturation and that it has the potential of becoming a nutraceutical food or pharmacological agent for improving metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2109438818,"Studies in altricial rodents attribute dramatic changes in perinatal cardiomyocyte growth, maturation, and attrition to stimuli associated with birth. Our purpose was to determine whether birth is a critical trigger controlling perinatal cardiomyocyte growth, maturation and attrition in a precocial large mammal, sheep (Ovis aries). Hearts from 0-61 d postnatal lambs were dissected or enzymatically dissociated. Cardiomyocytes were measured by micromorphometry, cell cycle activity assessed by immunohistochemistry, and nuclear number counted after DNA staining. Integration of this new data with published fetal data from our laboratory demonstrate that a newly appreciated >30% decrease in myocyte number occurred in the last 10 d of gestation (P < 0.0005) concomitant with an increase in cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (P < 0.05), indicative of apoptosis. Bisegmental linear regressions show that most changes in myocyte growth kinetics occur before birth (median = 15.2 d; P < 0.05). Right ventricular but not left ventricular cell number increases in the neonate, by 68% between birth and 60 d postnatal (P = 0.028). We conclude that in sheep few developmental changes in cardiomyocytes result from birth, excepting the different postnatal degrees of free wall hypertrophy between the ventricles. Furthermore, myocyte number is reduced in both ventricles immediately before term, but proliferation increases myocyte number in the neonatal right ventricle."
https://openalex.org/W821765141,"Tubular epithelial cells in the kidney are continuously exposed to urinary fluid shear stress (FSS) generated by urine movement and recent in vitro studies suggest that changes of FSS could contribute to kidney injury. However it is unclear whether FSS alters the epithelial characteristics of the renal tubule. Here, we evaluated in vitro and in vivo the influence of FSS on epithelial characteristics of renal proximal tubular cells taking the organization of junctional complexes and the presence of the primary cilium as markers of epithelial phenotype. Human tubular cells (HK-2) were subjected to FSS (0.5 Pa) for 48 h. Control cells were maintained under static conditions. Markers of tight junctions (Claudin-2, ZO-1), Par polarity complex (Pard6), adherens junctions (E-Cadherin, β-Catenin) and the primary cilium (α-acetylated Tubulin) were analysed by quantitative PCR, Western blot or immunocytochemistry. In response to FSS, Claudin-2 disappeared and ZO-1 displayed punctuated and discontinuous staining in the plasma membrane. Expression of Pard6 was also decreased. Moreover, E-Cadherin abundance was decreased, while its major repressors Snail1 and Snail2 were overexpressed, and β-Catenin staining was disrupted along the cell periphery. Finally, FSS subjected-cells exhibited disappeared primary cilium. Results were confirmed in vivo in a uninephrectomy (8 months) mouse model where increased FSS induced by adaptive hyperfiltration in remnant kidney was accompanied by both decreased epithelial gene expression including ZO-1, E-cadherin and β-Catenin and disappearance of tubular cilia. In conclusion, these results show that proximal tubular cells lose an important number of their epithelial characteristics after long term exposure to FSS both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the changes in urinary FSS associated with nephropathies should be considered as potential insults for tubular cells leading to disorganization of the tubular epithelium."

In this study, we investigated the rate of immunologic and/or virologic progression (ImmP/VirP) and its determinants in the ANRS CO21/CODEX cohort. Immunologic progression was defined as a lasting fall in CD4+T cell count below 350/mm(3) or more than 200/mm(3) with a baseline count below 600/mm(3). Virologic progression was defined as a HIV viral load (VL) above 2000 copies/mL on two consecutive determinations. Clinical characteristics, immune activation, ultrasensitive HIV VL and total HIV DNA were analyzed. Disease progression was observed in 15 of the 217 patients followed up between 2009 and 2013 (ImmP, n = 10; VirP, n = 5). Progressors had higher ultrasensitive HIV RNA levels at inclusion (i.e. 1-2 years before progression) than non-progressors. ImmP had also lower CD4+T cell nadir and CD4+T cell count at inclusion, and VirP had higher HIV DNA levels in blood. T cell activation and IP10 levels at inclusion were significantly higher in ImmP than in non-progressors. In summary, the lasting loss of CD4+T cells, residual HIV replication and basal levels of immune activation appear to be major determinants of progression in HICs. These factors should be considered for adjusting their follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2127463586,"In this study, we evaluated the interactions between Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Candida glabrata in mixed infections. Initially, these interactions were studied in biofilms formed in vitro. CFU/mL values of C. albicans were lower in mixed biofilms when compared to the single biofilms, verifying 77% and 89% of C. albicans reduction when this species was associated with C. glabrata and C. krusei, respectively. After that, we expanded this study for in vivo host models of experimental candidiasis. G. mellonella larvae were inoculated with monotypic and heterotypic Candida suspensions for analysis of survival rate and quantification of fungal cells in the haemolymph. In the groups with single infections, 100% of the larvae died within 18 h after infection with C. albicans. However, interaction groups achieved 100% mortality after 72 h of infection by C. albicans-C. glabrata and 96 h of infection by C. albicans-C. krusei. C. albicans CFU/mL values from larvae hemolymph were lower in the interacting groups compared with the monoespecies group after 12 h of infection. In addition, immunosuppressed mice were also inoculated with monotypic and heterotypic microbial suspensions to induce oral candidiasis. C. albicans CFU/mL values recovered from oral cavity of mice were higher in the group with single infection by C. albicans than the groups with mixed infections by C. albicans-C. glabrata and C. albicans-C. krusei. Moreover, the group with single infection by C. albicans had a higher degree of hyphae and epithelial changes in the tongue dorsum than the groups with mixed infections. We concluded that single infections by C. albicans were more harmful for animal models than mixed infections with non-albicans species, suggesting that C. albicans establish competitive interactions with C. krusei and C. glabrata during biofilm formation and development of experimental candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W1748123995,"Recent evidence suggests an important role for outer retinal cells in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Here we investigated the effect of the visual cycle inhibitor retinylamine (Ret-NH2) on the development of early DR lesions. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (male, 2 months old when diabetes was induced) were made diabetic with streptozotocin, and some were given Ret-NH2 once per week. Lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT)-deficient mice and P23H mutant mice were similarly studied. Mice were euthanized after 2 (WT and Lrat−/−) and 8 months (WT) of study to assess vascular histopathology, accumulation of albumin, visual function, and biochemical and physiological abnormalities in the retina. Non-retinal effects of Ret-NH2 were examined in leukocytes treated in vivo. Superoxide generation and expression of inflammatory proteins were significantly increased in retinas of mice diabetic for 2 or 8 months, and the number of degenerate retinal capillaries and accumulation of albumin in neural retina were significantly increased in mice diabetic for 8 months compared with nondiabetic controls. Administration of Ret-NH2 once per week inhibited capillary degeneration and accumulation of albumin in the neural retina, significantly reducing diabetes-induced retinal superoxide and expression of inflammatory proteins. Superoxide generation also was suppressed in Lrat−/− diabetic mice.

Recently, specialized retinal neuronal cells (photoreceptors) have been identified as major contributors to the vascular damage in DR (15de Gooyer T.E. Stevenson K.A. Humphries P. Simpson D.A.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 16586-16591Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Stitt and co-workers (15de Gooyer T.E. Stevenson K.A. Humphries P. Simpson D.A. Gardiner T.A. Stitt A.W. Retinopathy is reduced during experimental diabetes in a mouse model of outer retinal degeneration.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5561-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that diabetes did not cause the expected decrease in density of the retinal microvasculature in mice lacking rhodopsin (which secondarily leads to photoreceptor degeneration). The authors concluded that loss of the outer retina reduced the severity of DR in that model. In the retina, a photon of light is converted into an electrical signal by the phototransduction machinery of photoreceptors. When struck by light, opsin-bound 11-cis-retinal is photoisomerized to its all-trans stereoisomer. All-trans-retinal then is released from the opsin binding pocket, reduced to all-trans-retinol, and transported to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) where it is esterified by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and converted to 11-cis-retinol by the retinal pigmented epithelium-specific 65-kDa protein (RPE65). Finally, it is oxidized to 11-cis-retinal before traveling back to the photoreceptor outer segment to regenerate the visual pigments and photosensitivity of the photoreceptors. This regeneration pathway of chromophore is known as the visual (retinoid) cycle. All-trans-retinylamine (Ret-NH2) is structurally similar to vitamin A (Fig. 1) but acts as a visual cycle inhibitor by selectively inhibiting RPE65 in the RPE. RPE65 catalyzes the conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinal during the visual cycle, and thus its inhibition results in slowing of the visual cycle in rod photoreceptor cells. Ret-NH2 has also been shown to sequester reactive aldehydes (particularly all-trans-retinal) (18Zhang J. Dong Z. Mundla S.R. Hu X.E. Seibel W. Papoian R. Palczewski K. Golczak M. Expansion of first-in-class drug candidates that sequester toxic all-trans-retinal and prevent light-induced retinal degeneration.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 87: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mice treated with all-trans-Ret-NH2 displayed profound delayed dark adaptation following light exposure (19Golczak M. Kuksa V.

N-Retinylamides can be mobilized back to Ret-NH2 by hydrolysis, thus acting as a slow release depot of Ret-NH2 in cells expressing LRAT. N-Retinylamides are the dominant form of the drug that accumulates in RPE. Their levels build up within 2 h after intraperitoneal injection of Ret-NH2 to reach ∼100 pmol/eye after which their levels slowly decline over the next 7–10 days, reaching a relatively low but stable level of 2–4 pmol/eye (19Golczak M.

Lrat−/− mice are chromophore-deficient, and consequently their rod and cone visual functions are severely attenuated at an early age (30Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D.

In the present report, we demonstrate that administration of Ret-NH2 to diabetic animals inhibits both the vascular (capillary degeneration and abnormal leakage) and neural (visual function) defects that characterize early stages of DR. In addition, the unique actions of Ret-NH2 provide unique insight into the pathogenesis of DR. Our findings suggest that RPE cells and possibly also the visual cycle contribute to the development of DR. Neither the RPE nor enzymes of the visual cycle have previously been identified as potential contributors to the pathogenesis of DR or as targets for therapeutic inhibition of that retinopathy.

Diabetes was induced by five sequential daily intraperitoneal injections of a freshly prepared solution of streptozotocin in citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 60 mg/kg of body weight. After hyperglycemia was verified at least three times during the 2nd week after streptozotocin, diabetic mice were randomly assigned to remain as untreated diabetic controls or to be administered therapy. Insulin was given as needed to prevent weight loss without preventing hyperglycemia and glucosuria (0–0.2 unit of neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin subcutaneously, 0–3 times/week). Blood glucose and HbA1c were measured as reported previously (10Lee C.A. Li G. Patel M.D. Petrash J.M. Benetz B.A. Veenstra A. Amengual J. von Lintig J. Burant C.J. Tang J. Kern T.S.

Because blood sugar and insulin treatment are known to influence the development and severity of DR, considerable effort was made to keep glycemia similar in diabetics treated with and without Ret-NH2. Treatment of animals conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on Treatment of Animals in Research as well as to institutional guidelines. Animals were studied for 2- or 8-month duration of diabetes to determine the effects of potential therapies on molecular and histopathologic changes of the retina, respectively. All animals were euthanized 4–6 days after the last injection of Ret-NH2. Ret-NH2 was synthesized as described previously (19Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Positively charged retinoids are potent and selective inhibitors of the trans-cis isomerization in the retinoid (visual) cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Initially, a single dose of the amine was injected intraperitoneally into diabetic mice at doses of 0.05–1.0 mg/mouse, and retinal generation of superoxide and visual function were measured 3, 7, and 14 days later. Several diabetic mice died after administration of the 1 mg/mouse dose, so that dose was not studied further. Then the selected lower dose was administered once per week to diabetic mice for 2 months while assessing effects of therapy on retinal superoxide, expression of inflammatory proteins, and visual function. After selection of a safe and effective dose and frequency of its administration (0.2 mg/animal, once per week), a long term (8-month) study was performed to assess the effects of this treatment on diabetes-induced degeneration and dysfunction of retinal capillaries and visual function. In the 2- and 8-month studies, most animals were euthanized 4 days after the previous injection of retinylamine. Retinylamine was not given to nondiabetic animals. Freshly isolated retinas were incubated in 200 μl of Krebs-Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) with 5 or 30 mm glucose for 5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Luminescence indicating the presence of superoxide was measured 5 min after addition of 0.54 mm (final concentration) lucigenin as published previously (33Du Y. Tang J. Li G. Berti-Mattera L.

At 8 months of diabetes, sterile FITC-BSA (50 μg/μl) in phosphate-buffered saline (0.138 m NaCl, 0.0027 m KCl (pH 7.4)) was injected into the tail veins of mice at 100 μg/g. After 20 min, mice were euthanized, and their eyes were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and then frozen in O.C.T. (optimal cutting temperature compound) in isopentane on dry ice after infusion with sucrose. Retinal cryosections were cut and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Leakage of albumin was estimated from measurements of FITC-BSA in the inner plexiform layer of the neural retina using computer-assisted microscopy. Vascular permeability in diabetes is expressed as the ratio of FITC-dextran concentration in neural retina relative to that in plasma and compared with that of nondiabetic animals. DR is a slowly developing disease, and rodent models develop only the early stages of this retinopathy during their lives. After 8 months of diabetes, mouse eyes were fixed in formalin, and one retina from each animal was isolated, washed in running water overnight, and digested for 2 h in elastase as we reported previously (39Veenstra A.A.

When totally cleaned of neural cells, the isolated vasculature was laid out on a glass microscope slide, dried overnight, stained with hematoxylin and periodic acid-Schiff, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Degenerate (acellular) capillaries were quantitated in six to seven field areas corresponding to the mid-retina (200× magnification) in a masked manner. Acellular capillaries reported per square millimeter of retinal area were identified as capillary-sized vessel tubes having no nuclei along their length. We estimated whether or not photoreceptors had degenerated in diabetic mice by counting the number of layers in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in histologic cross-sections of retina. Using photomicrographs generated for the permeability measurements, we counted the number of cells of the ONL in two areas on either side of the optic nerve (∼300 μm from the optic nerve), and the resulting values were averaged together to compute a single estimate for each animal. WT diabetic and nondiabetic mice from the 8-month study served as controls for another experiment run simultaneously (9Du Y. Cramer M. Lee C.A. Tang J. Muthusamy A. Antonetti D.A. Jin H.

Retinas were isolated, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for immunoblotting. Samples (50 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. Antibodies for ICAM-1 (1:2,000; Proteintech, Chicago, IL) and inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and phospho-IκB and IκB (1:200 and 1:1,000 dilutions, respectively; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were applied followed by secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing, slides were visualized for enhanced chemiluminescence. Eyes from WT control and mice diabetic for 2 months were collected after (a) 24-h dark adaptation and (b) bleaching followed by dark adaption (which shows that the mice were able to regenerate 11-cis-retinaldehyde after bleaching). For retinoid extraction and HPLC analyses, all procedures were carried out under dim red light. Retinoids were extracted from eyecups, including the retina and RPE. The tissue was transferred into 200 μl of 2 m NH2OH (pH 6.8) and 200 μl of methanol and homogenized by sonification (five bursts for 5 s, 20% of maximum power). Retinoids were extracted from the homogenate as described previously (21Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Kubota R. Palczewski K.

HPLC analysis was performed on a normal phase ZORBAX SIL column (Agilent Technologies) in 10% ethyl acetate, hexane at an isocratic flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. Individual retinoids were determined by their retention times and spectral characteristics as compared with those of authentic standards. For quantification of molar amounts, peak integrals were scaled with defined amounts of reference retinoids. The reference retinoids all-trans-retinyl palmitate, 11-cis-retinal, and all-trans-retinal were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Corresponding retinal oximes were obtained by their reaction with NH2OH. The amount of a retinal isomer was determined by the total peak areas of both its syn- and anti-retinal oxime. Resulting amounts were summed to provide the total amount of 11-cis-retinal and all-trans-retinal in pmol/eye. Homogenates were made of both leukocytes from WT and Lrat−/− mice and from immortalized mouse retinal endothelial cells (42Su X. Sorenson C.M. Sheibani N. Isolation and characterization of murine retinal endothelial cells.Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). All-trans-retinol esterification was carried out essentially as described (21Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Kubota R. Palczewski K.

Although previous studies have shown that Sox2 is phosphorylated in human ESCs, the biological significance of Sox2 phosphorylation in ESC maintenance and reprogramming has not been well understood. In this study we have identified new phosphorylation sites on Sox2 and have further demonstrated that Cdk2-mediated Sox2 phosphorylation at Ser-39 and Ser-253 is required for establishing the pluripotent state during reprogramming but is dispensable for ESC maintenance. Mass spectrometry analysis of purified Sox2 protein has identified new phosphorylation sites on two tyrosine and six serine/Threonine residues. Cdk2 physically interacts with Sox2 and phosphorylates Sox2 at Ser-39 and Ser-253 in vitro. Surprisingly, Sox2 phosphorylation at Ser-39 and Ser-253 is dispensable for ESC self-renewal and cell cycle progression. In addition, Sox2 phosphorylation enhances its ability to establish the pluripotent state during reprogramming by working with Oct4 and Klf4. Finally, Cdk2 can also modulate the ability of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 in reprogramming fibroblasts back into pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, this study has for the first time demonstrated that Sox2 phosphorylation by Cdk2 promotes the establishment but not the maintenance of the pluripotent state. It might also help explain why the inactivation of CDK inhibitors such as p53, p21, and Arf/Ink4 promotes the induction of pluripotent stem cells.

In human and mouse ESCs, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog represent core transcription factors for maintaining the pluripotent state by sustaining the expression of pluripotency genes and repressing the expression of lineage differentiation genes (12Jaenisch R.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has identified four phosphorylation sites on Sox2, namely Ser-246, Ser-249, Ser-250, and Ser-251, in human ESCs (13Van Hoof D. Muñoz J. Braam S.R. Pinkse M.W.

Interestingly, their phosphorylation promotes SUMOylation of Sox2 on the site located upstream of the phosphorylation sites in human ESCs (13Van Hoof D. Muñoz J. Braam S.R. Pinkse M.W. Linding R.

SUMOylation of Sox2 at Lys-247 inhibits the ability of Sox2 to bind to its transcriptional targets and its interaction with Oct4 (15Wu Y. Guo Z. Wu H. Wang X. Yang L. Shi X. Du J. Tang B. Li W.

Commun. 2006; 351: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Likely Sox2 phosphorylation at these sites negatively regulates its function in controlling ESC pluripotency. It has recently been shown that Sox2 phosphorylation at Thr-118 by Akt promotes the establishment of the pluripotent state during reprogramming (17Jeong C.H. Cho Y.Y. Kim M.O. Kim S.H. Cho E.J. Lee S.Y. Jeon Y.J. Lee K.Y. Yao K. Keum Y.S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Phosphorylation of Sox2 cooperates in reprogramming to pluripotent stem cells.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sox2 monomethylation at Lys-119 by Set7 inhibits its transcriptional activity and induces its ubiquitination and degradation, and Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-1118 and Set-mediated Sox2 methylation at Lys-119 mutually inhibit each other (18Fang L. Zhang L. Wei W. Jin X. Wang P. Tong Y. Li J. Du J.X. Wong J. A methylation-phosphorylation switch determines Sox2 stability and function in ESC maintenance or differentiation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 537-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Acetylation of Sox2 on a lysine residue in the nuclear localization sequence promotes Sox2 nuclear export, thus decreasing its function in the nucleus (19Baltus G.A. Kowalski M.P. Zhai H. Tutter A.V. Quinn D. Wall D. Kadam S. Acetylation of sox2 induces its nuclear export in embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, Oct4 and Nanog are also phosphorylated (14Swaney D.L. Wenger C.D. Thomson J.A. Coon J.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Brumbaugh J. Hou Z. Russell J.D. Howden S.E. Yu P. Ledvina A.R. Coon J.J. Thomson J.A. Phosphorylation regulates human OCT4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of Nanog phosphorylation remains unknown, Oct4 phosphorylation at Ser-111 by active ERK leads to rapid ubiquitination and protein degradation, explaining why FGF signaling promotes Oct4 degradation and thus ESC differentiation (21Spelat R.

Chem. 2012; 287: 38279-38288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Oct4 at Ser-235 stabilizes Oct4 protein and facilitates its nuclear localization and interaction with Sox2, indicating that Akt-mediated Oct4 phosphorylation helps sustain ESC self-renewal (22Lin Y. Yang Y. Li W. Chen Q. Li J. Pan X. Zhou L. Liu C. Chen C. He J. Cao H. Yao H. Zheng L. Xu X. Xia Z. Ren J. Xiao L. Li L. Shen B. Zhou H. Wang Y.J.

Therefore, posttranslational modifications of core ESC transcription factors likely play important regulatory roles in pluripotency maintenance and/or establishment. During reprogramming, Oct4 and Sox2 activate p53 (Trp53) and p21 (Cdkn1a) expression, and inactivation of p53 or p21 can enhance Oct4/Sox2-mediated iPSC induction (23Kawamura T Suzuki J. Wang Y.V.

These results suggest that Cdks play pivotal roles in cellular programming, but it remains unclear how they regulate the functions of core pluripotency factors. In this study we have demonstrated that Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of mouse Sox2 at Ser-39 and Ser-253 is dispensable for ESC self-renewal but promotes the ability to establish the pluripotent state during reprogramming. Three biological replicates of FLAG-affinity-purified Sox2 preparations were TCA-precipitated, urea-denatured, reduced, alkylated, and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) followed by modified trypsin (Promega). Another two affinity-purified fraction was digested with elastase (Calbiochem) or endoproteinase Lys-C followed by endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (29Florens L. Washburn M.P. Proteomic analysis by multidimensional protein identification technology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 328: 159-175PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide mixtures were analyzed using fully automated 10-step chromatography run as previously described (29Florens L. Washburn M.P.

Full MS spectra were recorded on the peptides over a 400–1600 m/z range followed by fragmentation at 35% collision energy on the 1st to 5th most intense ions. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 120 s (31Zhang Y. Wen Z. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Effect of dynamic exclusion duration on spectral count based quantitative proteomics.Anal.

Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were searched using SEQUEST (32Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R.

As previously described (33Xiang Y Takeo S. Florens L. Hughes S.E. Huo L.J. Gilliland W.D. Swanson S.K. Teeter K. Schwartz J.W. Washburn M.P. Jaspersen S.L. Hawley R.S.

Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08 and minimum XCorr of 1.0 for single-, 2.0 for double-, and 3.0 for triple-charged spectra. In addition, the peptides had to be at least seven amino acids long, and their ends had to comply with the specificities of the enzymes used in the digestions. All spectra matching phosphorylated peptides were visually assessed. In-house-written software, NSAF version 7, was used to extract total and modified spectral counts for each amino acid within mouse Sox2 and calculate modification levels based on local spectral counts (33Xiang Y Takeo S.

HA-tagged wild-type Cdk1–6 and dominant-negative Cdk2 and -4 were obtained from Addgene. FLAG-tagged Cdks were PCR-amplified and inserted into the vector of pEF1-IRESGFP, which was modified from pIRESGFP (Clontech) by replacing the CMV promoter with EF1 promoter. The Sox2 encoding region was amplified from cDNA by PCR and was cloned into pGEX6p1 (GE Healthcare) for the kinase assay. FLAG-Sox2 and phosphorylation-defective or -mimic Sox2 mutants were cloned into pEF1-IREGFP. Three specific shRNA targeting Sox2 3′-UTRs (Fig. 3D) were cloned into the lentiviral vector of pSicoR-EF1GFP and were further tested for knockdown efficiencies by transfecting mouse ESCs. For the Sox2 RNAi rescue constructs (Fig. 3E), wild-type Sox2 and phosphorylation mutants together with IRES-GFP were cut from pEF1-IRES-GFP vector and put into lentiviral pSicoR-Sox2-i2-EF1GFP.

Point mutations in three sites were generated with three oligonucleotides by two-step PCR mutagenesis from a template pSico-EF1α-Cdk2 vector. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Sox2 for 2 days, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added for 30 min before the cells were harvested in the RIPA buffer. Anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads were used for immunoprecipitation (IP). After the electrophoresis, autoradiography was performed using Kodak BioMax MS film. For the kinase assay, 293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Cdks were lysed in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads were used for IP. The purified FLAG-Cdks were incubated with bacterial GST-Sox2 for 1 h in 20 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm ATP, and 5 mCi [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to stop the reaction, after which they were boiled, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis. The amount of 32P-labeled proteins was evaluated by autoradiography. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from E13.5 embryos carrying an Oct4-GFP transgene and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). iPSCs and R1 ESCs were maintained on MEF feeder layers in both mES and KSR media. mES medium was prepared as DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS (Gibco) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Millipore).

MEF feeder cells were inactivated by mitomycin C. N2, NEAA, basic FGF and lipid mixture were purchased from Invitrogen. Corticosterone was purchased from Alexis. Vitamin C (catalog number 49752) and other compounds used in iCD1 were purchased from Sigma, and CHIR99021 was synthesized at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health. E14 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were maintained under feeder-free conditions in Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated ES-qualified FBS (Hyclone), 0.055 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1× Glutamax, 0.1 mm nonessential Eagle's medium, 5000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1000 units/ml LIF (Chemicon). 293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Retroviral vectors (pMXs) containing the murine cDNAs of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (6Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

These plasmids were transfected into PlatE cells using calcium phosphate transfection. Lentiviruses encoding Sox2, Sox2 mutants, Cdk2, and Cdk2 mutants under the EFa-1 promoter were prepared by transfecting lentivirus packing vector, psPAX, and pMD2G into 293T cells. MEFs within two passages were split when they reached 80–90% confluence, plated at 7500 cells/cm2 for OKS-based iPSC generation 24 h before infection. The viral supernatants were then collected and filtered 48 h later to infect MEFs with 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The same procedure was repeated once on the following day. The day that viral supernatants were removed and the induction media were added was defined as day 0 post-infection. Total iPS colonies were counted 10 days post infection in triplicate under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) based on the Oct4-GFP expression and the ESC morphology. At least three independent experiments were analyzed in this study. iPSC colonies were also picked 8–10 days (OKS combination) post-infection in iCD1. The picked colonies were subsequently expanded and maintained in KSR with a feeder layer. Photos showing the whole well were taken after 15 days post-infection with SteREO Lumar V12 (Zeiss). Feeder cells were never used in a reprogramming procedure. MEFs within two passages at 7500 cells/cm2 were conducted precisely as the iPSC generation procedure. The day that viral supernatants were removed and the test media were added was defined as day 0 post-infection. Total MEF cells numbers were determined by hemocytometer from days 1 to 9 and averaged based on twice counting for each sample. All combinations were performed in triplicate, and at least three independent experiments were analyzed in this study. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), washed 2 times with PBS (Invitrogen), and then incubated in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 3% BSA fraction V (both Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies include: monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma); anti-mNanog (1:20, R&D Systems); anti-Rex1 (1:200, produced by Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health); anti-SSEA1 (1:100; R&D Systems); anti-Oct4 (1:100, Millipore); anti-Sox2 (1:100, R&D Systems). The day after incubation with primary antibodies the cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and further incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Secondary antibodies include: Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa647 chicken anti-goat IgG (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen); Alexa647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen). Nuclei were detected by DAPI staining. A Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal microscope was used for immunofluorescence studies. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol, and 2 μg was used to synthesize cDNA with ReverTra Ace® (Toyobo) and oligo-dT (Takara). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) and the primers (Table 1) and analyzed with BioRad CFX96. Gene expression levels were calculated with -fold change (2ΔΔCt) method. Reactions were performed in triplicate and normalized on the basis of Gapdh values. All were normalized to MEF cells that were not infected with lentivirus. At least two independent samples were analyzed in this study. S.E. was determined from ΔΔCt values and log-transformed.TABLE 1PCR primersGeneSense primers 5′-3′Antisense primers 5′-3′GapdhaatttggcattgtggaagggctcattggcagcaccagtggatgcagggaDppa3tgtggagaacaagagtgactcaatccgaacaagtcttDnmt3lcggagcattgaagacatccatcatcatacaggaagaggEndooct4taggtgagccgtctttccacgcttagccaggttcgaggatEndosox2agggctgggagaaagaagagccgcgattgttgtgattagtEndoklf4aacatgcccggacttacaaattcaagggaatcctggtcttcNanogctcaagtcctgaggctgacatgaaacctgtccttgagtgcRex1cagccagaccaccatctgtcgtctccgatttgcatatctcctgEsrrbtttctggaacccatggagagagccagcacctccttctacaE-cadherincagccttcttttcggaagactggtagacagctccctatgactgKrt7aggagatcaaccgacgcacgtctcgtgaagggtcttgaggSnailcttgtgtctgcacgacctgtcttcacatccgagtgggtttEpcamgcggctcagagagactgtgccaagcatttagacgccagttt Open table in a new tab Chimeras were produced by injecting iPSCs into blastocysts derived from ICR mice followed by implantation into pseudo-pregnant ICR mice. F2 mice were breeding with chimeric mice and ICR mice to determine germ line transmission of iPSCs. ICR MEF cells within four passages were seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and infected with virus as the iPS generation procedure. The day that viral supernatants were removed and the test media were added was defined as day 0 post-infection. MEF cells were digested for protein extraction beginning with day 2 until day 4 because the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colony appeared on day 5 in which endogenous Sox2 begins to express.

It has been studied whether use of these drugs predicts AKI after cardiac surgery. The objective of this study was to examine whether administration of these agents was independently associated with AKI after non-cardiac surgery.This was a retrospective observational study. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (age ≥ 18) who underwent non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia from 2007 to 2009 at Kyoto Katsura Hospital. Exclusion criteria were urological surgery, missing creatinine values, and preoperative dialysis. The exposures of interest were pre- and/or intra-operative use of diuretics or ACE-I/ARB. Outcome variables were postoperative AKI as defined by the AKI Network (increase in creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or 150% within 48 hours, or urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hour for > 6 hours). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted and adjusted for potential confounders. Propensity scores (PS) for receiving diuretics or ACE-I/ARB therapy were estimated and PS adjustment, PS matching, and inverse probability weighting were performed.There were 137 AKI cases (5.0%) among 2,725 subjects. After statistical adjustment for patient and surgical characteristics, odds (95% CI) of postoperative AKI were 2.07 (1.10-3.89) (p = 0.02) and 0.89 (0.56-1.42) (p = 0.63) in users of diuretics and ACE-I/ARB, respectively, compared with non-users. PS adjustment, PS matching, and inverse probability weighting yielded similar results. The effect size of diuretics was significantly greater in the patients with lower propensity for diuretic use (p for interaction < 0.1).Prescription of diuretics, but not ACE-I/ARB, was independently associated with postoperative AKI after non-cardiac surgery, especially in patients with low propensity for diuretic use. It might be reasonable to withhold preoperative diuretics in these patients."

LKB1-dependent phosphorylation of distinct AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) family members determines proper β cell polarity and restricts β cell size, total β cell mass, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, the full spectrum of LKB1 effects and the mechanisms involved in the secretory phenotype remain incompletely understood. We report here that in the absence of LKB1 in β cells, GSIS is dramatically and persistently improved. The enhancement is seen both in vivo and in vitro and cannot be explained by altered cell polarity, increased β cell number, or increased insulin content. Increased secretion does require membrane depolarization and calcium influx but appears to rely mostly on a distal step in the secretion pathway. Surprisingly, enhanced GSIS is seen despite profound defects in mitochondrial structure and function in LKB1-deficient β cells, expected to greatly diminish insulin secretion via the classic triggering pathway. Thus LKB1 is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis in β cells and in parallel is a powerful negative regulator of insulin secretion.

Deletion of LKB1 in adult β cells led to cellular hypertrophy (due to increased mTORC1 activity, secondary to inactivation of AMPK), increased β cell proliferation, dramatic alteration of β cell polarity (due to inactivation of MARK2), and increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to accelerated clearance of glucose in vivo and to protection against high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance. The mechanisms underlying the enhancement of insulin secretion in LKB1-deficient β cells have remained ill-defined. It was proposed that altered polarity of β cells may enhance insulin secretion to nearby blood vessels (23Granot Z. Swisa A. Magenheim J. Stolovich-Rain M. Fujimoto W. Manduchi E. Miki T.

Recently, two direct phosphorylation targets of LKB1 were reported to act as positive regulators of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. SIK2 was shown to enhance insulin secretion via phosphorylation and degradation of CDK5R1/p35 (26Sakamaki J. Fu A. Reeks C. Baird S. Depatie C. Al Azzabi M. Bardeesy N. Gingras A.C. Yee S.P.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 13857-13862Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Deletion of either gene disrupted insulin secretion. Because LKB1 deficiency is expected to functionally inactivate both SIK2 and SAD-A, a powerful mechanism must be activated upon LKB1 deletion that can compensate for these losses and lead to a net enhancement of insulin secretion. Here we have examined the mechanisms accounting for enhanced insulin secretion in LKB1-deficient β cells. We demonstrate that enhanced secretion upon LKB1 inactivation requires the classical triggering pathway but acts primarily at a more distal step. Surprisingly, we found that LKB1 deficiency causes a dramatic deterioration of mitochondrial structure and function. However the amplification of insulin secretion by LKB1 deficiency overrides this defect, exposing a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for long term enhancement of β cell function.

For convenience, LKB1-deficient mice are labeled in the manuscript as βLKB mice. Controls were lox/lox littermates. Tamoxifen (Sigma, 20 mg/ml in corn oil) was injected subcutaneously to adult mice (1–2 months old). Two daily doses of 8 mg were used to achieve near total deletion of LKB1 in β cells, and animals were studied 2–16 months later. Because recombination occurred in utero in Ins1-Cre;LKB1lox/lox mice (30Kone M. Pullen T.J. Sun G. Ibberson M. Martinez-Sanchez A. Sayers S. Nguyen-Tu M.S. Kantor C. Swisa A. Dor Y. Gorman T.

LKB1 and AMPK differentially regulate pancreatic beta-cell identity.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 4972-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), these animals were used at younger ages (8–12 weeks) as indicated in Fig. 4. Glyburide and Nifedipine were injected intraperitoneally at the indicated doses. Measurements of blood glucose and serum insulin were performed as described elsewhere (31Nir T. Melton D.A. Dor Y. Recovery from diabetes in mice by beta cell regeneration.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The joint ethics committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees) of the Hebrew University and Hadassah Medical Center and the United Kingdom Home Office (PPL 70/06608) approved the study protocol for animal welfare. The Hebrew University is an AAALAC International-accredited institute. The pancreas was homogenized in acid ethanol (0.18 m HCl in 70% ethanol). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, homogenate was diluted 1:10 with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Insulin content was measured using the ELISA kit (Crystal Chem) and was calculated per pancreas weight. For β cell mass calculation, consecutive paraffin sections 75 μm apart spanning the entire pancreas (∼10 sections/pancreas) were stained for insulin and hematoxylin. Digital images of sections at a magnification of ×40 were obtained and stitched using NIS-Elements software, and the fraction of tissue covered by insulin staining was determined. β cell mass was calculated as the product of pancreas weight and the fraction of tissue covered by β cells. Islets were isolated using collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) injected to the pancreatic duct followed by Histopaque (1119 and 1077, Sigma) gradient. Insulin secretion experiments were performed after an overnight incubation in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin unless stated otherwise. Islets were infected with an adenovirus encoding human LKB1 (Ad-STK11, Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA). Infection was performed at the multiplicity of infection indicated in RPMI 1640 treated with 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 48 h before measurements. Insulin secretion studies were performed in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRBB) containing 114.4 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 0.5% BSA, adjusted to pH 7.35. In static incubation experiments, 25–30 islets were preincubated in basal KRBB containing 2.8 mm glucose for 1 h. Islets were then consecutively incubated at 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h each. Medium was collected at the end of each incubation period. Insulin assays were performed in Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For dynamic assessment of insulin secretion, we used a perifusion system (Biorep) equipped with a peristaltic pump. Fifty size-matched islets were placed in columns and perifused at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with KRBB at 37 °C. Perifusion started with 2.8 mm glucose for equilibration and measurement of basal secretion and then exposed to different treatments. Medium was collected to 96-well plates, and insulin was measured by ELISA (Crystal Chem) and normalized to total islet DNA or protein as indicated. DNA was isolated using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). Whole islets were loaded with fura-2AM (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C in KRBB containing 119 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.7 mmol/liter KCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, and 25 mmol/liter NaHCO3. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a CCD-based imaging system and MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging), whereas islets were kept at 37 °C and constantly perifused with KRBB containing 2.8 mm or 16.7 mm glucose at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Intracellular Ca2+ was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence intensity (at 535/30 nm) after illumination at 340 and 380 nm. For each experiment we used 8–20 islets (32Tamarina N.A. Kuznetsov A. Rhodes C.J. Bindokas V.P. Philipson L.H. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate dynamics and intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic beta cells.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In some experiments Ca2+ imaging was performed using the non-ratiometric trappable fluorescent dye fluo-2 and Nipkow spinning disc confocal microscopy as described before (33Hodson D.J. Mitchell R.K.

Lipotoxicity disrupts incretin-regulated human beta cell connectivity.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 4182-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Intracellular glutamate was measured using Glutamate Assay Kit (Sigma, MAK004) per the manufacturer's instructions. We used 150 islets for each measurement. Calculated glutamate concentration was normalized to total protein content (measured by BCA kit, Pierce). To measure mitochondrial membrane potential we used TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester; Molecular Probes). Dissociated islet cells were plated 2 days before the experiment on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes. Cells were incubated for 1.5 h before imaging with TMRE (10 nm) and MitoTracker Green (100 nm) loaded together with the MDR inhibitor, verapamil (50 μm), at 11 mm glucose. Analysis was performed using confocal imaging after wash out of MitoTracker Green, and mitochondrial membrane potential changes were calculated as previously described (34Wikstrom J.D. Katzman S.M.

NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured using the same imaging system and culture conditions described for calcium. Autofluorescence derived from NADH was excited at 365 nm and measured at 495 nm in dye-free islets. 6–15 whole islets were used for each experiment. Fluorescence readings of each islet were normalized to the first reading and averaged for each mouse. For ATP/ADP imaging, isolated islets were cultured for 48 h with adenovirus (∼100 multiplicity of infection) expressing Perceval (35Tarasov A.I. Semplici F. Ravier M.A. Bellomo E.A. Pullen T.J.

Islets were then placed in a custom-manufactured 36 °C chamber (Digital Pixel) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope coupled to a Nipkow spinning disk head. Islets were kept at 36 °C and continuously perfused with bicarbonate buffer at 95% O2/CO2 (37Hodson D.J. Tarasov A.I. Gimeno Brias S. Mitchell R.K. Johnston N.R. Haghollahi S. Cane M.C. Bugliani M.

Endocrinol. 2014; 28: 860-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Results were normalized to the minimum fluorescence (Fmin). For real-time measurements of mitochondrial oxygen consumption we used Seahorse XF analyzer (38Wikstrom J.D. Sereda S.B. Stiles L. Elorza A. Allister E.M. Neilson A. Ferrick D.A. Wheeler M.B. Shirihai O.S. A novel high-throughput assay for islet respiration reveals uncoupling of rodent and human islets.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e33023Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Islets (50/well) were placed in 24-well islet plates with unbuffered DMEM supplied with 1% FCS and 2.8 mm glucose at 37 °C without CO2. Islets were then incubated at high glucose (16.7 mm) followed by consecutive treatment with FCCP (carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, 1 μm) and rotenone (5 μm) plus antimycin (5 μm). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was calculated by the XF analyzer AKOS algorithm and normalized to basal levels or to total protein content. Protein was extracted with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer, and total protein content was determined by Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). To measure mitochondrial DNA copy number, DNA was isolated from fresh whole islets or from fixed sorted β-cells by standard phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the ratio between cytochrome b (mitochondrial) and Aprt or L1 repetitive element (nuclear) with the following primers: cytochrome b, 5′-GCAGTCATAGCCACAGCA TTT-3′ and 5′-AAGTGGAAAGCGAAGAATCG-3′; Aprt, 5′-GGGATATCTCGCCCCTCTT-3′ and 5′-CACTCGCCTGCGATGTAGT-3′; L1, 5′-GTTACAGAGACGGAGTTTGGAG-3′ and 5′-CGTTTGGATGCTGATTATGGG-3′. Pancreas was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (Sigma), and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol followed by propylene oxide (Sigma). For embedding we used Agar 100 Resin (Agar Scientific). For imaging we used 80-nm sections stained with 5% uranyl acetate for 10 min followed by 10 min with lead citrate. Samples were visualized with a transmission electron microscope (Technai 12, Phillips) equipped with a MegaView II CCD camera. To assess structural defects in mitochondria, we determined for each EM-imaged mitochondrion whether it was swollen or had defective cristae. Docked granules were counted up to 200 nm from the plasma membrane and calculated as number of granules per membrane length. Protein was extracted from fresh islets by radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors leupeptin, aprotonin, and vanadate. Total protein was determined by Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Antibodies used were mouse anti-β-actin 1:10,000 (Sigma) and rabbit anti cytochrome c 1:1000 (Cell Signaling). RNA was isolated and purified from fresh islets with TRI reagent (Sigma) and RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using 200 ng of RNA by the High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative real-time PCR we used SYBR Green mix (Quanta Biosciences) and the following primers: PGC1α, 5′-GAGCCGTGACCACTGACAA-3′ and 5′-TGGTTTGCTGCATGGTTCT-3′; PGC1β, 5′-ATCGGGGTCCACCTTGAA-3′ and 5′-GGGTCACAGTTCTGGTTTGC-3′; β-actin, 5′-CACAGCTTCTTTGCAGCTCCT-3′ and 5′-GTCATCCATGGCGAACTGG-3′.

https://openalex.org/W1937101676,"Amylomaltase MalQ is essential for the metabolism of maltose and maltodextrins in Escherichia coli. It catalyzes transglycosylation/disproportionation reactions in which glycosyl or dextrinyl units are transferred among linear maltodextrins of various lengths. To elucidate the molecular basis of transglycosylation by MalQ, we have determined three crystal structures of this enzyme, i.e. the apo-form, its complex with maltose, and an inhibitor complex with the transition state analog acarviosine-glucose-acarbose, at resolutions down to 2.1 A. MalQ represents the first example of a mesophilic bacterial amylomaltase with known structure and exhibits an N-terminal extension of about 140 residues, in contrast with previously described thermophilic enzymes. This moiety seems unique to amylomaltases from Enterobacteriaceae and folds into two distinct subdomains that associate with different parts of the catalytic core. Intriguingly, the three MalQ crystal structures appear to correspond to distinct states of this enzyme, revealing considerable conformational changes during the catalytic cycle. In particular, the inhibitor complex highlights the requirement of both a 3-OH group and a 4-OH group (or α1–4-glycosidic bond) at the acceptor subsite +1 for the catalytically competent orientation of the acid/base catalyst Glu-496. Using an HPLC-based MalQ enzyme assay, we could demonstrate that the equilibrium concentration of maltodextrin products depends on the length of the initial substrate; with increasing numbers of glycosidic bonds, less glucose is formed. Thus, both structural and enzymatic data are consistent with the extremely low hydrolysis rates observed for amylomaltases and underline the importance of MalQ for the metabolism of maltodextrins in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1579824490,"The activity of individual sensory neurons can be predictive of an animal's choices. These decision signals arise from network properties dependent on feedforward and feedback inputs; however, the relative contributions of these inputs are poorly understood. We determined the role of feedforward pathways to decision signals in MT by recording neuronal activity while monkeys performed motion and depth tasks. During each session, we reversibly inactivated V2 and V3, which provide feedforward input to MT that conveys more information about depth than motion. We thus monitored the choice-related activity of the same neuron both before and during V2/V3 inactivation. During inactivation, MT neurons became less predictive of decisions for the depth task but not the motion task, indicating that a feedforward pathway that gives rise to tuning preferences also contributes to decision signals. We show that our data are consistent with V2/V3 input conferring structured noise correlations onto the MT population."
https://openalex.org/W2225889451,"Background The C9ORF72 expansion is one of the most common genetic etiologies observed with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Revised diagnostic criteria for bvFTD (FTDC) were recently introduced but only a few studies have evaluated the accuracy of these criteria. Objective The objective of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the FTDC criteria and assess the psychiatric history of these patients. Methods The study examined 36 patients carrying the C9ORF72 expansion and suffering from bvFTD (N = 32) or from bvFTD with motor neuron disease (bvFTD-MND, N = 4). Neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, structural brain imaging and PET/SPECT data were evaluated. Results We found 0.75 sensitivity (SD 0.44, 95%CI 0.57–0.87) for possible bvFTD and 0.64 (SD 0.44, 95%CI 0.57–0.87) for probable bvFTD. The sensitivity was even higher in bvFTD patients without MND, i.e., 0.81 for possible bvFTD and 0.69 for probable bvFTD. PET/SPECT was normal in 17.6% of scanned patients with bvFTD. A history of psychiatric symptoms (psychotic and/or mood symptoms) was detected in 61% of cases. Conclusions The FTDC possible and probable bvFTD criteria seem to identify the majority of the C9ORF72 expansion carriers with bvFTD, even though they exhibit only a limited number of behavioral criteria but a significant amount of psychiatric symptoms. The presence of a normal PET/SPECT does not exclude the possibility the C9ORF72 associated bvFTD."

A case-control study was designed to assess comprehensive contributions of the multiple genetic modifiers of bilirubin metabolism on significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Chinese descendents. Eleven common mutations and polymorphisms across five bilirubin metabolism genes, namely those encoding UGT1A1, HMOX1, BLVRA, SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, were determined using the high resolution melt (HRM) assay or PCR-capillary electrophoresis analysis. A total of 129 hyperbilirubinemic infants and 108 control subjects were evaluated. Breastfeeding and the presence of the minor A allele of rs4148323 (UGTA*6) were correlated with an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia (OR=2.17, P=0.02 for breastfeeding; OR=9.776, P=0.000 for UGTA*6 homozygote; OR=3.151, P=0.000 for UGTA*6 heterozygote); whereas, increasing gestational age and the presence of –TA7 repeat variant of UGT1A1 decreased the risk (OR=0.721, P=0.003 for gestational age; OR=0.313, P=0.002 for heterozygote TA6/TA7). In addition, the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms also contributed to an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia. This detailed analysis revealed the impact of multiple genetic modifiers on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. This may support the use of genetic tests for clinical risk assessment. Furthermore, the established HRM assay can serve as an effective method for large-scale investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1604001323,"The objective of this study was to investigate depth perception in astronauts during and after spaceflight by studying their sensitivity to reversible perspective figures in which two-dimensional images could elicit two possible depth representations. Other ambiguous figures that did not give rise to a perception of illusory depth were used as controls. Six astronauts and 14 subjects were tested in the laboratory during three sessions for evaluating the variability of their responses in normal gravity. The six astronauts were then tested during four sessions while on board the International Space Station for 5-6 months. They were finally tested immediately after return to Earth and up to one week later. The reaction time decreased throughout the sessions, thus indicating a learning effect. However, the time to first percept reversal and the number of reversals were not different in orbit and after the flight compared to before the flight. On Earth, when watching depth-ambiguous perspective figures, all subjects reported seeing one three-dimensional interpretation more often than the other, i.e. a ratio of about 70-30%. In weightlessness this asymmetry gradually disappeared and after 3 months in orbit both interpretations were seen for the same duration. These results indicate that the perception of ""illusory"" depth is altered in astronauts during spaceflight. This increased depth ambiguity is attributed to the lack of the gravitational reference and the eye-ground elevation for interpreting perspective depth cues."

Our goal was to characterize the steps underlying sensitization of the nerve cells to neurotoxicity when Aβ-target receptors are present. Of particular focus was the connection of the activated signaling molecules to oxidative stress. Differentiated neuroblastoma cells expressing mouse α4β2-nAChRs were exposed to Aβ1–42 for intervals from 30 min to 3 days. The cells and cell-derived protein extracts were then probed for activation of signaling pathway molecules (ERK, JNK, CaMKII, CREB, MARCKS, Fyn, tau). Our results show substantial, progressive activation of ERK in response to nanomolar Aβ exposure, starting at the earliest time point. Increased ERK activation was followed by JNK activation as well as an increased expression of PHF-tau, paralleled by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The impact of prolonged Aβ on the levels of pERK, pJNK, and ROS was attenuated by MEK-selective and JNK-selective inhibitors. In addition, the MEK inhibitor as well as a JNK inhibitor attenuated Aβ-induced nuclear fragmentation, which followed the changes in ROS levels.

https://openalex.org/W857749578,"Soil salt-alkalization is a major limiting factor for crop production in many regions. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season C4 perennial rhizomatous bunchgrass and a target lignocellulosic biofuel species. The objective of this study was to evaluate relative alkali-salt tolerance among 30 switchgrass lines. Tillers of each switchgrass line were transplanted into pots filled with fine sand. Two months after transplanting, plants at E5 developmental stage were grown in either half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with 0 mM Na+ (control) or half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with 150 mM Na+ and pH of 9.5 (alkali-salt stress treatment) for 20 d. Alkali-salt stress damaged cell membranes [higher electrolyte leakage (EL)], reduced leaf relative water content (RWC), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration rate (Tr). An alkali-salt stress tolerance trait index (ASTTI) for each parameter was calculated based on the ratio of the value under alkali-salt stress and the value under non-stress conditions for each parameter of each line. Relative alkali-salt tolerance was determined based on principal components analysis and cluster analysis of the physiological parameters and their ASTTI values. Significant differences in alkali-salt stress tolerance were found among the 30 lines. Lowland lines TEM-SEC, Alamo, TEM-SLC and Kanlow were classified as alkali-salt tolerant. In contrast, three lowland lines (AM-314/MS-155, BN-13645-64) and two upland lines (Caddo and Blackwell-1) were classified as alkali-salt sensitive. The results suggest wide variations exist in alkali-salt stress tolerance among the 30 switchgrass lines. The approach of using a combination of principal components and cluster analysis of the physiological parameters and related ASTTI is feasible for evaluating alkali-salt tolerance in switchgrass."
https://openalex.org/W2121134057,"Human toxocariasis is a parasitic zoonosis with a worldwide distribution but is underdiagnosed with an underestimated impact on human health. The ingestion of embryonated eggs of Toxocara spp. present on the hands or in contaminated food or water is the main mode of infection. The only record of Toxocara congenital infection in humans occurred in a premature infant. Helminth infections during pregnancy may be associated with reproductive disorders. Studies investigating the occurrence of toxocariasis in pregnancy are scarce, as is research on the possible implications of these parasites in reproductive health. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to Toxocara spp. in pregnant women and to identify risk factors associated with its infection.The cross-sectional study of the seropositivity of specific antibodies for Toxocara spp. was performed on 280 pregnant women. Serum samples were examined with enzyme-linked immunoassay. Epidemiological data were obtained through a questionnaire containing information about obstetric history, general life style choices, and the social and economic status of the women. The prevalence of Toxocara spp. IgG in pregnant women was 6.4%. Some of the risk factors associated with the infection were owning dogs (p = 0.003), living in the city centre (p = 0.028), living at the city beach (p = 0.003), and having a family income at or below minimum wage (p < 0.001). There was no association between reproductive disorders and Toxocara seropositivity.The seroprevalence of 6.4% for Toxocara spp. in pregnant women shows that there was exposure to the parasite. The study demonstrates the need for attention for the completion of clinical diagnosis parameters, as well as the expansion of highly specific serological studies in different regions to understand the impact of toxocariasis in pregnancy."

Acute and late toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria.The median follow-up period was 37.3 months (range, 6.3-45.1 months). The 3-year estimated local failure-free survival, regional failure-free survival, locoregional failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival were 95.5%, 97.0%, 94.0%, 92.1%, 86.8% and 97.0%, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed primary gross tumor volume, N stage and EBV-DNA to be independent predictors of VMAT outcomes (P < 0.05). The most common acute and late side effects were grade 2-3 mucositis (78%) and xerostomia (83%, 61%, 34%, and 9% at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after VMAT), respectively.VMAT for the primary treatment of NPC achieved very high locoregional control with a favorable toxicity profile. The time-saving benefit of VMAT will enable more patients to receive precision radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W761500788,"To investigate whether a value of information analysis, commonly applied in health care evaluations, is feasible and meaningful in the field of crime prevention.Interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency are increasingly being evaluated according to their cost-effectiveness. Results of cost-effectiveness models are subject to uncertainty in their cost and effect estimates. Further research can reduce that parameter uncertainty. The value of such further research can be estimated using a value of information analysis, as illustrated in the current study. We built upon an earlier published cost-effectiveness model that demonstrated the comparison of two interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency. Outcomes were presented as costs per criminal activity free year.At a societal willingness-to-pay of €71,700 per criminal activity free year, further research to eliminate parameter uncertainty was valued at €176 million. Therefore, in this illustrative analysis, the value of information analysis determined that society should be willing to spend a maximum of €176 million in reducing decision uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. Moreover, the results suggest that reducing uncertainty in some specific model parameters might be more valuable than in others.Using a value of information framework to assess the value of conducting further research in the field of crime prevention proved to be feasible. The results were meaningful and can be interpreted according to health care evaluation studies. This analysis can be helpful in justifying additional research funds to further inform the reimbursement decision in regard to interventions for juvenile delinquents."
https://openalex.org/W841014437,"The decreasing costs of genome sequencing is creating a demand for scalable storage and processing tools and techniques to deal with the large amounts of generated data. Referential compression is one of these techniques, in which the similarity between the DNA of organisms of the same or an evolutionary close species is exploited to reduce the storage demands of genome sequences up to 700 times. The general idea is to store in the compressed file only the differences between the to-be-compressed and a well-known reference sequence. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the performance of referential compression by removing the most costly phase of the process, the complete reference indexing. Our approach, called On-Demand Indexing (ODI) compresses human chromosomes five to ten times faster than other state-of-the-art tools (on average), while achieving similar compression ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2335982530,"Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription factors (STAT3 and STAT5) play important roles in breast epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. They have been investigated extensively in established breast cancer, but their activation status in precancerous lesions has not been reported. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues from 59 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and 31 cases of normal human breast tissue as well as 21 cases of usual ductal hyperplasias (UDH) were obtained from the First Hospital of Jilin University, China, and stained for pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 by immunohistochemistry. The median percentage of pSTAT5+ cells in ADH was 12%, not significantly deviant from that in normal breast. The median percentage of pSTAT3+ cells in ADH was 30%, significantly higher than that of normal breast. pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 were exclusive of each other—they were detected in different ADHs or in different cells within the same ADHs. In addition, both pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 were produced in similar percentages of cells in ADHs from cancer-free patients vs. ADHs that were adjacent to an invasive cancer. Our finding of a complementary expression pattern of pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in ADH suggests that these two transcription factors may have feedback inhibitory effects on each other during early stages of breast cancer evolution, and that disruption of this inverse relationship may be important in the progression from early lesions to cancer, which exhibits positive association between pSTAT3 and pSTAT5."
https://openalex.org/W793324958,"The vast majority of newly synthesized acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecules do not assemble into catalytically active oligomeric forms and are rapidly degraded intracellularly by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway. We have previously shown that AChE in skeletal muscle is regulated in part post-translationally by the availability of the noncatalytic subunit collagen Q, and others have shown that expression of a 17-amino acid N-terminal proline-rich attachment domain of collagen Q is sufficient to promote AChE tetramerization in cells producing AChE. In this study we show that muscle cells, or cell lines expressing AChE catalytic subunits, incubated with synthetic proline-rich attachment domain peptides containing the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval sequence KDEL take up and retrogradely transport them to the endoplasmic reticulum network where they induce assembly of AChE tetramers. The peptides act to enhance AChE folding thereby rescuing them from reticulum degradation. This enhanced folding efficiency occurs in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis and in turn increases total cell-associated AChE activity and active tetramer secretion. Pulse-chase studies of isotopically labeled AChE molecules show that the enzyme is rescued from intracellular degradation. These studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the large scale intracellular degradation of AChE previously observed and indicate that simple peptides alone can increase the production and secretion of this critical synaptic enzyme in muscle tissue.
