https://openalex.org/W2025049414,"Identification of a sequence of east-west trending magnetic anomalies of Mesozoic age in the western Somali Basin helps define the position of Madagascar in the Gondwana reconstruction. The anomalies are symmetric about ancient ridge segments and are flanked to the north and south by the Jurassic magnetic quiet zone. The motion of Madagascar relative to Africa was from the north and began in the middle Jurassic, about the same time as the initial breakup of Gondwanaland. Sea-floor spreading ceased when Madagascar assumed its present position in the Early Cretaceous."

Consequently, terrestrial life may be subject to relatively huge solar ultraviolet fluxes every few hundred million years."
https://openalex.org/W2094783772,"The background of and commercial needs leading to the development of practical membrane systems for the separation of industrial gases are presented. The critical issues and fundamental technical limitations that delayed earlier development of such systems and the solutions of some of the major problems in the field are discussed. Particular attention is given to the methods by which high gas fluxes and high selectivities have been achieved in hollow fibers. The performance characteristics of various practical gas separation methods are compared, and the effects of parameters such as pressure and contaminant levels are illustrated with representative examples."
https://openalex.org/W2020769378,"Oxygen isotope analyses of sanidine phenocrysts from rhyolitic sequences in Nevada, Colorado, and the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field show that delta(18)O decreased in these magmas as a function of time. This decrease in delta(18)O may have been caused by isotopic exchange between the magma and groundwater low in (18)O. For the Yellowstone Plateau rhyolites, 7000 cubic kilometers of magma could decrease in delta(18)O by 2 per mil in 600,000 years by reacting with water equivalent to 3 millimeters of precipitation per year, which is only 0.3 percent of the present annual precipitation in this region. The possibility of reaction between large magmatic bodies and meteoric water at liquidus temperatures has major implications in the possible differentiation history of the magma and in the generation of ore deposits."
https://openalex.org/W1997899944,"A nonlinear numerical model and a simple analytical theory explain the basic features of the equatorial surface jet in the Indian Ocean recently reported by Wyrtki. The observed width of this transient current, 500 kilometers, is given theoretically by twice the baroclinic equatorial radius of deformation. The numerical model reproduces all Wyrtki's observations of this natural phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2042830913,"Mollugo verticillata is the first plant species reported which has characteristics of both C(3) (Calvin-Benson pathway) and C(4) (Hatch-Slack pathway) plants. This plant species is intermediate between C(3) and C(4) plants in at least four features generally used to separate those two plant groups: leaf anatomy, cell ultrastructure, photorespiration, and primary photosynthetic products."
https://openalex.org/W2089489079,"Laminated mats composed of motile filamentous photosynthetic bacteria and nonmotile unicellular blue-green algae occur in a large number of Yellowstone hot springs at temperatures between 55 degrees and 70 degrees C. Field studies indicate that the bacteria are the predominant mat-forming component. Under low light intensities, mats composed exclusively of bacteria can be formed. The bacteria undergo a diurnal migration, moving on top of the algae dnring the night and becolming mixed again with the algae during the day of differential migration of the bacteria in daily response to reduced light intensities. This response to light is exactly opposite to that previously reported for filamentous stromatolite-forming, blue-green algae, but the net result is the same-formation of a laminated mat."

https://openalex.org/W1985645541,The black pineleaf scale insect has haploid males and diploid females. Ratios of males to females late in development ranged from 0.005 to 0.320 among insect subpopulations that were infesting different host trees. Demes well adapted to an individual ponderosa pine had a higher proportion of males than did demes that were poorly adapted to the host. Ratios of males to females rose in successive annual samples as natural selection increased insect adaptation. Gene flow between demes on different host trees produced predictable changes in the sex ratio.
https://openalex.org/W2068776995,"When African violet leaf explants are cultured in vitro, buds and shoots develop directly from the upper leaf surfaces. Three developmentally different African violet chimeras were cultured, and in each case adventitious shoots that developed into plants had the parent chimera pattern. A multicellular origin of the adventitious buds accounts for these results."

The Santa Ana wind implies very specific weather conditions for the Los Angeles coastal lowland. Destructive land uses, in part, provided the material visible in the dust plumes."
