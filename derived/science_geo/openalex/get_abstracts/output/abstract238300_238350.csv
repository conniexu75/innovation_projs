https://openalex.org/W2144644150,"Segmental duplications in the human genome are selectively enriched for genes involved in immunity, although the phenotypic consequences for host defense are unknown. We show that there are significant interindividual and interpopulation differences in the copy number of a segmental duplication encompassing the gene encoding CCL3L1 (MIP-1alphaP), a potent human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-suppressive chemokine and ligand for the HIV coreceptor CCR5. Possession of a CCL3L1 copy number lower than the population average is associated with markedly enhanced HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) susceptibility. This susceptibility is even greater in individuals who also possess disease-accelerating CCR5 genotypes. This relationship between CCL3L1 dose and altered HIV/AIDS susceptibility points to a central role for CCL3L1 in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis and indicates that differences in the dose of immune response genes may constitute a genetic basis for variable responses to infectious diseases."

Comparison of their genomes, integrated with proteomic and microarray data, with the genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii revealed a conserved core of 4500 Plasmodium genes in the central regions of the 14 chromosomes and highlighted genes evolving rapidly because of stage-specific selective pressures. Four strategies for gene expression are apparent during the parasites' life cycle: (i) housekeeping; (ii) host-related; (iii) strategy-specific related to invasion, asexual replication, and sexual development; and (iv) stage-specific. We observed posttranscriptional gene silencing through translational repression of messenger RNA during sexual development, and a 47-base 3' untranslated region motif is implicated in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2142334883,"We report that the organic salt (EDO-TTF) 2 PF 6 with ¾-filled-band (¼-filled in terms of holes), which forms an organic metal with strong electron and lattice correlation, shows a highly sensitive response to photoexcitation. An ultrafast, photoinduced phase transition from the insulator phase to the metal phase can be induced with very weak excitation intensity at near room temperature. This response makes the material attractive for applications in switching devices with room-temperature operation. The observed photo-induced spectroscopic change shows that this photoinduced phase transition process is caused by the cooperative melting of charge ordering assisted by coherent phonon generation."
https://openalex.org/W1975874773,"The sulfur-induced embrittlement of nickel has long been wrapped in mystery as to why and how sulfur weakens the grain boundaries of nickel and why a critical intergranular sulfur concentration is required. From first-principles calculations, we found that a large grain-boundary expansion is caused by a short-range overlap repulsion among densely segregated and neighboring sulfur atoms. This expansion results in a drastic grain-boundary decohesion that reduces the grain-boundary tensile strength by one order of magnitude. This decohesion may directly cause the embrittlement, because the critical sulfur concentration of this decohesion agrees well with experimental data on the embrittlement."

However, the roles of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins in TRAIL apoptosis remain elusive. Here we showed that, besides the specific cleavage and activation of Bid by caspase-8 and caspase-3, TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells required the specific cleavage of Mcl-1 at Asp-127 and Asp-157 by caspase-3, while other prototypic antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL seemed not to be affected. Mutation at Asp-127 and Asp-157 of Mcl-1 led to cellular resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In sharp contrast to cycloheximide-induced Mcl-1 dilapidation, TRAIL did not activate proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 in Jurkat cells. We further established for the first time that the C-terminal domain of Mcl-1 became proapoptotic as a result of caspase-3 cleavage, and its physical interaction and cooperation with tBid, Bak, and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 promoted mitochondrial apoptosis. These results suggested that removal of N-terminal domains of Bid by caspase-8 and Mcl-1 by caspase-3 enabled the maximal mitochondrial perturbation that potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Apoptosis exhibits two primary execution pathways downstream of the death signals, the caspase cascade (1Shi Y. Nat. Struct.

The Bcl-2 family proteins play pivotal roles in regulation of apoptosis, and the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members determines the mitochondrial response to apoptotic stimuli (6Gross A.

Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) protect mitochondrial membrane integrity, while the multidomain proapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bax and Bak) facilitate the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, from mitochondria to initiate the caspase cascade and organelle dysfunction.

Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have long been thought to be the critical regulators of cytokine withdrawal and stress-induced apoptosis (16Marsden V.S. Strasser A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 71-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), recent data have indicated that Mcl-1 may play more profound roles than Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in response to a variety of death stimuli. First, conditional gene targeting experiments show that early T and B lymphocyte development and mature lymphocyte homeostasis rely on cytokine-dependent inhibition of apoptosis by Mcl-1 (17Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast, hematopoiesis is initially normal in bcl-2-deficient (18Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) and bcl-XL-deficient mice (19Ma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or adenovirus infection (22Cuconati A. Mukherjee C. Perez D. White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) requires proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-XL or Bcl-2, which is upstream of Bcl-XL; Bax translocation to mitochondria; and caspase activation (21Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Finally specific cleavage of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL by caspase-3 or granzyme B is essential for spontaneous apoptosis of B cell lymphoma or cytotoxic T lymphocytes, respectively (23Han J.

Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). The homotrimeric form of TRAIL initiates apoptosis through engagement of death receptors (DR4 or DR5) whose intracellular death domain recruits and forms the death-inducing signaling complex (26Ashkenazi A. Dixit V. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Procaspase-8 is then recruited to the death domain via Fas-associated death domain protein and subsequently activated through interactions between the death effector domain (27Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Caspase-8, the apical caspase, in response to the extrinsic death signal can cleave and activate caspase-3 to execute programmed cell death (28Rathmell J.C. Thompson C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). On the other hand, caspase-8 can cleave Bid, and tBid then turns on mitochondrial dysfunction to activate caspase-3 (4Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Therefore, caspase-8 activation of Bid bridges the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways; however, the physiological role and specificity of this cross-talk remain elusive.Gene targeting experiments implicate that TRAIL-mediated apoptosis most likely plays a critical role in negative selection of T cells (30Lamhamedi-Cherradi S.E. Zheng S.J. Maguschak K.A. Peschon J. Chen Y.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, negative selection at least of early thymocytes is normal in mice deficient for other TNF superfamily members, such as TNF or TNF receptor (31Sytwu H.K. Liblau R.S. McDevitt H.O.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Given the more important role of Mcl-1 than that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in lymphocyte development (38Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), there might exist a functional link between TRAIL and the antiapoptotic function of Mcl-1. Indeed overexpression of Mcl-1 is reported to be responsible for TRAIL resistance in cholangiocarcinoma cells (39Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that TRAIL apoptosis required the specific cleavage of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL by caspase-3 in Jurkat T cells. We further demonstrated that the resulting C-terminal domain of Mcl-1 became a proapoptotic factor that cooperated with tBid to potentiate mitochondrial apoptosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Antibodies—Z-VAD-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, and Z-DEVD-fmk were purchased from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland) and Clontech. Monoclonal antibodies specific for Mcl-1 (S-19 and K-20), Bcl-2 (100), Bcl-XL (L-19), HA (Y-11), Myc (9E10), His tag, and GFP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Bid monoclonal (7A3), anti-caspase-9 polyclonal, anti-caspase-8 monoclonal (1C12), and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (7H8.2C12) was from Pharmingen. Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-15), horse heart cytochrome c, lactacystin A, and dATP were purchased from Sigma. MitoTracker was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [35S]Methionine and glutathione-Sepharose 4B protein were from Amersham Biosciences. Purified recombination FLAG-tagged TRAIL and its expression vector were kindly provided by Dr. Pascal Schneider (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland).Common cloning and expression vectors were purchased from various commercial sources: pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pCMV-HA, pCMV-myc, pGBK7, pEGFP-N1, and pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). The cDNA plasmids encoding human voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) 1, Bax, and Bcl-XL were described previously (41Shi Y. Chen J. Weng C. Chen R. Zheng Y. Chen Q. Tang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Plasmid Construction—The prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors of human Mcl-1 were constructed by add-on PCR and in-frame subcloning. In brief, PCR-amplified full-length Mcl-1 was inserted between EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1 (designated pGEX-4T1-Mcl-1) and pCMV-HA (designated pCMV-HA-Mcl-1). The similar expression vectors of C-terminal domains of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1-C1 (amino acids 128-350) and Mcl-1-C2 (amino acids 158-350)) were constructed in parallel by subcloning of related cDNA fragments between EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1 and pCMV-Myc. The EYFP fusion vector was made in parallel to yield pEYFP-N1-Mcl-1. The cDNAs of Mcl-1 without the transmembrane domain (encoding amino acids 1-329, 128-329, or 157-329) were subcloned between EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1 to yield pGEX-4T1-Mcl-1ΔTM, pGEX-4T1-C-Mcl-1-C1ΔTM, and pGEX-4T1-C-Mcl-1-C2ΔTM. The transmembrane domain of Mcl-1 was deleted to facilitate the purification of recombinant proteins. For expression of the GST fusion protein of tBid, amino acids 61-195 of human Bid was subcloned into pGEX-4T1 between BamHI and EcoRI sites. The mammalian expression vectors for Bid or tBid were made by insertion of corresponding cDNAs between EcoRI and SalI of pCMV-HA (designated pCMV-HA-Bid and pCMV-HA-tBid). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing analysis.Site-directed and Truncational Mutagenesis—Point mutations to the potential caspase-3 cleavage sites within Mcl-1 (D127A, D157E, and D127A/D157E double mutation) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) using either pGEX-4T1-Mcl-1 or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 as the template. A series of truncation mutants and wild type Mcl-1 were subcloned between EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 by add-on PCR. The primer sequences are available on request.Fluorescent Co-localization—The fluorescent immunostaining assays were performed as described previously (40Xu Y. Martin S. James D.E. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3493-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-N1-tBid and pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1-C2. Mcl-1 and Mcl-1-C2 were immunostained with anti-HA antibody (Y-11, 1:200) followed by TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes). GFP and TRITC signals were acquired using a confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SP2).Co-immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—For analysis of protein-protein interaction between Mcl-1-C2 and tBid, MCF-7 cells (2.5 × 106) were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-myc-Mcl-1-C2 and pCMV-HA-tBid or pCMV-HA control vector using Effectene (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody at the final concentration of 2 μg/ml was then added to 0.5 ml of lysates and incubated on a roller overnight at 4 °C. Formed complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and coprecipitated Mcl-1-C2 was detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 with 1% milk). To assess protein-protein interaction between Mcl-1 and various Bcl-2 family proteins and VDAC1, various GST fusion and His-tagged proteins where indicated were purified, and GST pull-down assays were performed exactly as described previously (41Shi Y. Chen J. Weng C. Chen R. Zheng Y. Chen Q. Tang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription PCR—The mRNA expression levels of various Bcl-2 family genes was performed using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR after Jurkat T cells were treated or not treated with TRAIL or cycloheximide. In brief, 5 μg of total RNA extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) were utilized to synthesize the first strand cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Five microliters of reverse transcription products were used for the second strand of cDNA amplification with 1.0 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The yield of various cDNAs was quantitated in a 1.5% agarose gel. The sequences of specific primers for mcl-1, bid, bcl-XL, bcl-2, and β-actin are available on request.Cleavage of Mcl-1 Protein—Caspase in vitro cleavage experiments were performed as described previously with modification (42Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μg of purified GST-Mcl-1ΔTM protein was incubated with 20 ng of recombinant caspase-3 or 200 ng of caspase-8 at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 μl of reaction buffer. The reactions were stopped and resolved by 15% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) the cleavage products were either visualized with Coomassie Blue R-250 staining or Western blotted with Mcl-1 antibody (K-20). The Mcl-1 fragments were cut from polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal Edman protein sequencing (Procise, ABI) according to the manufacturer's manual. Recombinant human caspase-3 and caspase-8 were prepared as described previously (12Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6539-6547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Caspase in vitro cleavage assays using apoptotic cell extracts were performed as described previously (44Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In brief, wild type Mcl-1, Mcl-1-D127A, Mcl-1-D157E, and Mcl-1-D127A/D157E mutant proteins were 35S-labeled by coupled transcription and translation (Promega). Four microliters of 35S-labeled protein were mixed with 10 μl of apoptotic cell extracts or 50 ng of purified recombinant caspase-3 in 25 μl of caspase reaction buffer. The reactions were terminated after incubation at 37 °C for 2 h by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The resultant proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Mcl-1 siRNA Knock-down—The 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes targeting Mcl-1 in the coding region of 15-35 (siRNA1, 5′-AAGAAACGCGGUAAUCGGACU-3′) and 454-474 (siRNA2, 5′-AAUAACACCAGUACGGACGGG-3′) were synthesized and purified by Genepharm Research (Shanghai, China). The transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). Briefly 3 × 105 HEK293T cells were plated in 2 ml of growth medium without antibiotic. Five microliters of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at 22 °C for 15 min and then incubated with 25 μlof20 μm siRNA duplex resuspended in 250 μl of Opti-MEM at 22 °C for an additional 15 min. The siRNA liposome mixture was then applied to cells at ∼90% confluence in 6-well plates. The expression levels of Mcl-1 were assayed by Western blot, and Bak was used as a control for the nonspecific knock-down. To measure the effect of Mcl-1 against TRAIL apoptosis, 24 h after transfection of Mcl-1 siRNA, cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-HA-Mcl-1 or pCMV-HA-Mcl-1-127A/157E. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for 4 h, and cell survival rates were then measured with a WST-1 kit (Roche Applied Science). Data represented the average of three independent transfections.Cell Death Assays—TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells was evaluated with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using the Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodine double staining method (Baosai, Beijing, China). To better correlate the relationship between apoptosis and various exogenously expressed Bcl-2 homologs, cell death assays where transfection had to be used were performed essentially as described previously (45Li P. Lee H. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Jenster G. Bai W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 46Cheng H.C. Shih H.M. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33930-33942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly HeLa cells or 293T cells (1 × 105) were seeded in 12-well plates. After 16 h, cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids as indicated together with 0.1 μg of pEGFP vector as transfection marker using the Effectene method (Qiagen). Cells were then exposed to TRAIL where needed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon TE2000). At least 300 GFP-positive cells were counted for each transfection, and apoptotic cells based on morphological alterations (rounded, condensed, and detached from dish) were counted. The percentage of apoptosis represented the mean value from three independent experiments conducted in triplicate (mean ± S.D.).Cytochrome c Release—Mitochondria of rat livers were prepared, and cytochrome c release experiments were performed exactly as described previously (47Zheng Y. Shi Y. Tian C. Jiang C. Jin H. Chen J. Almasan A. Tang H. Chen Q. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).RESULTSDown-regulation of Mcl-1 Was Associated with TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—To test the response of Bcl-2 family proteins to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we performed Western blotting on the major Bcl-2 family proteins in Jurkat cells treated with recombinant FLAG-tagged TRAIL (Fig. 1A). The results indicated that, along the time course of the treatment, increased apoptosis rates (top panel) accompanied reduction of both fulllength Bid and Mcl-1, while protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL remained constant (bottom panel). The antibody (7A3, Cell Signaling Technology) used in this experiment could not detect tBid, but other experiments have already established that Bid is cleaved by TRAIL-activated caspase-8 (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3764) Google Scholar, 12Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 418-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that Mcl-1 started to decay before Bid cleavage (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), implicating different stability dynamics and maybe a more important role for Mcl-1 in response to TRAIL signaling than that for Bid.Caspase Cleavage but Not Proteasome Degradation of Mcl-1 in Response to TRAIL—Mcl-1 is a highly regulated antiapoptotic protein, and it can be degraded by the proteasome pathway upon genotoxic stress (21Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or cleaved by caspase either in spontaneous apoptosis of B cell lymphoma (24Michels J. O'Neill J.W. Dallman C.L. Mouzakiti A. Habens F. Brimmell M. Zhang K.Y. Craig R.W. Marcusson E.G. Johnson P.W. Packham G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or in Fas-mediated cell death (48Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J.G. Brady H.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 125: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test which pathway might be involved in TRAIL-induced down-regulation of Mcl-1, we preincubated Jurkat T cells with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1A, lane 5) or proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 1B, lane 5) before addition of TRAIL. In contrast to the previous observation that TNFα-induced Bid degradation in Jurkat cells was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors (49Breitschopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21648-21652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), in the present study lactacystin could not block the proteasomal degradation of fulllength Bid, but Z-VAD-fmk could do so. In a similar fashion, reduction of Mcl-1 by TRAIL engagement could also be ablated by pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk but not lactacystin (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lane 5 in both), consistent with a recent report (50Herrant M. Jacquel A. Marchetti S. Belhacene N. Colosetti P. Luciano F. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7863-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In fact, lactacystin could promote Mcl-1 reduction through inhibition of proteasomal degradation of activated casapse-3 (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggested that TRAIL-induced apoptosis might require a unique step of caspase cleavage of Mcl-1. Furthermore both caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-fmk) and caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk) inhibitors were able to inhibit TRAIL-induced reduction of Mcl-1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), strongly suggesting that Mcl-1 cleavage could be a downstream event of caspase-3 activation.Mcl-1 turnover in apoptotic cells could be regulated at both transcription and post-translation levels (51Iglesias-Serret D. Pique M. Gil J. Pons G. Lopez J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test whether TRAIL-mediated down-regulation of Mcl-1 could occur at the transcription level as well, we performed RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA level of Mcl-1 and that of Bcl-XL as a control (Fig. 1C). The results showed that prolonged TRAIL treatment of Jurkat T cells led to decreased transcription of Mcl-1 gene, while that of Bcl-XL remained the same. This line of evidence indicated that TRAIL signaling caused reduction of full-length Mcl-1 protein at both transcription and post-translation levels.The de novo protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) can effectively induce apoptosis and cause Mcl-1 degradation via the proteasomal pathway (52Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14924-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis indicated that, in contrast to the effect of TRAIL on Mcl-1, reduction of Mcl-1 by CHX signaling could be completely inhibited by lactacystin (Fig. 2, A and B) but only partially abolished by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A). Moreover this reduction was not due to decreased Mcl-1 transcription as revealed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). Similar to TRAIL, addition of CHX did not affect the Bcl-XL level either at the post-translation (Fig. 2B) or transcription (Fig. 2C) level. These results, combined with observations in other apoptotic systems reported, strongly suggested that the regulation of the Mcl-1 level rather than Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL plays a critical role in the survival of TRAIL-sensitive cells. It further suggested that specific mechanisms mi"

https://openalex.org/W2117877053,"Moderate consumption of red wine reduces risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The polyphenols in red wine are ultimately responsible for this effect, exerting antiatherogenic actions through their antioxidant capacities and modulating intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional activities. Lipoprotein metabolism is crucial in atherogenesis, and liver is the principal organ controlling lipoprotein homeostasis. This study was intended to identify the primary effects of procyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in red wine, on both plasma lipoprotein profile and the expression of genes controlling lipoprotein homeostasis in the liver. We show that procyanidins lowered plasma triglyceride, free fatty acids, apolipoprotein B (apoB), LDL-cholesterol and nonHDL:nonLDL-cholesterol levels and slightly increased HDL-cholesterol. Liver mRNA levels of small heterodimer partner (SHP), cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes increased, whereas those of apoAII, apoCI, and apoCIII decreased. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA levels increased in muscle and decreased in adipose tissue. In conclusion, procyanidins improve the atherosclerotic risk index in the postprandial state, inducing in the liver the overexpression of CYP7A1 (suggesting an increase of cholesterol elimination via bile acids) and SHP, a nuclear receptor emerging as a key regulator of lipid homeostasis at the transcriptional level. These results could explain, at least in part, the beneficial long-term effects associated with moderate red wine consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2157461053,"The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> genome encodes three α-amylase-like proteins (AtAMY1, AtAMY2, and AtAMY3). Only AtAMY3 has a predicted N-terminal transit peptide for plastidial localization. AtAMY3 is an unusually large α-amylase (93.5 kDa) with the C-terminal half showing similarity to other known α-amylases. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, both the whole AtAMY3 protein and the C-terminal half alone show α-amylase activity. We show that AtAMY3 is localized in chloroplasts. The starch-excess mutant of <i>Arabidopsis sex4</i>, previously shown to have reduced plastidial α-amylase activity, is deficient in AtAMY3 protein. Unexpectedly, T-DNA knock-out mutants of <i>AtAMY3</i> have the same diurnal pattern of transitory starch metabolism as the wild type. These results show that AtAMY3 is not required for transitory starch breakdown and that the starch-excess phenotype of the <i>sex4</i> mutant is not caused simply by deficiency of AtAMY3 protein. Knock-out mutants in the predicted non-plastidial α-amylases AtAMY1 and AtAMY2 were also isolated, and these displayed normal starch breakdown in the dark as expected for extraplastidial amylases. Furthermore, all three AtAMY double knock-out mutant combinations and the triple knock-out degraded their leaf starch normally. We conclude that α-amylase is not necessary for transitory starch breakdown in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves."

https://openalex.org/W2027480690,"Growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are highly up-regulated during development and following renal injury and are known to induce marked morphogenic actions in cultured tubular epithelial cells, including scattering, migration, single cell branching morphogenesis, and multicellular branching tubulogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that HGF stimulates epithelial cells to express neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a member of the lipocalin family of secreted proteins that has recently been shown to participate in mesenchymal-epithelial transformation via its ability to augment cellular iron uptake. At concentrations below those found to mediate iron transport, purified Ngal can induce a promigratory and probranching effect that is dependent on ERK activation. The suppression of Ngal expression using short hairpin RNA results in increased cyst formation by tubular cells. However, the simultaneous addition of Ngal and HGF leads to direct association of the two proteins, and results in a partial inhibition of HGF-mediated activation of c-Met and the downstream MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. This inhibitory effect down-regulates HGF-stimulated single cell migration, and limits branching morphogenesis at both the single cell and multicellular level. These experiments demonstrate that the local expression of Ngal can play a regulatory role in epithelial morphogenesis by promoting the organization of cells into tubular structures while simultaneously negatively modulating the branching effects of HGF.

To induce these events, HGF activates signaling pathways involved in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell-matrix attachment, and cell-cell interactions (3Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I.

In vitro, activation of these pathways stimulates the loss of cell-cell contact (scattering), marked increases in cell migration, and the formation of tubules with multiple branch points. However, in vivo, these responses must be carefully regulated to prevent the formation of abnormal tubular architecture during development and repair. To identify the factors that epithelial cells utilize for the regulation of HGF-stimulated morphogenesis, we have recently performed a microarray analysis of renal inner medullary collecting duct cells stimulated with HGF (6Ueland J.M. Gwira J. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F581-F589Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One of the messages found to be markedly up-regulated was for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that is also known as SIP24, 24p3, or lipocalin2. Lipocalins are a diverse family of small secreted proteins that generally bind small hydrophobic ligands, soluble extra cellular macromolecules, and possibly specific cell surface receptors (7Flower D.R.

Ngal was first isolated as 24p3, an mRNA that was up-regulated in SV-40 infected primary kidney cells (10Hraba-Renevey S. Turler H. Kress M. Salomon C. Weil R. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 601-608PubMed Google Scholar), and the 24-kDa protein product was later identified and found to be an acute phase reactant secreted by the liver that could also be induced in other organs and a variety of cultured cells by exposure to serum, prostaglandins, LPS, and cytokines such as human fibroblast growth factor and Il-1 (11Meheus L.A. Fransen L.M. Raymackers J.G. Blockx H.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Van Bun S.M. Van de Voorde A. Liu Q. Nilsen-Hamilton M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1535-1547PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu Q. Nilsen-Hamilton M. J.

Despite the multiple stimuli that can induce Ngal expression, at present the functional role of this protein is not well understood. Based on its ability to bind compounds in the extracellular space, one major function appears to be either stabilizing/sequestering these bound molecules or facilitating their transport into the cell. Ngal has been found to associate with and stabilize such proteins as MMP9 in neutrophils (14Chu S.T. Lin H.J. Huang H.L. Chen Y.H. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Yan L. Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37258-37265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), whereas it has more recently been shown to bind bacterial siderophores and thereby act as an antimicrobial agent by sequestering iron (16Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 17Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). The iron-binding capacity of Ngal has also been shown to facilitate iron delivery into cells, thus potentially playing an important role in the regulation of iron-sensitive genes that participate in mesenchymal-epithelial transition during development of the proximal parts of the mammalian nephron (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, mice lacking Ngal expression are born in normal numbers and have no apparent phenotype when housed in the absence of bacteria (17Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), suggesting that kidney development is not markedly abnormal, although this has not yet been examined morphologically. The possibility that Ngal may play an important role in the adult kidney has been suggested from the observation that it is highly up-regulated following transient renal ischemia (19Mishra J. Ma Q. Prada A. Mitsnefes M. Zahedi K. Yang J. Barasch J. Devarajan P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2534-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar) and that an infusion of Ngal can protect against ischemia-mediated tubular injury in the mouse (20Mishra J. Mori K. Ma Q. Kelly C. Yang J. Mitsnefes M. Barasch J. Devarajan P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 3073-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that HGF can increase Ngal secretion and that Ngal can stimulate renal tubular cell ERK activation accompanied by a modest increase in cell migration and branching morphogenesis. These effects appear to be physiologically relevant, because knockdown of Ngal expression results in increased cyst formation by tubular cells grown in a three-dimensional matrix. Interestingly, we show that Ngal can bind directly to HGF, thereby diminishing HGF-stimulated c-Met receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling. These effects are seen within minutes of Ngal addition, at nanogram concentrations of Ngal, and independent of iron-loading, distinguishing them from the effects seen in mesenchymal-epithelial transition. The Ngal-mediated decrease in HGF signaling results in a significant inhibition of HGF-stimulated cell migration and single cell branching morphogenesis, suggesting that up-regulation of Ngal following renal injury is likely to play a modulatory role in tubular cell responses to HGF. Materials—The mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD)-3 cells are derived from the mouse inner medullary collecting duct (21Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Liu Q.

Anti-ERK 1/2, anti-phospho-ERK 1/2, and anti-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), anti-HGFα antibody from SantaCruz Biotechnology, and anti-phosphoMet (Tyr(P)-1234 and -1235) antibody from Upstate Biotechnology (phosphorylation of Tyr-1234 and Try-1235 has been shown to be critical for the activation of met receptor kinase activity (22Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar)). The anti-Ngal rabbit polyclonal antibody has been described previously (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y.

Type I collagen was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). HGF, Protein A-Sepharose, and tri-reagent were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Microarray Analysis—The microarray analysis has been described previously (6Ueland J.M. Gwira J. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F581-F589Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was prepared from control mIMCD-3 cells and cells stimulated with HGF for 24 h via a two-step purification using the RNEasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was used for hybridization in a glass slide microarray analysis of gene expression. The analysis was carried out using glass slides containing the mouse NIA15K gene set prepared by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The NIA15K array consists of ∼15,000 unique cDNA clones (∼50% from novel genes) obtained from pre-embryonic, embryonic, and newborn mice with an average size of 1.5 kb (23Tanaka T.S. Jaradat S.A. Lim M.K. Kargul G.J. Wang X. Grahovac M.J. Pantano S. Sano Y. Piao Y. Nagaraja R. Doi H. Wood III, W.H. Becker K.G. Ko M.S. Liu Q. Nilsen-Hamilton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9127-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed three times. Expression and Purification of Ngal—Ngal was expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli as described previously (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These bacteria fail to express siderophore and thus do not yield iron-loaded Ngal (16Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacteria were grown in modified medium lacking added iron (16 g of tryptone, 16 g of yeast extract, 2.5 g of NaCl, 4 ml of glycerol, pH 7.5). Protein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at log phase growth. Bacteria were lysed in 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.8), sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein was recovered using GSH-coupled-Sepharose 4B beads pre-equilibrated with 0.45 mm extraction buffer. (Amersham Biosciences, 17-0756-01). Ngal was cleaved from the GST fusion protein by treatment with human Thrombin C (Sigma) then repurified on a SuperDex-75 column equilibrated in a 5% dextrose, phosphate-buffered saline solution. For some experiments, Ngal was expressed either in XL-1B bacteria (which do express siderophore) +plus added iron, or in BL-21 bacteria plus exogenous siderophore and iron. Protein gel electrophoresis, using bovine serum albumin (American Bioanalytical) as a standard, was performed on the purified protein to verify the molecular weight of the purified protein, and the concentration was estimated from a standard curve using densitometry. Analysis of Ngal Secretion—mIMCD-3 epithelial cells were maintained using standard cell culture techniques in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed when the cells were ∼60% confluent. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, the medium was changed, and fresh medium with 40 ng/ml HGF was used to stimulate Ngal production. Every 24 h, the media were changed, and fresh media were added (without serum or additional HGF). Cell supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h after initial stimulation. Of note, 92% of the mIMCD-3 cells survive the 72 h of serum starvation as judged by trypan blue exclusion. The supernatant was concentrated using the 10,000 K Centricon Filter Unit (Millipore) as per manufacturer's instruction. The protein content was determined using the Bradford assay, and 20 μg of concentrated supernatant protein was used unless otherwise noted. Samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and separated via SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% milk, TBST (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and hybridized with the Ngal antibody at 1:1000 dilution in a 1% milk, TBST solution. The visualization of proteins was accomplished with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Stable Knockdown of Ngal Expression by shRNA—Expression of murine Ngal was stably suppressed using the GeneSuppressor System (Imgenex). Briefly, 2 primer pairs were synthesized, 1 pair encoding nucleotides 192–213 followed by a 9-base “loop” and the inverted repeat (shRNA1) and the second encoding nucleotides 352–373, again followed by the loop and inverted repeat (shRNA2). The primer pairs were annealed and cloned into the pSuppressor Retro vector for transfection into mIMCD-3 cells. A vector encoding a scrambled RNA was used as control. mIMCD-3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of either shRNA1, shRNA2, shRNA1 plus shRNA2, or the scrambled control, and a mixed population of stable cells selected on G418. Cells expressing shRNA1 or shRNA2 had an ∼50% reduction in secreted levels of Ngal (data not shown), whereas the doubly transfected cells had >90% suppression of Ngal expression over at least 15 passages (see Fig. 6). Cell Migration—Migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden Chamber assay (24Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar). A 48-well bottom plate (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD.) was filled with DMEM/F12 medium containing the appropriate factors. The well was overlaid with a collagen Type 1 (Collaborative Biomedical) coated polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores (Nucleopore). The top compartment was connected, and 1.5 × 104 cells were suspended in DMEM/F12 containing the appropriate factor(s) plus or minus the MEK inhibitor UO126 (10 μg/ml, Promega) were added to the top of each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the filters were removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Healthcare), the cells remaining on the top of the membrane were mechanically scraped off, and cells that had passed through the pores were counted to determine the number of cells/mm2 of membrane. Each well represents an n of 1, and each experiment was repeated at least three separate times. Branching Morphogenesis/Tubulogenesis—mIMCD-3 cells were trypsinized, washed in 0.5% serum/DMEM-F12 medium, and counted. Collagen solution was prepared using type I rat tail collagen with 10% 1 m HEPES, pH 8.0, and 10% 10× DMEM at 4 °C. Cells were added to a final concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml, and 100 μl of the mixture was aliquotted into each well of a 96-well plate. The solution was allowed to polymerize for 15 min at 37 °C, and 100 μl of DMEM/F12 containing 0.5% serum and 40 ng/ml of either HGF, Ngal, GST control, or both Ngal and HGF was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h, and ∼50 cells/well were counted randomly to determine the total number of processes/cell. Each well represents an n of 1. In some experiments, cells suspended in type I collagen were cultured in conditioned media that had been previously incubated for 48 h with either control mIMCD-3 cells, cells expressing shRNA1 plus shRNA2, or cells expressing the scrambled shRNA control. For long term tubulogenesis, cells were harvested as above and suspended in a 70:30 Matrigel (BD Biosciences):collagen mixture. The cells were then incubated in DMEM/F12 + 3% fetal calf serum with or without HGF (40 ng/ml) with or without Ngal (40 ng/ml) for up to 8 days with a media change every 3 days unless otherwise noted. Representative structures were photographed at 20× (for the long term assay) or 40× (for the single cell branching assay) using a Nikon microscope with Hoffman modulation. Images were obtained using a SpotRT digital camera and processed using the Photoshop software. HGF/EGF Signaling Experiments—Mouse mIMCD-3 epithelial cells were maintained using standard cell culture techniques in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed when the cells were ∼90% confluent. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h followed by stimulation with Ngal (40 ng/ml), HGF (40 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml), or a mixture of HGF plus Ngal (40 ng/ml for each protein, preincubated together for 10 min) for the indicated time. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.16 m NaCl, 20 mm Trizma (Tris base), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant protein content was determined using the Bradford assay. For protein gels, 40 μg of whole cell lysates were used, unless otherwise noted, and added to SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and separated via SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% milk, TBST (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and hybridized with the appropriate antibody at a 1:3000 dilution in 5% milk, TBST solution. Visualization of proteins was accomplished with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. HGF/Ngal Interaction—Conditioned supernatants were collected by incubating serum-starved cells for the indicated time in serum-free DMEM/F12 followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then incubated with or without HGF (40 ng/ml) for 1 h, and anti-HGFα antibody was added overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding protein-Sepharose A and washed 3× with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane, immunoblotted with anti-Ngal antibody, and visualized with ECL. For purified Ngal association, 1 μg of Ngal was incubated with or without HGF (1 μg) in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (lacking SDS) overnight in the presence of the anti-HGFα antibody and collected and analyzed as above. For detecting direct association of HGF and Ngal, purified HGF was isolated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml of purified Ngal in 5% milk, TBST overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBST and hybridized with anti-Ngal antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by visualization with ECL. The membrane was stripped with β-mercaptoethanol strip solution (1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) followed by incubation with anti-HGFα antibody. Up-regulation of Expression of Ngal Following HGF Stimulation—Microarray analysis was performed on RNA obtained from serum-starved mIMCD-3 cells stimulated for 24 h with HGF using the NIA15K mouse array. Three separate experiments revealed a 5.0 ± 1.0-fold up-regulation of the message for the secreted lipocalin protein Ngal. To determine whether HGF up-regulated the expression of the Ngal protein, supernatants were collected over 24-h time periods from serum-starved confluent cells after 48 and 72 h of HGF stimulation. Supernatants collected at 48 h revealed a large amount of Ngal even in the absence of HGF treatment (the concentration of Ngal in the supernatant reaches ∼100–250 ng/ml by 48 h based on comparison with purified Ngal, data not shown), with a modest increase in the amount of Ngal detected in the supernatants from HGF-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Following 72 h of serum starvation in the absence of HGF there was a substantial decline in basal levels of Ngal secretion, whereas HGF-stimulated cells expressed an ∼4-fold greater amount of Ngal at this later time point. These results confirm that Ngal is secreted by IMCD cells in response to serum (as has been shown in multiple other cell types) and demonstrate that HGF can increase both the message expression and the level of secretion of the Ngal protein. Ngal Stimulates Epithelial Cell Migration and Tubulogenesis—Following renal injury, surviving epithelial cells undergo a process of dedifferentiation into a more mesenchymal phenotype, followed by enhanced cell spreading, migration, and eventual reconstitution of a tubular morphology. Earlier observations that HGF is markedly up-regulated by acute renal injury (2Liu Y. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Joannidis M. Spokes K. Nakamura T. Faletto D. Cantley L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F231-F236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), coupled with more recent data demonstrating that Ngal is also highly expressed in the kidney following renal ischemia (19Mishra J. Ma Q. Prada A. Mitsnefes M. Zahedi K. Yang J. Barasch J. Devarajan P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2534-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), led us to investigate the possibility that Ngal is involved in regulating the morphogenic responses of tubular cells. Ngal is of particular interest in renal tubule cell morphogenesis, because it has recently been shown to be capable of binding and stabilizing extracellular proteins such as MMP9 (thereby potentially increasing matrix degradation and subsequent cell migration and tubule formation) (15Yan L. Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37258-37265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) as well as facilitating intracellular iron delivery, thus playing a regulatory role in iron-dependent gene transcription during mesenchymal-epithelial transition in kidney development (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ngal can regulate epithelial cell morphogenesis, the non-iron-loaded protein was purified from BL-21 E. coli lacking siderophore expression as described previously (Fig. 1B) (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cell migration was measured in mIMCD-3 cells that had been washed to remove any endogenous Ngal and then stimulated with increasing concentrations of purified Ngal for 4 h. Because the amount of Ngal secreted into the cell supernatant was estimated to be ∼100–250 ng/ml at 48 h of culture, we examined doses between 1 and 100 ng/ml. The rate of secretion of Ngal by IMCD cells is sufficiently slow enough to require ∼18–24 h of culture before the protein is detected in the supernatant of fully confluent cells, so the endogenously secreted protein is unlikely to significantly affect the net concentration of Ngal in experiments lasting less than 24 h. At doses from 10 to 60 ng/ml, Ngal stimulated epithelial cell migration, with a peak effect at 20–40 ng/ml (Fig. 2A, quantitated in B). Interestingly, concentrations >60 ng/ml resulted in a decrease in cell migration, whereas concentrations ≤1 ng/ml had no effect. The effects of Ngal on cell migration were reproduced using Ngal purified from siderophore positive XL-1B bacteria (either in the iron-loaded or iron-deficient state), as well as iron-loaded Ngal purified from BL-21 bacteria in the presence of exogenous siderophore and iron (data not shown). This suggests that the migratory effect of Ngal is independent of its iron-transporting capacity. Further support for this idea comes from the observation that the concentration of Ngal mediating the greatest migratory effect (20–60 ng/ml) is significantly below the microgram concentrations needed to demonstrate an iron-dependent transcriptional effect (18Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The observation that both HGF and Ngal were up-regulated following renal injury, and that HGF could directly stimulate Ngal secretion, suggested that cells were likely to be exposed to both factors simultaneously. We therefore tested the effect on cell migration of the addition of both factors. Surprisingly, the addition of Ngal consistently diminished HGF-stimulated cell migration toward the level seen with Ngal alone (Fig. 2C). Cell migration involves the coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeletal rearrangement with extension of lamellipodia and focal adhesion turnover at the leading edge, which are events similar to those required for in vitro tubule formation. We therefore examined the ability of Ngal to stimulate single cell process formation and multicellular tubule formation in cells cultured in a three-dimensional matrix. Again, cells were washed to remove endogenous Ngal and then suspended in a type 1 collagen matrix. After 24 h of treatment with purified Ngal, there was a modest but statistically significant increase in single cell process formation (Fig. 3A, quantitated in B). However, similar to the effects seen in migrating cells, the simultaneous addition of Ngal and HGF resulted in a decrease of HGF-stimulated branching morphogenesis toward that seen with Ngal alone. When mIMCD-3 cells were cultured for 8 days in a Matrigel/collagen mixture, they proliferated and organized into a mixture of multicellular cysts and some tubular structures in the absence of HGF, whereas the predominant type of structure seen following HGF treatment was branching tubules with central lumens (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the culture in the presence of 40 ng/ml Ngal without added HGF led to the formation of multiple elongated structures without detectable central lumens (Fig. 3C, b, occasional cysts were also observed under these conditions), whereas co-culture with Ngal and HGF resulted in a phenotype of elongated multicellular structures with fewer branches than those seen with HGF alone and the absence of lumens in the majority of cases. Cumulatively, the results of these phenotypic experiments reveal that Ngal has a moderate promorphogenic effect when given alone but acts to moderate the more vigorous migratory and branching effects of HGF. Ngal Stimulates Transient ERK Activation—We have demonstrated previously that cell migration and branching morphogenesis stimulated by HGF and EGF require the activation of the MAPK pathway (5Ishibe S. Joly D. Zhu X. Cantley L.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ability of Ngal to activate MAPK was therefore examined in cells stimulated with Ngal as compared with HGF. At concentrations that induced cell migration, Ngal addition resulted in a rapid, transient activation of ERK1/2 as judged by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of the proteins (Fig. 4A, quantitated in B). ERK activation was maximal at 10 min (at which point it was 2.5-fold greater than baseline, but was still less than 50% of that seen with HGF) and returned to baseline by 30–60 min. To determine whether Ngal-mediated ERK activation was critical for cell migration, cells were treated with or without the MEK inhibitor U0126 followed by stimulation with Ngal. These experiments revealed that Ngal-mediated cell migration was completely inhibited following treatment with U0126 (Fig. 4C). The rapid nature of this signaling effect suggests that Ngal may be directly binding to a specific cellular receptor, as has been previously suggested for tear lipocalin (lipocalin-1) (9Wojnar P. Lechner M. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16209-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the lipocalin-1 receptor identified by Wojnar et al. (9Wojnar P. Lechner M. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16209-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is believed to mediate internalization and degradation of lipocalin, and no direct signaling pathway has been identified downstream of this receptor to our knowledge. In addition, the ability of Ngal to bind to other molecules makes it difficult to exclude the alternative possibility that, despite our purification procedure and the absence of other detectable bands on Coomassie-stained gels, the Ngal has associated with a bacterially produced molecule that is itself mediating the modest ERK activation. Ngal Inhibits HGF but Not EGF Signaling—Our observations that Ngal diminished HGF-stimulated cell migration and tubule formation led us to examine the possibility that Ngal might inhibit HGF-dependent cell signaling. Cells were treated with HGF alone or HGF that was preincubated with Ngal for 10 min prior to addition to the cells. Although HGF alone resulted in a 7-fold increase in ERK activation and Ngal alone again caused a 2.5-fold stimulation, the mixture of Ngal and HGF resulted in a level of ERK activation that was 60% less than that seen with HGF alone (Fig. 5A, quantitated in B). Similarly, stimulation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase pathway (as judged by an antibody to the phosphorylated/activated form of the downstream kinase Akt) was diminished in cells treated with the HGF-Ngal mixture as compared with HGF alone (Fig. 5C, quantitated in D). Inhibition of the activation of both pathways led us to examine the level of phosphorylation of the c-Met receptor itself. Using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the activated receptor, the combination of Ngal and HGF was found to markedly diminish activation of the receptor as compared with treatment with HGF alone (Fig. 5E, quantitated in F). To determine whether these inhibitory effects of Ngal occurred with other morphogenic stimuli, we examined the effect of Ngal on EGF-stimulated cell signaling. In contrast to the results seen when Ngal was mixed with HGF, Ngal failed to inhibit EGF-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 5G, quantitated in H) or Akt activation (Fig. 5I, quantitated in J). Of note, our cell lysis conditions primarily solubilize cytosolic- and membrane-associated proteins, with poor solubilization of nuclear proteins. The translocation of much of the activated ERK into the nucleus therefore results in a decrease in total ERK in the cell lysates following EGF stimulation (Fig. 5G, lanes 2 and 4) and HGF stimulation (A, lane 2). Consistent with the observed decrease in ERK activation following stimulation with HGF and Ngal, total ERK in the lysate is not significantly diminished in this case (Fig. 5A, lane 4). While performing these experiments, we compared the effects of premixing the Ngal and HGF and then adding the mixture to the cells versus preincubating the cells in Ngal followed by the addition of HGF. We found that premixing the Ngal and HGF had the greatest inhibitory effect on HGF signaling (data not shown), suggesting that Ngal might selectively bind or degrade HGF. To test this possibility, we examined the ability of HGF and Ngal to associate in solution and by overlay. As previously shown, supernatants from confluent serum-starved cells cultured for 36 h contained large amounts of Ngal (Fig. 6A, lane 4). The addition of HGF to this conditioned supernatant resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of HGF and Ngal (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3), as did incubation of the purified bacterially expressed Ngal with HGF (Fig. 6B, lane 2). In no experiments did we detect evidence of degradation of HGF following association with Ngal. Immobilization of purified HGF by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon-P, followed by overlay with Ngal, confirmed that HGF and Ngal can directly interact (Fig. 6C). The ability of either bacterially expressed or endogenous Ngal to associate with HGF, coupled with the observation that the purified Ngal can inhibit HGF-stimulated Met receptor activation and signaling, led us to investigate the possibility that Ngal secreted by epithelial cells can act in an autocrine fashion to regulate HGF signaling. To test this, conditioned media containing Ngal were obtained by culturing serum-starved mIMCD-3 cells for 48 h in DMEM-F12 followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. HGF (40 ng/ml) was then added to either the conditioned media (thus allowing HGF to bind to the Ngal in the conditioned media) or control DMEM/F12 prior to stimulation of mIMCD-3 cells for 10 min. Immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed an ∼50% decrease in c-Met activation by the HGF added in conditioned media as compared with that added in the control media (Fig. 6D). To determine whether this inhibition of HGF signaling resulted in an alteration in the phenotypic response to HGF, mIMCD-3 cells suspended in type I collagen were stimulated with HGF suspended in either fresh or conditioned media, and cell branching was quantitated at 24 h. Similar to the results with purified Ngal (Fig. 3B), conditioned media significantly decreased HGF-stimulated cell branching (Fig. 6F). However, because conditioned media is likely to contain multiple secreted factors in addition to Ngal, we developed cell lines stably expressing two shRNA constructs (shRNA1 and shRNA2) to selectively knock down Ngal expression in the conditioned media (Fig. 6E). Conditioned media obtained from these cells failed to inhibit HGF-stimulated cell branching (Fig. 6F). To examine the importance of endogenous Ngal secretion on the long term phenotype of tubule formation, wild-type mIMCD-3 cells were compared with cells in which Ngal expression had been stably knocked down using shRNA1 and 2 and to cells expressing the same vector containing a scrambled shRNA. The cells were cultured for 6 days in 2% serum with HGF without a medium change to allow Ngal accumulation in the supernatants of the parental and scrambled cell lines (confirmed by Western blot, data not shown). Interestingly, although wild-type and scrambled shRNA control cells formed elongated cords/tubules under these conditions, the Ngal knockdown cells formed a mixture of tubular structures and cysts (Fig. 6G). The quantification of individual structures revealed that ∼65% of the multicellular structures formed by the cells lacking Ngal secretion were cysts, whereas greater than 90% of structures were branching tubules or cell cords in wild-type cells and cells expressing the scrambled shRNA. Thus, it appears that Ngal serves to limit HGF-stimulated morphogenic signaling but is itself required for efficient tubulogenesis. In conclusion, Ngal is secreted by renal tubular cells in response to serum or HGF and can bind HGF in solution. This association of Ngal and HGF appears to be independent of the iron-binding capacity of Ngal and can decrease the ability of HGF to bind to the c-Met receptor and activate downstream signaling, resulting in a decrease in HGF-stimulated cell migration and branching. In addition, Ngal itself appears to play a stimulatory role in the organization of epithelial cells into elongated tubular structures. The observation that Ngal null mice survive after birth suggests that renal development is not grossly abnormal in these animals, although a careful examination of the kidneys for cyst formation or branching defects has not yet been performed. However, prior work demonstrating that Ngal is highly up-regulated following renal injury suggests that the local expression of Ngal at the site of tubular injury may serve to enhance reparative tubule formation in the adult kidney while also muting HGF-stimulated epithelial morphogenesis, possibly preventing dysregulated branching during tubule repair.

https://openalex.org/W2090685276,"Reaction rates extracted from measurements of donor luminescence quenching by randomly dispersed electron acceptors reveal an exponential decay constant of 1.23 per angstrom for electron tunneling through a frozen toluene glass (with a barrier to tunneling of 1.4 electron volts). The decay constant is 1.62 per angstrom (the barrier, 2.6 electron volts) in a frozen 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran glass. Comparison to decay constants for tunneling across covalently linked xylyl (0.76 per angstrom) and alkyl (1.0 per angstrom) bridges leads to the conclusion that tunneling between solvent molecules separated by ∼2 angstroms (van der Waals contact) is 20 to 50 times slower than tunneling through a comparable length of a covalently bonded bridge. Our results provide experimental confirmation that covalently bonded pathways can facilitate electron flow through folded polypeptide structures."

One of the phases reported here is a periodic organization of identical pentagonal cylinders; the other one is a structure composed of square-shaped and triangular cylinders in the ratio 2:1. These two different packing motifs represent duals of the same topological class. The generalization of the concept applied here allows the prediction of a whole range of unusual complex liquid crystalline phases.
https://openalex.org/W2023199963,"The intermediate structures formed through radiationless transitions are termed “dark” because their existence is inferred indirectly from radiative transitions. We used ultrafast electron diffraction to directly determine these transient structures on both ground-state and excited-state potential energy surfaces of several aromatic molecules. The resolution in space and time (0.01 angstrom and 1 picosecond) enables differentiation between competing nonradiative pathways of bond breaking, vibronic coupling, and spin transition. For the systems reported here, the results reveal unexpected dynamical behavior. The observed ring opening of the structure depends on molecular substituents. This, together with the parallel bifurcation into physical and chemical channels, redefines structural dynamics of the energy landscape in radiationless processes."

https://openalex.org/W1976489564,"We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A(165) inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A(165) promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A(165) is mediating PGI(2) synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A(165) activity. In this study, PGI(2) synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha), 6-keto PGF(1alpha)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A(121) (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10(-9) m), increased PGI(2) synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI(2) synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI(2) release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI(2) release mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121) up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A(165) to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI(2) synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964677287,"Cancer cell lines are used worldwide in biological research, and data interpretation depends on unambiguous attribution of the respective cell line to its original source. Short-tandem-repeat (STR) profiling (DNA fingerprinting) is the method of choice for this purpose; however, the genetic stability of cell lines under various experimental conditions is not well defined. We tested the effect of long-term culture, subcloning, and generation of drug-resistant subclones on fingerprinting profiles in four widely used leukemia cell lines. The DNA fingerprinting profile remained unaltered in two of them (U937 and K562) throughout 12 months in culture, and the vast majority of subclones derived therefrom by limiting dilution after long-term culture revealed the same profile, indicating a high degree of stability and clonotypic homogeneity. In contrast, two other cell lines (CCRF-CEM and Jurkat) showed marked alterations in DNA fingerprinting profiles during long-term culture. Limiting dilution subcloning revealed extensive clonotypic heterogeneity with subclones differing in up to eight STR loci from the parental culture. Similar heterogeneity was observed in subclones generated by selection culture for drug resistance where DNA fingerprinting proved useful in identifying possible resistance mechanisms. Thus, common tissue culture procedures may dramatically affect the fingerprinting profile of certain cell lines and thus render definition of their origin difficult."

Substitution of Smad4 SUMO conjugation residue lysine 159, but not 113, to arginine not only disrupted Smad4-Daxx interaction but also relieved Daxx-elicited repression of Smad4 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the recruitment of Daxx to an endogenous, Smad4-targeted promoter in a Lys159 sumoylation-dependent manner. Finally, down-regulation of Daxx expression by RNA interference enhanced transforming growth factor β-induced transcription of reporter and endogenous genes through a Smad4-dependent, but not K159R-Smad4-dependent, manner.

Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev.

With an increasing number of sumoylated proteins being identified, it has been proposed that SUMO conjugation affects target protein function by two major mechanisms (1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Hay R.T. Trends Biochem.

Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). First, sumoylation alters the molecular interaction properties and/or the subcompartmentalization of its targets. For instance, sumoylation of the transcriptional factor Elk-1 not only regulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of this protein (7Salinas S. Briancon-Marjollet A. Bossis G. Lopez M.A. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. Debant A. Hipskind R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but also results in the recruitment of histone deacetylase HDAC2 to Elk-1-regulated promoters, thereby repressing their transcription (8Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Second, sumoylation antagonizes other post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and acetylation, by targeting a common acceptor lysine residue. The prototypical example is that SUMO conjugation of IκBα at lysine 21 stabilizes this protein by blocking ubiquitination at the same site (9Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Because many transcriptional regulatory proteins are subjected to SUMO modification (1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 3Girdwood D.W. Tatham M.H. Hay R.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), sumoylation has emerged as an important mechanism in controlling gene expression. Transforming growth factor (TGF) β regulates a wide array of biological activities (for reviews, see Refs. 10Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar and 11Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of TGF-β are mediated by both the type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 (receptor-regulated Smads, R-Smad). The activated R-Smads then form complexes with the common-mediator Smad4 (Co-Smad) and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes that mediate TGF-β-induced cellular processes (12Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 13Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv.

Recently, several groups have demonstrated that Smad4 could be covalently conjugated by SUMO-1 at lysine 113 and 159, and mutation of both sumoylation residues significantly increases Smad4 transcriptional activity, suggesting a negatively regulatory mode of sumoylation on Smad4 activity (17Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D.

J. 2004; 379: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Currently, the underlying mechanism as to how the sumoylation modulates Smad4 transcriptional activity has not been completely unraveled. Mutation of Smad4 sumoylation sites does not alter the ability of Smad4 to form a complex with its interacting partners on promoter (17Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but rather modestly increases the stability of Smad4 (18Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, sumoylation was found to inhibit Smad4 intrinsic transcriptional activity per se (19Long J. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), implicating a mechanism involving the recruitment of specific transcriptional factors to Smad4-regulated promoters via SUMO-modified Smad4. Daxx is initially identified as a cytoplasmic signaling molecule linking Fas receptor to Jun N-terminal kinase signaling (21Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Daxx has also been reported to associate directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the type II TGF-β receptor, thereby mediating TGF-β-induced apoptosis and Jun N-terminal kinase activation (22Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Besides functioning as a signal transducer in the cytoplasm, Daxx also acts as a transcriptional corepressor in the nuclear compartments. Daxx was found to suppress several transcription factor-responsive reporter activities, including reporters of CRE, E2F1, Sp1, and NF-κB (23Ecsedy J.A. Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, through direct protein-protein interactions, Daxx can inhibit the transcriptional potential of several transcription factors, such as ETS1 (24Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Pax3 (25Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whether Daxx is involved in TGF-β-induced Smad4 transcriptional regulation has not been explored. In the present study, we showed that Daxx is capable of repressing the transcriptional activity of Smad4 through its interaction with SUMO-modified Smad4. Mutation of Smad4 sumoylation residue Lys159 but not Lys113 disrupted its association with Daxx, thereby abolishing the inhibitory effect of Daxx on Smad4 transactivation. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Daxx forms complexes with the wild-type Smad4 but not with K159R mutant on the promoter of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), suggesting that Daxx controls Smad4 transcriptional activation via Lys159 sumoylation. Accordingly, down-regulation of Daxx expression by RNA interference increased Smad4 transactivation and PAI-1 expression regulated by TGF-β. Our results identify an important role for Daxx in mediating sumoylation-dependent modulation of Smad4 transcriptional potential. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) Assays—Yeast two-hybrid array screen using LexA-Smad4 as bait against preys consisting of 600 human full-length cDNA clones fused to the VP16 transactivation domain. Briefly, AMR70 yeast strain expressing LexA-Smad4 was mated with L40 yeast expressing different preys in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, the resulting yeast cells were cultured in medium lacking tryptophan and leucine for selection of diploid cells. Diploid cells were further transferred to medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for scoring protein-protein interactions. Positive clones were selected and subsequently verified by one-on-one transformation assays. β-Gal liquid assays were performed with the Galacto-light Plus kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA), and three separate liquid cultures for each yeast transformant were assayed. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA fragments for various Smads and Smad4 subdomains were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pBTM116 in-frame with the LexA to generate pBTM116-Smad1,- Smad2, -Smad3, -Smad4, -MH1, -Linker, and -MH2. The cDNA fragments of Smad1, Ubc9, Daxx, and its deletion mutants were inserted into the pACT2 vector to produce pGalAD-Smad1, -Ubc9, -DaxxFL, -Daxx1–625, -Daxx1–501, and -Daxx570–740. HA-Daxx and its mutant constructs were described (27Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Lin D.Y. Lai M.Z. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15958-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). pCMV-Myc-Smad4, pCMV-FLAG-Smad4, and pRK5-HA-Smad4 were constructed by inserting full-length cDNA of Smad4 into the pcDNA3.1-Myc vector (Invitrogen), pCMV-Tag 2 (Stratagene), and pRK5-HA vector, respectively. pEGFP-Daxx and p2XFLAG-Daxx were generated by subcloning full-length cDNA of Daxx into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) and pCAG-2XFLAG vector. The mammalian and yeast constructs expressing sumoylation site mutants K113R, K159R, and K113/159R were created using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pCMV-Myc-Smad4 and pBTM116-Smad4 as templates, respectively. For constructing pGST-Smad4-Linker, cDNA fragment coding the linker domain was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). To generate p6XHis-Daxx570–740, the cDNA fragment of Daxx was subcloned into the gateway pENTR3C vector (Invitrogen) followed by a switch to the pDEST17 vector (Invitrogen). pSUPER-Daxx was engineered by inserting an oligonucleotide corresponding to Daxx sequence 46GAT GAA GCA GCT GCT CAG C64 into the pSUPER vector (a generous gift from Dr. Reuven Agami). SBE4-Luc is a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assay—COS-1 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mv1Lu mink lung cell line is a gift from Dr. Neng-Yao Shih (National Health Research Institutes). All of the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate stable transfectants of Smad4 and its mutants, MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc-Smad4, pCMV-Myc-Smad4K113R, pCMV-Myc-Smad4K159R, or pCMV-Myc-Smad4K113/159R and then selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Transient transfections of COS-1 and Mv1Lu mink lung cells were carried out using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen). For coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, the cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection. For the reporter gene assay, 2 × 105 cells of COS-1, Mv1Lu, MDA-MB-468, or its derivatives were seeded on 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Various expression constructs, together with the β-Gal expression vector (as an indicator for normalization of transfection efficiency), were introduced into these cells by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The transfectants were starved for 12 h followed by TGF-β treatment for additional 18 h. The cells were lysed and assayed for relative luciferase activity (firefly luciferase for the reporter and β-Gal activity for the indicator) as manufacture instructed (Packard, Meriden, CT). For reporter gene experiments involving pSUPER-Daxx, transfection and reporter assays were performed as described above, except the cells were harvested at 60 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). For assaying Daxx-Smad4 interaction, the lysis buffer was supplemented with 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses as described previously (28Lin D.Y. Lai M.Z. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15958-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Smad4 (B-8, monoclonal) (G-20, polyclonal), Smad3 (I-20), and SUMO-1 (d-11) were purchased from Santa Cruz. Another anti-SUMO-1 antibody (GMP-1) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Antibodies to Daxx and FLAG were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were from Covance. Anti-actin antibody was from Chemicon. Immunofluorescence—MDA-MB-468 cells were plated onto coverslips the day before transfection. The expression vectors for EGFP-Daxx and/or HA-Smad4 were transiently transfected into MDA-MB-468 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum together with or without 200 pm TGF-β for 2 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100, and then incubated with the anti-HA antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following this incubation, the cells were washed three times for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and the incubated with the Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) for 1 h at 20 °C. The nuclei were revealed by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (10 μg/ml). The coverslips were inverted and mounted on slides. The images were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. In Vitro Sumoylation Assays and Binding Assays for Sumoylated Proteins—The FLAG-tagged Smad4 proteins were purified from transiently transfected COS-1 cells using immunoprecipitation as described above. The precipitated Smad4 proteins were divided equally into two portions for sumoylation reactions in the presence or absence of SUMO-1 proteins. In vitro sumoylation was performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 2 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 15 ng of SUMO E1 recombinant proteins (LAE Biotechnology), 200 ng of Ubc9, 100 ng of SUMO-1, and FLAG-Smad4 proteins bound on beads. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Half of the resulting sample was examined for sumoylation by Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. The other half of the sample was further incubated with lysates of COS-1 cells overexpressing HA-Daxx or its mutants at 4 °C for overnight. Beads of samples were collected by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibody. GST Pull-down Assay—The expression and purification of GST-Smad4-Linker fusion protein were performed as described (27Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Lin D.Y. Lai M.Z. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15958-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2 μg of purified GST fusion proteins bound on glutathione agarose beads were subjected to in vitro sumoylation assay. A fraction of the reaction mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting to indicate the amount of input and SUMO-1-modified GST fusion proteins. The resulting samples were washed, blocked with BSA, and then incubated for 2 h with 0.3 ml of binding mixture containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, together with recombinant Daxx570–740 proteins generated from BL21 codon plus strain transformed with p6XHis-Daxx570–740. The bound samples were washed four times and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Daxx antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—The chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed essentially as described (31Hussein S.M. Duff E.K. Sirard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48805-48814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼8 × 106 cells of each MDA-MB-468 Smad4 stable clone were seeded on four plates (10 cm), cultured for 36 h, and then starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% fetal bovine serum for additional 12 h. The cells were further stimulated with TGF-β (200 pmol) for 2 h and then subjected to fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm to stop cross-linking. After chromatin extraction, shearing, and preclearing steps, the samples were split for immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of anti-Daxx (Sigma), anti-Smad4 (B-8, Santa Cruz), control rabbit IgG (SC-2027, Santa Cruz) antibodies, or no antibody (as input chromatin control). Bound DNA-protein complexes were washed and then eluted as described (31Hussein S.M. Duff E.K. Sirard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48805-48814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and the cross-links were removed by incubating in 250 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h. The resulting samples were precipitated and resuspended for proteinase K digestion and followed by DNA purification with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). 5 μl of purified DNA (one-ninth of each sample) was used for PCR amplification (42 cycles). Primers flanking Smad-binding elements (SBEs) in the PAI-1 promoter were 5′-GACAAGGTTGTTGACACAAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATAACCTCCATCAAAACGTGG-3′ (reverse), which are corresponding to –894/–873 and –614/–593 from the initiation ATG, respectively. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. Quantification of PAI-1 Expression Level in pSUPER-Daxx-transfected MDA-MB-468 Smad4 Stable Cells—MDA-MB-468 Smad4 wild-type and mutant stable cells were cotransfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-Daxx along with pEGFP-C1 vector (in a 10:1 ratio). Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h, and the GFP-positive cells were isolated by FACS Vantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The resulting cells were cultured for additional 24 h and subsequently treated with or without TGF-β for 4 h. Total cellular RNAs from these cells were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Five microgram of RNA of each sample was then reverse transcribed using ThermoScript reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen) in 20 μl of reaction mix. A1-μl aliquot of the reverse transcription reaction product was used for semiquantitative PCR analysis with specific PAI-1 primers (forward primer: 5′-CAGACCAAGAGCCTCTCCAC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-ATCACTTGGCCCATGAAAAG-3′) for an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. As an internal control, an aliquot of each sample was analyzed for the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA by semiquantitative and real time PCR with the forward primer (5′-TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGAAG-3′). The PCR products were then subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The real time quantitative PCR were performed on the Applied Biosystem PRISM 7700 sequence detector with SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems) for detection as described in the manufacturer's guidelines. For each sample, the average threshold (Ct) value was resulted from quadruplicate assays, and the ΔCt value was determined by subtracting the average glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ct value from the average PAI-1 Ct value. Three independent experiments were performed for measuring PAI-1 levels of pSUPER-Daxx-transfected MDA-MB-468 Smad4 stable cells. Daxx Interacts with Smad4 and Suppresses Its Transcriptional Activity—In a search for potential partner of the Smad4, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid array screen using a fusion protein comprised of the full-length human Smad4 and the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA-Smad4) as bait. Daxx and Ubc9 were recovered from this screen as positive clones. The specificity of the interactions of Daxx, Ubc9, and Smad4 was verified by one-on-one transformation (Fig. 1A, left panel). Introduction of both LexA-Smad4 and GalAD-Daxx or GalAD-Ubc9 (Daxx or Ubc9 fused with Gal4 activation domain, respectively) constructs conferred onto transformants the ability to grow in medium lacking histidine. By contrast, yeast transformed with the control bait, LexA-MST3, or LexA-Smad1, along with GalAD-Daxx or GalAD-Ubc9 failed to do so, indicating that the interactions of Smad4 with Daxx and Ubc9 are specific. We further tested the possibility of Daxx associating with other Smad proteins and demonstrated that neither Smad2 nor Smad3 interacted with Daxx in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1A, right panel). Because Daxx can act as a transcriptional coregulator, identification of Daxx interacting with Smad4 prompted us to examine whether Daxx is involved in regulating Smad4 transcriptional activity. To this end, expression constructs of Smad4 and Smad3 were cotransfected with increasing amount of HA-Daxx into COS-1 cells along with the 3TP-Lux reporter, which contains TGF-β-responsive elements from the PAI-1 and collagenase promoters (32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (33Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), overexpression of both Smad3 and Smad4 induced a TGF-β-independent 3TP-Lux reporter activity (Fig. 1B). Introduction of Daxx, however, suppressed the transcriptional activity of Smad3/4 in a dose-dependent manner. To further substantiate the Daxx transcriptional repression on Smad4, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells lacking endogenous Smad4 were transfected with FLAG-Smad4 and HA-Daxx along with the reporter 3TP-Lux or SBE4-Luc, with the latter containing four copies of the Smad-binding element CAGA (35Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), followed by TGF-β treatment. As expected, Daxx also inhibited the TGF-β-induced reporter activities of 3TP-Lux (Fig. 1C) and SBE4-Luc (Fig. 1D) in MDA-MB-468 cells carrying exogenous Smad4. Furthermore, the repressive effect of Daxx on Smad4-mediated reporter activities of 3TP-Lux (Fig. 1E) and SBE4-Luc (Fig. 1F) was also observed in Mv1Lu mink lung cells, another TGF-β-responsive cell line. Together, these results indicate that Daxx could suppress Smad4-mediated transcriptional activity, and this suppression is not a cell type-specific event. To further establish the link between the interaction and regulation of Smad4 by Daxx, we delineated the domain(s) of Daxx required for interacting with Smad4. Several Daxx deletion mutants were generated and then characterized for their interplays with Smad4 by yeast two-hybrid assays and Smad4 reporter experiments. In yeast two-hybrid assays, a truncated mutant of Daxx expressing amino acid residues 570–740 (Daxx570–740) was still able to interact with LexA-Smad4 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, two N-terminal fragments, Daxx1–501 and Daxx1–625, failed to do so. Therefore, the C-terminal domain of Daxx is sufficient for binding Smad4. Consistent with the results from yeast two-hybrid assays, Daxx570–740, instead of Daxx1–625, inhibited the 3TP-Lux reporter gene activity in COS-1 cells cotransfected with a fusion construct consisting of both TGF-β type I and II receptor cytoplasmic domains, R(II-I)C (Fig. 2B) that has been shown to activate TGF-β responses in a ligand-independent manner (36Feng X.H.

Likewise, the repressive effect of Daxx and Daxx570–740, but not Daxx1–625, on Smad4 was also observed in the Smad4-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells (data not shown). Thus, the interaction capabilities of these Daxx mutants are well correlated with their transcriptional repression abilities toward Smad4. Daxx Does Not Alter the Nuclear Translocation of Smad4 — Because Daxx was reported to associate with the TGF-β type II receptor in the cytoplasm (22Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the repressive effect of Daxx on Smad4 is due to an inhibition of Smad4 nuclear translocation. To test this possibility, MDA-MB-468 cells were transiently transfected with HA-Smad4 and/or EGFP-Daxx followed by TGF-β treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the translocation of Smad4 from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear compartment upon TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 3, panel a versus panel c). Daxx, however, was mainly distributed in the nucleus, and its localization was not altered by TGF-β treatment (panel e and panel g). Notably, when both Smad4 and Daxx were coexpressed in the same cells, Daxx did not block"
https://openalex.org/W2086891449,"Clinical data suggest that iron is a negative factor in chronic hepatitis C; however, the molecular mechanisms by which iron modulates the infectious cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) remain elusive. To explore this, we utilized cells expressing a HCV replicon as a well-established model for viral replication. We demonstrate that iron administration dramatically inhibits the expression of viral proteins and RNA, without significantly affecting its translation or stability. Experiments with purified recombinant HCV RNA polymerase (NS5B) revealed that iron binds specifically and with high affinity (apparent Kd: 6 and 60 microM for Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively) to the protein's Mg2+-binding pocket, thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity. We propose that iron impairs HCV replication by inactivating NS5B and that its negative effects in chronic hepatitis C may be primarily due to attenuation of antiviral immune responses. Our data provide a direct molecular link between iron and HCV replication."
https://openalex.org/W1985501548,"Human Aurora kinases have three gene family members: Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C. It is not yet established what the specificity of these kinases are and what signals relayed by their reactions. Therefore, we employed small pool expression screening to search for downstream substrates of Aurora-A. Interestingly, all of the identified Aurora-A substrates were resistant to serve as substrates for Aurora-B or Aurora-C, suggesting that these Aurora family members may have distinct substrate specificity for propagation of diverse signaling pathways, even though they share a conserved catalytic kinase domain. Of the candidate substrates, Aurora-A could increase the functional activity of RalA. Mutational analysis revealed that RalA-Ser194 was the phosphorylation site for Aurora-A. Ectopic expression of V23RalA-WT could enhance collagen I-induced cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) Aurora-A stable cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of V23RalA-S194A in MDCK Aurora-A-stable cell lines abolished the intrinsic migration and transformation abilities of Aurora-A. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic search for the downstream substrates of Aurora-A kinase. Moreover, these results support the notion that Aurora-A may act in concert with V23RalA through protein phosphorylation on Ser194 to promote collagen I-induced cell motility and anchorage-independent growth in MDCK epithelial cells.

Aurora, an emerging family of serine/threonine kinases, has recently drawn intense attention because of its association with the development of human cancers and mitotic progression (for review see Refs. 1Nigg E.A.

Phylogenetic classification reveals three human members, Aurora-A, -B, and -C (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). These kinases are characterized by a conserved kinase domain at the C terminus, whereas the N-terminal domains are of variable lengths and share low sequence identity (5Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). It has been found that Aurora-A gene overexpression is associated with cancer cell lines, invasive carcinoma, and spindle abnormality. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A transforms Rat-1 and NIH3T3 cells (6Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M.

Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The issue of the oncogenic potential of Aurora-A remains controversial, however, particularly in light of the recent report that overexpression of Aurora-A fails to induce oncogenic transformation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (8Anand S. Penrhyn-Lowe S. Venkitaraman A.R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Aurora-B causes polyploidy and leads to genome instability, which is a major factor in the predisposition of tumor cells (9Tatsuka M. Katayama H. Ota T. Tanaka T. Odashima S. Suzuki F. Terada Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4811-4816PubMed Google Scholar). However, less is known with respect to the role of Aurora-C. The key questions to be resolved relate to the identity of the downstream targets of these Aurora kinases, and whether Aurora family members may recognize distinct downstream targets, hence propagating diverse signaling pathways. To fully understand how a protein kinase regulates biological processes, it is imperative to identify its substrate(s). Very little information is available regarding the substrates of human Aurora family members, however. Currently, several potential substrates have been identified from different model organisms, such as: yeast (Ask1, Dam1, Spc34, Sli15, Ndc80, Ndc10, Cin8, and Histone H3) (10Cheeseman I.M.

However, it is essential to identify the one or more phosphorylation sites of a given substrate to facilitate studies with phosphorylation site mutants to investigate the signals a kinase relay. Most of the above substrates are involved in mitotic progression, or spindle or centrosome regulation. For example, TPX2, a component of the spindle apparatus, is required for the targeting of Aurora-A to the spindle microtubules (15Kufer T.A. Sillje H.H. Korner R. Gruss O.J. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); whereas BRCA1, a multiple function protein, is involved in G2-M phase transition (19Ouchi M. Fujiuchi N. Sasai K.

In contrast, overexpression of Aurora-A could increase telomerase activity through c-myc in human ovarian and breast epithelial cells (20Yang H. Ou C.C. Feldman R.I. Nicosia S.V. Kruk P.A. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that Aurora-A may participate in other cellular process. Furthermore, a proposed consensus site (K/R)X(S/T)-(I/L/V), has been deduced for yeast Aurora kinase (Ipl1) phosphorylation (10Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). There is only one Aurora gene family member in yeast. By contrast, there are two in Drosophila and Xenopus, and three in humans. This raises a series of unanswered questions, including whether the human counterparts of these identified substrates from different model organisms serve as the targets for all human Aurora family members or for just one of the Aurora kinases, and, whether the proposed consensus site for Ipl1 is indeed the bona fide substrate recognition motif for Aurora kinases in humans. In this study, small pool expression screening, which has been used successfully to identify substrates for protein kinases (21Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was employed to identify potential Aurora-A substrates. The underlying concept is subdivision of the whole library into smaller pools to substantially increase clone abundance and the probability of detecting potential substrates for a given kinase in the pool. Moreover, this method makes it easier to rapidly isolate a single clone once a candidate substrate is identified, because, relative to large pools, small pools are less likely to contain multiple candidate cDNAs. Indeed, several potential substrates for Aurora-A were identified in this study. Among the identified substrates, two potential substrates, Ral-GDS and RalA, were of particular interest. Both are involved in the Ras-primed cell transformation pathway (23Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activation of RalA enhances the transforming activities of RasH and Raf (24Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that RalA (or its constitutively active forms G23V and Q72L) are involved in multiple signaling pathways, including: the activation of phospholipase D1 and Src kinase (25Jiang H.

Moreover, Ral-GDS 1The abbreviations used are: GDS, guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; WT, wild type. and Ca2+/calmodulin are known to be by far the best-known regulators of RalA (31Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Park J.B. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whether other proteins are involved in the regulation of RalA remains unclear, however. In this study, nine potential substrates, spanning a broad range of biological responses, were identified based upon electrophoretic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Surprisingly, none of the identified substrates serve as substrates for Aurora-B and Aurora-C, suggesting that Aurora family members might have distinct substrate specificity, despite the fact that they share a conserved catalytic kinase domain. Furthermore, Aurora-A phosphorylates RalA on Ser194, and Ser194 phosphorylation is critical for the activation of RalA. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A promotes collagen I-induced cell motility and anchorage-independent growth ability through phosphorylation on V23RalA-Ser194. These findings suggest that elaboration of Aurora-A phosphorylation of RalA may provide mechanistic insights into the oncogenesis of Aurora-A. DNA Constructs—Plasmids encoding the full-length Aurora-A and RalA were constructed in pCMV2-FLAG, HA-pcDNA3.1, or GST-vector, respectively. The kinase-dead mutant of Aurora-A and S138A, S183A, S194A (three phosphorylation site mutants), or G23V mutants for RalA were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) employing Aurora-A or RalA as the template. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-tagged Aurora-A-(WT/KR), Aurora-B-(WT/KR), RalA, and RalB fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The fusion proteins were then purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored at –80 °C. Small Pool Expression Screening—Small pool expression screening (22Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was used to identify the downstream targets of Aurora-A protein kinase, and we adopted the detailed protocol published previously (22Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, we have subdivided human placenta cDNA library (OriGene) into 342 small pools, which contain 200–300 clones instead of 100,000 clones per pool. Plasmids were isolated from each pool and then served as templates for in vitro transcription and translation (TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems from Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The procedures were according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that we added 0.5 μg of plasmid per reaction, and the reaction volume was scaled down to 5 μl. The in vitro kinase assay was described previously (34Wu Y.M. Huang C.L. Kung H.J. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17672-17678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The [35S]methionine-labeled protein pools (5 μl) were incubated with either wild-type (WT) or catalytically inactive (KR) recombinant GST-Aurora-A in the kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) at 30 °C for 10 min. In general, the reaction volumes were 40–50 μl. If there is a potential substrate presented in a protein pool, an electrophoretic mobility shift caused by protein phosphorylation would be observed when protein samples are incubated with WT but not with KR form of Aurora-A. To increase the possibility of separating the phosphorylation and non-phosphorylation forms, reaction mixtures were loaded side by side on a 20-cm SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gel) and changing the acrylamide:bis ratio from 29:1 to 100:1. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp.) followed by autoradiography. Among the 342 cDNA small pools screened, 11 pools contained at least one protein band exhibiting a shift in electrophoretic mobility when incubated with WT but not KR-form of Aurora-A, implicating these pools contained potential substrates. We then transformed these eleven pools respectively, isolated single clones, and tested with kinase reactions as described above. The cDNA clones of the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (derived from single clones), which showed slowly migrated bands, were sequenced, and nine different genes were identified. These substrates were then incubated with different protein kinases, including E. coli-expressed GST-Aurora-A/B, and baculovirus-expressed His-tagged Aurora-C (35Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The substrates that exhibited electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with various protein kinases were scored as positive as shown in Supplementary Table SI. To demonstrate whether protein phosphorylation but not other post-translational modifications caused the electrophoretic mobility shift, λ phosphatase (100 units per reaction, New England Biolabs) was used to verify this finding. In Vitro Kinase Reaction—2 μg of purified GST-tagged RalA-(WT/S194A) or V23Ral-(WT/S194A) or RalB fusion proteins were incubated with purified recombinant GST Aurora-A proteins in the kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) coupled with 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. In general, the reaction volumes were 40–50 μl. Kinase reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The peptides were synthesized by using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (36Songster M.F. Barany G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 126-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After completion of the peptide synthesis, the peptide was cleaved from resin support with trifluoroacetic acid treatment. The purification of the synthetic peptide was conducted by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The purity of each peptide was at least 90%. The molecular weight of each synthetic peptide was analyzed and confirmed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Equal amounts of each peptide (5 μg) were incubated with recombinant 0.2 μg of His-Aurora-A and 0.6 μg of His-Aurora-B (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) proteins, respectively. The kinase reaction was performed in the kinase reaction buffer as described above with 2.5 of μCi [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 5 min. In general, the reaction volumes were 20–30 μl. The reactions were then stopped by spotting on P81 ion exchange filter paper (Whatman), and the paper was washed with 1% phosphoric acid 20 min for three times as described earlier (37Huang C.Y. Yuan C.J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CPM (counts per minute) values of each reaction were acquired via liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). The phosphorylation extent of Aurora-A/B to various RalA peptides was normalized with RalA-S194-WT peptide as relative activity. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—293T and NIH3T3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air environment incubator and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) or calf serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Additional sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) was also supplemented for NIH3T3. Transient transfection of various constructs into 293T or NIH3T3 cells was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the transfected cells were harvested for following experiments. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assay—To prepare cell-free lysates, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffer saline, and lysed in extraction buffer, which was composed of 50% lysates buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) and 50% immunoprecipitation washing buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 40 mm β-glycerolphosphate) as described earlier (38Hsu J.M. Lee Y.C. Yu C.T. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32592-32602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay reagents (Pierce). 500 μg of total cell lysates was incubated with antibodies against target epitopes and Protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Research Product) to immunoprecipitate the target protein at 4 °C for 4 h. These immune complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation washing buffer as described above. The immunoprecipitated complex was then incubated with indicated purified recombinant kinase in the kinase reaction buffer as described in previous section with 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. In general, the reaction volumes were 40–50 μl. Kinase reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp.) followed by autoradiography. Ral Activation Assay—The Ral activation assay was performed as previous described (39Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with FLAG-Aurora-A-(WT/KR) and/or HA-V23RalA-(WT/S194A) with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (Sigma). 1 mg of proteins from each sample was precleaned with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with 20 μl of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ral binding domain beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C.The beads were then washed three times with 1× RAB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane, and Western blotted with anti-RalA (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science). Establishment of Stable Clones in MDCK 3B5 Cells—MDCK cells, clone 3B5, were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air environment incubator and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Subconfluent MDCK cells were transfected with various combinations of HA-tagged V23RalA-(WT/S194A) and FLAG-tagged Aurora-A-(WT/KR) constructs with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. MDCK cells stably expressing various constructs were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). An individual clone was picked up and analyzed for exogenous Aurora-A or V23RalA expression by Western blotting. Each selected stable clone was lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of total lysates (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with 1:2000 dilution of anti-FLAG (M5, Sigma) or anti-HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science) antibody followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Migration and Invasion Assay—Migration and invasion assays of various MDCK stable clones were evaluated via 24-well Transwell (8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane, Costar) chambers. For migration assay, the chambers were prepared by precoating with 30 μgof collagen I to the under surface of the membrane at room temperature for 30 min. The collagen I solution was then discarded, and the chambers were air dried for 20 min. For migration assay, 5 × 103 cells of various MDCK stable clones were suspended in 400 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS and were seeded to the upper chamber, whereas 600 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the outer side of the chamber. After being cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2/95% air environment for 20 h, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by a cotton tip applicator, and migratory cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed by methanol and stained with Giemsa (Sigma). Cell migration values were determined by counting all migrated cells of each stable clone under a phase-contrast microscope (200× magnitude) on five independent membranes and then normalized with parental MDCK cells as relative ratio. For invasion assay, 117 μg of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) was added to the upper surface of the membrane and allowed for gelling at 37 °C for overnight. 1 h before invasion assay, the collagen I was coated as described above. 1 × 104 cells in 400 μl of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS were seeded to the upper chamber, and 600 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the outer side of the chamber. The following procedures for invasion assay were the same as in the migration assay described above. Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Anchorage-independent growth ability of various MDCK stable clones was determined by assessing colony formation efficiency in the soft agar system as in previous reports (40Zhang D.L. Liu S.G. Yan L.F. Li L.J. Huang G.S. Fang F.D. Xia G.T. He X.Y. Gao B.X. Bai X.H. Wang W. Ding P.G. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 104 cells of each stable clone or parental MDCK cells were suspended in 3 ml of 10% FBS-DMEM containing 0.3% Seakem-agarose (Cambrex BioScience Rockland). The suspension was then added onto a layer of 10% FBS-DMEM containing 0.5% Seakem-agarose and in a 60-mm dish. 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS was then added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air environment incubator with replaced medium every 3 days. After 4 weeks, the colony numbers of each clone from three independent experiments were stained with crystal violet (Sigma), counted, and then normalized with parental MDCK cells as relative ratio. Identification of Downstream Substrates of Aurora-A by Small Pool Expression Screening—Small pool expression screening was used to identify the downstream substrates of Aurora-A protein kinase. Briefly, we transcribed and translated small pools of human placenta cDNA library in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The [35S]methionine-labeled protein pools were incubated with either purified GST-wild-type (WT) or catalytically inactive (KR) recombinant Aurora-A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In the screening for electrophoretic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, 11 out of 342 cDNA small pools tested exhibited mobility shift changes in Aurora-A-WT- but not Aurora-A-KR-treated protein pools. One of the positive pools is shown in Fig. 1A. Subsequently, treatment with λ phosphatase abolished the slowly migrating mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the electrophoretic mobility shift was caused by protein phosphorylation (data not shown). All positive pools were retransformed into E. coli, and the individual cDNA clones were isolated and tested with kinase reactions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We subsequently sequenced those cDNA clones that tested positive and identified nine non-redundant cDNA clones. Fig. 1B summarizes the findings and showed that nine [35S]methionine-labeled single clones exhibited electrophoretic mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE when incubated with Aurora-A-WT. Several of the identified substrates, such as c-Fos and FLJ10877 fis, exhibited significant electrophoretic mobility shifts, raising the possibility that there are multiple phosphorylatio"
https://openalex.org/W2115874465,"Expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin is associated with cancer cell viability and drug resistance. Thus, control of its expression in cancer cells has significant consequences for cancer therapeutics. Here we have shown that hedamycin, a GC-rich DNA binding drug, down-regulated survivin expression. Using a series of survivin promoter-luciferase constructs, we have identified an 86-bp GC-rich DNA element (-124 to -39) that mediates the ability of hedamycin to down-regulate survivin expression. Furthermore, both in vivo foot-printing and in vitro gel mobility shift experiments revealed that hedamycin bound to a 21-bp GC-rich DNA element (-115 to -95) in the survivin promoter. This drug-DNA interaction abrogated the binding of Sp-1 or Sp1-like proteins to the 21-bp cis-acting DNA element, and mutagenesis of this region consistently diminished survivin promoter activity. Finally, down-regulation of survivin transcription by hedamycin modulated the viability of cancer cells. These data suggest that abrogation of Sp-1 or Sp1-like protein binding to the 21-bp DNA element in the survivin promoter contributes at least in part to the inhibitory effect of hedamycin on survivin gene transcription.

Consistent with the dual functions of survivin, there are two pools (cytoplasmic and nuclear) of survivin associated with distinct subcellular components (8Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A.

Moreover, the expression of survivin is cell cycle-regulated with a robust increase in G2/M (6Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C.

Thus, survivin appears to be an important cancer therapeutic target, and modulation of survivin expression and/or function may provide rational approaches for cancer therapeutics. One of the major strategies for modulating survivin expression is control of its transcription. We and others have previously demonstrated that doxorubicin-induced cancer cell death is at least in part involved in the transcriptional inhibition of survivin through doxorubicin stabilization of p53 proteins (31Zhou M. Gu L. Li F. Zhu Y. Woods W.G. Findley H.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Mirza A. McGuirk M. Hockenberry T.N. Wu Q. Ashar H. Black S.

However, it is not known whether small sequence-selective DNA binding anticancer agents could modulate survivin expression by binding to the survivin promoter region and regulating promoter activity. Also, it is not known whether the modulation of survivin transcription by certain DNA binding drugs plays a role in drug action mechanism associated with induction of tumor cell death. Answers to these questions could lead to the development of novel approaches to control survivin transcription for new cancer therapeutic strategies. In this report, we investigated the molecular specificity of a GC-rich sequence-selective DNA binding drug, hedamycin. We found that hedamycin down-regulates survivin transcription by engaging an 86-bp GC-rich element (-124 to -39) in the survivin core promoter region and by preventing accessibility of this sequence to Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins involved in transcription. Functionally, hedamycin-induced down-regulation of survivin resulted in enhanced apoptosis of tumor cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—Cells from human colon cancer (HCT116) and cervical epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) were maintained in RPMI1640 and DMEM, 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DMS, dimethyl sulfate. respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were routinely subcultured twice weekly. The antisurvivin antibody (FL-142), a polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody generated by immunizing rabbits with the full-length survivin protein, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Hedamycin was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Propidium iodide, dimethyl sulfate (DMS), piperidine, monoclonal antiactin antibody, and goat peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit IgG antibody were purchased from Sigma. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Vent DNA polymerase and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolab (Beverly, MA). Oligotransfectamine™ reagent and Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Western Blot—In all experiments, cells were treated with hedamycin in the presence of complete medium containing 10% serum. Western blot analysis of survivin and actin expression was performed as described previously (34Ling X. Bernacki R.J. Brattain M.G. Li F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15196-15203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase visualization system kit (National Diagnostics/LPS, Rochester, NY) and visualized by autoradiography after various exposure times (20–120 s). Total RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Cells both with and without hedamycin treatments were used to isolate total RNAs. The mRNAs for survivin and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined by Northern blot analysis as described previously (35Li F. Ling X. Huang H. Brattain L. Apontes P. Wu J. Binderup L. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Vector Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5 × 104/well) and grown to ∼50–60% confluence for transfection. Each of the relevant survivin promoter-luciferase constructs (36Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with pRL-TK (TK promoter-Renilla-luciferase construct, internal control) into HeLa cells. Briefly, 490 ng of a pLuc-survivin construct and 10 ng of pRL-TK in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM were mixed with 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine™ in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM in a 1.5-ml tube for each well of 24-well plates. After incubation at room temperature for 20–25 min, the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was added to each well containing 200 μl of serum-free DMEM. Following incubation for 2–3 h, the DNA-Lipofectamine complex was replaced by complete medium containing 10% serum. Cells were treated with hedamycin 24 h after transfection and processed for luciferase assays 8–24 h after drug treatment. For the luciferase assay, a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used. The transfected cells in 24-well plates were washed with PBS and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (up to 200 μl/well) on a shaker for up to 1 h at 4°C. Cell lysate (20 μl/well) was used for measurement of luciferase activities in a luminometer by first mixing the cell lysate (20 μl) with 20 μl of luciferase assay reagent for measuring firefly luciferase activity and subsequently adding 20 μl of Stop-Glo reagent for measuring Renilla luciferase activity. Data were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (internal control) as arbitrary units. Contiguously Nested Deletion of the Survivin Promoter Luciferase Construct—Contiguous deletion of bases from 230 to 86 in pLuc-230c was carried out using an Erase-a-Base system (Promega). Briefly, pLuc-230c (100–150 μg/ml) was completely digested with SalI, filled in with 50 units of Klenow DNA polymerase/ml (Promega), and blocked with 40 μm α-phosphorothioate dNTP/1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37 °C. After heat inactivation of the enzyme for 10 min at 70 °C, the end-blocked DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and digested with BamHI, followed by a second phenol extraction and quantification. Digested DNA (5 μg) was incubated at 25 °C in 60 μl of Exo III digestion buffer containing 66 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.66 mm MgCl2, and 400 units of exonuclease III. Aliquots (2.5 μl) from the above solution were mixed with the S1 digestion buffer (7.5 μl) containing 40 mm potassium acetate (pH 4.6), 340 mm NaCl, 1.35 mm ZnSO3, 7% glycerol, and S1 nuclease (300 units/ml) every 15–30 s/time point. The aliquot mixtures from each time point were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C, stopped with 1 μl of 0.3 m Tris base and 0.05 m EDTA, and heat-inactivated for 10 min at 70 °C. Contiguously deleted DNA samples at each time point were blunted with 100–150 units of Klenow/ml for 10 min at 37 °C and religated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5% polyethylene glycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units of T4 ligase/ml at 16 °C overnight. Competent Escherichia coli cells were subsequently transformed with the religated contiguously deleted DNA samples by electroporation. The clones carrying progressive deletions from the 5′-end were identified by PCR amplification of 10–20 colonies from each time point. The exact deletion end in each clone containing the expected size was determined by sequencing. In Vivo Footprinting by Ligation-mediated Polymerase Chain Reaction (LM-PCR)—The LM-PCR method utilized was largely based on the Mueller and Wold protocol (48Mueller P.R. Wold B. Garrity P.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 15.13.11-15.13.26Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, (i) HeLa cells grown in 15-cm plates with or without hedamycin treatment were permeabilized for 2–4 min with 24 ml of PBS containing 24 μl of DMS, followed by gentle washing of each plate three times for 20–40 s/wash with 20 ml of PBS. Cells were then lysed with 1.5 ml of lysis solution (NaCl 300 mm, Tris 50 mm, pH 8.0, EDTA 25 mm, SDS 0.2%, and proteinase K 0.2 mg/ml). The resultant lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 3–16 h and extracted four times with equal volumes of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The genomic DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol, redissolved overnight in 2 ml of TE buffer (Tris 10 mm, pH 8.0, EDEA 1 mm)/plate, and precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m NaAc. The DNA was then redissolved in 200 μl of TE and adjusted to a concentration of 0.5–2 μg. (ii) DNA (125 μg in 175 μl of TE) isolated from cells without drug treatment was mixed with 25 μl of 1% DMS in dH2O for 2–4 min and quenched with 50 μl of cold DMS stop solution (1 m β-mercaptoethanol and 1.5 m NaAc, pH 7.0). Next, DNA (100–200 μg in 200 μl of TE) from cells treated with hedamycin was similarly mixed with 50 μl of cold DMS stop solution. DNA from each reaction was then precipitated by adding 750 μl of cold 100% ethanol and washed with cold 75% ethanol. (iii) The DNA was dissolved in 1 m piperidine for 15 min, incubated at 90 °C for 30 min, frozen on dry ice, and evaporated for 1–2 h in a SpeedVac. DNA was precipitated in 400 μl of TE containing NaAc (0.3 m) by adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and then precipitated a second time in 650 μl of TE containing NH4Ac (2.5 m) by adding equal volumes of isopropanol. After washing with 500 μl of 75% ethanol, DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of dH2O, dried in a SpeedVac, and redissolved in TE to a concentration of 0.4–0.6 μg/μl for LM-PCR. (iv) LM-PCR: 20 μm each of the two linker primers, LM25 (5′-GCG GTG ACC CGG GAG ATC TGA ATT C-3′) and LM11 (5′-GAA TTC AGA TC-3′), were annealed. Three μg of DNA template/reaction were used for the first strand synthesis with gcFP1 or hRP1 (refer to Fig. 4 for sequence information) and Vent DNA polymerase, followed by ligation of the annealing linker primer to the first strand DNA at 16 °C overnight using T4 DNA Ligase. The ligated DNA in each reaction was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m NaAc and 10 μg of yeast tRNA and washed with 70% ethanol. This DNA was used as templates for PCR using LM25 and gcFP2 or hRP2 (refer to Fig. 4) with Vent DNA polymerase for 21 PCR cycles, followed by two additional PCR cycles after adding [γ-32P]ATP-labeled gcFP3 or hRP3. The DNA in each reaction was extracted using an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and the supernatant was evenly divided into three tubes. The DNA in each tube was precipitated with 2–3 volumes of 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and air dried for 10 min. Each of the samples was then resuspended in 4–8 μl of loading buffers and denatured at 90 °C for 3–4 min. We ran 2–3 μl of each sample on a 6% PAGE gel along with 32P-labled φX174 DNA/Hinf I markers. Isolation of HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts—HeLa cells at ∼90% confluence were scraped into ice-cold PBS and collected into conical tubes. After centrifuging the tube at 1,800–2000 × g at 2 °C for 15 min, the cell pellets were gently resuspended with 3× pellet cell volume of ice-cold buffer A without Triton X-100 (10 mm HEPES, PH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were then pelleted as above and resuspended in 3× pellet cell volume of ice-cold buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v). The resuspended cells were allowed to swell for 12–15 min on ice. Cell nuclei were then collected by centrifugation (3440 × g) for 15 min at 2 °C and resuspended with 1× packed nuclei volume in ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell nuclei suspension was incubated on ice (∼2 °C) for 30 min with continuous mixing. The nuclear extracts (supernatant) were collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. The nuclear extracts were aliquoted (50–100 μl/each 1.5-ml tube), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80 °C for EMSA experiments. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides (probes) were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (8–15 μg) were preincubated in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, PH 7.9, 25 mm NaCI, 5 mm MgCI2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 12.5 μg/ml thymus DNA) for 20 min at 25 °C in a volume of 19 μl with and without an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors in the presence or absence of hedamycin. After addition of 1 μl of labeled DNA (1–2 × 105 cpm), the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at 25 °C. Each reaction mixture was then loaded into the well of a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 V in 1× TBE buffer (Tris-borate, 90 mm, EDTA 1 mm) at 25 °C for 1–2 h. To determine the direct interaction of the 21-bp DNA element (refer to Fig. 4 for sequence information) with hedamycin, the reaction was run on a 12 instead of a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The typical sequence for Sp-1 binding used in this study is 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′. Generation of pLuc-230CDE3m—PLuc-230CDE3m, in which the 21-bp element (CDE3W) contains point mutations (lower case letters in the CDE3m primer), was generated as follows. Using pLuc-230 as templates, the 230CDE3M PCR fragment was amplified using a pair of primers, hscyc-1 (5′-CGC GGATCC GCG TTC TTT GAA AGC AGT C-3′ (BamHI underlined) and CDE3m (5′-CCC AAGCTT AAA TCT GGC GGT TAA TGG CGC GCC GCG GGG CAT GTC GGG AGC GCA CGC CCT CTT AGG CGG TCa cCC CCC ata GGC CTT CTG-3′ (HindIII underlined and the 21-bp element in bold). After being digested with BamHI and HindIII, the PCR fragment was cloned into the pLuc luciferase reporter vector at the BamHI and HindIII sites in the correct orientation upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The obtained clones were characterized by BamHI and HindIII digestion and then confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of the Survivin Expression Vector and Cell Death Assay—The expression vector for survivin has been characterized previously (6Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S.

HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1 × 105/well) for fluorescence microscopy studies or in 6-well plates (3 × 105/well) for flow cytometry analysis. Cells at ∼40–50% confluence were transfected with pEGFPc1 (control vector, Clontech) or survivin expression vector pEGFPc1-survivin (pG-survivin). Briefly, 1 μg(3 μg for 6-well plates) of vector DNA in 100 μl (300 μl for 6-well plates) of serum-free DMEM was mixed with 3 μl (9 μl for 6-well plates) of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 100 μl (300 μl for 6-well plates) of serum-free DMEM in a 1.5-ml tube for each well of a 12-well plate. After the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20–40 min, the DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 mixture was added to each well containing 300 μl of the cell culture medium. The DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complex was replaced by complete medium containing 10% serum after incubation for 6 h. Cells were treated with hedamycin overnight 24 h after transfection. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, mounted using mounting solution containing 0.05% 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and sealed with round cover glasses. For flow cytometry, cells from the 6-well plates were harvested by trypsinization and washed with PBS. Cells were fixed in 5 ml of 70% ethanol for 30 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 25 μg/ml propidium iodide and 40 μg/ml RNase A for 30–45 min on ice. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences) by counting 10,000 cells/sample with and without gating EGFP fluorescence. Data from flow cytometry were analyzed using WinList software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME). Parallel triplicate assays were performed. Statistical Analysis—We performed a pair-wise comparison of each experimental group with a control group after checking to make sure the data were approximately normal. When necessary we applied a square-root transformation to conform the residuals to approximately normal. We employed a two-group t test assuming equal variance. The significance levels quoted are two-tailed, and significance (p value) was set at the nominal level of 0.05. Hedamycin Down-regulates Survivin Expression and Promoter Activity—We investigated the ability of hedamycin, a GC-rich DNA-selective binding drug to affect expression levels of the mitotic regulator and apoptosis inhibitor, survivin. Treatment of cancer cell lines including HeLa (Fig. 1A) and HCT116 (Fig. 1B) with hedamycin resulted in significant inhibition of survivin expression. Comparable concentrations of hedamycin were associated with dose-dependent loss of cancer cell viability, imaged under a phase-contrast microscope (Fig. 1C). Hedamycin treatment was also associated with down-regulation of survivin mRNA expression (Fig. 2A), suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for the modulation of survivin expression. Accordingly, luciferase reporter assay experiments revealed that hedamycin also decreased survivin promoter activity (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Hedamycin down-regulates survivin mRNA expression and its promoter activity.A, HeLa cells were treated as shown. Subsequently, survivin mRNA expression was determined by Northern blotting. Glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was an internal control for total RNA loading. B, HeLa cells were transfected with a survivin promoter-luciferase construct, pLuc-6270, and the internal control vector, pRL-TK. Cells were then treated with hedamycin for 16 h as indicated, followed by measurement of luciferase activity using a dual luciferase reporter system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were derived from a representative experiment in triplicate after normalization to Renilla luciferase activity (internal controls) and are shown in a histogram as percentages.

Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were transfected into HeLa cells and analyzed for transcriptional activity after treatment with hedamycin for up to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, a 230-bp survivin core promoter region was sufficient to recapitulate the inhibitory effect of hedamycin on survivin gene expression. Next, we narrowed the minimal responsive region in the survivin promoter using a set of contiguous deletion constructs derived from the 230-bp core promoter region. In these experiments, a cis-acting DNA element involved in hedamycin-mediated transcriptional repression was functionally mapped to an 86-bp GC-rich DNA fragment (from -124 to -39) (Fig. 3B). Further deletion of the 86-bp promoter region revealed a significant loss of promoter activity (not shown), which was not further investigated for hedamycin-dependent modulation. A 21-bp DNA Motif within the Functionally Identified 86-bp DNA Fragment Is at Least in Part Involved in the Inhibitory Effect of Hedamycin on Survivin Expression—To investigate whether a cis-acting DNA element was responsible for hedamycin-mediated down-regulation of survivin gene expression, we employed an in vivo LM-PCR footprinting approach (Fig. 4). In these experiments, a DNA element containing a 21-bp DNA motif (Fig. 4, A and B) exhibited sensitivity to DMS-mediated piperidine digestion, implying that the binding of hedamycin to DNA chang"
https://openalex.org/W2093358776,"The subcellular localization of the polyamine transporter TPO1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. When expressed from a multi-copy vector, TPO1 was located mainly on the plasma membrane, but with some localization on the vacuolar membrane. Polyamine transport by TPO1 was dependent on pH. Uptake of spermidine and spermine occurred at alkaline pH (pH 8.0), whereas inhibition of spermidine uptake, but not spermine uptake, was observed at acidic pH (pH 5.0). This suggests that TPO1 catalyzes polyamine excretion at acidic pH, similar to the PotE transporter in Escherichia coli. Paraquat, a polyamine analogue, was excreted by TPO1 at a rate comparable with the excretion of spermidine (deduced from the inhibition of spermidine uptake) at pH 5.0. However, excretion of preloaded radiolabeled spermidine and spermine was not observed in intact cells, suggesting that preloaded spermidine (or spermine) exists mainly as spermidine (or spermine)-ribosome complex in cells. The transport activity of TPO1 was enhanced through phosphorylation at Ser19 by protein kinase C and at Thr52 by casein kinase 1. Sorting of TPO1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane was enhanced through phosphorylation at Ser342 by cAMP-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2.

Sorting of TPO1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane was enhanced through phosphorylation at Ser342 by cAMP-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2. Polyamines, which are essential for cell growth, are regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, and transport (1Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). With regard to polyamine transport, the properties of three polyamine transport systems were clarified in our laboratory by cloning the genes for these systems from Escherichia coli (2Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified four genes that encode polyamine transport proteins TPO1 through TPO4 (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Overexpression of these proteins reduced polyamine toxicity and promoted accumulation of polyamines in vacuoles. Among the four polyamine transporters, those encoded by TPO2 and TPO3 were specific for spermine, whereas those encoded by TPO1 and TPO4 recognized putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. We also reported recently that another transporter, UGA4, located on the vacuolar membrane, can catalyze the uptake of putrescine and 4-aminobutyric acid (6Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We reported that TPO1 is located on the vacuolar membrane after overexpression using the multi-copy vector YEp351 (7Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported recently that TPO1 is located on the plasma membrane, as determined by using a hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; PKC, protein kinase C; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; TPK, yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase.-tagged TPO1 knock-in strain (8Albertsen M. Bellahn I. Krämer R. Waffenschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, TPO1, located on the plasma membrane, was predicted to be involved in excretion of polyamines. However, polyamine excretion by TPO1 was very low (∼20 pmol spermidine excreted/min/mg cell dry mass) (8Albertsen M. Bellahn I. Krämer R. Waffenschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, we re-examined the cellular localization and polyamine transport activity of TPO1 using multi-copy and single-copy plasmids encoding TPO1 or HA-tagged TPO1. Furthermore, we studied the effect of phosphorylation of TPO1 on cellular localization and polyamine transport activity. We found that TPO1 is located on the plasma membrane but that some TPO1 is also located on the vacuolar membrane when TPO1 is overproduced. Furthermore, TPO1 can catalyze the uptake of polyamines at alkaline pH and their excretion at acidic pH. We also studied the effect of phosphorylation by using TPO1 with mutations at Ser/Thr residues located in putative cytoplasmic loop regions and by using yeast strains deficient in protein kinases. The activity of TPO1 was enhanced by phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase 1, and sorting of TPO1 to the plasma membrane was enhanced by phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2. Plasmids—Plasmid YEpTPO1 in vector YEp351 (LEU2+) (7Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A.

For construction of the plasmid encoding HA-tagged TPO1 (YEpTPO1-HA3), the gene for the TPO1 open reading frame lacking the termination codon was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of X2180-1A (MATa SUC2 mal0 gal2 CUP1) as a template using primer sets of HindIII-TPO1F (5′-TAGCCCAAGCTTGATCGTAGGAATTCCCTAAAG-3′) and SalI-TPO1R (5′-TAACGCGTCGACAGCGGCGTAAGCATACTT-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and SalI and inserted into the same restriction sites of YEp352 (URA3+) (7Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding three copies of Haemophilus influenzae HA epitope was amplified from pcDNA3-HA (9Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), which was a generous gift from Dr. N. Sonenberg (McGill University), using primers SalI-Gly5HA3F (5′-TAACGCGTCGACGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGAC-3′) and EcoRI-HA3R (5′-CCGGAATTCTTACTGAGCAGCGTAATCTGGAAC-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with SalI and EcoRI and inserted into the same restriction sites of the plasmid constructed as described above. For efficient expression of TPO1 protein, 170 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of the UGA4 gene (10André B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.-C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was amplified by primers UGA4UTRF (5′-GGAATTCTAAATGTTCAAACCTTTATAAAGA-3′) and UGA4-UTRR (5′-GGAATTCATCTGCCATTAACATTCCCG-3′) and inserted into the EcoRI site located downstream of HA-tagged sequences after digesting the fragment with EcoRI. The single-copy plasmid encoding HA-tagged TPO1 (YCpTPO1-HA3) was constructed by inserting the DNA fragment of the HA-tagged TPO1 gene of YEpTPO1-HA3. After amplification of the HA-tagged TPO1 gene by PCR using primers HindIII-TPO1F and HindIII-UGA43′UTRR (5′-TAGCCCAAGCTTATCTGCCATTAACATTCCCG-3′), the DNA product was digested with HindIII and inserted into the same site of YCp50 (URA3+) (11Kuo C.-L.

Plasmid YEp352 (URA3+) encoding the TPO1 gene (YEpTPO1-2) was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment of YEpTPO1 (YEp351 encoding the TPO1 gene) into the same sites of YEp352. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TPO1 gene was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a Seq 4 × 4 personal sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences).

To transform YEpTPO1 and YEp351 (LEU2+) for the assay of polyamine transport, TPK1 and TPK2 gene-disrupted mutants (YKT724 and YKT725) of YPH499 were generated by one-step gene disruption (16Kaiser C.

Briefly, after treatment with Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm E64C (a thiol proteinase inhibitor; Peptide Institute, Inc.), and 20 μm FUT-175 (a serine protease inhibitor; Ref. 21Fujii S. Hitomi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and fractionated by a discontinuous sucrose gradient ranging from 18% to 54% (w/v) in 10 steps of 4% difference each. The fractionated membrane was suspended in 100 μl of a SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.2% sodium deoxycholic acid, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). A 50 μl aliquot of samples was separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). After proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore), HA-tagged TPO1, vacuolar H+-ATPase 1 (VPH1), and plasma membrane ATPase 1 (PMA1) were detected using the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. When refractionation of the vacuolar membrane fraction was performed, two batches of vacuolar fractions (fractions 3–6) obtained by centrifugation were used for a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—This was performed according to the methods of Pringle et al. (23Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) using mouse monoclonal anti-HA as a primary antibody and goat anti-mouse-IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 as a secondary antibody. The slides were immersed in ProLong antifade solution (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence was analyzed with a confocal microscope (LSM510 laser scanning microscope; Zeiss) with an argon laser (λex = 488 nm and λem = 505 nm). Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-VPH1 (clone 10D7; Molecular Probes), rabbit polyclonal anti-PMA1 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Serrano, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas; Ref. 24Eraso P. Cid A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes), and horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Transport Assay—Yeast YPH499, LRB341, LRB264, LRB265, YKT724, YKT725, and LRY636 cells carrying YEpTPO1 (LEU2+), yeast DL100 and DL376 cells carrying YEpTPO1–2 (URA3+), and yeast YPH499 and YTH27-1 cells carrying YCP50 or YCpTPO1 were harvested at A540 = 0.5. Collected cells were suspended in the buffer containing 20 mm Na/Hepes, pH 8.0 (or 20 mm Na/MES buffer, pH 5.0), and 10 mm glucose at 0.2 mg protein/ml and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 mm [14C]spermine or [14C]spermidine (37 MBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 20, 40, or 60 min, a 0.5 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was filtered through cellulose acetate filter (pore size, 0.45 μm; ADVANTEC) and washed two times with the buffer described above containing 1 mm spermine or spermidine. The radioactivity on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For the assay of polyamine excretion, paraquat, one of the polyamine analogues (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was used as substrate. [14C]Paraquat was preloaded by incubation of cells (0.2 mg protein/ml) with 1 mm [14C]paraquat (18.5 MBq/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) at pH 8.0 for 90 min. After cells were washed as described above, [14C]paraquat-loaded cells were incubated in the buffer containing 20 mm Na/MES buffer, pH 5.0, and 10 mm glucose. After incubation for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min at 30 °C, a 0.5 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was centrifuged (17,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C), and the radioactivity of the supernatant was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Measurement of Polyamine Content in Whole Cells—Polyamines in whole cells harvested at A540 = 0.5 were extracted by treatment of the cells with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 70 °C for 1 h with occasional shaking. Polyamine content was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (26Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cellular Localization of TPO1 Protein—To determine the cellular localization of TPO1, a triple HA epitope tag was attached to the C terminus of TPO1. Cells overexpressing TPO1-HA3 were resistant to spermine toxicity, as were cells overexpressing untagged TPO1, indicating that TPO1-HA3 functions similarly to TPO1 (data not shown). Using TPO1-HA3, cellular localization was determined by Western blot analysis after sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the membrane fraction. As shown in Fig. 1, TPO1-HA3 was located in the plasma membrane fraction when TPO1-HA3 was expressed using the single-copy vector YCp50. The results confirmed the recent report by Albertsen et al. (8Albertsen M. Bellahn I. Krämer R. Waffenschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, TPO1-HA3 was located in both the vacuolar membrane and plasma membrane fractions when the protein was expressed using the multi-copy vector YEp352. To exclude the possibility that the TPO1-HA3 found in the vacuolar membrane fraction (lanes 3–6 in the second panel of Fig. 1) actually reflects contamination from the plasma membrane fraction, refractionation of the vacuolar membrane fractions was performed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. TPO1-HA3 appeared not only in the vacuolar membrane fraction but also in the plasma membrane fraction. The amount of TPO1 at vacuolar membrane fraction was increased compared with the first fractionation, suggesting that some TPO1 is indeed located on the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 1). These results were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, fluorescent TPO1-HA3 was observed in both the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane when these proteins were expressed using the multi-copy vector YEp352. However, when the protein was expressed using the single-copy plasmid YCp50, TPO1-HA3 was located mainly on plasma membrane.Fig. 2Subcellular localization of TPO1 determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Yeast BY4741 cells carrying plasmid encoding the HA-tagged TPO1 gene were cultured in Mg2+-limited synthetic complete medium in the presence of 0.4 mm spermine and harvested at A540 = 0.5.

As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, uptake of spermine and spermidine was observed at pH 8.0, using cells transformed with the multi-copy plasmid. For the E. coli putrescine transport protein PotE, putrescine is transported in both directions; putrescine uptake occurs at pH > 7, whereas excretion occurs at acidic pH (27Kashiwagi K. Kuraishi A. Tomitori H. Igarashi A. Nishimura K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36007-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether TPO1 has a similar activity, excretion of spermine and spermidine was measured at pH 5.0, which is close to the pH value within vacuoles (28Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, spermine uptake at pH 5.0 was only slightly inhibited by TPO1, but spermidine uptake was clearly inhibited, indicating that TPO1 has polyamine excretion activity at acidic pH. When TPO1 was expressed with the single-copy plasmid in TPO1 gene-disrupted mutant YTH27-1, low but significant uptake at pH 8.0 and excretion of these polyamines at pH 5.0, judging from the inhibition of the uptake of these polyamines, were observed (Fig. 3, B and D). The results indicate that TPO1 located on the plasma membrane catalyzes spermine and spermidine uptake at pH 8.0 and excretion of these polyamines at pH 5.0. Excretion of preloaded [14C]spermidine from cells by TPO1 was then examined. However, the excretion of preloaded [14C]spermidine by TPO1 was very small (data not shown), confirming previous results (8Albertsen M. Bellahn I. Krämer R. Waffenschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because spermidine binds to ribosomes (29Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the measured excretion of spermidine may be influenced by spermidine binding to ribosomes. We therefore measured the excretion of preloaded [14C]paraquat, a polyamine analogue (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), by TPO1. As shown in Fig. 4, excretion of [14C]paraquat from cells was in the following order: YPH499/YCpTPO1 > YPH499/YCp50 > TPO1 gene-disrupted mutant YTH27-1/YCp50. Excretion of [14C]paraquat by TPO1 (∼0.4 nmol/min/mg protein) occurred at a rate comparable with excretion of spermidine, as deduced by the inhibition of spermidine uptake by TPO1 at pH 5.0 (∼0.4 nmol/min/mg protein) (see Fig. 3B). However, excretion of [14C]paraquat was not observed at pH 8.0 (data not shown). Excretion of spermine was confirmed by measuring spermine content in cells cultured in the presence of spermine. As shown in Table II, spermine content became lower in YPH499 cells containing YEpTPO1 than in YPH499 cells during the culture with 0.4 mm spermine. A mutant with a disrupted TPO1 gene became more sensitive to spermine toxicity, so the strain was cultured in the presence of 0.25 mm rather than 0.4 mm spermine. There was greater accumulation of spermine in these mutant YTH27-1 cells than in wild-type cells. The results indicate that TPO1 can function to excrete polyamines as well as other substances (30do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.-L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B.

Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether TPO1, which functions mainly as the excretion protein of polyamines, is also regulated by phosphorylation or not. We mutated the 10 Ser/Thr potential phosphorylation sites in TPO1 to alanine residues (Fig. 5A). These residues were thought to be located in the cytoplasmic loop regions of the TPO1 protein (5Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Resistance to spermine toxicity, measured as cell growth in the presence of 0.4 mm spermine in the medium, was examined using these TPO1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 5B, resistance to spermine toxicity was observed with wild-type TPO1 and the mutants S8A, 2The mutated TPO1 S8A contains alanine instead of serine at position 8. S23A, S72A, T81A, T85A, S91A, and S357A, whereas resistance to spermine toxicity was greatly reduced or absent in the S19A, T52A, and S342A mutants. The uptake of spermidine by TPO1 mutants was measured at pH 8.0 using cells transformed with YEpTPO1 or YEpTPO1 encoding the mutant TPO1 (Fig. 6). In the S19A, T52A, and S342A mutants, spermidine uptake was decreased. Because an aspartate or glutamate residue can function similarly to a phosphorylated serine or threonine residues, we also examined spermidine uptake activity of TPO1 mutants containing glutamate at these positions (the S19E, T52E, and S342E mutants). The activity of these mutants was higher than that of the wild type (Fig. 6A), consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of the native Ser and Thr residues regulates the activity of TPO1. Essentially the same results were obtained using TPO1 gene-disrupted YTH27-1 cells transformed with the single-copy plasmid YCpTPO1 or YCp50 encoding the mutated TPO1 (Fig. 6B). Based on consensus amino acid sequences, phosphorylation of Ser19, Thr52, and Ser342 can be catalyzed by protein kinase C, casein kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively (35Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are three kinds of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (13Robertson L.S. Causton H.C. Young R.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5984-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), one form of protein kinase C (14Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and two casein kinases (15Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garrett S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined which kinases are involved in activation of TPO1 using mutants deficient in each kinase. First, resistance to spermine toxicity, measured as cell growth in the presence of 0.4 mm spermine, was examined using each kinase-deficient mutant carrying the plasmid encoding TPO1 in a multi-copy vector. As shown in Fig. 7, spermine toxicity was markedly increased in a casein kinase-deficient mutant (Δyck1) and in two of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase mutants (Δtpk1 and Δtpk2). A less dramatic but still large increase in spermine toxicity was observed in a protein kinase C-deficient mutant (Δpkc1). The spermine toxicity of Δpkc1, Δyck1, and Δtpk1 and Δtpk2 mutants was relieved by YEpTPO1 (S19E), YEpTPO1 (T52E), and YEpTPO1 (S342E), respectively (Fig. 7), but not by other TPO1 mutants (data not shown). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser19, Thr52, and Ser342 is catalyzed by protein kinase C, casein kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. Spermidine uptake activity by TPO1 was then measured at pH 8.0 using these mutants transformed with various YEpTPO1 mutants. The uptake activity was greatly inhibited in the Δpkc1, Δyck1, and Δtpk1 and Δtpk2 mutants, and the activity of Δpkc1, Δyck1, and Δtpk1 and Δtpk2 mutants was recovered by transforming YEpTPO1 (S19E), YEpTPO1(T52E), and YEpTpo1 (S342E) mutants, respectively, but not by transforming other mutants (Fig. 8). These results indicate that three different types of protein kinase (protein kinase C, casein kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase) are involved in the regulation of TPO1 activity under these experimental conditions. The subcellular distribution of the TPO1-HA3 mutants was studied using TPO1 gene-disrupted mutant YTH27-1 transformed with the single-copy plasmid YCpTPO1-HA3 mutants. These experiments were designed to examine the role of phosphorylation of Ser19, Thr52, and Ser342 in localization of TPO1. As shown in Fig. 9, the TPO1 mutants S19A and T52A were located on the plasma membrane, but the mutant S342A was located intracellularly, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that phosphorylation at Ser19 and Thr52 enhances the activity of TPO1 and that phosphorylation at Ser342 enhances sorting of TPO1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Evidence that cAMP-dependent protein kinases TPK1 and TPK2 are involved in the sorting of TPO1 to the plasma membrane was also obtained from the cellular localization of TPO1 using yeast mutants deficient in each cAMP-dependent protein kinase. As shown in Fig. 10, sorting of TPO1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane was clearly decreased in Δtpk1 and Δtpk2 mutants, but not in Δtpk3 mutant. However, TPO1 (S342E) was located on the plasma membrane in the Δtpk1 and Δtpk2 mutants, supporting the possibility that phosphorylation of Ser342 by TPK1 and TPK2 is important for the sorting of TPO1 to the plasma membrane.Fig. 10Subcellular localization of TPO1 in cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene-deficient mutants. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene-disrupted mutants (Δtpk1, Δtpk2, and Δtpk3) and their parental strains were transformed with YCpTPO1-HA3 or YCp mutated TPO1-HA3 and cultured as described in the Fig. 3 legend and harvested at A540 = 0.5.

Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported recently that TPO1 is located on the plasma membrane (8Albertsen M. Bellahn I. Krämer R. Waffenschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We confirmed these results using a single-copy vector. However, some TPO1 was also found on the vacuolar membrane when expressed using a multi-copy vector. Similar results were obtained with TPO2, TPO3, and TPO4 (data not shown). In a previous study (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we could not observe a decrease in spermine content in cells by TPO1 when cells were cultured in the presence of 0.3 mm spermine, nor did we detect excretion of spermine from cells by TPO1 using an in vitro system. Thus, we concluded that TPO1 was located on vacuoles. In this study, we observed a decrease in spermine content by TPO1 when cells were cultured in the presence of 0.4 mm spermine instead of 0.3 mm spermine (Table II) and also observed the excretion of paraquat, but not spermine and spermidine, in an in vitro system. When cells are cultured in a high concentration of spermine, a large amount of spermine accumulates in cells. As a result, free spermine probably increases, and the spermine is then excreted from cells, leading to the observed decrease in spermine content. Experiments designed to study the excretion of paraquat or polyamines were carried out using cells that had been preloaded for 90 min with these amines. In this case, the preloaded spermine and spermidine, but not paraquat, probably bound to acidic substrates such as ribosomes (29Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This could account for the observed excretion of paraquat and the lack of excretion of polyamines. Thus, it is now clear that TPO1 on the plasma membrane can excrete various substances (30do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.-L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Teixeira M.C. Sa-Correia I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This is the first report to show the decrease in spermine from cells and efficient excretion activity of the polyamine derivative paraquat from cells by TPO1. We reported previously that the E. coli putrescine transport protein PotE has putrescine uptake activity as well as excretion activity (27Kashiwagi K. Kuraishi A. Tomitori H. Igarashi A. Nishimura K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36007-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, we thought that TPO1 might also be able to catalyze polyamine transport in both directions. In this study, we showed that TPO1 catalyzes polyamine uptake at pH > 7 and excretion at acidic pH. If the transport activity of TPO1 is analogous to that of PotE, polyamine uptake at pH > 7 is probably dependent on proton motive force composed mainly of membrane potential, whereas polyamine excretion at acidic pH is catalyzed by a polyamine-H+ antiport activity of TPO1. It has been reported that casein kinase 1-dependent phosphorylation is required for membrane trafficking of Pdr5p to the plasma membrane in yeast (38Decottignies A. Owsianik G. Ghislain M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37139-37146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that both cAMP-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2 are necessary for the complete sorting of TPO1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation site by cAMP-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2 was at Ser342, which is located in the cytoplasmic loop between the VI and VII transmembrane segment (see Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of Ser342 was mimicked by Glu342. Thus, a negative charge at this position is important for sorting of TPO1 to plasma membrane. The deficiency of either cAMP-dependent protein kinase 1 or 2 enhanced spermine toxicity during cell growth and caused the decrease in spermidine uptake activity. This suggests that the function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase 1 was not fully substituted by cAMP-dependent protein kinase 2 and vice versa. We do not know the exact role of these two kinases, but both kinases may exist in cells in a limited amount. Therefore, they may not compensate each other. We have reported previously that polyamine uptake in yeast is regulated by Ser/Thr protein kinases, polyamine transport kinases 1 and 2 (33Kakinuma Y. Maruyama T. Nozaki T. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Nozaki T. Nishimura K. Michael A.J. Maruyama T. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activity of TPO1 was not influenced by these two kinases (data not shown). Thus, these two kinases are involved only in the polyamine uptake protein rather than in the polyamine excretion protein like TPO1. We thank Drs. K. Williams and A. J.

The amount of IP3 produced is particularly critical to determining the spatio-temporally coordinated Ca2+-signaling patterns. In this paper, we report a novel signal cross-talk between DAG and the IP3-mediated Ca2+-signaling pathway. We found that a DAG derivative, 1-oleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), induces Ca2+ oscillation in various types of cells independently of protein kinase C activity and extracellular Ca2+. The OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was completely abolished by depletion of Ca2+ stores or inhibition of PLC and IP3 receptors, indicating that OAG stimulates IP3 production through PLC activation and thereby induces IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Furthermore, intracellular accumulation of endogenous DAG by a DAG-lipase inhibitor greatly increased the number of cells responding to agonist stimulation at low doses.

Stimulation of a wide variety of cells by hormones, neurotransmitters, or growth factors leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified essential medium; SAG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP3, 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol-[3,4-d]pyrimidine. and triggers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ signaling via activation of IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (1Berridge M.J.

Proper regulation of receptor-IP3/Ca2+ signaling is very important, because the IP3-induced Ca2+ release underlying a variety of spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics has been shown to considerably affect various cellular functions such as smooth muscle contraction, fertilization, immune response, gene expression, synaptic plasticity, development, and so on (3Berridge M.J.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the versatility of IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling include (i) a plasma membrane receptor-PLC system that generates the second messenger IP3 (5Hollinger S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These molecular mechanisms interact with each other, and thus, they all affect each other. For example, intracellular Ca2+ released from Ca2+ stores has a positive feedback effect on PLC activity (15Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 16Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R157-R159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IP3R activity is positively or negatively regulated by Ca2+ depending on the intracellular Ca2+ level (17Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ entry machinery is regulated by store depletion, conformational changes of IP3Rs, or direct binding of phospholipids and DAG (14Venkatachalam K. Van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous regulatory mechanisms of these signaling molecules and their interactions allow cells to establish precise and complex Ca2+ patterns that contribute to various physiological phenomena. In this paper, we report a novel regulatory mechanism involved in receptor-IP3-Ca2+ signaling, i.e. DAG-mediated positive feedback stimulation of PLC. We unexpectedly found that 1-oleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a membrane-permeable derivative of DAG, induces Ca2+ oscillation in COS-7 cells independently of PKC activity and extracellular Ca2+. The OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was also observed in HeLa cells, CHO-K1 cells, and astrocytes, suggesting that the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation is a general phenomenon in various types of cells. The OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was dependent on Ca2+ release through IP3Rs, because 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) (18Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), an IP3R inhibitor, or depletion of Ca2+ stores with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) abolished the Ca2+ mobilization. In addition, we found that treatment of COS-7 cells with a PLC inhibitor or expression of the IP3-absorbent protein “IP3-sponge” completely abolished the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation, indicating that OAG stimulates IP3 production via PLC activation. We also discovered that accumulation of endogenous DAG as a result of exposure to a DAG-lipase inhibitor increases the sensitivity of the Ca2+ response in COS-7 cells to low-dose ATP stimulation. These findings suggested that DAG produced via the receptor-PLC signaling cascade leads to further PLC activation, resulting in the increased IP3 production and amplification of receptor-Ca2+ signaling. We propose that, in addition to the well known positive feedback effect of Ca2+ on PLC activity, this novel signal cross-talk between DAG and PLC activity may be a crucial mechanism regulating the amount of IP3, which is an important factor in determining the threshold of Ca2+ signaling generation and Ca2+ dynamics in response to agonist stimulation, and that it may play an important role in physiological phenomena that are dependent on IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Culture—COS-7 cells, CHO-K1, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Nakarai). Astrocytes were prepared from the cerebral cortex of postnatal 1 day mice or postnatal 1 day Wistar rats using the standard method (19Miller S. Romano C. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6103-6109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following trypsin treatment, cortices were dissociated by trituration and cultured in 75-mm2 flask with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The confluent cells then were treated with trypsin after overnight shaking (280 rpm) and replated on 3.5 cm of poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottom dishes (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) at a density of 1 × 104/dish. After 4–5 days from the replating, Ca2+ imaging was performed. We confirmed that the cultured cells were astrocytes by immunostaining with mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (Sigma) (data not shown). Pharmacological Reagents—The following reagents were used in study: 1-oleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) (Calbiochem, Nakarai Tesque, and Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). To neglect the possible effect caused by contaminated substances, we used OAG purchased from the three companies and confirmed their same effect on Ca2+ mobilization: PP3 and PP2 (Calbiochem); 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (SAG) (Sigma); U73122 and U73343 (Calbiochem); RHC80267 (Calbiochem); 2-APB; staurosporine (Calbiochem); phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Calbiochem); CPA (Calbiochem); inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan); and ATP. GFP and IP3-Sponge Transfection—COS-7 cells plated on the 3.5-cm poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom dish (Matsunami) were transfected with totally 1.0 μg of plasmids encoding GFP (pcDNA-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA)) and IP3-sponge (pcDNA-IP3-sponge). The G224 fragment encoding IP3-sponge (20Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was cloned into pcDNA3 (Clontech) (molar ratio 1:2) by lipid method using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, the cells were used for Ca2+ imaging. Intracellular Ca2+Imaging—Cells plated on the 3.5-cm poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom dish (Matsunami) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Dojindo) for 30 min at room temperature in the loading solution (in mm): 115 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 2 mm CaCl2; 20 Hepes; and 10 glucose, pH 7.42. Fura-2 fluorescence images were analyzed using an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a video image analysis system (Argus-50/CA, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) with excitation filters at 340 ± 10 and 380 ± 10 nm, a dichroic beam splitter at 400 nm, and a bandpass emission filter at 510–550 nm. The recording solution contains (in mm): 115 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 20 Hepes; and 10 glucose, pH 7.42 (unless mentioned otherwise). Solutions containing phospholipids (OAG and SAG) were used after brief sonication. Ca2+Release from Cerebellar Microsomes—Mice cerebellar microsome fractions were prepared as described previously (17Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). IP3-induced Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes was measured with Fura-2 and a fluorospectrometer, CAF110 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane fractions were suspended at a concentration of 200 μg/ml protein in the buffer containing 1 μg/ml oligomycin (Sigma), 2 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), 10 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), and 2 μm Fura-2 (Dojindo) After loading Ca2+ into microsomes by activating Ca2+-ATPase using 1 mm ATP (Sigma), Fura-2 was alternately excited with 340 and 380 nm and the fluorescence changes at 510 ± 10 nm were detected in response to 100 μm OAG and 100 μm IP3 application. At the end of each set of experiments, maximum and minimum values of Fura-2 fluorescence were obtained in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm EGTA, respectively (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). DAG Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells at 70% confluency in 60-mm culture plastic dishes were treated with 50 μm RHC80267 or 0.1% Me2SO (control) for 10 min in the recording buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+ and then stimulated with 0.3 μm ATP for 3 min. Immediately after removal of the buffer, cells were fixed with 1 ml of methanol, scraped, and transferred to a 15-ml plastic tube. The dish was rinsed once with another 1 ml of methanol, which then was added to the previously collected ethanol, and the quantification of DAG level was performed using this solution. DAG kinase assay was performed as reported previously (22Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After separating DAG using thin-layer chromatography, the thin-layer chromatography plate was subjected to autoradiography and the optical density of radioactive spot corresponding to DAG was quantified using a custom-made software for image analysis (TI-workbench). A DAG Derivative, OAG, Induces Ca2+Oscillation in Various Types of Cells—To explore a novel biological function of DAG in intracellular signaling, we measured Ca2+ signals following the application of a membrane-permeable DAG derivative, OAG, to COS-7 cells. Interestingly, we found that, in the nominal absence of external Ca2+, OAG application (100 μm) to COS-7 cells induces Ca2+ oscillation with a short latency of 1–5 min (Fig. 1A; also see Supplemental Video 1). The frequency of Ca2+ oscillation varies from cell to cell. Although the nominal Ca2+-free solution (EGTA-free) actually contains very low concentration of Ca2+ (∼1.0 μm), the Ca2+ mobilization following OAG application could not have been due to Ca2+ influx through cell surface Ca2+-permeable channels such as TRPC channels as previously reported (24Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 25Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 26Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) because we also detected the OAG-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the extracellular solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA (Fig. 1B). The application of a membrane-impermeable DAG derivative, SAG (100 μm), failed to induce Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 1C). The effect of OAG was dose-dependent. As shown in Fig. 1D, hardly any Ca2+ mobilization was detectable when 10 μm OAG was applied. The OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was first observed at 30 μm OAG, and the frequency of Ca2+ oscillation gradually increased as the OAG concentration was increased to 30, 100, and 300 μm (Fig. 1D). The time lag between OAG application and the onset of the Ca2+ response also tended to become shorter as the OAG concentration was increased. The corresponding concentrations of the vehicle, Me2SO, did not induce any Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown). These results were unexpected, because several previous studies have reported detecting no Ca2+ mobilization upon OAG application under extracellular-Ca2+-free conditions (26Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Grimaldi M. Maratos M. Verma A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4737-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we detected similar Ca2+ oscillations after exposure to OAG purchased from three different companies (see “Experimental Procedures”), the OAG-induced Ca2+ response is unlikely to have been an artifact. To determine whether OAG would induce Ca2+ oscillation in other types of cells, we applied OAG to CHO-K1 cells, HeLa cells, and rat primary astrocytes and examined them for a Ca2+ response. As shown in Fig. 2, in the nominal absence of external Ca2+, we observed OAG-induced Ca2+ mobilization in these cells, the same as in COS-7 cells, suggesting that the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation is a general phenomenon rather than specific to COS-7 cells. Ca2+Release through IP3Rs Underlies OAG-induced Ca2+ Oscillation—We next evaluated the contribution of Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores to the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation in COS-7 cells. When the Ca2+ store had been depleted with a Ca2+ pump inhibitor, CPA (10 μm), before OAG application, OAG no longer induced Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the application of 2-APB, an inhibitor of IP3Rs, completely abolished the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was caused by Ca2+ release through IP3Rs. To determine whether OAG activates IP3Rs directly, we next performed an in vitro Ca2+ release assay using mice cerebellar microsomes. As shown in Fig. 3C, no Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes was detected in response to 100 μm OAG or the solvent, Me2SO, whereas the application of IP3 (100 μm) to cerebellar microsomes induced transient Ca2+ release. In addition, OAG did not enhance the amount of Ca2+ release induced by IP3 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation is likely to be mediated by IP3 production rather than by direct activation of IP3Rs. To confirm the possible involvement of IP3 production in the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation, we exposed the cells to a PLC inhibitor, U73122, prior to OAG application. As shown in Fig. 4, 10 μm U73122 completely abolished the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4Aa), whereas the biologically inactive analog U73343 (10 μm) had no inhibitory effect (Fig. 4Ab). Furthermore, when we transiently co-expressed IP3 absorbent protein IP3-sponge (20Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and GFP in COS-7 cells before OAG application, no Ca2+ oscillation was detected in GFP-positive IP3-sponge-expressing COS-7 cells, whereas control cells that did not express IP3-sponge (GFP-negative cells) showed Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 4B). Expression of GFP alone did not affect the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation (data not shown). Thus, these results strongly suggested that OAG and thus also DAG are capable of inducing production of IP3 via PLC activation, which initiates Ca2+ release through IP3Rs. Analysis of the Molecular Mechanism of the OAG-induced Ca2+Oscillation—To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms linking DAG to PLC activation, we analyzed the involvement of PKC activity in the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation. As shown in Fig. 5, the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation occurred independently of PKC activation, because acute application of PMA, a potent activator of PKC (1.0 μm), to COS-7 cells did not induce any Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 5A) and pretreatment of cells with a broad serine-threonine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (100 nm), did not abolish the Ca2+ mobilization following OAG application (Fig. 5B). Next, because cellular DAG is mainly metabolized by DAG lipase, we treated COS-7 cells with the DAG-lipase inhibitor RHC80267 (25 μm) before OAG application. As shown in Fig. 5C, RHC80267 did not affect the OAG-induced oscillation, indicating that it was not caused by metabolites of OAG. Interestingly, we found that a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, completely abolished the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation, whereas the inactive PP2 analog PP3 used as a control failed to abolish the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 5D). Endogenous DAG Modifies the Ca2+Response to ATP Stimulation in COS-7 Cells—Finally, we tried evaluating the contribution to the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in COS-7 cells of DAG endogenously produced in response to ATP stimulation. We hypothesized that if metabolization of endogenously produced DAG was inhibited by DAG-lipase inhibitor, accumulated DAG would cause further production of IP3, resulting in the change in Ca2+ mobilization in response to agonist stimulation. The use of the DAG-lipase inhibitor, RHC80267, has been a common method to examine the effect of endogenous DAG on several physiological phenomena (24Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 29Andoh T. Itoh H. Higashi T. Saito Y. Ishiwa D. Kamiya Y. Yamada Y. Brain Res. 2004; 1013: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and we could detect the increased endogenous DAG level by RHC80267 treatment upon ATP stimulation using DAG kinase assay (Supplemental Fig. 1). To rule out the possible effect of DAG-dependent PKC activity on Ca2+ mobilization, we pretreated COS-7 cells with 300 nm PMA for 36 h to down-regulate PKC activity (30Matthies H.J. Palfrey H.C. Hirning L.D. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and imaged Ca2+ signals evoked by application of various concentrations of ATP (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 μm)inthe presence and absence of DAG-lipase inhibitor RHC80267 (50 μm). As shown in Fig. 6, the results showed that, whereas none of the control cells released Ca2+ in response to 0.05 μm ATP stimulation (0%), a small population of RHC80267-treated cells did release Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores in response to 0.05 μm ATP stimulation (0.54 ± 0.59%, mean ± S.D.). In addition, the numbers of RHC80267-treated cells that responded to 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 μm ATP stimulation were statistically higher than the numbers of control cells (0.1 μm ATP: control 0.15 ± 0.39%; RHC80267 4.51 ± 4.72%, 0.3 μm ATP: control 19.35 ± 14.23%; RHC80267 44.34 ± 15.39%, 0.5 μm ATP: control 58.84 ± 12.47%; RHC80267 70.59 ± 10.79%, mean ± S.D.). Although RHC80267-treated cells tended to have larger Ca2+ peak amplitudes than the control cells, there was no statistically significant difference in peak Ca2+ amplitudes between the RHC80267-treated cells and the control cells. When stimulated with a higher dose of ATP (3.0 μm), almost all of the control and RHC80267-treated cells released Ca2+ and there were no differences between them in the percentage of cells that responded or the amplitudes of the Ca2+ release (data not shown). Thus, these results suggested that a higher level of DAG endogenously produced in response to ATP stimulation could cause further IP3 production via PLC activation, resulting in the enhanced Ca2+ mobilization from Ca2+ stores through IP3Rs in response to low-dose agonist stimulation. DAG is well known as a potent PKC activator; however, other physiological actions of DAG have recently been reported including activation of RasGRP (31Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and some TRPC channels (24Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 25Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and inhibition of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (32Gordon S.E. Downing-Park J. Tam B. Zimmerman A.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 409-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Crary J.I. Dean D.M. Nguitragool W. Kurshan P.T. Zimmerman A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We propose a new biological function of DAG, i.e. DAG-induced IP3 production via PLC activation. The results of the present study demonstrated that a DAG derivative, OAG, induces Ca2+ oscillation in various types of cells, and based on the following findings, we concluded that the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was attributable to IP3-mediated Ca2+ release through IP3Rs as follows: 1) the independence of extracellular Ca2+; 2) abolition of the oscillation by store depletion; 3) blockade by IP3-mediated signaling inhibitors, 2-APB and IP3-sponge; and 4) blockade by PLC inhibition. These findings indicate the existence of a positive feedback effect of DAG on PLC activity, and consistent with this finding, we have demonstrated that the DAG-mediated positive feedback signaling to PLC contributes to the amplification of agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling, suggesting a physiological significance of the feedback mechanism. The amount of IP3 produced by OAG could be inferred from the pattern of Ca2+ signaling, because the pattern is generally dependent on the concentration of the agonists applied to cells. In many types of cells, application of low concentrations of agonists, which result in the production of small amounts of IP3, induces a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ lasting only a few seconds (Ca2+ spike) or repetitive Ca2+ spikes (Ca2+ oscillation), whereas high concentrations of agonists induce sustained Ca2+ elevation throughout the period of agonist application. Because at the highest concentration we tested (300 μm) OAG induced only an oscillatory and not a sustained Ca2+ elevation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1D), the amount of IP3 produced by DAG-mediated signaling must have been relatively small. This conclusion is supported by the observation that even a relatively low level of expression of IP3-sponge completely abolished the OAG-induced oscillation (Fig. 4B), because suppression of Ca2+ mobilization by IP3-sponge has been shown to be dependent on both its expression level and the dose of the agonist (20Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, even the small amount of IP3 derived from the DAG-mediated signaling would be highly effective in shaping IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling when agonist stimulation is weak. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated that accumulation of intracellular DAG with an DAG-lipase inhibitor greatly increased the number of cells that responded to low doses (0.05 and 0.1 μm) of ATP (Fig. 5). Therefore, we concluded that DAG-induced IP3 production is an important molecular mechanism in the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling in addition to numerous other molecular mechanisms (e.g. modification of IP3R activity by several proteins and modification of signaling from surface receptors to PLC). Grimaldi et al. (28Grimaldi M. Maratos M. Verma A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4737-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported the finding that OAG application to glial cells induced slow Ca2+ oscillation that was dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. They showed that the OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation was caused by Ca2+ entry through TRPC3 channels and that Ca2+ release from internal stores was not involved in the Ca2+ oscillation. In the presence of external Ca2+, we observed similar slow Ca2+ oscillations in glial cells that were less frequent than in the absence of external Ca2+ (data not shown); however, the percentage of the glial cells exhibiting low-frequency Ca2+ oscillation in response to OAG in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ was even smaller than reported by Grimaldi et al. (28Grimaldi M. Maratos M. Verma A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4737-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, they did not detect the OAG-induced Ca2+ mobilization observed in the present study in the absence of external Ca2+. Although we do not know the exact reasons for these discrepancies, differences among groups in cell culture protocols and conditions and thus in stages of the differentiation of the glial cells may have been responsible. Although we found that DAG stimulates PLC activity, it was previously shown that PKC, which is activated by DAG, inhibits PLC activity via phosphorylation of PLC (34Yue C. Ku C.Y. Liu M. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These two effects of DAG on PLC activity seem inconsistent. Because PKC phosphorylates and inhibits only the PLCβ isoform (34Yue C. Ku C.Y. Liu M. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), DAG may stimulate other isoforms of PLC and enhance IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Alternatively, the above two actions of DAG may affect different phases of the Ca2+ signaling induced by IP3-mobilizing agonists. Because PKC activation requires cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, PLC activity by PKC-mediated phosphorylation may become suppressed after cytosolic Ca2+ is sufficiently increased and the suppression may therefore facilitate the termination of individual Ca2+ spikes and waves. By contrast, DAG together with the Ca2+ released from Ca2+ stores may stimulate PLC activity earlier than the PKC-mediated suppression and contribute to the formation of the rising phases of Ca2+ signaling. Complex DAG actions and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration changes may underlie the spatio-temporally organized Ca2+ dynamics induced by IP3-mobilizing agonists. The molecular mechanisms by which DAG activates PLC remain to be determined. First, what is the molecular target of DAG? Blockade of OAG-induced Ca2+ oscillation by PP2 implies involvement of Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). However, because we were unable to detect any significant effect of DAG on Src (one of the Src family PTKs) activity in vitro (data not shown), Src is unlikely to be a direct target of DAG in the DAG-mediated PLC activation pathway. Thus, DAG may directly activate other DAG-binding proteins that lead to Src family PTK activation. Second, what type of PLC is activated by DAG? At least 12 mammalian PLC isoforms have been identified to date. They are PLCβ1–4, PLCγ1–2, PLCδ1–4, PLCϵ, and PLCζ (35Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 36Fukami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and one of them, PLCϵ, has recently been reported to be activated by Ras (37Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that the activity of RasGRP, the regulator of Ras, is increased by DAG (31Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), PLCϵ may be one of the candidates for the molecule responsible for the DAG-induced IP3 production. However, since our data suggested possible involvement of Src family PTK activity in the DAG-mediated PLC activation, how Src family PTK activity is involved in the signaling is unknown. Another candidate is PLCγ, because PLCγ can be activated by Src family PTK-mediated phosphorylation (38Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 39Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C. Ashby B. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because Src family PTKs are also involved in the activation of receptor-PLC signaling through G-protein tyrosine phosphorylation (41Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of such signaling proteins by Src family PTKs may underlie the molecular mechanism of the DAG-induced PLC activation. In conclusion, we propose a novel biological function of DAG as an inducer of IP3 production through PLC activation. The novel signal cross-talk between DAG and the IP3-mediated signal pathway amplifies agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling in response to weak extracellular stimuli. Because IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release plays an important role in various physiological functions including synaptic plasticity, gene expression, proliferation, and development, the increased IP3 production via DAG-mediated signaling may affect numerous biological phenomena.

https://openalex.org/W2019375881,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) is an essential endoribonuclease that consists of one RNA component and at least nine protein components. Characterization of the complex is complicated by the fact that eight of the known protein components are shared with a related endoribonuclease, RNase P. To fully characterize the RNase MRP complex, we purified it to apparent homogeneity in a highly active state using tandem affinity purification. In addition to the nine known protein components, both Rpr2 and a protein encoded by the essential gene YLR145w were present in our preparations of RNase MRP. Precipitation of a tagged version of Ylr145w brought with it the RNase MRP RNA, but not the RNase P RNA. A temperature-sensitive ylr145w mutant was generated and found to exhibit a rRNA processing defect identical to that seen in other RNase MRP mutants, whereas no defect in tRNA processing was observed. Homologues of the Ylr145w protein were found in most yeasts, fungi, and Arabidopsis. Based on this evidence, we propose that YLR145w encodes a novel protein component of RNase MRP, but not RNase P. We recommend that this gene be designated RMP1, for RNase MRP protein 1.

RNase MRP 1The abbreviations used are: MRP, mitochondrial RNA processing; UTR, untranslated region; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TAP, tandem affinity purification; IgG-POD, peroxidase-conjugated antibody. is a highly conserved and essential ribonucleoprotein endoribonuclease that cleaves substrates in at least two intracellular compartments. Most RNase MRP is localized to the nucleolus (1Reimer G. Raska I. Scheer U. Tan E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 176: 117-128Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), where a role in processing of rRNA precursors has been identified (2Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7935-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). RNase MRP-mediated cleavage at the A3 site of pre-rRNA ultimately leads to the generation of 5.8S(S) rRNA (3Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Kearsey S. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2452-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Chu S. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A fraction of RNase MRP RNA finds its way to the mitochondrion (6Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. Science. 1987; 235: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 7Topper J.N. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 16-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial RNase MRP processes RNA transcripts, which serve as primers for the leading strand of mitochondrial DNA replication (8Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30614-30621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recent data also support a role for RNase MRP mRNA degradation, whereby cleavage of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of CLB2 mRNA, which encodes a B-type cyclin, leads to its rapid degradation and aids cell cycle progression (10Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all the known components of RNase MRP are essential for viability. To date, a single RNA component and at least nine protein components of nuclear RNase MRP have been identified. The subunit composition of RNase MRP closely resembles that of a related ribonucleoprotein endoribonuclease, RNase P, which processes tRNA precursors to generate mature 5′ termini. Eight of the proteins associated with RNase MRP (Pop1, Pop3, Pop4, Pop5, Pop6, Pop7, Pop8, and Rpp1) are also components of RNase P (11Lygerou Z. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Séraphin B. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Dichtl B. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Stolc V. Altman S.

An RNA-binding protein, encoded by the gene SNM1, is the only known protein component that associates with RNase MRP RNA but not RNase P RNA (15Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rpr2p has been identified as a unique protein component of the RNase P complex (14Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The similarities between RNase MRP and RNase P extend beyond that of shared protein components. The RNA subunits of RNase MRP and RNase P are evolutionarily and structurally related (16Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Schmitt M.E. Bennett J.L. Dairaghi D.J. Clayton D.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). They share only weak sequence homology, but they fold into similar cage-like secondary structures (16Forster A.C. Altman S. Science. 1990; 249: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition to subunit composition, both RNase MRP and RNase P localize to the nucleolus and the mitochondria and have been shown to cleave common substrates (14Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18Chamberlain J.R. Pagan-Ramos E. Kindelberger D.W. Engelke D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3158-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite their similarities, RNase MRP and RNase P appear to assemble into separate catalytic complexes. Nuclear RNase P, purified to homogeneity by high-resolution anion exchange chromatography, retains tRNA processing activity independently of RNase MRP (5Lygerou Z. Allmang C. Tollervey D. Séraphin B. Science. 1996; 272: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this study, we outline a method for purifying nuclear RNase MRP in S. cerevisiae to apparent homogeneity using a tandem affinity purification system (19Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Characterization of the purified complex confirms that the MRP RNA and nine previously identified proteins are components of the RNase MRP complex. In addition, we found the protein encoded by the essential gene YLR145w and the gene RPR2 in preparations of purified and active RNase MRP. We demonstrate that the Ylr145w protein is indeed a protein component of RNase MRP essential for its activity but is not a component of RNase P. This will be the second unique protein component of RNase MRP. We recommend the new name for this gene be designated RMP1, for RNase MRP protein 1. Strains and Media—Yeast media and genetic manipulations have been described previously (10Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Cai T. Reilly T.R. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7857-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain used for cloning, DH5α, has the genotype φ80dlacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17 (rk−mk+) supE44 thi-1 λ-gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacIZYA-argF)U169 F-. Basic molecular techniques were performed as described previously (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To purify RNase MRP, the YSW1 strain, which has the genotype MATa POP4::TAPTAG::TRP1ks pep4:LEU2 nuc1::LEU2 sep1::URA3 trp-1his3–11,15 can-100 ura3–1 leu2–3,112, was used (10Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This strain was constructed by using PCR to amplify the TAP fusion cassette from pBS1479 (a gift from Bertrand Séraphin) and then using PCR-based genomic TAP tagging to integrate the tag into the carboxyl-terminal codon of the POP4 gene (19Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). LSY389–34A, which has the genotype MATa sep 1::URA3 pep4::LEU2 nuc1::LEU2 ade2–1 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100 ura3–1 leu2–3,112, was used as the wild-type control strain in PCR, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation analysis. The heterozygous YLR145w yeast knock-out strain KLS115 (MATa/∝ his3-Δ1/his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0/leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0/ura3-Δ0 met15-Δ0/MET15 LYS2/lys2-Δ0 YLR145w/YLR145w::KanMX4) and the TAP-tagged YLR145w strain KLS116 (MATa YLR145w::TAPTAG::HIS3 his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) unless noted yeast were grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose). Whole-cell Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell yeast protein extracts were prepared as described previously (20Cai T. Reilly T.R. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7857-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were denatured in 2% (w/v) SDS and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a BA-S NC-supported nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH) by use of a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer cell. The membrane was stained for 4 min with Ponceau S solution (0.1% Ponceau S, 5% acetic acid) and washed with double distilled H2O to ensure proper transfer. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) milk-TBST (20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 24 °C, incubated with primary antibody for 2 h, and washed with TBST three times for 10 min each. The washed blot was then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (IgG-POD) for 1 h and washed with TBST four times for 15 min each. The IgG-POD was detected with a Roche Applied Science chemiluminescence Western blotting kit and exposed to film for 30 min and then exposed to film again overnight. Goat anti-protein A antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution (Roche Applied Science). Precipitation of TAP-tagged Protein—Forty μl of rabbit IgG agarose (Sigma), which was equilibrated in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), was incubated with 40 μl of whole-cell yeast extract on ice for 1 h. The samples were washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A. The volume of each sample was brought up to 100 μl with buffer A. The samples were made 2% (w/v) SDS and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After the beads were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform equilibrated to pH 5.3, precipitated with ethanol, and examined by Northern analysis. Purification of Nuclear RNase MRP Using Tandem Affinity Purification—RNase MRP was purified from strain YSW1 as described in detail previously (10Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several individual preparations were pooled for further analysis. Western Blot Analysis of RNase MRP Protein Components—For each antibody tested, 2 μg of purified nuclear RNase MRP was denatured as described above, resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a BA-S NC-supported nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.). Each membrane was blocked in 5% (w/v) milk-phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2PO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4) and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature; incubated with a primary antibody for 2 h; washed with 5% (w/v) milk-phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EDTA for one quick wash and three 10-min washes; blotted with an anti-rabbit IgG-POD (1:1000 dilution; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h; and washed with 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% SDS for one quick wash followed by four washes for 15 min each. The anti-rabbit IgG-POD was detected with a Roche Applied Science chemiluminescence Western blotting kit and exposed to film for 10 s, 30 s, and 5 min. The following primary rabbit antibodies were used: anti-Snm1 (1:2500; Ref. 15Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); anti-Pop1 (1:1000; Ref. 22.Cai, T. (2000) Cell Cycle Regulation by an Endoribonuclease. Ph.D. thesis, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse NYGoogle Scholar); anti-Pop3 (1:500; Ref. 22.Cai, T. (2000) Cell Cycle Regulation by an Endoribonuclease.

Ph.D. thesis, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse NYGoogle Scholar). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Purified Nuclear RNase MRP—Three hundred μg of purified RNase MRP was run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad). Individual protein components were excised from the gel using a fresh razor blade. Each gel slice was cut into 1 × 1-mm cubes and placed in a 0.65-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tube (PGC Scientific, Frederick, MD) The gel pieces were washed with double distilled H2O and then destained twice at 37 °C with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile and dried under vacuum. The gel pieces were then reduced at 56 °C for 30 min in 10 mm dithiothreitol/100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The pieces were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and then alkylated by 55 mm iodoacetamide/100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. After washing with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, the gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile and dried under vacuum. The pieces were re-swollen in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) at a final concentration of 12.5 ng/ml and placed on ice for 1 h. Excess buffer was removed, and then the gel pieces were resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The gel pieces were digested overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were mixed vigorously for 10 min and extracted from the gel pieces with double distilled H2O. The digested products were extracted twice for 1 h with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/5% (v/v) formic acid. The extracts were pooled together, spun at 16,000 × g for 5 min to remove contaminating gel pieces, and then dried under a vacuum. Each sample was resuspended in 8 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and passed through a C18 microzip tip (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry data were collected at the Proteomics Core Facility at State University of New York Upstate Medical University using a TOF Spec 2E mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Beverly, MA.) All samples were analyzed under identical parameters in reflectron mode. The protein mass spectra generated were analyzed using Pro Found (http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/profound_bin/WebProFound.exe). PCR Mutagenesis of YLR145w—Plasmid pKLS108 (URA3 CEN YLR145w) was used as a template for PCR mutagenesis (23Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 2: 79-82Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides YLR145wFOR (5′-GTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTCACCTGCCACCCTATTTTC-3′) and YLR145wREV (5′-CCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTACTTGGGCAGACAAGGTC-3′) were used to amplify a 1.1-kb gene product that contained the YLR145w gene. Error-prone Deep Vent (exo-) polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used to increase the mutation rate. The plasmid YCplac111 (LEU2 CEN) contains unique HindIII and BamHI restriction sites that were used to remove a 30-bp region surrounding the multiple cloning site (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Purified mutagenized YLR145w PCR product and the gapped YCplac111 plasmid were co-transformed into the haploid strain KLS111 (MATα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 ylr145w::KanMX4 pKLS108 [URA3 CEN YLR145w]) to achieve in vivo gap repair of YCplac111. Leu+ transformants were transferred to plates containing 0.2% (w/v) 5-fluoroorotic acid (25Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Transformants were passed a second time on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium to ensure that the URA3-containing plasmid was lost. Mutants that exhibited a temperature-conditional growth phenotype were selected for further analysis. The YCplac111 plasmid was recovered from the mutant yeast strain via transformation of E. coli with yeast cell lysates (20Cai T. Reilly T.R. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7857-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated plasmid was re-transformed into KLS111 to ensure that the mutations were linked to the plasmid. The entire YLR145w gene was sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers to identify mutations. Analysis of Yeast RNA—Analysis of yeast RNA by Northern analysis was performed as described previously (26Cai T. Aulds J. Gill T. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Probes used for Northern analysis were RNase MRP RNA (1,088-bp EcoRI fragment of pMES140 (LEU2 CEN NME1) encompassing the NME1 gene (28Shadel G.S. Buckenmeyer G.A. Clayton D.A. Schmitt M.E. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), RNase P RNA (450-bp fragment stretching from -22 to +428 of the RPR1 gene), and tRNAArg (178-bp fragment from -71 to +107 of the tR(ACG)L gene). Probes were radiolabeled for hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Radioactive blots were analyzed on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The RNase MRP Complex Was Purified using TAP-tagged Pop4—Purification of RNase MRP has been recalcitrant to standard techniques due to sensitivity of the RNA component of the enzyme to contaminating RNases and to low yields. Previous research aimed at characterization of the complex has relied upon fractionation techniques to purify RNase MRP-containing extracts or mutational and/or genetic analyses of known RNA or protein components (2Schmitt M.E.

Buckenmeyer G.A. Clayton D.A. Schmitt M.E. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have generated a yeast strain (YSW1) with a modified POP4 locus from which RNase MRP can be purified to homogeneity. To alleviate problems associated with nuclease digestion, the strain contains deletions in two of the major cellular nucleases, NUC1 and XRN1 (29Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 6: 3125-3134Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To simplify the purification and to optimize yields, we utilized a TAP methodology (19Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The cassette consists of a calmodulin-binding domain, a TEV protease cleavage site, the IGG-binding domain of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, and a yeast TRP1 marker. This cassette was integrated into the carboxyl-terminal codon of the POP4 gene at its chromosomal locus (Fig. 1A). PCR amplification of the POP4 gene in the resulting YSW1 strain was done to confirm proper integration of the TAP cassette (Fig. 1B). YSW1 grew at rates comparable to wild type at all temperatures tested and maintained normal rRNA processing. The modified Pop4 was examined in whole-cell extracts to ensure that it was not rapidly degraded with addition of the tag or that the tag was being rapidly removed (Fig. 1C). In the YSW1 strain, a 54.3-kDa band is clearly visible, which corresponds to the expected size of the Pop4-TAP tag fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation of the Pop4 tag using rabbit IgG was also performed to confirm association of the modified Pop4 with the MRP RNA. As shown in the Northern analysis of the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1D), the wild-type control strain does not precipitate MRP RNA. However, the TAP fusion strain precipitated MRP RNA, indicating that the TAP tag effectively isolates RNA molecules associated with Pop4. After confirming that the modified Pop4 protein was functioning comparable to the wild-type protein, we were able to purify the nuclear RNase MRP complex using tandem affinity purification. Because the Pop4 protein is also a component of the RNase P complex, we modified the standard purification procedure to maximize yields of RNase MRP while minimizing co-purification of RNase P. This was accomplished mainly by breaking and extracting cells in a low to moderate salt concentration. RNase MRP was readily released under these conditions, whereas a majority of the RNase P was retained in the cells. In addition, the RNase P complex was found to bind poorly to the calmodulin beads in the final stage of the purification. Samples were collected throughout the purification process, and both total RNA and protein were analyzed (Fig. 2). In the protein A elution, small amounts of the RNase P RNA were detected; however, this RNA was <1% of the total RNA after the final calmodulin step, as measured by fluorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained RNA. The final elution from the calmodulin beads resulted in a single band consistent in size with NME1, the 340-nucleotide component of RNase MRP (Fig. 2A). The identity of this band was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 2B). Indeed, very little breakdown product of the MRP RNA was detected, indicating the complex is whole. The enzyme complex was found to be highly active on both the rRNA A3 substrate and CLB2-5′-UTR substrate, indicating that all of the components required for RNase MRP function are present (10Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The complex was analyzed on a 15–30% glycerol gradient (37Cai T. Schmitt M.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to ensure it was a single complex. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, a single peak was present that contained all of the RNase MRP proteins. Spreading of a trace amount of the Pop4 protein and the Rpp1 protein indicates that a very small amount of a partial complex of these two proteins may be co-purifying with the complex. This may represent an intermediate during RNase MRP and RNase P assembly or may simply be a break-down product. Negative staining electron microscopy of the purified complex indicated homogeneous size particles of between 25 and 30 nm across. 2M. E. Schmitt and D. R. Mitchell, unpublished observations. Identification of Purifying Proteins—Proteins isolated from many separate purifications were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Consistently, there were at least 9–10 protein bands that separated between ∼12 and 100 kDa, consistent with the size and number of proteins believed to be in the RNase MRP complex (Fig. 2). To identify which bands corresponded to known complex components, we took advantage of available antibodies. Western analyses were performed using antibodies for five of the established protein components of nuclear RNase MRP, namely, Snm1, Pop1, Pop3, Pop4, and Rpp1 (Fig. 3B). Proteins isolated from the final product of the TAP purification were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Each blot was incubated with an antibody corresponding to one of the individual protein components, probed with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence. In each case, the RNase MRP proteins were found in the final purified product, assisting in identifying the appropriate bands (Fig. 4). Antibodies against Pop1 identified a minor amount of breakdown product of this protein. These bands were absent in fresh preparations and increased in older preparations after several rounds of freezing and thawing. Antibodies to Snm1 also detected multiple bands near the same molecular mass. This is consistent with what is seen with these antibodies in whole-cell extracts (15Schmitt M.E. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The multiple forms may be the result of proteolytic digestion or secondary modifications. We looked expressly for potential phosphorylation of this protein, but none was detected (data not shown). Because antibodies are not available for all the known protein components of RNase MRP, we sought to identify the remaining components by mass spectrometry. Protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Table I). This identified with high confidence Pop1, Pop4 + tag, Rpp1, Snm1, Ylr145w, Pop3, Pop7, Pop5, Rpr2, Pop6, and Pop8 in the purified preparations of nuclear RNase MRP. All of these proteins were identified with a high degree of confidence in separate purifications. As a result, all the known protein components of RNase MRP, as well as Rpr2, a protein thought to be unique to the RNase P complex, were detected. Previous research suggested that RNase MRP contained only nine protein components. However, our analysis identified two additional proteins in the complex. Ylr145w is an essential gene that was recently identified in a genomic analysis as being part of the RNase P enzyme complex (30Hazbun T.R. Malmstrom L. Anderson S. Graczyk B. Fox B. Riffle M. Sundin B.A. Aranda J.D. McDonald W.H. Chiu C. Syndsman B.E. Bradley P. Muller E. Fields S. Baker D. Yates J.R. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 12: 1353-1365Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Rpr2p may also associate with RNase MRP.

Open table in a new tab Determination of the Stoichiometry of the RNase MRP Complex—In order to quantitate the relative amount of each of the proteins in the RNase MRP complex, we utilized the protein dye SPYRO Ruby. This fluorescent dye binds most proteins in a linear fashion independent of their amino acid composition. SDS-PAGE gels were stained with SPYRO Ruby and scanned using a Bio-Rad FluorS imager. Utilizing this approach we quantitated each of the identified bands relative to Pop1, which was given a value of 1. After imaging, the proteins were excised from gels, and their identity was confirmed using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. These data are summarized in Table I. Ylr145w Is a Component of RNase MRP, but Not RNase P—Our MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy data indicate that the protein encoded by the uncharacterized open reading frame YLR145w may be a component of nuclear RNase MRP.

Because of the functional differentiation, plant peroxisomes are subdivided into several classes, such as glyoxysomes and leaf peroxisomes. These peroxisomal functions are maintained by import of newly synthesized proteins containing one of two peroxisomal targeting signals known as PTS1 and PTS2. These targeting signals are known to be recognized by the cytosolic receptors, Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively. To demonstrate the contribution of Pex5p and Pex7p to the maintenance of peroxisomal functions in plants, double-stranded RNA constructs were introduced into the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of the PEX5 and PEX7 genes was efficiently reduced by the double-stranded RNA-mediated interference in the transgenic Arabidopsis. The Pex5p-deficient Arabidopsis showed reduced activities for both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions. An identical phenotype was observed in a transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing functionally defective Pex5p. In contrast, the Pex7p-deficient Arabidopsis showed reduced activity for glyoxysomal function but not for leaf peroxisomal function. Analyses of peroxisomal protein import in the transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that Pex5p was involved in import of both PTS1-containing proteins and PTS2-containing proteins, whereas Pex7p contributed to the import of only PTS2-containing proteins. Overall, the results indicated that Pex5p and Pex7p play different roles in the maintenance of glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions in plants.

Overall, the results indicated that Pex5p and Pex7p play different roles in the maintenance of glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions in plants. Peroxisomal enzymes are synthesized in the cytosol and function after their post-translational transport into peroxisomes. Most of the plant peroxisomal enzymes have been shown to contain one of two peroxisome targeting signals within their amino acid sequences (1Mullen R.T. Baker A. Graham I.A. Plant Peroxisomes.

One type of targeting signal, called PTS1 1The abbreviations used are: PTS1, peroxisome targeting signal 1; PTS2, peroxisome targeting signal 2; 2,4-DB, 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ti, tumor-inducing; Pa, pascal.1The abbreviations used are: PTS1, peroxisome targeting signal 1; PTS2, peroxisome targeting signal 2; 2,4-DB, 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ti, tumor-inducing; Pa, pascal. (peroxisome targeting signal), is a unique tripeptide sequence found in the carboxyl terminus of the proteins (3Trelease R.N. Lee M.S. Banjoko A. Bunkelmann J. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 156-167Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Hayashi M. Aoki M. Kato A. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1996; 10: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In higher plant cells, the permissible combinations of tripeptide sequence for PTS1 are (C/A/S/P)(K/R)(I/L/M) (5Hayashi M. Aoki M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another type of targeting signal, PTS2, is involved in a cleavable amino-terminal presequence (6Gietl C. Faber K.N. Vanderklei I.J. Veenhuis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal presequences contain a consensus sequence (A/L/Q/I)X5(H)(L/I/F) (where X indicates any amino acid) (7Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PTS2 is processed to form the mature protein after its transport into peroxisomes.Peroxisomes in higher plant cells have been shown to differentiate into at least three different classes, namely glyoxysomes, leaf peroxisomes, and unspecialized peroxisomes (9Beevers H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1979; 30: 159-193Crossref Google Scholar). Each organelle contains a unique set of enzymes that provides special functions in various organs in higher plants. Glyoxysomes are present in cells of storage organs, such as endosperms and cotyledons during post-germinative growth of oilseed plants, as well as in senescent organs (10Nishimura M. Hayashi M. Kato A. Yamaguchi K. Mano S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). They contain enzymes for fatty acid β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle and play a pivotal role in the conversion of seed-reserved lipid into sucrose. It has been suggested that fatty acids produced from the lipid are exclusively degraded in glyoxysomes (i.e. not in mitochondria) during germination and post-germinative growth in plants (11Beevers H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 243-251Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By contrast, leaf peroxisomes are widely found in cells of photosynthetic organs. It has been shown that some enzymes responsible for photorespiration are localized in leaf peroxisomes even though the entire photorespiratory process involves a combination of enzymatic reactions that occur in chloroplasts, leaf peroxisomes, and mitochondria (12Tolbert N.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 254-268Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We recently identified 256 candidates of peroxisomal genes encoding either PTS1-containing proteins or PTS2-containing proteins within the entire Arabidopsis genome (13Kamada T. Nito K. Hayashi H. Mano S. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of these, the functions of only 29 gene products have been identified. By using a custom-made microarray, we extensively examined the expression of all these genes in various organs. Statistical analyses of the expression profiles revealed that peroxisomal genes could be classified into five groups. From the results, we suggested that plant peroxisomes can be subdivided into at least five different classes, namely glyoxysomes, cotyledonary peroxisomes, leaf peroxisomes, root peroxisomes, and unspecialized peroxisomes. However, the mechanism to maintain the functional differentiation of plant peroxisomes is still unknown.Recent analyses of peroxisome-deficient mutants allowed the identification of over 25 PEX genes and their products, peroxins (14Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 75-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), from various organisms. Fifteen PEX gene orthologues exist in the Arabidopsis genome (15Mullen R.T. Flynn C.R. Trelease R.N. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 256-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis mutants with defective PEX2, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX14, and PEX16 were reported (16Hayashi M.

Of these, Pex14p is a peroxisomal membrane protein encoded by PED2 (Arabidopsis orthologue of PEX14) and is believed to contribute to both PTS1- and PTS2-dependent protein targeting pathways, because the Arabidopsis ped2 mutant had defects in intracellular transport of both PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins (16Hayashi M. Nito K. Toriyama-Kato K. Kondo M. Yamaya T. Nishimura M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pex5p (PEX5 product) and Pex7p (PEX7 product) function as cytosolic receptors for PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins, respectively (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Here we report on transgenic plants that had defects in Pex5p and Pex7p. Based upon the phenotypes of the transgenic plants, we show evidence that Pex5p and Pex7p contributed differently to the maintenance of the peroxisomal functions in plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was used as the wild-type plant. Construction of transgenic plants expressing GFP-PTS1 and PTS2-GFP and characterization of the ped2 mutant were described previously (16Hayashi M. Nito K. Toriyama-Kato K. Kondo M. Yamaya T. Nishimura M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Mano S. Nakamori C. Hayashi M. Kato A. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All seeds were surface-sterilized and grown on growth medium (2.3 mg/ml Murashige and Skoog salts (Wako, Osaka, Japan), 1% sucrose, 100 μg/ml myoinositol, 1 μg/ml thiamine-HCl, 0.5 μg/ml pyridoxine, 0.5 μg/ml nicotinic acid, 0.5 mg/ml MES-KOH, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar) with or without antibiotic(s). In some experiments, 0.2 μg/ml of 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid was added, or sucrose was removed from the growth medium. Seedlings were then transferred and grown on a 1:1 mixture of perlite and vermiculite under a 16-h-light (100 μE m–2 s–1)/8-h-dark light cycle at 22 °C in a normal atmosphere or in an atmosphere containing 1000 Pa CO2.Construction of Artificial Genes—Isolation of PEX5 and PEX7 cDNAs was reported previously (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For making the pex5i and pex7i constructs, the gene-specific sequences in the sense orientation were amplified by PCR to introduce SpeI and SacI sites at each end, whereas BamHI and XhoI sites were introduced into the same sequence of the antisense orientation. The sense and antisense DNA fragments were inserted between SpeI-SacI and XhoI-BamHI sites of pBluescript KS– (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively. A BamHI-BglII fragment encoding a bar gene from the pARK22 plasmid was also inserted at a BamHI site of the same plasmid as a linker. The XhoI-SacI DNA fragments were removed from the plasmids and ligated into the XhoI-SacI site of pBI121-Hm linker. The pBI121-Hm linker was constructed from a Ti vector, pBI121, by replacing the GUS gene with a linker sequence containing XbaI, XhoI, SmaI, SpeI, KpnI, and SacI sites. It also contained a hygromycin-resistant gene as a selectable marker in plants. To make the PEX5Δ7 construct, a DNA fragment encoding the Met1–Tyr657 region of Pex5p was amplified by PCR. It was inserted into a pDONR221 plasmid (Invitrogen) and then transferred into a Ti vector, pGWB2 (kindly gifted from Dr. Nakagawa), using BP and LR clonases according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen).Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation—Ti vectors carrying pex5i, pex7i, and PEX5Δ7 were independently introduced into kanamycin-resistant parental transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP-PTS1 and PTS2-GFP (24Mano S. Nakamori C. Hayashi M. Kato A. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by vacuum infiltration (25Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1RifR). Transformed Arabidopsis lines were selected on growth medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml hygromycin.Immunoblotting—Sample preparation and immunoblot analyses using antibodies against AtPex5p and AtPex7p were performed as previously reported (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Crude extract was prepared from leaves of the 3-week-old T1 plant. Ten μg of the total protein was used for immunoblotting.Measurements of Maximum Quantum Yield of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm)—To reduce the effect of photoinhibition, plants were grown for 4 weeks in an atmosphere containing 1000 Pa CO2 under low light (50 μE m–2 s–1). These plants were then illuminated with strong light (450 μE m–2 s–1) for 0 and 4 h in a normal atmosphere (36 Pa CO2). At the end of each illumination period, plants were kept for 30 min in the dark. The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was automatically calculated from the results of the modulated chlorophyll fluorescence emission from the upper surface of dark-adapted leaves that was measured using a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer; Mini-PAM (H. Walz, Effeltrich, Germany).Detection of Fluorescence Derived from GFP-PTS1 and PTS2-GFP— For analyzing root cells, T1 plants, grown 10 days on growth medium, were mounted under a coverslip. For analyzing leaf cells, leaves removed from the 3-week-old plants were mounted under a coverslip. Fluorescent images of the specimens were captured using an LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with an argon laser and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (emission 500–550 nm) (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Yeast Two-hybrid Analyses—Yeast two-hybrid analyses of PEX5Δ7 were performed according to protocols reported previously (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding PEX5Δ7 in a pDONR plasmid was transferred into a pGAD-GW plasmid. The yeast two-hybrid vector, pGAD-GW, was constructed from pGAD-C1 (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the multicloning site with a gateway conversion cassette (Invitrogen). Construction of other vectors used in this study have been described elsewhere (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transformants were tested for growth on synthetic medium containing 50 mm 3-aminotriazole without histidine and were assayed for quantitative β-galactosidase activity.RESULTSGeneration of Transgenic Plants That Have a Defect in Pex5p or Pex7p—Double-stranded RNA interference was used to induce post-transcriptional gene silencing of PEX5 and PEX7.To induce double-stranded RNA interference in Arabidopsis, we constructed two artificial genes, pex5i and pex7i, that encode RNAs capable of double strand formation at gene-specific sequences. Transformation and selection were performed by a method reported previously (27Levin J.Z. de Framond A.J. Tuttle A. Bauser M.W. Heifetz P.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, both constructs contain two identical sequences encoding a part of the corresponding protein in antisense and sense orientations and were linked together by a bar gene. In parallel, we constructed PEX5Δ7 overexpressing the Met1–Tyr657 region of Pex5p lacking 71 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). This transgenic plant was constructed because we expected that the defective Pex5p protein would induce a dominant negative phenotype. These DNA fragments were inserted under the control of a constitutive 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus in a Ti vector containing a hygromycin-resistant gene as a selectable marker in plants, and then integrated into the genomes of two kanamycin-resistant transgenic plants, AtGFP-PTS1 and AtPTS2-GFP, by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Construction of these parental lines has been described previously elsewhere (24Mano S. Nakamori C. Hayashi M. Kato A. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes of the AtGFP-PTS1 and AtPTS2-GFP had punctated green fluorescence because of the peroxisomal targeting of GFP-PTS1 (a GFP fusion protein containing 10 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of hydoxypyruvate reductase) and PTS2-GFP (a GFP fusion protein containing 49 amino-terminal amino acid residues of citrate synthase at its amino terminus) (see Fig. 4, bottom panels). The retransformation of pex5i, pex7i, and PEX5Δ7 into the AtGFP-PTS1 and AtPTS2-GFP plants allowed us to determine the effects of these DNA constructs on import of the GFP-PTS1 and PTS2-GFP in vivo. The primary transformants were designated as T0 plants.

In both pex5i/GFP-PTS1 and pex5i/PTS2-GFP the amounts of Pex5p were greatly reduced, whereas no effect was observed for the amounts of Pex7p (Fig. 1B, pex5i (lane 1) and pex5i (lane 2)). Inversely, the amounts of Pex7p were greatly reduced, whereas no effect was observed for the amounts of Pex5p in both pex7i/GFP-PTS1 and pex7i/PTS2-GFP (Fig. 1B, pex7i (lane 1) and pex7i (lane 2)). PEX5Δ7/GFP-PTS1 and PEX5Δ7/PTS2-GFP contained an additional form of Pex5p whose molecular mass was well matched with the polypeptide encoded by PEX5Δ7, whereas no effect was observed for Pex7p (Fig. 1B, PEX5Δ7 (lane 1) and PEX5Δ7 (lane 2)). It is noteworthy that all of these samples contained similar amounts of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (data not shown). All phenotypes described in this study were dominant.Effects of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxybutyric Acid and Sucrose on Growth of Pex5i, Pex7i, and PEX5Δ7—We reported previously (28Hayashi M. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar) that plants lacking glyoxysomal fatty acid β-oxidation become resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybytyric acid (2,4-DB) and require sucrose during postgerminative growth. To analyze the contribution of Pex5p and Pex7p to glyoxysomal function, the effects of 2,4-DB and sucrose were examined using T2 progenies of the transgenic lines. When these T2 populations were grown on medium containing 2,4-DB, ∼75% of the T2 seedlings had elongated roots, indicating resistance to 2,4-DB. The 2,4-DB-resistant phenotypes are shown in Fig. 2, upper panel. Because of genetic segregation of the transgene in the T2 population, the rest of the seedlings showed strong growth inhibition identical with their parental plants. In addition, ∼75% of T2 seedlings required sucrose for post-germinative growth. These seedlings could not grow normally in the absence of sucrose (Fig. 2, middle panel). All seedlings that showed 2,4-DB resistance or required sucrose were resistant to both hygromycin and kanamycin (data not shown). These results indicated that introduction of the pex5i, PEX5Δ7, and pex7i constructs into the transgenic plants caused the defect in glyoxysomal function.Fig. 2Effects of 2,4-DB and sucrose on the growth of pex5i, PEX5Δ7, and pex7i transgenic plants. T2 progenies of the transgenic plants (pex5i, PEX5Δ7, and pex7i) and parental plants (cont) expressing GFP-PTS1 (lane 1) or PTS2-GFP (lane 2) were grown for 10 days on growth medium containing 0.2 μg/ml of 2,4-DB, growth medium without sucrose (–sucrose), and normal growth medium (GM) under constant illumination. Seedlings were removed from the media and arranged on agar plates.

When pex5i/GFP-PTS1 and PEX5Δ7/GFP-PTS1 were grown in a normal atmosphere (36 Pa CO2), they had yellow-green leaves and showed a dwarf phenotype compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 3A, pex5i(air) and PEX5Δ7(air)). This phenotype was recovered when the plants were grown under high CO2 conditions (1000 Pa CO2) (Fig. 3A, pex5i(CO2) and PEX5Δ7(CO2)). A similar phenomenon was observed in the ped2 mutant that has a defective PEX14 gene conferring reduced activity for photorespiration (16Hayashi M. Nito K. Toriyama-Kato K. Kondo M. Yamaya T. Nishimura M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, pex7i/PTS2-GFP grew normally even in the normal atmosphere (Fig. 3A, pex7i(air)). Based on these results, we assume that loss of Pex5p function reduces the activity of photorespiration in leaf peroxisomes, whereas loss of Pex7p does not.Fig. 3Photorespiratory glycolate metabolism in pex5i, PEX5Δ7, and pex7i transgenic plants.A, effect of CO2 on the growth of pex5i, PEX5Δ7, and pex7i transgenic plants. The parental plants expressing AtGFP-PTS1 (cont), pex5i/GFP-PTS1 (pex5i), PEX5Δ7/GFP-PTS1 (PEX5Δ7), and pex7i/PTS2-GFP (pex7i) were grown for 8 weeks in an atmosphere containing 1000 Pa CO2 (CO2) or in a normal atmosphere (air) under constant illumination. Arrows indicated top of an inflorescence apex. B, effect of strong irradiation on maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). AtGFP-PTS1 (GFP-PTS1), pex5i/GFP-PTS1 (pex5i/PTS1), AtPTS2-GFP (PTS2-GFP), pex7i/PTS2-GFP (pex7i/PTS2), and the ped2 mutant (ped2) were grown for 4 weeks in an atmosphere containing 1000 Pa CO2 under low light (50 μE m–2 s–1). These plants were illuminated with strong light (450 μE m–2 s–1) for 4 h in a normal atmosphere. Maximum quantum yields of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) of the leaves at a 0-h (0h) and a 4-h illumination (4h) were measured after these plants were kept for 30 min in darkness. Each point represents the average Fv/Fm measured in six leaves of independent plants with standard error.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tested this hypothesis by measuring the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, which can be estimated from the ratio of the variable fluorescence of dark-adapted chlorophyll a to the maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) (29Franklin L.A. Levavasseur G. Osmond C.B. Henley W.J. Ramus J. Planta. 1992; 187: 399-408Google Scholar, 30Krause G.H. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 566-574Crossref Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 31Öquist G. Chow W.S. Andersson J.M. Planta. 1992; 186: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We compared Fv/Fm of dark-adapted leaves of the parental plants with pex5i/GFP-PTS1 plants and pex7i/PTS2-GFP plants (Fig. 3B). They were initially grown for 3 weeks in an atmosphere containing high CO2 (1000 Pa) under low light (50 μE m–2 s–1) to reduce the effects of photoinhibition. All plants grown in this condition showed normal growth and had similar Fv/Fm values (Fig. 3B, 0h). These plants were then transferred to a normal atmosphere (36 Pa CO2), where they were illuminated with a strong light (450 μE m–2 s–1). Under these conditions, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase acts as an oxygenase in addition to its carboxylase activity, which is necessary for CO2 fixation in photosynthesis. Phosphoglycolate, a byproduct of the oxygenase reaction, is metabolized by photorespiration enzymes and finally returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle. Therefore, the Fv/Fm of the wild-type plants would not be expected to change after the strong illumination, and this is what was observed (Fig. 3B, GFP-PTS1(4 h) and PTS2-GFP(4 h)). In contrast, significant reduction of Fv/Fm was observed in the pex5i/GFP-PTS1 as well as the ped2 mutant, which has a defective PEX14 gene (Fig. 3B, pex5i/PTS1(4h) and ped2(4h)). Only a weak reduction of Fv/Fm was observed in pex7i/PTS2-GFP (Fig. 3B, pex7i/PTS2(4 h)). These results indicate that pex5i/GFP-PTS1 plants were unable to maintain sufficient activity of the Calvin-Benson cycle under low CO2/strong light conditions because of the defect in photorespiration. The imbalance between the light reaction and the Calvin-Benson cycle might have been responsible for the observed reduction of the Fv/Fm. These results indicated that Pex5p, but not Pex7p, is necessary for the maintenance of the activity of photorespiration in leaf peroxisomes.Intracellular Transport of Peroxisomal Proteins in the Absence of Pex5p—Subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins, GFP-PTS1 and PTS2-GFP, in the cells of pex5i/GFP-PTS1 and pex5i/PTS2-GFP was determined using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Both leaf and root cells of pex5i/GFP-PTS1 showed green fluorescence only in the periphery of the cells (Fig. 4, upper panels) that coincided with the cytosol surrounding the central vacuoles. Identical fluorescent images were obtained in 19 independently isolated transformants for pex5i/GFP-PTS1 out of 20 T1 progenies showing hygromycin/kanamycin resistance. Cytosolic fluorescence was also obtained in leaf and root cells of 35 independent transformants for pex5i/PTS2-GFP out of the 42 T1 progenies (Fig. 4, middle panels). In contrast, cells of parental transgenic plants, AtGFP-PTS1 and AtPTS2-GFP, showed punctated green fluorescence that coincided with peroxisomes (Fig. 4, lower panels). These data indicate that Pex5p mediates intracellular transport of both PTS1-containing and PTS2-containing proteins.Protein-Protein Interaction of PEX5Δ7 Gene Product—By employing a yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and pull-down assays, we demonstrated previously (23Nito K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that Arabidopsis Pex5p has the ability to bind not only to PTS1-containing proteins but also Pex7p and Pex14p in vitro (also see Fig. 5). Pex5p possesses a tetratricopeptide repeat motif at the carboxyl terminus (32Brickner D.G. Brickner J.H. Olsen J.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 330Google Scholar, 33Wimmer C. Schmid M. Veenhuis M. Gietl C. Plant J. 1998; 16: 453-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tetratricopeptide repeat motif consists of seven tandem repetitive consensus amino acid sequences that are necessary to interact with PTS1 (34Brocard C. Kragler F. Simon M.M. Schuster T.

The SpoU and TrmD families were previously considered to be unrelated to each other; however, recent computational analysis has suggested that they might share a common evolutionary origin and form a single “SPOUT” (SpoU-TrmD) superfamily (31Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Taking the above information together, the trefoil knot structure is probably conserved in the catalytic domains of most SPOUT methyltransferases. This raises, however, an important question. The roles of the conserved amino acid residues in the motifs that are shared across the various SpoU members remain unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that the residues conserved in the motifs are involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, such as the binding of both substrates (AdoMet and tRNA) and the release of the products, and also contribute to the stability of the protein structure. Furthermore, we discuss amino acid substitutions in general among the SPOUT superfamily of methyltransferases. Materials—[methyl-14C]AdoMet (1.95 GBq/mmol) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (2.47 TBq/mmol) were purchased from ICN; cold AdoMet and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) were from Sigma; and DE52 was from Whatman. Sephacryl S-100 high resolution came from Amersham Biosciences. The AdoHcy affinity column was synthesized from a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's manual. CM-Toyopearl 650M was from Tosoh, Japan. DNA oligomers were bought from Invitrogen, and T7 RNA polymerase was from Toyobo, Japan. All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of the Proteins—The gene encoding tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase from T. thermophilus HB8 was cloned into the E. coli pET30a expression vector (6Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We carried out the site-directed mutagenesis by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the plasmids were analyzed with ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencers. The wild-type enzyme was purified as reported previously (6Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Twelve mutant proteins (N35A, N35Q, S37G, R41K, R41M, E124Q, E124D, P143Q, S150C, S150T, N152D, and N152E) were purified by the same method. Because the AdoHcy affinity column did not efficiently purify five mutant proteins (N35D, R41A, E124A, S150A, and N152A), we purified these proteins by two-step ion exchange chromatography. In brief, fractions of the DE52 column chromatography step in the standard purification procedure were combined, dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and separated by CM-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography (liner gradient; 100–250 mm KCl in the buffer A). The mutant protein fractions were assessed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In cases where the purity of the protein was not satisfactory, we repeated the CM-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography step after dialysis against the buffer A. The fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl), and concentrated with Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.). Glycerol was added to the purified proteins to a final concentration of 50%, and the samples were stored at –30 °C. The quantity of protein was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Measurements of Enzymatic Activity—A standard assay for enzyme activity was carried out in which incorporation of the methyl group from [methyl-14C]AdoMet into yeast tRNAPhe transcript was measured as follows: 300 ng of protein, 7 μm transcript, and 38 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet in 30 μl of buffer B were incubated for 5 min at 50 °C, and then an aliquot (20 μl) was assessed by the conventional filter assay. The yeast tRNAPhe transcript was prepared as reported previously (7Hori H. Kubota S. Watanabe K. Kim J.M. Ogasawara T. Sawasaki T. Endo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25081-25090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the methyl transfer reaction with [methyl-3H]AdoMet. To determine the kinetic parameters for AdoMet, the concentrations of the mutant proteins and yeast tRNAPhe transcript were fixed at 0.23 and 8.5 μm, respectively. However, the range of the AdoMet concentrations and the incubation times were varied according to the methyl transfer activity of the protein. When the mutant protein had relatively high activity, [methyl-3H]AdoMet concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 μm were used. When the mutant proteins had relatively low activity, we measured the initial velocities under modified conditions as follows. The AdoMet concentrations were adjusted to 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 2.0 mm by the addition of cold AdoMet. In the latter case, the incubation period was prolonged to 60 min. Kinetic parameters for tRNA were determined as previously reported (7Hori H. Kubota S. Watanabe K. Kim J.M. Ogasawara T. Sawasaki T. Endo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25081-25090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analytical Ado-Hcy Affinity Column Chromatography—The affinity of the purified proteins for AdoHcy was qualitatively analyzed by the Ado-Hcy column chromatography as described in our previous report (6Hori H.

Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Purified protein (final concentrations, 0, 1.1, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.7, 6.8, 8.0, 9.1, 10.0, and 11 μm) and 5 μm yeast tRNAPhe transcript were incubated in 20 μl of buffer C (25 mm Trisacetic acid (pH 7.0) and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2) at 37 °C for 20 min. A 6% polyacrylamide gel (width, 90 mm; length, 90 mm; thickness, 1 mm) was prepared with 1× buffer C, and 4 μl of loading solution (0.25% bromphenol blue and 30% glycerol) was added to each of the samples, which were then loaded onto the gel immediately. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature under a constant voltage (100 V) for 1 h. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect protein and then with methylene blue to detect RNA. The quantities of RNA and protein were measured with a Fuji Photo Film BAS2000 imaging analyzer. Measurement of CD Spectra—CD spectra were measured with a JASCO spectropolarimeter J-820 equipped with a JASCO PTC-423L thermocontroller. Cuvettes with a 1-mm path length were used. Each sample (250 μg/ml) in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) was preincubated at 25, 50, or 75 °C for 20 min, and then the spectrum was recorded from 300 to 200 nm at each temperature. The scan speed was 50 nm/min. The spectra shown in this paper are the average of five scans. The content of α-helix (percentage) was calculated according to Ref. 32Clark D.J. Hill C. Martin S.R. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar. Analytical Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration was performed with an ÄKTAprime chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Superdex 75 column (10/30; column volume, 23.6 ml). The column was first equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mm KCl, and the sample (30–50 μg) was then injected. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by the absorption of UV at 280 nm. The enzyme-tRNA complex was analyzed as follows. The enzyme (400 pmol) and tRNA (80–800 pmol) were incubated at 4 °C for 5 min in 100 μl of the buffer B and then injected onto the column. The elution profiles were monitored by the absorption of UV at 260 and 280 nm. Selection of Target Sites for the Site-directed Mutagenesis— Fig. 1 schematically shows the multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the eubacterial SPOUT proteins that have been identified functionally and/or structurally. To generate the alignment, we basically followed the publications of Gustafson et al. (9Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Anantharaman et al. (31Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). Conserved amino acid sequences resembling motifs 1, 2, and 3 are also found in members of the TrmD family, as reported by Anantharaman (31Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), although these motifs were originally identified in SpoU family members (9Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present work, we focused mainly on the amino acid residues conserved in these motifs. We therefore selected amino acid residues on this basis as the target sites for mutation; these residues are indicated in red in Fig. 1. Although the residues selected are separated in the primary amino acid sequence, they constitute the catalytic pocket in the three-dimensional structure (see Fig. 8). We prepared 17 mutants in this work (Table I) and expressed the proteins by the E. coli pET 30a expression system. All proteins were purified to homogeneity, as assessed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown; see Figs. 2 and 7).Table IKinetic parameters for AdoMet and yeast tRNAPhe transcriptVariant nameAdoMettRNA transcriptReference/SourceKmVmaxRelative Vmax/KmKmVmaxμmμmol/mg·hnmμmol/mg·hWild type101011003Ref. 6Hori H.

https://openalex.org/W2040048937,"We report the observation of unusually strong and systematic changes in the electron transport in metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes that are undergoing collisions with inert gas atoms or small molecules. At fixed gas temperature and pressure, changes in the resistance and thermopower of thin films are observed that scale as roughly M(1/3), where M is the mass of the colliding gas species (He, Ar, Ne, Kr, Xe, CH4, and N2). Results of molecular dynamics simulations are also presented that show that the maximum deformation of the tube wall upon collision and the total energy transfer between the colliding atom and the nanotube also exhibit a roughly M(1/3) dependence. It appears that the transient deformation (or dent) in the tube wall may provide a previously unknown scattering mechanism needed to explain the atom collision-induced changes in the electrical transport."
https://openalex.org/W1988958979,"Our planetary system is embedded in a small-body disk of asteroids and comets, vestigial remnants of the original planetesimal population that formed the planets. Once formed, those planets dispersed most of the remaining small bodies. Outside of Neptune, this process has left our Kuiper belt and built the Oort cloud, as well as emplacing comets into several other identifiable structures. The orbits in these structures indicate that our outer solar system's comet disk was shaped by a variety of different physical processes, which teach us about how the giant planets formed. Recent work has shown that the scattered disk is the most likely source of short-period comets. Moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates that the sculpting of the Kuiper belt region may have involved large-scale planetary migration, the presence of other rogue planetary objects in the disk, and/or the close passage of other stars in the Sun's birth cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2045096405,"Proprotein convertases play an important role in tumorigenesis and invasiveness. Here, we report that a dibasic amino acid convertase, furin, directly cleaves proMMP-2 within the trans-Golgi network leading to an inactive form of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Co-transfection of COS-1 cells with both proMMP-2 and furin cDNAs resulted in the cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide of proMMP-2. The molecular mass of cleaved MMP-2 (63 kDa), detected in both cell lysates and conditioned medium, is between the intermediate and fully activated forms of MMP-2 induced by membrane type 1-MMP. Furin-cleaved MMP-2 does not possess proteolytic activity as examined in a cell-free assay. Treatment of transfected cells with a furin inhibitor resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of proMMP-2 cleavage; recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, which binds to the active site of membrane type 1-MMP, had no inhibitory effect. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the furin consensus recognition motif of proMMP-2(R69KPR72↓) prevented propeptide cleavage, thereby identifying the scissile bond and characterizing the basic amino acids required for cleavage. Other experimental observations were consistent with intracellular furin cleavage of proMMP-2 in the trans-Golgi network. The furin cleavage site in other proMMPs was examined. MMP-3, which contains the RXXR furin consensus sequence, was cleaved in furin co-transfected cells, whereas MMP-1, which lacks an RXXR consensus sequence, was not cleaved.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dec-RVKR-cmk, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; TGN, trans-Golgi network.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dec-RVKR-cmk, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; TGN, trans-Golgi network. are an important family of zinc- and calcium-dependent proteinases that degrade extracellular matrix components and numerous other proteins. MMPs are implicated in physiological and pathological processes related to extracellular matrix turnover, including wound healing, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3195) Google Scholar). MMP-2 (gelatinase A, 72-kDa type IV collagenase) appears to be especially important in tumor invasion and metastasis because of its ability to degrade basement membrane type IV collagen (2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar).All MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes, and most of them are secreted from cells as proenzymes consisting of a propeptide, a catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a hemopexin-like domain; MMP-7, -23, -26, and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) are exceptions (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3195) Google Scholar, 3Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The zymogens of most MMPs are activated through a two-step activation mechanism. Activator proteinases, such as trypsin or plasmin or organomercurial chemical treatment, first attack the proteinase-susceptible “bait” region located in the middle of the propeptide domain (4Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Kronberger A. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6725-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Whitham S.E.

This cleavage induces conformational changes in the propeptide and renders the final activation site to be readily cleaved by a second proteolysis. The latter reaction is usually an intermolecular autocatalytic event (6Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to other secreted MMPs, proMMP-2 is physiologically activated on the cell surface through a MT-MMP-dependent mechanism (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric binding of TIMP-2 to the catalytic site of MT1-MMP on the cell surface, followed by the binding of the C-terminal domain of proMMP-2 to the C terminus of TIMP-2, results in a trimolecular complex. A second TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP molecule on the cell surface then cleaves proMMP-2, leaving highly focused active MMP-2 available for efficient substrate degradation and participation in other events (8Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial cleavage of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP occurs at the Asn37–Leu38 bond forming an intermediate (64-kDa form identified by gelatin zymography), which is followed by an intermolecular autocleavage of the Asn80–Tyr81 bond to generate a 62-kDa fully activated form (9Strongin A.Y.

Furin, one of seven proprotein convertases, has been implicated in the MMP-2 activation mechanism. Furin cleaves proMT1-MMP at the R108RKR111 furin consensus sequence, leading to activation of MT1-MMP (12Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Furin is a subtilisin-like serine endoprotease that cleaves neuropeptides, receptors, growth factors, cell surface glycoproteins, and enzymes on the C-terminal side of the consensus sequence -Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg↓-(RX(K/R)R) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (13Liu G.

Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg residues at the P1 and P4 positions of the cleavage site are essential, whereas the P2 basic amino acid is not but serves to enhance processing efficiency. Therefore, RXXR represents the minimal furin cleavage site. Favorable residues at P2 and P6 can compensate for less favorable ones at position P4 (15Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furin is a type I membrane protein localized to the TGN, a late Golgi structure that is responsible for sorting secretory pathway proteins to their final destinations, including the cell surface, endosomes, lysosomes, and secretory granules (16Gu F. Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1067-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The steady-state localization of furin to the TGN has led to the supposition that this endoprotease cleaves proprotein substrates in this compartment (17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furin has also been reported to form a naturally truncated and, hence, secreted form called shed furin, which exhibits functional activity even though it lacks the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (18Vey M. Schafer W. Berghofer S. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In studies designed to further characterize the role of furin in MT1-MMP-induced proMMP-2 activation, we observed that co-transfection of furin cDNA along with proMMP-2 cDNA in COS-1 cells resulted in cleavage of proMMP-2. This result was surprising because COS-1 cells express negligible amounts of MT1-MMP and are unable to activate proMMP-2 in the absence of transfection with MT1-MMP cDNA (20Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This observation led us to carry out additional experiments, which demonstrated that furin directly cleaves proMMP-2 in the TGN, resulting in cell secretion of a non-proteolytic enzyme.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Brefeldin A, a reagent that causes a distortion in intracellular protein traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (21Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2) and decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-RVKR-cmk), a furin inhibitor containing a consensus furin cleavage sequence, was purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). The pcDNA3 expression vector and oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA restriction enzymes and the pSG5 expression vector were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant proMMP-2 was produced by COS-1 cells transfected with proMMP-2 cDNA and purified as described previously (22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol.

Mouse anti-human MMP-2 antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). MT1-MMP, MMP-2, TIMP-2, and α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh mutant (α1-PI, an inhibitor of furin), wild-type, soluble, and dominant negative furin (furinS→ A) cDNAs were described previously (19Rehemtulla A.

Docherty (Celltech, Slough, UK).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmids were transfected into cells using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (20Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were harvested after an 18-h incubation of COS-1 cells at 37 °C in serum-free media.Construction of Plasmids—MMP-1 and MMP-3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Chitra Biswas (Tufts University School of Medicine) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. The truncated proMMP-2 cDNA, designated as proMMP-2ΔC, which lacks the entire hinge and hemopexin-like domains of MMP-2 (from Ala418 to Cys631) was constructed by introducing a stop codon into Ala418. In brief, a PCR fragment encoding for the signal, propeptide, and catalytic domains of proMMP-2 was amplified using the proMMP-2/pcDNA3 vector as template with a forward T7 primer, which annealed with a T7 promoter sequence in the pcDNA3 vector (5′ to 3′: AATACGACTCACTATAG) and the reverse primer (5′ to 3′: AAGGATCCCTACCCATAGAGCTCCTGAATGC 3′). The resulting PCR fragments containing EcoRI and BamHI sites were then cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector.To examine the potential furin cleavage site in proMMP-2, a mutant proMMP-2 with arginine 69 substituted by the neutral amino acid alanine (MMP-2R69→ A), was constructed by an overlap extension mutagenesis approach using a two-step PCR as described previously (22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mutagenic reverse primer (5′ to 3′: GTTGCCGCAGCGTGGCTTCGCCATGG TCTCGAT) (underlined nucleotides indicate the altered codon) was paired with a forward T7 primer to generate the N-terminal portion fragment carrying the desired mutation by employing the PCR using the proMMP-2/pcDNA3 template. Another PCR fragment encoding the C-terminal region of proMMP-2 (Lys70–Cys631) was generated by amplifying the proMMP-2 cDNA template with the forward primer (5′ to 3′: AAGCCACGCTGCGGCAACCCA), which partially complemented the mutated N-terminal proMMP-2 fragment generated above, and the reverse primer Sp6, which recognizes the Sp6 promoter sequence in the pcDNA3 vector (5′ to 3′: GTGACACTATAGAAT). Finally, PCR amplification using the T7 forward primer and the Sp6 reverse primer was employed to generate full-length mutant proMMP-2, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the pSG5 expression vector driven by an SV40 promoter. The cloning junction and mutant sequences in all mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing as described previously (22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells transfected with proMMP-2 cDNA and furin cDNA were grown on glass coverslips to 60% confluence and fixed for 10 min at 4 °C in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies (1 μg/ml for both mouse anti-proMMP-2 antibody and rabbit anti-furin antibody) and secondary antibodies (1: 1500 dilution of a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and a Texas Red-conjugated mouse IgG) (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). After extensive washes, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with antifading medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The samples with double-stained specimens were examined and photographed with a Nikon fluorescent microscope and Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 model confocal imaging system. The images were analyzed by Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad).Co-immunoprecipitation of Both MMP-2 and Furin—COS-1 cells co-transfected with furin and proMMP-2 cDNAs were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MMP-2 antibodies followed by capture of the antigen-antibody complex with protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen). The MMP-2 complex was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel), and Western blotting was performed using anti-furin antibodies.Fluorogenic Substrate Degradation Assay—Furin-cleaved MMP-2 along with unprocessed latent MMP-2 was isolated from the conditioned medium of COS-1 cells co-transfected with proMMP-2 cDNA and furin cDNA using gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (24Crabbe T. Zucker S. Cockett M.I. Willenbrock F. Tickle S. O'Connell J.P. Scothern J.M. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6684-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, proMMP-2 and MT1-MMP-activated MMP-2 were isolated and used as controls. Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (BCA™ protein assay kit, Pierce). Equal amounts of furin-cleaved and MT1-MMP-activated MMP-2 (based on densitometry analysis) as well as proMMP-2 were incubated with 1.5 μm fluorogenic substrate (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2) at 25 °C for 60 min. Fluorimetric analysis was performed at λexcitation = 328 nm and λemission = 393 nm as described previously (25Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar).Procedures for Gelatin Substrate Zymography and Western Blotting—Basic protocols for these techniques have been described in our recent studies (22Cao J.

To examine the role of furin in the furin-MT1-MMP-MMP-2 activation axis, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with both furin and proMMP-2 cDNAs, and the conditioned medium from the transfected cells was examined by gelatin zymography. Surprisingly, conditioned media harvested from these cells revealed the cleavage of proMMP-2 (zymogen form) (Fig. 1A). In comparison with the MT1-MMP processing of proMMP-2, which resulted in intermediate (64-kDa) and activated (62-kDa) forms of MMP-2 (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), furin-cleaved MMP-2 (fur.MMP-2) migrated as a 63-kDa protein. The cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-MMP-2 antibody (data not shown).To further examine the cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin, a synthetic specific inhibitor of furin, Dec-RVKR-cmk, was employed. Cells co-transfected with both furin and proMMP-2 cDNAs were incubated with the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1B, furin-induced cleavage of proMMP-2 was inhibited by Dec-RVKR-cmk in a dose-dependent fashion, confirming that the cleavage of proMMP-2 was furin-mediated.Cleavage of proMMP-2 by Furin Is Independent of MT1-MMP Expression—To clarify the direct role of furin in the cleavage of proMMP-2, conditioned media from COS-1 cells transfected with different combinations of cDNAs encoding protease inhibitors as well as proMMP-2, MT1-MMP, and furin were examined. As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of TIMP-2, a natural inhibitor of MT1-MMP, in co-transfected COS-1 cells totally blocked MT1-MMP-induced proMMP-2 activation but had no effect on furin-induced proMMP-2 cleavage. A similar inhibitory effect was noted in transfected cells treated with a synthetic broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, e.g. CT1847 (27Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (data not shown). On the other hand, co-expression of cells with the furin inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh mutant cDNA (α1-PI), interfered with the cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin (Fig. 2A) but did not affect MT1-MMP cleavage of proMMP-2 (22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin is independent of MT1-MMP. A, no interference of TIMP-2 on furin-induced proMMP-2 cleavage. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with different combinations of cDNAs as indicated and incubated in serum-free medium. The spent conditioned medium was examined by gelatin zymography. α1-Antitrypsin Pittsburgh mutant (α1-PI) but not TIMP-2 inhibited furin-induced proMMP-2 cleavage. B, N-terminal cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin. The spent conditioned medium from COS-1 cells co-transfected with proMMP-2ΔC along with MT1-MMP or furin cDNAs was examined by gelatin zymography. Furin but not MT1-MMP is able to cleave the C-terminal hemopexin domain-deleted proMMP-2 mutant (proMMP-2ΔC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been demonstrated that formation of a complex between the C-terminal domain of MMP-2 with the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 is essential for immobilizing MMP-2 at the cell surface in order for it to be activated by MT1-MMP (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 27Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C.

Hence, C-terminal hemopexin domain-deleted MMP-2 is not activated by MT1-MMP. To examine the requirement for the C-terminal domain of MMP-2 in cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin, a deletion mutant of proMMP-2 lacking the hemopexin domain from Ala418 to Cys631 (28Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C.S. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated (proMMP-2ΔC). The conditioned medium from COS-1 cells transfected with various cDNAs as indicated was collected, and gelatin zymography was performed (Fig. 2B). Consistent with a previous report (24Crabbe T. Zucker S. Cockett M.I. Willenbrock F. Tickle S. O'Connell J.P. Scothern J.M. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6684-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), proMMP-2ΔC displayed gelatinolytic activity. As anticipated, co-transfection of COS-1 cells with MT1-MMP and proMMP-2ΔC cDNAs did not result in cleavage of proMMP-2ΔC. In contrast, co-expression of furin with proMMP-2ΔC cDNAs in COS-1 cells resulted in the cleavage of the C-terminal-deleted proMMP-2. Taken together, these data indicate that furin cleaves proMMP-2 at the N terminus and that this cleavage is independent of MT1-MMP.Intracellular Cleavage of proMMP-2 by Furin—Furin is a transmembrane protein distributed mainly in the TGN (29Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Furin also traffics to the cell surface and to a lesser degree is shed into the extracellular environment (18Vey M. Schafer W. Berghofer S. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, the processing compartment of proMMP-2 by furin was examined. To evaluate the possibility that the cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin occurs extracellularly, COS-1 cells were transfected with furin alone, MT1-MMP alone, or proMMP-2 cDNA alone. Transfected cells were co-cultured in various combinations, and conditioned media were collected. As anticipated, co-culture of the COS-1 cells expressing MT1-MMP with cells expressing proMMP-2 led to proMMP-2 activation (Fig. 3A) supporting a cell surface-activated mechanism for proMMP-2. In agreement with a previous report that shed furin functions in conditioned medium (18Vey M. Schafer W. Berghofer S. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), co-culture of the COS-1 cells expressing furin and proMMP-2 resulted in the cleavage of proMMP-2, but less efficiently, despite the presence of considerable levels of shed furin in the conditioned medium as depicted by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). COS-1 cells expressing furin did not enhance proMMP-2 activation induced by MT1-MMP. To further clarify this observation, a soluble furin cDNA lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain (Sol. furin) (19Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into COS-1 cells along with proMMP-2 cDNA, and the spent conditioned medium was examined by gelatin zymography. Consistent with the co-culture result, soluble furin processed proMMP-2 less efficiently than wild-type furin (Fig. 3C). These data thus support the hypothesis that furin is shed into conditioned media and possesses enzymatic activity. To further examine the enzymatic role of furin in proMMP-2 cleavage, a dominant negative furin construct was employed in which the active site serine was mutated to alanine (furinS→ A) (19Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inactive mutant (furinS→ A) failed to cleave proMMP-2 in transfected cells (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Intracellular cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin. A, inefficient extracellular cleavage of proMMP-2 by furin. COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-MMP, furin, proMMP-2, or GFP control were co-cultured as indicated. The spent conditioned medium was collected and examined by gelatin zymography. Co-culture of cells expressing furin and cells expressing proMMP-2 resulted in inefficient cleavage of proMMP-2. B, shedding of furin in transfected COS-1 cells. The conditioned medium from COS-1 cells transfected with furin cDNA was concentrated and examined by Western blotting using an anti-furin antibody. 80-kDa soluble furin was detected in the conditioned medium. C, enzymatic inactive furin is unable to cleave proMMP-2. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with proMMP-2 cDNA along with GFP control, MT1-MMP, furin, soluble furin (sol.Furin), or inactive furin (FurinS-A) cDNAs, and the conditioned media were collected for gelatin zymography. In contrast to furin, furinS→ A-transfected cells failed to result in cleavage of proMMP-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the fact that furin is mainly localized to the TGN, we compared the cleavage of proMMP-2 in whole cell lysates of transfected cells versus the conditioned medium. Cleaved MMP-2 (63 kDa) was noted in both the conditioned medium and the cell lysates of COS-1 cells expressing both furin and proMMP-2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7). Because furin-induced proMMP-2 cleavage occurs less efficiently in the extracellular environment (Fig. 3, A and C), we hypothesized that proMMP-2 was primarily activated by furin in the TGN and/or the secretory pathway. To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with brefeldin A, which blocks protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (21Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Marotta A. Conrad P.A. Bloom G.S.

https://openalex.org/W1987819431,"In yeast, chitin is laid down at three locations: a ring at the mother-bud neck, the primary septum and, after cytokinesis, the cell wall of the daughter cell. Some of the chitin is free and the remainder attached to β(1–3)glucan or β(1–6)glucan. We recently reported that the chitin ring contributes to the prevention of growth at the mother-bud neck and hypothesized that this inhibition is achieved by a preferential binding of chitin to β(1–3)glucan at that site. Here, we devised a novel strategy for the analysis of chitin cross-links in [<sup>14</sup>C]glucosamine-labeled cell walls, involving solubilization in water of alkali-treated walls by carboxymethylation. Intact cell walls or their digestion products with β(1–3)glucanase or β(1–6)glucanase were carboxymethylated and fractionated on size columns, and the percentage of chitin bound to different polysaccharides was calculated. Chitin dispersed in the wall was labeled in maturing unbudded cells and that of the ring in early budding cells. The former was mostly attached to β(1–6)glucan and the latter to β(1–3)glucan. This confirmed our hypothesis and indicated that the cell has mechanisms to attach chitin, a water-insoluble substance, synthesized here through chitin synthase III, to different acceptors, depending on location. In contrast, most of the chitin synthase II-dependent chitin of the primary septum was free, with the remainder linked to β(1–3)glucan."

To clarify the role of lipids in insulin secretion, we generated mice with β-cell-specific overexpression (βLPL-TG) or inactivation (βLPL-KO) of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a physiologic provider of fatty acids. LPL enzyme activity and triglyceride content were increased in βLPL-TG islets; decreased LPL enzyme activity in βLPL-KO islets did not affect islet triglyceride content. Surprisingly, both βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO mice were strikingly hyperglycemic during glucose tolerance testing. Impaired glucose tolerance in βLPL-KO mice was present at one month of age, whereas βLPL-TG mice did not develop defective glucose homeostasis until approximately five months of age. Glucose-simulated insulin secretion was impaired in islets isolated from both mouse models. Glucose oxidation, critical for ATP production and triggering of insulin secretion mediated by the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, was decreased in βLPL-TG islets but increased in βLPL-KO islets. Islet ATP content was not decreased in either model. Insulin secretion was defective in both βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO islets under conditions causing calcium-dependent insulin secretion independent of the KATP channel. These results show that β-cell-derived LPL has two physiologically relevant effects in islets, the inverse regulation of glucose metabolism and the independent mediation of insulin secretion through effects distal to membrane depolarization.

Normal secretion of insulin, the anabolic hormone central to glucose metabolism, is necessary for normal lipid metabolism. The converse may also be true; normal lipid metabolism may be necessary for normal insulin secretion. Acute exposure to fatty acids potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas chronic exposure causes a muted insulin secretory response to glucose (1Crespin S.R. Greenough W.B.

Increased provision of lipids might be expected to decrease insulin secretion by decreasing pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and glucose oxidation, known as the Randle effect (7Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Reports addressing this issue are conflicting (8Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 9Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it is likely that any effects on pyruvate dehydrogenase are blunted because of the high activity of pyruvate carboxylase in islets, which ultimately prevents effects on glucose oxidation by preserving cytoplasmic pyruvate (10Liu Y.Q.

Fatty acids have been postulated to interfere with insulin secretion by disrupting normal mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism (11Boucher A. Lu D. Burgess S.C. Telemaque-Potts S. Jensen M.V. Mulder H.

Fatty acids have been postulated to promote insulin secretion through the effects of long chain acyl-CoA molecules on a variety of potential targets (15Yaney G.C. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1297-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and more recently, through direct effects on the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 (16Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. Tanaka H. Maruyama M. Satoh R. Okubo S. Kizawa H. Komatsu H. Matsumura F. Noguchi Y. Shinohara T. Hinuma S. Fujisawa Y. Fujino M. Nature. 2003; 422: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The source of lipids that modulate insulin secretion is also unknown. Fatty acids delivered to β-cell regulatory pools could be derived from circulating non-esterified fatty acids (mostly bound to albumin), intracellular triglycerides (the substrate for the intracellular enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase) (14Winzell M.S. Svensson H. Enerback S. Ravnskjaer K. Mandrup S. Esser V. Arner P. Alves-Guerra M.C. Miroux B. Sundler F. Ahren B. Holm C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or circulating triglycerides traveling in lipoproteins. The relative contribution of each of these pools in β-cells to insulin secretion is unknown. In other tissues, hydrolysis of circulating lipoprotein-associated triglycerides is the principal source of fatty acids destined for metabolism (17Augustus A.S. Kako Y. Yagyu H. Goldberg I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E331-E339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This process is accomplished by the extracellular enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). 1The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoprotein lipase; βLPL-KO, β-cell lipoprotein lipase knockout; βLPL-TG, β-cell lipoprotein lipase transgenic; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KO, knock-out; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; tSNARE, target membrane-associated SNARE; vSNARE, vesicle-associated SNARE; TG, transgenic; WT, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoprotein lipase; βLPL-KO, β-cell lipoprotein lipase knockout; βLPL-TG, β-cell lipoprotein lipase transgenic; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KO, knock-out; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; tSNARE, target membrane-associated SNARE; vSNARE, vesicle-associated SNARE; TG, transgenic; WT, wild-type. LPL is regulated by hormones and nutrients in a tissue-specific manner (18Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, where fatty acids are stored, LPL activity is induced by feeding and suppressed by fasting. In muscle, which relies on fatty acids for energy production in the postabsorptive state, LPL activity is induced by fasting and suppressed by feeding. Insulin stimulates LPL in adipocytes and adipose tissue (19Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but may inhibit LPL in heart (20Sambandam N. Abrahani M.A. St. Pierre E. Al-Atar O. Cam M.C. Rodrigues B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have shown that LPL is expressed in human and rodent islets (21Marshall B.A. Tordjman K. Host H.H. Ensor N.J. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Coleman T. McDaniel M.L. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27426-27432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) where its regulation resembles that of adipocytes, because β-cell LPL expression is induced by glucose and insulin (22Cruz W.S. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12162-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we describe two novel mouse models generated to define how LPL, a physiologic provider of fatty acids, affects insulin secretion. Both overexpression and inactivation of β-cell LPL activity cause diabetes phenotypes despite opposite effects on islet glucose metabolism. Both also cause defects in the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion, suggesting that optimal β-cell function requires maintenance of a discrete range of triglyceride-derived fatty acids by LPL. Animals—The Washington University Animal Studies Committee approved these studies. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility with unrestricted access to water and standard mouse chow containing 6% fat. For mice with β-cell overexpression of LPL (βLPL-TG), a human LPL cDNA engineered to encode a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein was inserted at the EcoRI site of the vector pRIP I (a gift from Dr. Bess Marshall), which contains an intron and polyadenylation signal and is known to direct expression of transgenes in mouse β-cells (23Koster J.C. Marshall B.A. Ensor N. Corbett J.A. Nichols C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was sequentially treated with SacI and XhoI to liberate the LPL transgene and then the fragment was separated from vector DNA, and C57BL/6 x CBA hybrid embryos were injected at the Washington University Mouse Genetics Core. Transgenic animals, identified by PCR genotyping using human LPL/HA-specific primers, were born in expected Mendelian frequencies, and all experiments were performed with littermates. For mice with β-cell-specific inactivation of LPL (βLPL-KO), Ins2Cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory, number 003573) were crossed with mice carrying LPL alleles flanked by loxP recombination sites (LPLlox/lox) (24Augustus A. Yagyu H. Haemmerle G. Bensadoun A. Vikramadithyan R.K. Park S.Y. Kim J.K. Zechner R. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25050-25057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). First generation animals hemizygous for the RIP-Cre gene and bearing one “floxed” LPL allele (LPLlox/wtCre+) were crossed with LPLlox/lox animals to generate β-cell LPL-deficient (LPLlox/loxCre+) and β-cell LPL wild-type (LPLlox/loxCre–) littermates that were used for experiments. The following primers (schematically represented in Fig. 2) were used to document LPL gene rearrangement: Primer A, 5′-GTA GGT TTG GAA TGG TCA TTT GGC ATG TCC-3′; Primer B, 5′-TTT CCA CTG CAC AGC TGT TTA AGT GAC TGG-3′; and Primer C, 5′-CCT AGT CTT CTC TAG GCA GAG AGC AGC AGA-3′. Amplification of non-rearranged DNA by primers A and B yields a product of ∼700 bp, whereas the amplification of appropriately rearranged DNA with primers A and C yields a product of ∼400 bp. Islet Isolation—Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and Ficoll step density gradient separation and then selected with a microscope to exclude any contaminating tissues (25McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mouse islets were counted and aliquoted for insulin secretion studies (10–25 islets/aliquot), analysis of triglyceride content (50–100 islets/aliquot), insulin content (5 islets/aliquot), measurement of glucose oxidation (30 islets/aliquot), or measurement of LPL activity (200 islets/aliquot). Analytical Procedures—Islet LPL enzyme activity was measured as described previously (22Cruz W.S. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12162-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets were solubilized in a buffer composed of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mg/ml BSA, 80 mg/ml sucrose, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 2 mg/ml deoxycholate. Activity was assayed as the release of radiolabeled oleate from an emulsion containing glyceroltri[1-14C]oleate (Amersham Biosciences). Serum glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and non-esterified fatty acids were measured using reagents from Sigma. Islet triglycerides were determined after extraction of lipids with 2:1 (v/v) chloroform and methanol followed by sonication of the extract in reagent buffer using a Branson 250-probe-tip Sonifier. Serum insulin was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem Inc., Downer's Grove, IL). Islets in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA were sonicated, and the total insulin content was determined by radioimmunoassay in the Washington University Diabetes Research and Training Center. For Western blotting, tissues were Dounce-homogenized, solubilized in sample buffer under reducing conditions, boiled for 10 min, and then proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Detection of human LPL protein produced by transgenic mice was performed using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (MMS-101P; Covance). ATP levels were determined within the linear response of a luciferin-based assay. Freshly isolated islets were homogenized in a nucleotide-releasing mixture and then frozen. Standard curves were generated with serial dilutions of ATP, and bioluminescence was detected using a luminometer. Static Insulin Secretion—Islets were rinsed with CMRL 1066 medium containing 3 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA, placed in microcentrifuge tubes in the same buffer, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator for 30 min. The buffer was then replaced with CMRL 1066 medium containing 3 or 20 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA, and the samples were incubated for 30 (βLPL-TG) or 20 min (βLPL-KO). Insulin secreted into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Mice in clean cages with free access to water were fasted for 4 h and then weighed, and baseline blood glucose was determined using a glucose oxidase analyzer (HemoCue Inc., Lake Forest, CA). The animals were injected intraperitoneally with 50% (w/v) dextrose at a dose of 2 mg/g body weight, and blood glucose was measured at 30, 60, and 120 min. Insulin tolerance tests were conducted in an analogous manner, except that mice received an intraperitoneal injection of human regular insulin (Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana) at a dose of 0.5 units/kg body weight. Glucose Oxidation—Islets were washed and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (25 mm Hepes, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) without glucose or BSA, gassed with 5% CO2/95% air, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3 or 16.5 mm glucose in the presence of d-[U-14C]glucose was added, and the tubes were transferred to scintillation vials containing filter paper and sealed with septum caps (26McDaniel M.L. King S. Anderson S. Fink J. Lacy P.E. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 303-308PubMed Google Scholar, 27Corbett J.A. Wang J.L. Hughes J.H. Wolf B.A. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster J.R. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The vials were incubated for 2 h in a shaking water bath at 37 °C, and then 200 μl of 2 n NaOH was added to the filter paper through the stopper cap using a needle and syringe. Two hundred μl of 6 n HCl was added to the tubes containing islets, and the vials were incubated without shaking at room temperature overnight. The tubes were then removed, scintillation fluid was added to the vials containing filter paper, and radioactivity representing 14CO2 production determined in a scintillation counter. Statistical Methods—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated by unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test or by analysis of variance with appropriate post-hoc tests. Significance levels are described in the individual figure legends. Generation of βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO Mice—For βLPL-TG mice, two independent founders carrying the transgene encoding an HA-tagged LPL molecule, shown schematically in Fig. 1A, were characterized and found to share the same phenotype. An HA-tagged protein of the predicted size was detected in islets from βLPL-TG animals but not in control islets (Fig. 1B). Certain regions of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, transiently activate the insulin promoter during embryogenesis (28Gannon M. Shiota C. Postic C. Wright C.V. Magnuson M. Genesis. 2000; 26: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). No HA-tagged LPL was detectable in brain extracts from βLPL-TG or control mice (Fig. 1B), and there was no difference in brain LPL enzyme activity between genotypes (data not shown). Compared with non-transgenic islets, βLPL-TG islets had three-fold more LPL activity (Fig. 1C) in the presence of 3 mm glucose (p = 0.0019) and nearly five-fold more LPL activity in the presence of 20 mm glucose (p = 0.0004). Islet triglyceride content was modestly but significantly increased in the transgenic animals (Fig. 1D). Isolated islets in culture respond to elevated glucose concentrations by increasing LPL activity (22Cruz W.S. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12162-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 1D) suggests that the increased LPL activity measured in our in vitro assay (Fig. 1C) leads to increased fatty acid flux and subsequent metabolic adaptations in vivo. For βLPL-KO mice, the presence of the Cre recombinase in β-cells was predicted to remove exon 1 of the LPL gene (Fig. 2A). PCR reactions, including Primers A, B, and C as shown in Fig. 2A, showed the expected rearrangement of the LPL gene (as indicated by the presence of a 400 bp band) in islet DNA from Cre+ mice (Fig. 2B). Detection of the 700-bp wild-type band in the KO lane is expected, as Cre is driven by a β-cell-specific promoter, and DNA from non-β-cells in islets should not be rearranged. That the conditional rearrangement of the LPL gene occurred only in the β-cell was shown by the presence of the wild-type product and the absence of the rearranged product in DNA from the following tissues of RIP-Cre+ mice: brain, heart, adipose tissue, spleen, and liver (data not shown). LPL enzyme activity (Fig. 2C) was ∼40% lower in βLPL-KO as compared with control islets in the presence of 20 mm glucose (p = 0.0307). Residual LPL activity detected in islets from βLPL-KO mice is likely because of the presence of non-β-cells. Although we observed a reduction in glucose-stimulated LPL activity in βLPL-KO islets (Fig. 2C), this change in LPL activity did not alter the islet content of triglycerides in vivo (Fig. 2D). Glucose Intolerance and Defective Insulin Secretion with Perturbations of β-cell LPL—Neither genetic manipulation of LPL expression affected fasting serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, or insulin (data not shown). There was also no effect of increased or decreased islet LPL activity on body mass. Weights for βLPL-TG mice at the age of 12 weeks were: TG males, 32.8 ± 1.8 g; WT males, 31.2 ± 0.9 g; TG females, 24.5 ± 4.9 g; and WT females, 25.5 ± 5.0 g. Weights for βLPL-KO mice at the age of 12 weeks were: KO males, 27.2 ± 1.6 g; WT males, 28.3 ± 1.3 g; KO females, 22.0 ± 0.5 g; WT females, 21.3 ± 1.3 g. Insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin tolerance testing was unaffected in both βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO mice (Fig. 3, B and D). However, βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO animals became hyperglycemic compared with their respective wild-type littermates during glucose tolerance testing (Fig. 3, A and C). The data of Fig. 3 represent males, but the same results were seen with females. To characterize in vivo insulin secretory responses, insulin was measured during glucose tolerance tests in separate cohorts. Compared with the basal state, plasma insulin nearly doubled 30 min after glucose administration in both the βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO animal models (Table I). Although βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO mice displayed significantly higher blood glucose levels 30 min after challenge, there were no significant differences in circulating insulin concentrations between these animals and their respective wild-type littermates. The failure to detect higher insulin levels in the setting of hyperglycemia suggests the presence of defective insulin secretion, which was confirmed using isolated islets (Fig. 4). βLPL-TG (Fig. 4A) and βLPL-KO (Fig. 4C) islets secreted less insulin than controls when stimulated with 20 mm glucose. Islet insulin content was unaffected in both models (Fig. 4, B and D).Table IPlasma insulin and glucose concentrations before and after glucose challengeAnimal model and respective littermate controlTime after glucose injectionInsulinGlucoseInsulin/Glucoseminpg/mlmg/dlWild-type0800 ± 265244 ± 273.13 ± 0.82βLPL-TG0868 ± 203213 ± 264.22 ± 1.0Wild-type301775 ± 664398 ± 304.40 ± 1.6βLPL-TG301600 ± 592572 ± 16ap < 0.001 compared to wild-type littermate glucose level 30 minutes after injection.2.90 ± 1.1Wild-type0440 ± 24126 ± 102.99 ± 0.35βLPL-KO0460 ± 60109 ± 54.15 ± 0.58Wild-type30844 ± 7274 ± 253.21 ± 0.34βLPL-KO30829 ± 11403 ± 35bp < 0.005 compared to wild-type littermate glucose level 30 min after injection.2.14 ± 0.32cp < 0.05 compared to wild-type littermate insulin/glucose ratio 30 min after injection.a p < 0.001 compared to wild-type littermate glucose level 30 minutes after injection.b p < 0.005 compared to wild-type littermate glucose level 30 min after injection.c p < 0.05 compared to wild-type littermate insulin/glucose ratio 30 min after injection.

This delayed onset of glucose intolerance suggests that these animals successfully compensate for the increased delivery of fatty acids for a period of time. In contrast, βLPL-KO mice as young as one month of age, the earliest age examined, exhibit impaired glucose tolerance (data not shown), suggesting that these animals have insufficient levels of a fatty acid-derived signal required for normal insulin secretion. Because these two animal models developed impaired glucose tolerance at different ages, βLPL-TG animals were studied at 5–6 months of age, whereas βLPL-KO mice were studied at 2–3 months of age. Opposite Effects on Islet Glucose Oxidation and Defects in the Amplifying Pathway of Insulin Secretion—These genetic models of altered islet LPL expression had opposite effects on islet glucose oxidation. Glucose oxidation was decreased at 16.5 mm glucose in βLPL-TG islets relative to islets from wild-type siblings (Fig. 5A), but this decrease was unlikely to be due to lipotoxicity-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, because islet ATP content was increased (Fig. 5B). Previous studies have suggested that increased availability of fatty acids in islets can increase expression of uncoupling protein-2 (14Winzell M.S. Svensson H. Enerback S. Ravnskjaer K. Mandrup S. Esser V. Arner P. Alves-Guerra M.C. Miroux B. Sundler F. Ahren B. Holm C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), known to decrease insulin secretion presumably through effects on ATP generation (29Zhang C-Y. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.-B. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Consistent with the ATP data of Fig. 5B, there was no effect of LPL expression on islet uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels (not shown). There was also no effect of LPL modulation on islet mRNA levels for glucokinase (not shown), a key mediator of β-cell glucose metabolism. Glucose oxidation was increased at both 3 and 16.5 mm glucose in βLPL-KO islets as compared with islets from wild-type littermates (Fig. 5C). Qualitatively, the increased glucose oxidation as a consequence of lowered β-cell LPL expression is the opposite to that of βLPL-TG islets, which have reduced glucose oxidation. However, differences in the ages of animals studied and in their genetic backgrounds limit the validity of direct quantitative comparisons of glucose oxidation between these two models of altered LPL expression. There was no effect of β-cell LPL knockdown on islet ATP content (Fig. 5D). Despite differing effects on glucose oxidation, βLPL-TG and βLPL-KO islets had similar defects in the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion (Fig. 6). Treatment with 250 μm diazoxide and 30 mm KCl, conditions inducing insulin secretion independent of the KATP channel, revealed defects in insulin secretion at 3 and 20 mm glucose in βLPL-TG islets (Fig. 6A) and at 20 mm glucose in βLPL-KO islets (Fig. 6B). Diabetes, a disease projected to affect 366 million people worldwide by the year 2030 (30Wild S. Roglic G. Green A. Sicree R. King H. Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (11710) Google Scholar), is characterized by two salient pathophysiologies: insulin resistance and the inability of the β-cell to secrete sufficient insulin to maintain normal levels of blood glucose. Both may be affected by abnormal lipid metabolism. By modulating β-cell expression of LPL, which is known to be altered in diabetes and critical for the physiologic delivery of fatty acids to tissues, we have identified three important roles for this enzyme in β-cell function. First, normal levels of β-cell LPL are required to maintain glucose homeostasis in an intact physiologic system, because an increase in islet LPL activity (βLPL-TG mice, Fig. 3A) and a decrease in islet LPL activity (βLPL-KO mice, Fig. 3C) resulted in systemic glucose intolerance. Second, LPL activity inversely regulates islet glucose metabolism. Glucose oxidation was decreased in islets with increased LPL activity (Fig. 5A) and increased in islets with d"

https://openalex.org/W1996689433,"Trypanosoma brucei and related organisms contain an organelle evolutionarily related to peroxisomes that sequesters glycolysis, among other pathways. We have shown previously that disruption of protein import into this organelle, the glycosome, can be accomplished through RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of the peroxin PEX14. Decreased PEX14 in turn leads to cell death, which, at least in the procyclic stage, can be triggered by the presence of glucose. Here we show that fructose, which is taken up and metabolized by procyclic form T. brucei, and glycerol, which interfaces with the glycosomal glycolytic pathway, are also toxic during PEX14 RNAi. Earlier computer modeling studies predicted that glycolysis would be toxic to T. brucei in the absence of glycosomal compartmentation because of the intrinsic lack of feedback regulation of the parasite hexokinase and phosphofructokinase. To further test this hypothesis, we performed double RNAi, targeting hexokinase and PEX14. Knockdown of hexokinase rescued PEX14 knockdown cells from glucose toxicity, even though glycosomal proteins continue to be mislocalized to the cytosol. Knockdown of phosphofructokinase was benign in the absence of glucose but toxic in the presence of glucose. When PEX14 and phosphofructokinase mRNAs were jointly targeted for RNAi, glycerol remained toxic to the parasites. Taken together, these data indicate that the glycosome provides significant, but not complete, protection of trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis.

Taken together, these data indicate that the glycosome provides significant, but not complete, protection of trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis. Trypanosoma brucei subspecies cause African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. The human disease is fatal if untreated, and the animal disease continues to compromise agricultural development in Africa. T. brucei and related protozoa (kinetoplastids and bodonids) are the only organisms known to sequester glycolysis within a cellular organelle. This organelle, the glycosome, is evolutionarily related to peroxisomes. Glycosomes and peroxisomes share a number of metabolic functions, such as the β-oxidation of fatty acids and ether-lipid biosynthesis (1Parsons M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, targeting sequences that route proteins to these organelles are closely related (2Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.-L. Keller G.-A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as are the biogenesis proteins, which are known as peroxins (PEXs) 1The abbreviations used are: PEX, peroxin; HK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; SOGG, special order SDM-79 medium lacking glucose, glucosamine, and glycerol; Tet, tetracycline; nt, nucleotide; RNAi, RNA interference.

The hallmark of the glycosome, in distinction to peroxisomes, is the presence of the Embden-Meyerhof segment of the glycolytic pathway (see Fig. 1 for schematic). Metabolism of glucose to either 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate or 3-phosphoglycerate (depending on the developmental stage and species) occurs in the glycosome, and further conversion to pyruvate can occur in both the glycosome and cytosol. Glycosomes and peroxisomes are closed systems in which ADP/ATP and NAD/NADH must be kept in balance internally, and transporters are required for the transfer of substrates and products (7Van Roermund C.W. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Glycosomes are essential for the survival of both bloodstream (mammalian) and procyclic (insect midgut) form T. brucei (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Guerra-Giraldez C. Quijada L. Clayton C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolysis and the glycosome have received considerable attention because the mammalian stages of T. brucei rely exclusively on glycolysis for the generation of ATP. However, the procyclic stage does not require glucose and primarily uses amino acid catabolism to generate ATP (10Ter Kuile B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4699-4705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In glycolysis, for each molecule of glucose that is metabolized, two ATPs are initially invested and then four are generated, for a net yield of two ATPs (Fig. 1). The net ATP is generated in the cytosol, whereas ATP balance within the glycosome is maintained by multiple enzymes for which the interplay has not been established (11Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hexokinase (HK) mediates the first reaction in glycolysis by phosphorylating glucose in an ATP-dependent manner, and, following isomerization, phosphofructokinase (PFK) generates fructose 1,6 bisphosphate. In most organisms, the activity of these enzymes is tightly regulated. However, this is not the case for the kinetoplastid homologues, and in particular HK is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate (12Nwagwu M. Opperdoes F.R. Acta Trop. 1982; 39: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of regulatory control creates an automatic feed forward mechanism in kinetoplastids, sometimes referred to as “turbo glycolysis” (13Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 162-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Computer modeling studies, done on data derived from bloodstream form parasites, suggest that the role of compartmentation of glycolysis within the glycosome is to keep the activities of HK and PFK sequestered from cellular pools of substrates (e.g. ATP) and that this is essential to protect the cell (14Bakker B.M. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Bakker B.M. Mensonides F.I.

Mislocalization of these unregulated kinases to the cytosol might lead to runaway phosphorylation of hexoses (because of the availability of the cytosolic pool of ATP), ATP depletion, and cell death. We have previously identified and examined the role of one of the T. brucei glycosome biogenesis proteins, PEX14 (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This peroxin is an essential component of the receptor-docking complex, which is involved in the targeting of matrix proteins to the glycosome and translocation of these matrix proteins across the glycosomal membrane. We demonstrated by RNAi that PEX14 is essential for the proper localization of glycosomal matrix proteins and that its depletion results in the death of both bloodstream and procyclic form parasites. In addition, we showed that one specific cause of this lethality in procyclic stage parasites was glucose. Here we extend our analysis to demonstrate that several sugars or components of the glycolytic pathway have a similar lethal phenotype in cells where PEX14 has been depleted by RNAi. In addition, we demonstrate the specific role played by glycolysis in this phenotype by construction of T. brucei double RNAi cell lines that knock down both PEX14 and either HK or PFK expression. Growth of Parasites—T. brucei strain TREU667 (16Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 17Michelotti E.F. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 927-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 29-13 (16Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) procyclic form parasites were maintained in the JRH Biosciences formulation of SDM-79 supplemented with 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 3.75 mg/liter hemin, and 10% fetal calf serum. G-418, hygromycin, and phleomycin were added to a final concentration of 15, 50, and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. This formulation does not contain glycerol, unlike our previous formulation of SDM-79. In addition, NaH2PO4·H2O was increased from 126 to 954 mg/liter, glutamine was increased from 320 to 513 mg/liter, and serine was reduced from 71 to 10 mg/liter. We also obtained a special order medium from JRH Biosciences that further lacked glucose and glucosamine (SOGG medium). When cells were grown in SOGG, unless otherwise noted, we used serum that was dialyzed against a 40-fold volume of phosphate-buffered saline (dialysis tubing was extensively washed to remove glycerol). RNAi experiments employed the strain 29-13, which contains integrated copies of T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline (Tet) repressor, which allows Tet-regulated expression of introduced genes. Cell densities were determined using a Z1 Coulter counter, and growth curves were performed using duplicate or triplicate cultures. Cultures in log phase were diluted to 106 cells/ml to begin the experiment, and RNAi was induced by the addition of 4 μg/ml Tet. Tet was added every 24–48 h, and cultures were kept below 2 × 107 cells/ml. Plasmid Construction—RNAi constructs were based on the plasmid pZJM, which contains a cloning site between opposing T7 promoters under the control of the Tet operator (18Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This plasmid can be integrated into the transcriptionally silent ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer. Amplification of the relevant fragments from T. brucei genomic DNA used primers containing HindIII sites. For HK, the forward primer was 5′-AAGCTTCAATATCCTCGAACACATC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AAGCTTCTCGAGGAAGCCCTTCGTCCACCGG-3′. There are two HK loci in T. brucei (19Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), HK1 and HK2, which differ only by 1 bp in the 526-bp region used for RNAi (nt 18–543 of the 1416-nt open reading frame). For PFK, primers 5′-AAGCTTGAATCTCGCAGCCGCGTTACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCTTGAAGAGGATGTTGACACCG-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify nt 10–582 of the 1461-nt PFK open reading frame. The PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced. Cloned fragments were then ligated into the vector pZJM-PEX14 (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) following digestion of both vector and insert with HindIII (see Fig. 3), yielding both orientations (tail-to-tail (A) or tail-to-head (B)). The A orientation plasmid was digested with XhoI, taking advantage of a site in the reverse primer (HK) or the naturally occurring site within the cloned fragment, 5 bp upstream of the reverse primer (PFK), to release the PEX14 fragment. Religation then generated constructs targeting only the glycolytic enzyme. Determination of Transcript Levels by Real-time PCR and Northern Analysis—For the HK knockdown strains, real-time PCR was used for analysis of HK1/HK2 and PEX14 transcript levels. Primers were specific for the endogenous genes and not the RNAi constructs. The HK primers, which matched both HK1 and HK2, were 5′-GTCAACAGGCGCTGGAGAA-3′ (forward), 5′-CCGCAGGAAGGCAGTTAATAGAC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-CCCGCCGCGTTATT-3′ (reporter). PEX14 primers were 5′-GGAGACTCAGGAAGCTCTTGAAG-3′ (forward), 5′-GCAACTTCCCGAGGGTGAT-3′ (reverse), and 5′-CAAGGCTGAACTCTCC-3′ (reporter). Samples (5 × 107 cells) were taken after 2 days of RNAi induction, and RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA using the Taqman reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems). Approximately 50 ng of cDNA of each sample was loaded per well for PCR. RNA loading was normalized according to α-tubulin mRNA levels using the primers 5′-CGCTCGTATTGACCACAAATTCG-3′ (forward), 5′-ACCCTCACCGACGTACCA-3′ (reverse), and 5′-AAGCGCGCCTTCGTG-3′ (reporter). For the PFK strains, PFK and PEX14 transcript levels were determined by Northern analysis on RNA samples (10 μg) prepared as above. Samples were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel (NuSieve: agarose, 3:1) and transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran N, Schleicher & Schüll). Following prehybridization in ULTRAHyb (Ambion), RNA probes that were prepared using the Promega Riboprobe-T7 kit were added to 106 cpm/ml. The probes detected both the native transcripts and those produced by the RNAi constructs. Blots were washed twice with 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl/1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C. Western Analysis—Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline three times and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Approximately 5 × 106 cell equivalents/sample were separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels (Cambrex PAGEr). Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran) and probed with rabbit anti-HK or anti-PFK (a gift from Paul Michels), which was prepared against purified T. brucei HK1 or PFK (20Misset O. Bos O.J. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 157: 441-453Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The second step was protein A (1:5000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). After quantitating the HK signal, blots were stripped and incubated with anti-PEX14 (1:100) (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and anti-NOG1 (1:5000) (21Park J.H. Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 173-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a loading control. Image analysis was done using the Amersham Biosciences storm PhosphorImager system and software. Immunofluorecence Analysis—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using an antiserum directed against procyclic form glycosomes (1:100 dilution) (22Parker H.L. Hill T. Alexander K. Murphy N.B. Fish W.R. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After washing, slides were mounted using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) for fluorescence microscopy. PEX14 RNAi Induction Is Lethal with Various Sugars or Glycerol—In our previous work, we established an RNAi procyclic form cell line in which the expression of double-stranded RNA corresponding to the 5′ half of PEX14 was induced by Tet. We demonstrated that induced expression of PEX14 RNAi led to mislocalization of glycosomal matrix proteins and was lethal for parasites when glucose was present in the medium (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This phenotype was evident at 4 days following the induction of RNAi in procyclic forms, apparently requiring the dilution of PEX14 through cell division and protein turnover. We wanted to determine what concentration of glucose was lethal and whether other sugars or other components of our medium related to glycosomal metabolism might be lethal as well. Although procyclic form cultures are normally maintained in SDM-79 medium, the previous experiments used a modified RPMI-based medium. We therefore obtained a special formulation of SDM-79 that lacked glycerol, glucose, and glucosamine. When RNAi was induced, the PEX14 RNAi parasites in SOGG medium supplemented with 10% non-dialyzed fetal calf serum died after 4 days (results not shown). This concentration of fetal calf serum yielded a final concentration of 356 μm glucose. Growth of the PEX14 RNAi cell line was tested in SOGG medium using dialyzed serum (yielding a final concentration of 9 μm glucose) and supplemented with different concentrations of glucose (Fig. 2A). In the absence of additional glucose, induced cultures showed only a slight growth defect, with one-half the cell numbers of their uninduced counterparts by day 11. In the presence of 100 μm glucose, uninduced cultures grew somewhat better than the induced cultures. Higher levels of glucose (1 and 10 mm) were toxic to induced cultures. The difference in cumulative cell number by day 11 for these cultures was approximately 2 orders of magnitude. As we found previously in the RPMI-based medium, if cells were grown in the absence of glucose for several days during PEX14 RNAi induction, and then glucose was added back to 10 mm, the lag period was eliminated, and the culture died within 24 h (data not shown). Galactose is not taken up by T. brucei (23Eisenthal R. Game S. Holman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and, as expected, its presence had no effect on the growth of induced parasites (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a lethal phenotype was observed in induced cultures containing 10 mm fructose and 10 mm glycerol (Fig. 2, B and C). Glycerol was additionally tested at various concentrations ranging from 100 μm to 10 mm. The addition of 100 μm glycerol to induced cultures reduced the number of viable parasites 10-fold, whereas 1 and 10 mm glycerol reduced them 100-fold (data not shown). 2-Deoxyglucose is phosphorylated by HK but inhibits glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and is not further metabolized (Fig. 1). It arrested growth almost immediately, both in the presence and absence of RNAi induction (Fig. 2C). This effect was also seen in another cell line, TREU667, and was ameliorated by increasing amounts of glucose in the medium (data not shown). 2-Deoxyglucose may have other effects on the cell in addition to the futile consumption of ATP, such as inhibition of glycosylation. However, previous studies have shown that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, has little effect on the viability of procyclic forms (25Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Welburn S.C. Ruepp S. Roditi I. Hwa K.Y. Englund P.T. Wells C.W. Murphy N.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Double RNAi Constructs Are Effective in Knockdown of Multiple mRNAs—Computer modeling studies of bloodstream form parasites suggest that sequestration of glycolysis within the glycosome may be essential to protect the cell from the potentially lethal effects of unregulated HK and PFK in the cytosol (15Bakker B.M. Mensonides F.I. Teusink B. van Hoek P. Michels P.A. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis with procyclic parasites in vivo by taking advantage of the mislocalization phenotype that arises when PEX14 is depleted. We created double RNAi constructs in T. brucei with portions of PEX14 and either HK1 or PFK. The 5′ end of HK1 was amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA and cloned into the PEX14 RNAi construct in two orientations with respect to PEX14 (Fig. 3). The double-stranded RNA should target transcripts for both HK genes (HK1 and HK2) because the two differ by only one nt in the region employed. An RNAi construct targeting HK1/2 mRNA (but not PEX14) was constructed as well. These constructs were stably transfected into T. brucei 29-13. The levels of HK1/2 and PEX14 mRNA were evaluated by reverse transcription and real-time PCR on day 2 after induction of RNAi (Fig. 4). HK1/2 mRNA levels in induced HK1 and HK1-PEX14 A and B RNAi cell lines were lowered to ∼15% of the levels of the corresponding uninduced cell line. In the original PEX14 RNAi line, HK1/2 mRNA levels did not change upon induction. Similarly, PEX14 mRNA levels were reduced in the PEX14 and the two HK-PEX14 double RNAi cell lines upon addition of Tet but remained unchanged in the HK knockdown. In the PEX14 knockdown, PEX14 mRNA was ∼25% of the uninduced control, and in the double RNAi mutants, it was 35% of the control. Thus, knockdown of both mRNA target molecules was accomplished by induction of one RNAi construct with two gene fragments. HK Knockdown Rescues PEX14 Knockdown—To test whether depletion of HK could rescue the PEX14 knockdown, we examined the growth of cultures of HK, HK-PEX14 B, and PEX14 RNAi cell lines in the presence of glucose. At the same time, we assessed the levels of the relevant proteins as well as compartmentation of glycosomal proteins. Immunoblotting of cell lysates from several time points revealed that following induction of RNAi in the HK-PEX14B line, both PEX14 and HK protein levels were reduced to levels comparable with those seen by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 5A) (HK1 and HK2 both have molecular masses of 51 kDa). We also assessed when mislocalization of glycosomal proteins occurred, because it is presumably linked to the detrimental phenotype. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using an anti-glycosome antibody that recognizes three different glycosomal matrix proteins (pyruvate phosphate dikinase, aldolase, and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase) (22Parker H.L. Hill T. Alexander K. Murphy N.B. Fish W.R. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The HK RNAi knockdown showed the punctate pattern typical of uninduced cells at all time points (day 8 is shown in Fig. 5B). In contrast, none of the PEX14 RNAi cells had the normal punctate pattern of staining 4 days after induction (Fig. 5B). By this time the population had stopped growing (Fig. 5C). The population began to increase again around day 11. We have shown previously that this escape is accompanied by re-expression of normal levels of PEX14 (4Furuya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The slower growing HK-PEX14 double RNAi cell line showed a longer phenotypic lag for mislocalization. Little mislocalization of glycosomal proteins was seen at day 4, but a strong mislocalization pattern was observed at day 8, when only about 5% of the cells demonstrated the punctate phenotype (Fig. 5B). Of the remaining cells, approximately one-third showed a diffuse staining pattern, whereas two-thirds had both diffuse and punctate characteristics. By 11 days post-induction, only 2% of cells had a punctate pattern of staining, two-thirds had diffuse cytosolic staining, and one-third had both diffuse and punctate characteristics. During the time period when glycosomal proteins were accumulating in the cytosol of the HK-PEX14 RNAi cell line, there was no slowing of proliferation (Fig. 5C), and microscopic analysis showed no evidence of significant cell death. Taken together, these data show that a decrease in HK rescues the PEX14 knockdown from glucose toxicity. Effects of Silencing of PFK and PEX14—The second ATP-requiring step in glycolysis is mediated by PFK within the glycosome. We therefore generated RNAi constructs targeting PFK and PEX14 mRNA as well as one targeting PFK alone. mRNA levels in the corresponding single and double RNAi lines were evaluated by Northern analysis. As in the case of the HK mutants, significant reductions of both PFK mRNA and PEX14 mRNA (Fig. 6A) were seen in the double RNAi constructs, whereas only the expected knockdown was observed in the single RNAi lines. Immunoblot analysis of induced cultures of PFK and PFK-PEX14B showed that the proteins were similarly depleted (Fig. 6, C and E). On day 8, PFK levels were reduced to 9 and 25% of control levels in the single and double knockdown lines, respectively. On day 8, PEX14 was decreased to 10% of control levels in the double knockdown line. We tested the effects of PFK depletion on growth in various media. In contradistinction to the result obtained with the knockdown of HK, knockdown of PFK mRNA resulted in sensitivity to glucose; growth ceased and cells began to die (Fig. 6B). RNAi-induced knockdown of PFK would create a bottle-neck in glycolysis at the same position as 2-deoxyglucose with respect to ATP consumption, which we demonstrated above to be toxic to the parasites. The effects of PFK RNAi take longer to appear than the effects of 2-deoxyglucose, at least in part because the RNAi-induced phenotype requires that the preexisting PFK be diluted to low levels. In contrast to glucose, the addition of glycerol to the medium was beneficial whether or not PFK RNAi was induced (Fig. 6B). Because the knockdown of PFK alone was so deleterious in the presence of glucose, it is not surprising that knockdown of PFK did not rescue PEX14 RNAi for growth in glucose (data not shown). We predicted that PFK depletion would not rescue the PEX14 RNAi line for growth in glycerol, because glycerol interfaces with the glycolytic pathway well below the reaction mediated by PFK (Fig. 1). The PFK-PEX14 double RNAi cell line was evaluated in the presence of 1 mm glycerol for growth (Fig. 6D). On day 4, growth of the population ceased, and mislocalization of glycosomal proteins to the cytosol was observed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). These results suggest that the lethal phenotype caused by the loss of glycosomal compartmentation mediated by knockdown of PEX14, at least in the case of glycerol, occurs downstream of PFK. The studies reported here shed additional light on the role of glycosomal compartmentation in T. brucei and the danger of unregulated glycolysis. The first step in the metabolism of glucose is phosphorylation by HK. Most reactions involving glucose flow from this initial event (e.g. glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide sugar biosynthesis). The rescue of the otherwise lethal PEX14 RNAi by co-reduction of HK via the double RNAi construct suggests an important role for HK in inducing the lethal phenotype. It is possible that the unregulated activity of HK causes the lethal phenotype in the PEX14 RNAi cell line through a depletion of cellular ATP and a concomitant accumulation of phosphorylated hexoses, as suggested by the computer models of Bakker et al. (15Bakker B.M. Mensonides F.I. Teusink B. van Hoek P. Michels P.A. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a reduction in HK mRNA levels reduces flux through the glycolytic pathway, preventing the accumulation of a toxic intermediate further downstream in the pathway. Other workers have shown that the removal of glucose from the medium or the knockdown of HK affects the expression of surface glycoconjugates (19Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and resistance to the adenosine analog tubercidin (26Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Wang Z. Wells L. Sanchez M. Landfear S.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46596-46600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that glucose metabolism has more far-reaching effects on the cell. In any case, the rescue from PEX14 knockdown via depletion of HK appears essentially identical to deletion of glucose from the growth medium. The results for the PFK knockdown, although not entirely discordant with the suggestions of the computer modeling, are still a somewhat unexpected twist. Here it seems quite clear that a lethal phenotype results when glucose is present, even in the context of an intact glycosome. This phenotype could result because trypanosomal HK, unlike other HKs, is not inhibited by accumulating glucose 6-phosphate that would normally shut off glycolysis when PFK is depleted (see Fig. 1). One result would be the consumption of intraglycosomal ATP and increased glycosomal hexose phosphates. The specific block in glycolysis caused by 2-deoxyglucose is at glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. With respect to ATP consumption in glycolysis and accumulation of hexose phosphates, this inhibition is at the same place as the PFK knockdown. Taken together, these results suggest that sequestration of the pathway within the glycosome does not provide complete protection from the dangerous design of glycolysis. These results highlight the consequences of futile initiation of glycolysis in the presence of an intact glycosome, even in a stage when the parasite does not even require glycolytic metabolism (27Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der M.P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). How this knockdown of PFK impacts flux in other pathways in trypanosomes remains to be studied, although it could increase flow through the pentose phosphate pathway as it does in Escherichia coli (28Hua Q. Yang C. Baba T. Mori H. Shimizu K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 7053-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The question remains as to whether the depletion of intraglycosomal ATP and accumulation of intraglycosomal hexose phosphates are sufficient to cause cell death or whether toxicity results from an interplay with other, possibly cytosolic, molecules. We hasten to point out that these results do not rule out the possibility that the effects of glucose toxicity result from a downstream process in the PEX14 RNAi mutant that has lost glycosomal compartmentation. The observation that the PEX14 knockdowns are not rescued from glycerol toxicity by co-reduction of PFK supports the idea that at least one problem with the PEX14 RNAi mutant lies downstream of HK and PFK. The parasites possess a glycerol kinase that is normally sequestered within the glycosome (29Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The forward reaction for this enzyme (glycerol + ATP → glycerol 3-phosphate + ADP) is kinetically preferred (but normally opposed in glycosomal metabolism) and has the possibility of consuming cellular ATP, just as proposed for the hexose kinases. It will be interesting to determine whether this enzyme is involved in the lethal effect of glycerol during PEX14 RNAi. We have found that upon prolonged growth in SOGG medium, growth of parasites induced for PEX14 RNAi begins to slow compared with their uninduced controls. These data indicate that although glucose and glycerol may mediate immediate toxic effects when PEX14 is reduced in this cell line, it is likely that the lack of a functional glycosome has other deleterious consequences. Examples of other pathways in the glycosome that might be impacted by loss of compartmentation include ether-lipid synthesis or β-oxidation of fatty acids (1Parsons M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additionally, protection against cellular stresses may also be affected because a member of the glutathione-dependent peroxidase family (30Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17062-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and certain superoxide dismutases (31Plewes K.A. Barr S.D. Gedamu L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) appear to be glycosomal. The functions of these pathways in procyclic form T. brucei have received little attention. We expect that in other trypanosomatids, such glycosomal pathways might prove to be more obviously important than in T. brucei. For example, knock-out of ether-lipid biosynthesis in Leishmania causes a specific defect in the establishment of intracellular parasitism (32Zufferey R. Allen S. Barron T. Sullivan D.R. Denny P.W. Almeida I.C. Smith D.F. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44708-44718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using RNAi in T. brucei, we are now able to begin to experimentally address the importance of sequestering glycolysis within the glycosome. These insights allow us in turn to focus on a more general analysis of the role of compartmentation of other biological processes within this organelle.

https://openalex.org/W2014271698,"Black holes are most often detected by the radiation produced when they gravitationally pull in surrounding gas, in a process called accretion. The efficiency with which the hot gas radiates its thermal energy strongly influences the geometry and dynamics of the accretion flow. Both radiatively efficient thin disks and radiatively inefficient thick disks are observed. When the accreting gas gets close to the central black hole, the radiation it produces becomes sensitive to the spin of the hole and the presence of an event horizon. Analysis of the luminosities and spectra of accreting black holes has yielded tantalizing evidence for both rotating holes and event horizons. Numerical simulations imply that the relativistic jets often seen from accreting black holes may be powered in part by the spin of the hole."
https://openalex.org/W2015176407,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) is an important neurotransmitter and intercellular messenger regulating various gastrointestinal functions, including electrolyte transport. To date, however, no information is available with respect to its effects on the human intestinal apical anion exchanger Cl-/OH- (HCO3−). The present studies were therefore undertaken to examine the direct effects of serotonin on OH- gradient-driven 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid-sensitive 36Cl- uptake utilizing the post-confluent transformed human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. Our results demonstrate that serotonin inhibits Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells via both tyrosine kinase and Ca2+-independent protein kinase Cδ-mediated pathways involving either 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtype. The data consistent with our inference are as follows. (i) The short term treatment of cells with 5-HT (0.1 μm) for 15-60 min significantly decreased Cl-/OH- exchange (50-70%, p < 0.05). (ii) The specific agonists for 5-HT3, m-chlorophenylbiguanide, and 5-HT4, 3-(4-allylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-quinoxaline chloronitrile, mimicked the effects of serotonin. (iii) Tropisetron dual inhibitor for both the 5-HT3/4 receptor subtypes significantly blocked the inhibition, whereas specific 5-HT3 (Y-25130) or 5-HT4 receptor (RS39604) antagonist failed to block the inhibitory effects of 5-HT.

(vi) The specific inhibitor for PKCδ, rottlerin, significantly blocked the inhibition by 5-HT.

The gastrointestinal tract is an important source of the endogenous amine, serotonin, mainly stored in the mucosal enterochromaffin cells and in the enteric nervous system (1Gershon M.D. Erde S.M.

Schworer H. Pharmacol. Res. 1991; 23: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 5-HT is an important neurotransmitter and intercellular messenger to modulate gastrointestinal functions (3Gershon M.D. Takaki M. Tamir H. Branchek T. Experientia (Basel). 1985; 41: 863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 5-HT has been shown to alter gastrointestinal motility (4Cooke H.J. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), alter gastric acid secretion, and enhance intestinal secretions (1Gershon M.D. Erde S.M. Gastroenterology. 1981; 80: 1571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Zinner M.J. McFadden D. Sherlock D. Jaffe B.M. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Most of the previous studies regarding the effects of serotonin on ion transport were mainly based on the electrophysiological data including short circuit current measurements and unidirectional fluxes. These studies showed that 5-HT stimulated electrogenic Cl- secretion and inhibited Na+ and Cl- absorption in the rat colon (6Zimmerman T.W. Binder H.J. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), jejunum (7Hardcastle J. Hardcastle P.T. Redfern J.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1981; 320: 41Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), ileum (8Moriarty K.J. Higgs N.B. Woodford M. Warhurst G. Turnberg L.A. Gut. 1987; 28: 844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and guinea pig ileum (9Leysen J. Neuropharmacology. 1984; 23: 247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 5-HT has also been shown to inhibit the NaCl-absorptive process in the rabbit ileum and gall bladder (10Donowitz M. Tai Y.H. Asarkof N. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: G463PubMed Google Scholar) but has no effect in rabbit and guinea pig colon (10Donowitz M. Tai Y.H. Asarkof N. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: G463PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cooke H.J. Carey H.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 111: 329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sundaram et al. (12Sundaram U. Knickelbein R.G. Dobbins J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 5-HT inhibits Cl-/HCO-3 exchange activity in villus cells and stimulates HCO-3 secretion in crypt cells of the rabbit ileum. In contrast, 5-HT appears to have no significant effect on coupled NaCl absorption in the human jejunum (13Kellum J.M. Budhoo M.R. Siriwardena A.K. Smith E.P. Jebraili S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-HT exerts its effects by binding to 5-HT receptors, which are distributed on the neuronal, muscular, and epithelial structures (14Hansen M.B. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 77: 3PubMed Google Scholar). Based on pharmacological studies and molecular cloning (15Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157PubMed Google Scholar), the existence of at least seven 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-7) subdivided into 14 subtypes has been discovered. With the exception of 5-HT5 and 5-HT6, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1P, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, and 5-HT4 have been reported to be expressed in the gut (16Gaginella T.S. Rimele T.J. Wietecha M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 335: 101Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT4 receptors are coupled via guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins to their effectors, whereas 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel permeable to anions and cations (17North R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in different animal models have shown that 5-HT1 receptors mediate peristaltic reflex and do not seem to play a major role in intestinal fluid transport, whereas 5-HT2, 5-HT3, and 5-HT4 receptors produce a variety of responses in the GI tract such as alterations in intestinal fluid transport (18Burleigh D.E. Borman R.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 241: 125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and modulation of motility (19Bockaert J. Fozard J.R. Dumuis A. Clarke D.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). 5-HT seems to induce Cl- secretion by stimulating neural 5-HT3 receptors in the distal colon of guinea pig (20Cooke H.J. Wang Y.Z. Frieling T. Wood J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G833PubMed Google Scholar) and rat small intestine (21Beubler E. Horina G. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and non-neural 5-HT4 receptors in the rat colon (22Budhoo M.R. Kellum J.M. J. Surg. Res. 1994; 57: 44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), human jejunum (13Kellum J.M. Budhoo M.R. Siriwardena A.K. Smith E.P. Jebraili S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ileum (23Borman R.A. Burleigh D.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 927Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent binding studies have shown the presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the brush border membranes of the rabbit jejunal enterocytes (24Alcalde A.I. Sorribas V. Rodriguez-Yoldi M.J. Lahuerta A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 403: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Studies have also demonstrated the existence of 5-HT2 receptors on the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells from rabbit ileum (25Salvador M.T. Rodriguez-Yoldi M.C. Alcalde A.I. Rodriguez-Yoldi M.J. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 309Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), human sigmoid colon (26Borman R.A. Burleigh D.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 812: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and guinea pig small intestinal crypt cells (27Siriwardena A.K. Budhoo M.R. Smith E.P. Kellum J.M. J. Surg. Res. 1993; 55: 55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although 5-HT has been known to play a major role in regulating a number of physiological functions in the GI tract, elevated levels of serotonin have been implicated in the patho-physiology of disease states such as carcinoid syndrome (7Hardcastle J. Hardcastle P.T. Redfern J.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1981; 320: 41Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), celiac disease (28Challacombe D.N. Dawkins P.D. Baker P. Gut. 1977; 18: 882Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), irritable colon (29Kyosola K. Penttila O. Salaspuro M. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1977; 12: 363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and dumping syndrome (30Thompson J.H. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1971; 2: 687PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that 5-HT administration in vivo induces Cl- secretion in the rabbit small intestine (31Donowitz M. Charney A.N. Heffernan J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: E85PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a mediator of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome associated with a net secretion of water and electrolytes (32Donowitz M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1975; 20: 1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies suggest an important role of 5-HT in modifying electrolyte transport process that could involve either stimulation of Cl- secretion or a decrease in Na+ and Cl- absorption. However, to date, the effects of 5-HT on the human intestinal apical membrane Cl-/OH- exchange activity have not been investigated, and the signal transduction pathways involved in 5-HT-mediated alteration of NaCl absorption have not been delineated. In this regard, most of the effects of 5-HT on the intestinal ion transport have been shown to be mediated through various intracellular mediators such as phosphoinositides, Ca2+, and prostaglandins (33Hansen M.B. Skadhauge E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol A. 1997; 118: 283Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activation of 5-HT4 receptors has been reported to change the levels of cAMP and cGMP (34Hoyer D. Schoeffter P. J. Recept. Res. 1991; 11: 197Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, studies of Eklund et al. (35Eklund S. Brunsson I. Jodal M. Lundgren O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1987; 129: 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Donowitz et al. (31Donowitz M. Charney A.N. Heffernan J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: E85PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that cAMP plays no role in mediating the secretory effects of 5-HT in cat and rabbit intestine. Recent studies (36Stoner M.C. Scherr A.M. Lee J.A. Wolfe L.G. Kellum J.M. Surgery. 2000; 128: 240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) point out the role of nitric oxide in mediating the effects of 5-HT-induced Cl- secretion in the rat colon. The current studies were therefore undertaken to examine the following: (i) the possible regulation of Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells (a well established model for the human intestinal transport studies) by serotonin; (ii) to characterize the 5-HT receptor subtype(s) involved; and (iii) the signal transduction pathways involved in this process. Our current studies demonstrate that serotonin inhibits apical Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells via both tyrosine kinase and protein kinase Cδ-mediated pathways involving either the 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtype. Radionuclide 36Cl as HCl was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Caco-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). 5-Hydroxytryptamine-creatinine sulfate (5-HT, serotonin), 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and tropisetron were obtained from Sigma. Specific agonists for 5-HT3, m-chlorophenylbiguanide, and 5-HT4, 3-(4-allylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-quinoxaline chloronitrile, specific antagonists for 5-HT3 (Y-25130) and 5-HT4 (RS39604), were obtained from TOCRIS (Ellisville, MO). BAPTA-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Chelerythrine chloride, calphostin C, herbimycin, and 4-amino-5-(4methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Ro318220, Go6796, and rottlerin were procured from Calbiochem. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against PKCδ, goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and protein A-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphorylated p60 (p-Src, Tyr416) and polyclonal anti-Lck were purchased from Cell Signaling (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) HRP-conjugated antibody, monoclonal anti-Src, anti-Fyn, or polyclonal anti-Yes and anti-Lyn were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals were of at least reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, 1% essential and nonessential amino acids, and 20% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4, in 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C. For the uptake experiments, cells from passages between 20 and 25 were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml. Confluent monolayers were used for transport experiments at the10th to the 12th day post-plating (i.e. 5-7 days post confluence). To study the effect of serotonin (5-HT) on Cl-/OH- exchange activity, cells were acutely exposed to 100 nm 5-HT for 15, 30, or 60 min. In a separate set of experiments, cells were pretreated with tropisetron (dual 5-HT3/5-HT4 antagonist, 1 μm) or 5-HT3 receptor antagonist Y25130 (300 nm), or 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (300 nm), or Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (20 μm), or the specific PKC inhibitors chelerythrine chloride (2 μm) and calphostin C (200 nm), or the specific PKCα inhibitor Go6976 (5 nm), the specific PKCϵ inhibitor Ro318220 (100 nm), the specific PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (10 μm), or the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin (1 μm) or the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (10 μm) for 1 h prior to the addition of serotonin (100 nm). These inhibitors were also co-incubated along with serotonin for another 1 h. In another set of experiments, cells were treated with specific 5-HT3 (m-chlorophenylbiguanide, 1-100 μm) and 5-HT4 (3-(4-allylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-quinoxaline chloronitrile, 0.1-10 μm) agonists for 1 h. Uptake Chloride uptake experiments were performed essentially as described by Olsnes et al. (37Olsnes S. Tonnessen T.I. Ludt J. Sandvig K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with some modifications (38Saksena S. Gill R.K. Syed I.A. Tyagi S. Alrefai W.A. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Am. J.

Physiol. 2002; 283: G626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's base media containing 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.5, for 30 min at room temperature. The media were removed, and the cells were rapidly washed with 1 ml of tracer-free uptake mannitol buffer containing 260 mm mannitol, 20 mm Tris/MES, pH 7.0. The cells were then incubated with the uptake buffer for a 5-min period. This period was chosen because it falls within the linear range of Cl- uptake in this system (38Saksena S. Gill R.K. Syed I.A. Tyagi S. Alrefai W.A. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Saksena S. Gill R.K. Syed I.A. Tyagi S. Alrefai W.A. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For 36Cl- uptake studies, the uptake buffer was the mannitol buffer containing 1.4 μCi of 36Cl- (2.9 mm) of hydrochloric acid (specific activity-17.12 mCi/g) ± 0.3 mm DIDS. The uptake was terminated by removing the buffer and washing the cells rapidly two times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS). Finally, the cells were solubilized by incubation with 0.5 n NaOH for 4 h. The protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was counted by a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer, TRI-CARB 1600-TR (Packard Instrument Co.). 0.3 mm DIDS-sensitive chloride uptake was considered as Cl-/OH- exchange, and the uptake values were expressed as nmol/mg protein/5 min. Caco-2 cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates at a density of 10 × 104 (Corning Glass) were treated with serotonin (100 nm) for the 15-, 30-, and 60-min period or with the specific Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (10 μm). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were homogenized by passing 10 times through a 26-guage needle. The lysate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts (∼75 μg/sample) of protein, as determined by the Bradford assay, were combined with the SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein-bound nitrocellulose membranes were first incubated for 20 min at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 1× PBS and 3% nonfat dry milk. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1000 dilution) in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were rinsed in water and washed with the wash buffer containing 1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 for 45 min with agitation, during which time the wash buffer was changed every 5 min. Tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were visualized with ECL detection reagents. After treatment of Caco-2 cells with serotonin (100 nm) for different times or specific Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (10 μm), specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist Y25130 (300 nm), 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (300 nm), or addition of both 5HT3 and 5HT4 receptor antagonists, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were prepared as described above. The protein content of the resulting supernatant was adjusted to contain 500 μg in 200 μl of lysis buffer and incubated with the polyclonal antibody against novel PKCδ (2 μg) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, immune complexes were precipitated by using protein A-agarose beads. In a separate set of experiments, 5-HT-treated lysates at different time points were incubated with monoclonal anti-c-Src or anti-Fyn or polyclonal anti-Yes, anti-Lck, or anti-Lyn overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the immune complexes were precipitated using protein A- or G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with the lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect PKCδ phosphorylation, the protein-bound nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine-HRP-conjugated antibody, and bands were visualized with the ECL method. To detect the phosphorylation of each of the Src family members, the protein-bound nitrocellulose membranes were first incubated for 60 min at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 1× TBS (Tris-buffered saline), 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with the anti-phospho-Src Tyr416 (1:1000 dilution) in the dilution buffer containing 1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed with the wash buffer containing 1× TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min with agitation, during which time the wash buffer was changed every 5 min. Finally, the membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution), and bands were visualized with ECL detection reagents. Subcellular Fractionation—Caco-2 cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates at a density of 10 × 104 (Corning Glass) were treated with serotonin (100 nm) for different times, washed with ice-cold PBS three times, and scraped into 400 μl of the cold homogenization buffer (HB) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were homogenized on ice with 25 strokes of a glass tissue homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 59,000 rpm for 50 min at 4 °C (Optima™ TLX Ultracentrifuge; Beckman Instruments). The supernatant was designated the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of the HB containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 by brief sonication and incubated on ice for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was designated the membrane fraction. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Equal amounts of protein (∼75 μg/sample), as determined by the Bradford assay, were combined with Laemmli's Sample Buffer containing 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and then boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and trans-blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein-bound nitrocellulose membranes were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with the polyclonal antibody specific to PKCδ (1:800 dilution) in the blocking buffer containing 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed for 30 min with a wash buffer containing 1× PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Finally, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature and washed for 45 min with agitation, during which the wash buffer was changed every 5 min. PKC bands were visualized with ECL detection reagent. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Each independent set represents mean ± S.E. of data from at least 9 wells used on three separate occasions. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. To examine the effects of 5-HT on the Cl-/OH- exchange activity, Caco-2 cells were incubated with 5-HT at a concentration of 100 nm for different time points, and the DIDS-sensitive Cl-/OH- exchange activity was assessed. As shown in Fig. 1, a significant decrease (∼60%) in Cl-/OH- exchange activity was observed as early as 15 min, and the inhibition remained about the same at 30 and 60 min. Effect of Tropisetron (Dual 5-HT3/4 Receptor Antagonist)—The receptor subtype mediating the 5-HT-induced inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity was characterized with the use of the 5-HT receptor antagonist tropisetron. When employed at a final concentration of 0.1 μm (concentration at which it is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist), it had no effect on the 5-HT-mediated inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity (data not shown). However, when used at a concentration of 1 μm (1 h), at which it is known to antagonize the 5-HT4 as well as the 5-HT3 receptors, tropisetron caused a significant reversal in the 5-HT-mediated inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity (Fig. 2A). Because tropisetron is characterized as a weak competitive 5-HT4 antagonist (having higher affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor), we therefore used more specific and selective individual receptor antagonists. Effect of 5-HT Receptor Antagonists—The specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist Y25130 (300 nm) failed to block the 5-HT-induced inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that if 5-HT3 receptor is blocked, 5-HT can still mediate its effects through the 5-HT4 receptor. Similar results were observed with the selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (300 nm, 1000-fold selectivity over 5-HT3 receptor) (41Hegde S.S. Bonhaus D.W. Johnson L.G. Leung E. Clark R.D. Eglen R.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Studies were also performed in the presence of the 5-HT3 (Y25130) and 5-HT4 (RS39604) receptor antagonists together on the 5-HT-induced inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells. The inhibitory effects of 5-HT were significantly abolished in the presence of both the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 antagonists added together (Fig. 2D). Hence, the observed findings with the dual and individual receptor antagonists suggest that either of the 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes could be sufficient for 5-HT-mediated inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells. When 5-HT3 receptor is blocked, 5-HT could act through the 5-HT4 receptor, and when the 5-HT4 receptor is blocked, 5-HT could act via 5-HT3 receptor. To confirm further that both 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor subtypes are involved in this process, specific 5-HT3, m-chlorophenylbiguanide (1-100 μm, 1 h), and 5-HT4, 3-(4-allylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-quinoxaline chloronitrile (0.1-10 μm, 1 h), agonists were used. Both 5-HT3 (Fig. 3A) and 5-HT4 (Fig. 3B) agonists significantly decreased the Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells. These results indicate that 5-HT mediates its effects via activation of either 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor as both 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 agonists could mimic the effects of 5-HT. Moreover, no additive effects were observed when both the 5HT3 and 5HT4 agonists were added together (75 ± 2% as compared with control). Previous studies have suggested that the effects of 5-HT on NaCl absorption (10Donowitz M. Tai Y.H. Asarkof N. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: G463PubMed Google Scholar) and Cl- secretion (42Bolton J.E. Field M. J. Membr. Biol. 1977; 35: 159Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) are mediated by an increase in the intracellular calcium levels. We thus examined the role of calcium in mediating the effects of 5-HT by using the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (20 μm, 1 h). As shown in Table I, in the presence of BAPTA-AM there was essentially no effect on the 5-HT-mediated inhibition of Cl-/OH- exchange activity. However, previous findings from our laboratory demonstrated that exactly under the same experimental conditions, BAPTA-AM (20 μm, 1 h) significantly blocked the Ca2+-dependent effects of serotonin on Na+/H+ exchange activity (43Gill R.K. Tyagi S. Alrefai W.A. Malakooti J. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Gastroenterology. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and the H2O2 effects on Cl-/OH- exchange activity (44Saksena S. Tyagi S. Syed I.A. Alrefai W.A. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: A143Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) in Caco-2 cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that the inhibitory effects of 5-HT on the Cl-/OH- exchange activity in Caco-2 cells are not related to the intracellular calcium levels and further confirm that BAPTA-AM is an optimal chelating agent of c"

Interestingly, some KatG variants, which lost the catalatic activity, form compound III easily. Here, we compared the kinetics of interconversion of ferrous enzymes, compound II and compound III of wild-type Synechocystis KatG, the variant Y249F, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). It is shown that dioxygen binding to ferrous KatG and Y249F is reversible and monophasic with apparent bimolecular rate constants of (1.2 ± 0.3) × 105m–1 s–1 and (1.6 ± 0.2) × 105m–1 s–1 (pH 7, 25 °C), similar to HRP. The dissociation constants (KD) of the ferrous-dioxygen were calculated to be 84 μm (wild-type KatG) and 129 μm (Y249F), higher than that in HRP (1.9 μm). Ferrous Y249F and HRP can also heterolytically cleave hydrogen peroxide, forming water and an oxoferryl-type compound II at similar rates ((2.4 ± 0.3) × 105m–1 s–1 and (1.1 ± 0.2) × 105m–1 s–1 (pH 7, 25 °C)). Significant differences were observed in the H2O2-mediated conversion of compound II to compound III as well as in the spectral features of compound II. When compared with HRP and other heme peroxidases, in Y249F, this reaction is significantly faster ((1.2 ± 0.2) × 104m–1 s–1)). Ferrous wild-type KatG was also rapidly converted by hydrogen peroxide in a two-phasic reaction via compound II to compound III (≈2.0 × 105m–1 s–1), the latter being also efficiently transformed to ferric KatG. These findings are discussed with respect to a proposed mechanism for the catalatic activity.

These findings are discussed with respect to a proposed mechanism for the catalatic activity. Catalase-peroxidases (KatGs, 1The abbreviations used are: KatG, catalase-peroxidase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.1The abbreviations used are: KatG, catalase-peroxidase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. EC 1.11.1.7) are bifunctional heme b-containing enzymes exhibiting an overwhelming catalase activity and a substantial peroxidase activity with various one-electron donors. The catalatic activity of KatGs, i.e. the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, is unique for both heme peroxidase superfamilies (i.e. the superfamily of peroxidases from archaea, bacteria, fungi, and plants and the superfamily of animal peroxidases). Despite the availability of crystal structures (1Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Carpena X.

Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38991-38999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), no structural bases for the high catalase activity of KatGs has been assigned so far. Whether in KatGs compound I plays a similar role in the catalase cycle as in monofunctional catalases (EC 1.11.1.6; see Fig. 1, Reactions 1 and 2) (5Nicholls P. Fita I. Loewen P. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 51-106Crossref Google Scholar) is not clear at the moment. From a thermodynamic point of view, there is no barrier for the two-electron oxidation process, which oxidizes hydrogen peroxide to dioxygen. The standard reduction potential of the redox couple E′°(O2/H2O2) is 280 mV (6Wood P.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and normally, the oxidizing intermediates of heme peroxidases are strong oxidants (7Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). Similar to monofunctional catalases, compound I does not accumulate during H2O2 degradation but can be trapped by using organic peroxides (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this intermediate exhibits only a low reactivity toward H2O2 (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another peculiarity of KatGs regards the spectral features of compound II formed by one-electron reduction of compound I (see Fig. 1, Reaction 3), which in most heme peroxidases is a ferryl species with a red-shifted Soret band and two typical maxima in the visible region (7Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar) and accumulates in the peroxidase cycle (see Fig. 1, Reactions 1, 3, and 4). Both in the absence and in the presence of one-electron donors, an accumulation of a ferryl-like compound II was never observed in wild-type KatGs, suggesting that the spectral features of KatG compound II could be similar to that of the ferric protein (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to other heme peroxidases, KatG compound III does not accumulate even under high concentrations of H2O2. In Mycobacterium KatG, 400 mm H2O2 had to be added to ferric KatG to monitor the formation of compound III spectroscopically, but the observed intermediate was unstable and rapidly decayed to the ferric enzyme (10Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Normally, peroxidase compound III is a ferrous-dioxy/ferric-superoxide complex (similar to oxyhemoglobin or oxymyoglobin) formed by three different routes (7Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar): (a) the oxygenation of ferrous peroxidase (see Fig. 1, Reaction 6); (b) the reaction of ferric enzyme with superoxide anion (see Fig. 1, Reaction 8); and (c) the reaction of (ferryl)-compound II with excess hydrogen peroxide (see Fig. 1, Reaction 11). Recently, the rate of reaction between ferric Mycobacterium KatG and superoxide was determined by pulse radiolysis to be 5.5 × 105m–1 s–1 (11Ghiladi R.A. Cabelli D.E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4772-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the reactivity of ferrous KatG is completely unknown. Neither its reactivity toward dioxygen (see Fig. 1, Reaction 6) nor its two-electron oxidation reaction to compound II mediated by H2O2 (see Fig. 1, Reaction 10) (12Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Lanz M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 312: 292-298Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) nor the transition of compound II to compound III has been investigated so far, although the knowledge of these reactions could help to understand the KatG-specific high catalase activity. This is most obvious when looking at the variants Y249F of Synechocystis KatG (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or Y229F of Mycobacterium KatG (14Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These tyrosines are part of a KatG-specific covalent link at the distal heme side, formed among the side chains of conserved tryptophan, tyrosine and methionine. Most interestingly, disruption of this covalent link by exchange of these tyrosines converted the bifunctional KatGs to typical monofunctional heme peroxidases. The catalase activity was dramatically decreased, the formation of (conventional) compound I could be followed even with equimolar H2O2, and a typical (ferryl-)compound II was formed, which was easily transformed to compound III (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings motivated us to perform the following comparative kinetic investigation of the reaction of ferrous wild-type KatG from Synechocystis, the variant Y249F, and horseradish peroxidase, respectively, with both dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide as well as of the interconversion of compound II to compound III. By using the stopped-flow technique, we were able to calculate the apparent bimolecular rate constants of the transitions ferrous protein → compound III, ferrous protein → compound II, and compound II → compound III and detect significant differences between the three investigated protein species. Materials—Hydrogen peroxide, obtained as a 30% solution from Sigma, was diluted, and the concentration was determined using ϵ240 = 39.4 m–1 cm–1 (15Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Sodium dithionite was from Aldrich and was used either directly or from a freshly prepared anaerobic stock solution. All experiments were performed at 25 °C and 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. All solutions were made anaerobic by flushing with nitrogen gas (oxygen < 3 ppm) and stored in a glove box (Meca-Plex, Neugebauer) with a positive pressure of nitrogen (25 millibars). Recombinant wild-type KatG and the Y249F variant were expressed and purified as described previously (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Sigma (Typ VIA). Ferrous peroxidases were prepared in the glove box by a minimal excess of solid sodium dithionite. The presence of excess dithionite was estimated by its absorbance at 315 nm. Methods—Oxygen concentrations were measured polarographically (YSI 5300 biological oxygen monitoring system) by utilizing a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331 oxygen probe) inserted into a stirred water bath (YSI 5301B) at 25 °C. To achieve a defined oxygen concentration, oxygen-saturated 50 mm phosphate buffer (100% oxygen saturation at 25 °C corresponds to 1262 μm dioxygen (16Chappel J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), giving a final concentration of 631 μm after mixing in the stopped-flow machine) was bubbled with nitrogen for different periods, and the oxygen concentration was measured polarographically. Oxygenated buffer solutions were transported to the stopped-flow device in gas-tight syringes with no gas head space to avoid loss of oxygen or contact with oxygen. The sequential mixing stopped-flow apparatus (Model SX-18MV) and the associated computer system and software were from Applied Photophysics. All reactions were followed by either using a monochromator or using the diode-array detector (Applied Photophysics PD.1) attached to the stopped-flow machine. All tubes of the stopped-flow were flushed several times with a nitrogen-bubbled dithionite solution to remove free oxygen from the system. Final enzyme concentration varied typically between 1 and 3 μm. For measuring the reaction of ferrous KatG and HRP with O2 or H2O2, the conventional stopped-flow mode was used. Compound III formation was followed as absorbance increase at 414 nm (wild-type and Y249F), whereas compound II formation was followed as absorbance decrease at 440 nm (wild-type KatG and Y249F). HRP compound II formation was followed at 418 nm. In a typical experiment, 2–6 μm ferrous peroxidase was mixed with various concentration of H2O2 or O2 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Oxygenated buffer, nitrogen-bubbled hydrogen peroxide solutions (1–200 μm), and preparations of ferrous wild-type KatG, Y249F, or HRP were transported to the stopped-flow device in gas-tight syringes. The H2O2-mediated transition of compound II to compound III was either monitored in the H2O2-mediated reaction sequence ferrous peroxidase → compound II → compound III (in the case of wild-type KatG) by using the conventional mode and the diode array detector or monitored in the sequential stopped-flow mode by preforming compound II (in the case of Y249F and HRP) and following its reaction with H2O2 as absorbance increases at 414 nm. In a typical experiment, Y249F was mixed with equimolar H2O2, and finally, after a delay time of 7 s, with hydrogen peroxide. The final concentrations and conditions are as follows: 1 μm Y249F, 10–150 μm H2O2, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 25 °C. All reactions were also analyzed by using the Pro-K simulation program from Applied Photophysics. Time traces were fitted using the single-exponential equation of the Applied Photophysics software, and from the slopes of the linear plots of the kobs values versus substrate concentration, the apparent second-order rate constants were obtained. Reaction of Ferrous Wild-type KatG and the Y249F Variant with Dioxygen—Even in the presence of a high excess of hydrogen peroxide, it is not possible to monitor spectroscopically the formation of compound III (oxyferrous peroxidase) of Synechocystis wild-type KatG (Fig. 1, Reaction 6). By contrast, only a minor excess (10-fold) of H2O2 led to the formation of compound III in the variant Y249F, as indicated by the appearance of absorption bands at 414, 542, and 576 nm (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To understand these significant differences and eventually to relate them to the dramatic differences in enzymatic properties (Y249F lost the catalase activity), it is necessary to investigate pathways of compound III formation and transition. Thus, the ferrous forms of both wild-type KatG and Y249F were formed and probed for their reactivity with dioxygen. A good spectrum of ferrous Synechocystis wild-type KatG has its peak maxima at 438 nm and in the visible region at 558 nm with a shoulder around 580 nm (Fig. 2A, first spectrum). Ferrous Y249F exhibited similar spectral features (Fig. 3A, first spectrum). The addition of dioxygen to ferrous wild-type KatG resulted in the rapid formation of compound III with absorbance maxima at 414, 548, and 578 nm. Fig. 2A demonstrates the spectral transition with clear isosbestic points at 391, 427, 473, 552, 573, and 590 nm. The reaction was monophasic, and the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined by fitting the absorbance (414 nm) versus time curves to a single exponential function (Fig. 2B). The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants were directly proportional to the initial oxygen concentrations and allowed the determination of the apparent second-order rate constant for oxygen binding (kon) from the slope of the plot (Fig. 2C). With (1.2 ± 0.3) × 105m–1 s–1 (pH 7.0 and 25 °C), the rate constant is about twice as much as that determined for horseradish peroxidase ((5.3 ± 0.4) × 104m–1 s–1 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C) (17Rodriguez-Lopez J. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the koff values are different. In HRP, koff was reported to be <0.1 s–1 (17Rodriguez-Lopez J. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), resulting in KD = koff/kon < 1.9 μm (17Rodriguez-Lopez J. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas koff in the case of wild-type KatG is 10 s–1 (Fig. 2C, intercept), resulting in a KD value of 84 μm. As a consequence of this high dissociation rate constant, the ferrous-dioxy complex is unstable.Fig. 3Reaction of ferrous Y249F with oxygen (compound III formation).A, spectral changes after mixing of 3 μm ferrous Y249F with air-saturated water. Spectra were recorded at 1, 9, 22, 42, and 80 ms (bold line, compound III) after mixing. Conditions were as follows: 3 μm ferrous enzyme; 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; 25 °C.

C, a plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constants versus oxygen concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of dioxygen to ferrous Y249F (absorption bands at 438 and 558 nm) followed similar kinetics. The transition to compound III (absorption bands at 414, 545, and 578 nm) was also monophasic with clear isosbestic points at 391, 427, 472, 550, and 586 nm, respectively (Fig. 3A). The observed first-order rate constants were determined at 414 nm (compound III formation) and at 440 nm (oxidation of the ferrous enzyme) and plotted against the concentration of oxygen, yielding an apparent bimolecular rate constant of (1.6 ± 0.2) × 105m–1 s–1 at 414 nm at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (Fig. 3C). Similar to wild-type KatG, the finite intercept of 20 s–1 indicates reversible dioxygen binding. The calculated dissociation constant, KD, is 129 μm at pH 7.0. HRP compound III reverts over a period of minutes to the native ferric state (kdecay = 8.2 × 10–3 s–1) according to Reaction 9 in Fig. 1, and the transition is independent of oxygen concentration (17Rodriguez-Lopez J. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, wild-type KatG compound III is much more unstable. At pH 7.0 the decay rate was determined to be 2.5–3.6 s–1, which is about 350 times higher than that of HRP compound III. By contrast, conversion of Y249F compound III to the ferric state was about 40 times slower (0.07 s–1) than that of wild-type KatG compound III. From these findings, the following conclusion can be drawn. The kinetics of compound III formation by binding of dioxygen to the ferrous proteins as well as the spectral features of compound III are similar in wild-type KatG, Y249F, and HRP. However, there is a significant difference in the stability of the oxyperoxidases. In HRP, compound III is very stable; it neither decays to ferric HRP-releasing superoxide (kdecay = 8.2 × 10–3 s–1) (Fig. 1, Reaction 9) nor dissociates to ferrous HRP-releasing dioxygen (indicated by the low koff value of 0.1 s–1 (17Rodriguez-Lopez J. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, Reaction 7)) at reasonable rates. By contrast, KatG compound III is very unstable, and both pathways are more than 2 orders of magnitude faster (koff of 10 s–1 and kdecay of 2.5–3.6 s–1). In Y249F, the kinetics of Reactions 6 and 7 are similar to wild-type KatG, but the rate of Reaction 9 is significant slower (kdecay = 0.07 s–1). The exchange of Y249 prevents the formation of the KatG-typical covalent adduct (18Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) but only slightly affects the binding and dissociation of fluoride (19Santoni E. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 792-5802Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and dioxygen to the ferric protein. However, it decelerates compound III decay via Reaction 9 (Fig. 1). Reaction of Ferrous HRP, Wild-type KatG, and the Y249F Variant with Hydrogen Peroxide—The high dissociation rate constant of the ferrous-dioxy complex of KatG implies the presence of ferrous KatG in steady state. Besides binding dioxygen, a ferrous heme peroxidase can also mediate the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide, forming water and compound II (Fig. 1, Reaction 10) (20Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The spectral transitions observed upon reaction of ferrous HRP or the KatG variant Y249F with hydrogen peroxide were very similar. Fig. 4 shows the formation of a typical oxyferryl compound II after mixing 2 μm ferrous Y249F with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide. In the Soret region, a clear isosbestic point was at 425 nm. Compound II was built within 90 ms (Fig. 4B), but it was very unstable and transformed to compound III. Y249F compound II exhibited absorbance maxima at 418, 530, and 558 nm, exactly the same that were observed when Y249F was incubated with a very small excess of H2O2 (<10 μm) (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Due to the instability of Y249F, the reaction was biphasic with about 90% of the changes in absorbance corresponding to the first and faster phase, i.e. the conversion of ferrous Y249F to compound II. By using a single-exponential equation (Fig. 4B) and plotting the pseudo-first-order rate constants versus the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4C), an apparent second-order rate constant of (2.4 ± 0.3) × 105m–1 s–1 (pH 7.0, 25 °C) was calculated. The finite intercept of 2.5 s–1 underlines that compound II is unstable and is subjected to a further redox transition mediated by H2O2. Both the spectral transition and the kinetics of the two-electron oxidation of HRP with H2O2 are very similar (not shown). The calculated apparent bimolecular rate constant was determined to be (1.1 ± 0.2) × 105m–1 s–1 (pH 7.0, 25 °C) with an intercept of 0.3 s–1. These findings underline the high similarity between the KatG variant Y249F and HRP. Not only are the kinetics of compound I and compound II formation and the UV-Vis spectra nearly identical, but in addition, reduction of both redox intermediates with ascorbate and tyrosine follow the same kinetics (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), apart from the most important fact that the catalatic activity of both enzymes is negligible. Completely different is the H2O2-mediated oxidation of wild-type ferrous KatG. In contrast to the Y249F, no ferryl-type compound II is formed. This fits well with previous observations that wild-type KatG compound II exhibits spectral features similar to ferric KatG (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the spectral changes obtained in the reaction of 3 μm ferrous wild-type KatG with 50 μm hydrogen peroxide. The reaction again exhibited a clear isosbestic point at 421 nm. The bold spectrum depicts a spectrum similar (but not identical) to the ferric enzyme in the Soret region (408 nm) but not at higher wavelength (bands at 540 and 580 nm), indicating that some portion of the protein was already in the compound III state. The bold spectrum was selected 880 ms after mixing ferrous wild-type KatG with H2O2. It finally converted to the spectrum of the ferric state (data not shown). The reaction of ferrous wild-type KatG with H2O2 was biphasic with the first and faster phase responsible for about 80–90% of the decrease in absorption at 440 nm (Fig. 5B). By fitting the first phase using a single-exponential equation (Fig. 5B) and plotting the kobs against hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 5C), an apparent bimolecular rate constant of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 105m–1 s–1 was calculated. Although this rate corresponds to that of both the Y249F variant and HRP, the spectral transition is completely different. Neither a ferryl-type compound II spectrum nor a pure protein radical compound II spectrum, which should exhibit spectral features similar to ferric KatG (Fig. 5A), could be monitored. It is evident that it transforms to the compound III spectrum very fast. This can be inferred by inspection of Fig. 5D, which shows the reaction of ferrous wild-type KatG with a higher excess of hydrogen peroxide (3 μm enzyme and 300 μm H2O2). Within 40 ms, an intermediate appeared with spectral features representative of a mixture of at least two redox intermediates with compound III dominating (Fig. 5D, bold line), which, finally, reacted back to the ferric enzyme (broken line) within a few seconds. The H2O2-mediated Conversion of Compound II to Compound III—Both Figs. 4 and 5 already indicate that KatG compound II readily converts to compound III in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The measurements suggested that this transition is much faster in KatGs than in any other plant-type peroxidase. To determine the actual bimolecular rate constant, the sequential stopped-flow mode was used. Fig. 6A shows the direct conversion of Y249F compound II to compound III. The fast reaction was monophasic (Fig. 6B), and the bimolecular rate constant was (1.2 ± 0.2) × 104m–1 s–1 at pH 7.0, which is much higher than that reported for other heme peroxidases like HRP (20 m–1 s–1 (21Adediran S.A. Lambeir A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), lignin peroxidase (70 m–1 s–1 (22Cai D. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11149-11155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), or myeloperoxidase (78 m–1 s–1 (20Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), respectively. The elucidation of the kinetics of the reaction of ferrous wild-type KatG with H2O2 faced several problems. Only with low concentrations of H2O2 (<50 μm) could a shift in the Soret region from 438 to 408 nm be observed, whereas at higher concentrations, the spectral features of compound III began to dominate within milliseconds (compare Fig. 5, A and D), suggesting that the reaction sequence is also ferrous wild-type KatG → compound II → compound III. The slowest rate in this transition was estimated to be ≈2.0 × 105m–1 s–1. With respect to the spectral features of compound II, this investigation underlined that significant differences exist between wild-type KatG and Y249F, the latter corresponding to a typical ferryl-type (low spin) compound II like in HRP, whereas the spectral features of wild-type compound II suggests the presence of a high spin compound II (ferric protein plus protein radical). It has to be noted that the unexpected high rate of compound II to compound III conversion was very similar to the rate reported for the H2O2-mediated transition of compound II to compound III of the monofunctional bovine liver catalase (6.1 × 104m–1 s–1) (23Lardinois O.M. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 251-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Relevance for Catalase Activity and Proposal of the Catalatic Mechanism—In monofunctional catalases, the catalatic pathway is thought to include Reactions 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Depending on experimental conditions, inactivation of catalase activity of monofunctional catalases is assumed to occur due either to accumulation of a (ferryl-like) compound II (“slow” inhibition) or to formation of compound III (“rapid” inhibition) at higher peroxide concentrations. The catalatic mechanism of KatG is still under discussion. Assuming a mechanism similar to monofunctional catalases is one working hypothesis; however, many findings hold against it as follows. (i) Wild-type compound I produced with peroxoacetic acid reacts extremely slow with H2O2 as demonstrated by the sequential stopped-flow technique (8Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). (ii) In wild-type Synechocystis catalase-peroxidase, the chemical nature of the intermediate referred to as conventional compound I was shown to be the superposition of the oxoferryl porphyrin π -cation radical, the tryptophanyl radical, and the tyrosyl radical as demonstrated by our recent multi-frequency EPR spectroscopy study (24Jakopitsch C. Schmuckenschlager F. Wanasinghe A. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Ivancich A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46082-46095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (iii) The observation of redox intermediates with unique features in their room temperature electronic absorption spectrum suggests the existence of alternative electronic structures of compound I (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Jakopitsch C. Schmuckenschlager F.

An alternative mechanism could be very similar to that proposed for the human peroxidases myeloperoxidase (20Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and lactoperoxidase (25Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Neugschwandtner K. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which includes Reactions 6, 10, and 11 in Fig. 1. When compared with KatG, the catalatic activity of myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase is low, but the present study revealed important differences in the rates of the H2O2-mediated oxidation of compound II to compound III. In KatGs, the rate constant for this reaction is 1.2 × 104m–1 s–1 and therefore at least 2 orders of magnitude faster when compared with myeloperoxidase (78 m–1 s–1) (20Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or lactoperoxidase (70 m–1 s–1) (25Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Neugschwandtner K. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another important fact is that wild-type KatG compound III does not accumulate during hydrogen peroxide degradation even upon incubation of the ferric enzyme with high H2O2 concentrations. By contrast, lactoperoxidase and thyroid peroxidase compound III can already be formed by the addition of 200 μm hydrogen peroxide to 1.7 μm ferric enzyme (26Kohler H. Taurog A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and in the KatG variant Y249F, a 10-fold excess of H2O2 already converts compound II to compound III (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the absence of H2O2, we succeeded in forming pure KatG compound III by following the oxygen binding to ferrous KatG and could demonstrate that the spectral features of wild-type KatG, Y249F, and HRP compound III are very similar but that there are substantial differences in the stability of the corresponding dioxygen complexes. Furthermore, the two-electron oxidation of ferrous KatG by H2O2 unequivocally demonstrated significant differences between wild-type KatG and Y249F (or HRP). In wild-type KatG (and in contrast to Y249F and HRP), no oxoferryl-type compound II accumulates in detectable concentrations, which confirmed earlier observations in the reaction between compound I preformed with peroxoacetic acid and one-electron donors (9Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Ruker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which suggested that KatG compound II could be a protein radical species with spectral features similar to ferric KatG. The present data also suggest that in wild-type KatG, oxoferryl (compounds I and II) and dioxygen adducts (compound III) are destabilized when compared with Y249F and HRP. One significant structural difference between wild-type KatG and Y249F is that in the variant, the KatG-specific covalent adduct (which includes Tyr-249, Met-275, and Trp-122) at the distal heme side is absent (18Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We now know three striking consequences; the catalase activity in Y249F is lost (whereas the peroxidase activity is unaffected), and in the presence of H2O2, an oxoferryl-type compound II is formed and easily converts to compound III (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Jakopitsch C. Schmuckenschlager F.

By contrast, in the presence of the covalent link, the catalase activity is high, and neither an oxoferryl-type compound I nor II accumulates, nor does compound III. Based on these data, we propose the following mechanism that has the stoichiometry of a classical catalatic activity (2 H2O2 → O2 + 2 H2O).R-PorFeIII+H2O2→H2O+R-+⋅PorFeIV=O→+⋅R-PorFeIV=O REACTION I +⋅R-PorFeIV=O+H2O2→H2O+[+⋅R-PorFeIII-O2⋅−↔+⋅R-PorFeII-O2] REACTION II [+⋅R-PorFeIII−O2⋅−↔+⋅R-PorFeII-O2]→R-PorFeIII+O2REACTION III In the first reaction, the ferric enzyme is oxidized to compound I, thereby reducing H2O2 to water. Recent EPR experiments have shown the contribution of three different oxoferryl species obtained by reaction of wild-type KatG with peroxoacetic acid, namely an exchange-coupled porphyrin radical, a tryptophanyl, and a tyrosyl radical (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Jakopitsch C. Schmuckenschlager F.

Upon using H2O2 in enzyme oxidation, neither the accumulation of the classical compound I (porphyrin radical-type, which typically shows a hypochromicity in the Soret peak) nor the accumulation of a protein radical species (which should exhibit an oxoferryl-type compound II spectrum like in cytochrome c peroxidase (27Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar)) could be ever observed spectroscopically (in contrast to Y249F). This suggests a rapid conversion of compound I by the second hydrogen peroxide molecule. Based on previous findings that wild-type compound I, which accumulates with peroxoacetic acid and exhibits a 40–50% hypochromicity in the Soret region, reacts only very slowly with H2O2, we proposed that the protein radical form has a higher reactivity toward H2O2 (24Jakopitsch C. Schmuckenschlager F. Wanasinghe A. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Ivancich A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46082-46095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the reaction of this species with H2O2 would be similar to that of an oxyferryl compound II with H2O2, namely displacement of the ferryl oxygen by both oxygen atoms deriving from hydrogen peroxide as has been demonstrated for the compound II to compound III conversion of lactoperoxidase by isotopic labeling (28Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7189-7194Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The present study has demonstrated that this reaction is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster in KatGs (kapp of 1.2 × 104m–1 s–1) when compared with other heme peroxidases (e.g. HRP 20 m–1 s–1 (21Adediran S.A. Lambeir A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or myeloperoxidase 78 m–1 s–1 (20Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). The reaction product would be a ferrous-dioxy/ferric-superoxide complex containing a protein radical site when H2O2 reacts with the protein radical/oxoferryl-type compound I instead of oxoferryl-type compound II. Storing a one-oxidation equivalent could guarantee that (i) finally dioxygen and not superoxide is released when ferric KatG is formed and (ii) that the dioxygen adduct is much more unstable when compared with the typical oxymyoglobin-like compound III. As a consequence, this species does not accumulate, and the enzyme cycles rapidly. In this mechanism, the dioxygen species is attached to the heme iron before being released, which is in contrast to the proposed catalatic mechanism of monofunctional catalases (5Nicholls P. Fita I. Loewen P. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 51-106Crossref Google Scholar). Although this proposed mechanism is very speculative at the moment, it is based on significant differences between wild-type KatG and Y249F (or HRP) presented in this work. It provides a basis for further investigations that will help to understand the extraordinary bifunctional activity of catalase-peroxidases."
https://openalex.org/W2045951959,"Sprouty proteins are evolutionarily conserved negative feedback regulators of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. Mammalian versions of these proteins differentially regulate signaling induced by the fibroblast and the epidermal growth factors (FGF and EGF, respectively). Herein we show that, although both growth factors elevate expression of Sprouty-2, FGF- and not EGF-induced activation of the Erk/MAPK pathway is inhibited by Sprouty-2. Attenuation of FGF-signaling is accompanied by the induction of Sprouty-2 phosphorylation on the amino-terminal as well as carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues, which are less effectively modified upon EGF treatment. Mutagenesis of carboxyl-terminal tyrosines, especially a newly identified phosphorylation site, tyrosine 227, impaired the inhibitory activity of Sprouty-2. These results attribute a novel role for carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues and yet unidentified phosphotyrosine-binding proteins in the differential regulation of Sprouty-2 activity."

In most eukaryotes, telomeric DNA consists of tandem arrays of short repetitive sequences, with a guanine-rich strand running 5′ to 3′ toward the chromosome end.

These 3′-overhangs are an important feature of telomere structure because they constitute the substrate for telomerase and provide the binding sites for specialized G strand-binding proteins.

The first TEBP to be characterized was isolated from the hypotrichous ciliate Oxytricha nova (9Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6056-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Structural analysis revealed the presence of three oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding folds (OB-folds) in the α subunit and one in the β subunit (17Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Telomeric DNA is deeply embedded in a cleft between the α and β subunits, explaining the high affinity and efficient protection of the DNA 3′ terminus within the complex. The α subunit can also homodimerize and may mediate telomere-telomere associations by forming a complex with two chromosome ends (10Gray J.T. Celander D.W. Price C.M. Cech T.R.

In S. cerevisiae, genetic studies revealed the critical role of Cdc13 in chromosome end protection (12Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell.

Further studies demonstrated that Cdc13 plays multiple roles in the protection of telomeres as well as in the regulated recruitment of telomerase and the coordinated synthesis of G-rich and C-rich strands (13Nugent C.I.

Like ciliate TEBPs, purified Cdc13 binds to G-rich telomeric DNA with high affinity (13Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V.

Although Cdc13 shares no apparent sequence similarity with the ciliate proteins, the NMR structure of the Cdc13 DNA binding domain revealed the presence of an OB-fold that is structurally similar to the amino-terminal OB-fold of the TEBP α subunit (26Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarity with the amino-terminal OB-fold of ciliate TEBPs is also observed in Pot1 proteins (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of fission yeast, human, and chicken Pot1 demonstrated that they bind to the cognate G strand of telomeric DNA and play a critical role in telomere length regulation and end protection (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 27Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 28Colgin L.M.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2091-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deletion of the fission yeast pot1+ gene results in rapid loss of telomeric and subtelomeric DNA, chromosome end fusions, and segregation defects (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Most cells die as a consequence of this chromosomal instability. However, in a subset of cells, random fusion of chromosome ends results in the circularization of all three chromosomes. Cells with circular chromosomes divide readily and form survivor strains, which subsequently lack a requirement for factors involved in chromosome end maintenance (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 30Naito T. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Nakamura T.M. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science. 1998; 282: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in binding to the 3′-overhang at the ends of telomeres in vivo, Pot1 binds to the G-rich strand of fission yeast telomeric DNA but not to the C-rich strand or double-stranded telomeric DNA (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain has been mapped to include the 185 amino-terminal residues of Pot1. This fragment, here referred to as Pot1N, retains the binding specificity of the full-length protein, and the high resolution crystal structure of Pot1N in complex with DNA has been solved (32Lei M. Podell E.R. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Nature. 2003; 426: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the DNA in the complex adopts a folded conformation involving base stacking and two unusual G-T bp. Any sequence change in the DNA prevents this structure from forming, providing an explanation for the high sequence specificity in DNA binding. Here we describe the purification of full-length Pot1 protein and characterize its interactions with a variety of DNA sequences based on the analysis of 100 cloned telomeres. A comparison between full-length Pot1 and Pot1N revealed that protein sequences beyond the NH2-terminal 185 amino acids present in Pot1N contribute to DNA binding by the naturally occurring Pot1 protein. These additional DNA contacts increase the half-life of the protein·DNA complex considerably and explain why Pot1N is a poor competitor for chromosome ends in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that the high cooperativity and sequence specificity observed with Pot1N are relaxed in the context of the full-length protein. These differences are likely to impact on telomerase regulation as well as the distinction between chromosome ends and DNA double-stranded breaks. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pot1—The full-length Pot1 cDNA was cloned downstream of a 6-histidine affinity tag and 3C protease cleavage site to generate plasmid pPB460. pPB460 was transformed into Rosetta-Gami (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells (Novagen) and plated onto Luria Broth plus 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol agar plates. Several colonies were selected to inoculate 10 ml of tryptone phosphate medium (20 g of tryptone, 15 g of yeast extract, 8 g of NaCl, 2 g of Na2HPO4, 1 g of KH2PO4, and 2 g of dextrose/liter) plus carbenicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C for 6 h before expanding to a 250-ml culture. The following day, cells were diluted 1:50 into 10 liters and grown to a density of OD550 = 0.4, at which time the temperature was reduced to 16 °C. After 30 min, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a 0.5 mm final concentration, and cells were harvested 12 h later. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 volume of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture, consisting of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, chymostatin, bestatin, and aprotinin (3.6 trypsin inhibitory units/mg). Suspended pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. For each round of purification, cell pellets from 40 liters of culture (∼360 g) were thawed in an ice/water bath and supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 to aid in lysis. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, stirring occasionally until very viscous, at which time the cells were supplemented with KCl to 300 mm and sonicated 10 times for 30 s. The lysed material was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% saturation). The precipitate was collected at 25,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was dissolved in 150 ml of TB1 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm imidazole, 0.25% Tween 20, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with 200 mm KCl and protease inhibitors. Proteins were bound in batch to a 7-ml packed volume of washed and equilibrated Talon (BD Biosciences) metal affinity resin at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times in 20 ml of TB1 buffer plus 800 mm KCl and twice in TB1 buffer plus 100 mm KCl. Bound proteins were eluted in TB1 buffer plus 100 mm KCl and 100 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were combined (∼50 ml) and bound in batch to a 3-ml packed volume of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed four times with 10 ml of TB2 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25% Tween 20, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) plus 100 mm KCl. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined and bound in batch to a 3-ml packed volume of Affi-Blue-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with 10 ml of TB2 buffer plus 200 mm KCl. Bound protein was eluted with 7 ml of TB2 buffer plus 1 m KCl. The peak fractions were pooled (∼5 ml) and concentrated on 250 μl of Talon resin. The beads were washed in a spin column (BIO 101, Inc.) and eluted with 300 mm imidazole in TB2 buffer plus 1 m KCl. The peak fraction (∼0.5 ml) was loaded onto a 24-ml Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TB3 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fractions containing full-length Pot1 but not its degradation products were identified by SDS-PAGE, flash frozen in small aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Pot1N was purified from 1 liter of culture using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) resin. Cloning of Telomere Sequences—Oligonucleotides PBoli548 (CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTAGGA) and PBoli550 (TACGACTCACTATAGGGTAACC), 5 pmol each, were annealed in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 by heating to 95 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. To attach PBoli548 to the 3′-end of telomeres covalently, 1 μg of S. pombe genomic DNA and 0.5 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides were combined in a 20-μl reaction containing 100 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and the manufacturer's supplied buffer at 16 °C for 16 h. Telomeres ligated to PBoli548 were amplified by PCR with PBoli434 (GTGTGGAATTGAGTATGGTGA), PBoli550, and Taq Plus Long polymerase mix (Stratagene). PCR products were gel purified and cloned into pCR4blunt-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen) for sequence analysis. DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotide substrates were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, oligonucleotide substrates were purified by PAGE and 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by gel filtration on a G25 spin column (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Electromobility Shift Assays—Unless otherwise indicated, protein-oligonucleotide binding reactions were performed in TEA buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 40 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, and 5 mm magnesium chloride) on ice for 15 min. Oligonucleotide substrates (250 nm) were bound by the indicated amounts of protein, and 6 × loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added just prior to loading onto Tris borate 4–20% gradient gels, run at 4 °C at 160 V for 80 min. Gels were dried onto DE81 (Whatman) paper and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Competition Experiments—Binding reactions were performed as described earlier. In a chase experiment, a portion of the binding reaction (3 μl) was removed and placed in an Eppendorf tube containing cold competitor DNA at the indicated molar excess of telomeric repeats. For the competitor-free control, an equivalent volume of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) was substituted for the competitor DNA. The samples were incubated in the presence of competitor for the indicated times and analyzed as described above. Exonuclease Protection Assays—DNA substrates (100 nm) were incubated in 10-μl reactions with 280 nm Pot1 or 5.6 μm Pot1N in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 at 20 °C for 15 min. In control reactions, Pot1 was replaced with the equivalent volume of Pot1 storage buffer. Each reaction was divided in half, and 5 μl was loaded onto 4–20% Tris borate gels to verify DNA binding as described above. The other half of the reaction was mixed with 10 units of E. coli exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 20 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of 1/5 volume stop buffer A (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m EDTA, 25 mg/ml SDS, and 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 8 μl of loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue (w/v), 0.05% xylene cyanol (w/v) in formamide). A 4-μl aliquot was applied to a 10% polyacrylamide and 8 m urea sequencing gel and electrophoresed in 1 × Tris borate/EDTA at 80 W for 80 min. The gel was dried at 80 °C and exposed overnight to a phosphorimaging screen. As a control for recovery and loading, a 63-mer oligonucleotide was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and ∼200 cpm was added to each reaction prior to phenol/chloroform extraction. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pot1 Protein— Pot1 and Pot1N were expressed in E. coli, and soluble extracts of several clones were analyzed for expression by Western blotting. Differences in expression levels among clones were found to be negligible (data not shown), and a number of colonies were pooled for large scale inductions. Extracts derived from ∼360 g of cell pellet (40 liters of culture) were fractionated by a combination of affinity and classical chromatography, including Talon metal affinity, Q-Sepharose, and Affi-Blue (Fig. 1, A and B). Difficulty arose in separating the highly labile Pot1 protein from the products of proteolysis which occurred during the initial steps of purification. These Pot1 fragments were strikingly similar in their chromatographic behavior on a variety of resins but were successfully separated from full-length Pot1 by gel filtration (Fig. 1C). Fractions 12 and 13 were used in the binding experiments presented here. From 40 liters of bacterial culture, ∼400 μg of purified Pot1 protein was obtained (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Pot1N was expressed at much higher levels, and essentially homogeneous protein was obtained after only two chromatographic steps on nickel affinity and Q-Sepharose resin (Fig. 1D, lane 3). The yield was ∼50 mg/liter of culture and hence 5,000-fold higher than for Pot1. Pot1 Has an Extended DNA Binding Site—The minimal binding site for Pot1N has been determined by filter binding assay as GGTTAC (33Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will refer to the GGTTAC motif as Tel, followed by single letter abbreviations for additional nucleotides present in certain DNA substrates. A stable complex between the Tel hexamer and Pot1N could only be visualized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay when the protein was present in large excess (supplemental Fig. 1, I). When the protein:DNA ratio was below 10:1, a smear or no shift at all was observed, presumably because of the dissociation of complexes during electrophoresis. Single nucleotide permutations of the Tel sequence in either direction significantly reduced Pot1N binding, in accord with the high sequence specificity of Pot1N (Ref. 33Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. 1, II and VI). A stable Pot1N ·DNA complex was also observed with a TelA substrate, a sequence motif that commonly occurs in fission yeast telomeres (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The stability of the Pot1N·DNA complex diminished as further nucleotides, corresponding to part of an additional telomeric repeat, were added to the 3′-end (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–12). These observations are in agreement with previous data, where nontelomeric 3′-extensions also had a deleterious effect on Pot1N binding (33Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used here, full-length Pot1 also forms a complex with the GGTTACA substrate, which partially dissociates during electrophoresis, as suggested by a smeary band shift (Fig. 2B, lane 2). However, unlike Pot1N, single nucleotide additions to the 3′-end increased Pot1 ·DNA complex stability (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). These results suggest that in addition to the DNA contacts described for the OB-fold in Pot1N (32Lei M. Podell E.R. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Nature. 2003; 426: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), additional contacts contribute to DNA binding in the context of the full-length protein. Indeed, a set of sensitive probabilistic methods of data base search and structure prediction identified the presence of a second OB-fold immediately downstream of OB-1. 2A. Mushegian and P. Baumann, unpublished data. The presence of tandem OB-folds has recently also been demonstrated by x-ray crystallography for human Pot1 (34Lei M. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To characterize the additional protein-DNA contacts, we generated a number of oligonucleotide substrates composed of two tandem heptameric repeats with mutations in either the first or the second repeat. The mutations within each repeat were chosen to eliminate binding by Pot1N. We found that binding of full-length Pot1 to these DNA substrates was highly dependent on the integrity of the first heptameric repeat (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Consistent with the first OB-fold binding the first GGTTACA motif in the same manner as observed with Pot1N, single nucleotide changes of G2 to C or T3 to A dramatically reduced Pot1 binding (lanes 4 and 8). In contrast, the same mutations in the second repeat had little effect on complex stability (lanes 6 and 10). Taken together our data suggest that full-length Pot1 has an extended DNA binding site compared with Pot1N. Sequence specificity largely depends on the contacts made by the amino-terminal OB-fold. A predicted second OB-fold stabilizes the Pot1 ·DNA complex and extends the binding site toward the 3′-end. Sequence Analysis of Fission Yeast Telomeres—We speculated that the relaxed sequence specificity in the second DNA binding domain may allow the protein to bind and protect different naturally occurring telomeric sequences. Although previous analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity surrounding each GGTTAC core motif, this conclusion was largely based on only five cloned chromosome ends (3.Sugawara, N. F. (1988) Ph.D. thesis, DNA Sequences at the Telomeres of the Fission Yeast S. pombe, Harvard University, Cambridge, MAGoogle Scholar). In addition, the procedure used to generate these clones removed the single-stranded 3′-overhang from each telomere and hence did not include the region bound by Pot1. To examine telomeric repeat heterogeneity from a larger data set, we have now cloned and analyzed 100 individual chromosome ends from a culture of S. pombe cells using a method that retains the naturally occurring 3′-overhang. Individual telomere length varied between 70 and 354 nucleotides, with a mean length of 188 ± 55 nucleotides. The GGTTAC sequence clearly emerged as the most common motif, occurring a total of 2,196 times or nearly 22 times/telomere. Although 14% of these core hexamers occurred in tandem, the rest are separated by 1–20 nucleotides of spacer sequences (Fig. 3A). Although longer spacers were sporadically encountered, 84% of GGTTAC repeats are separated by 0–3 nucleotides. The average spacer length for all repeats is 2.3 nucleotides. Two intervening sequences (GT and AA) are present once in each telomere, localizing to the proximal and largely invariable region. By far the most common sequences separating two core hexamers are a single adenine (29%) and adenine followed by a variable number of guanines (31%; Fig. 3B). Indeed, 81% of all core hexamers were followed by an adenine (Fig. 3C), making direct heptameric GGTTACA repeats almost twice as common as tandem GGTTAC motifs. Guanines were the most common nucleotide encountered in the second to fourth positions between repeats (Fig. 3C). Spacer sequences and length were very similar between the eight most distal and internal repeats, suggesting that heterogeneity arises as telomeres are synthesized by telomerase (data not shown). The GGTTAC core motif is unusual among telomeric repeats, in that it only contains two consecutive guanines as opposed to three or more found in the telomeric repeats of most other species. Our analysis of 2,196 GGTTAC repeats revealed that spacer sequences add additional guanines to 31% of the core hexamers (Fig. 3D). This form of repeat heterogeneity may be particularly important because the major telomere-binding protein in fission yeast, Taz1, requires three consecutive guanines for stable binding (35Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). 3J. Cooper, personal communication. Cooperativity in Binding to Longer Oligonucleotide Substrates—Based on the observations described above, a variety of oligonucleotide substrates were synthesized and analyzed for binding by Pot1 and Pot1N in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. A DNA substrate consisting of four perfect GGTTAC repeats is referred to as (Tel)4, whereas three consecutive GGTTACAC repeats are abbreviated as (TelAC)3. Longer naturally occurring sequences with variable spacer sequence are listed as TelN followed by the number of core repeat units. The actual sequences for these DNA substrates are listed in the respective figure legends. To explore the possibility that spacer sequences between GGTTAC repeats affect binding, we compared two DNA substrates of identical length, (Te"

Intense research efforts in the past have established that TFIID promoter-binding activity as well as the function of TFIID-promoter complexes is tightly regulated through dynamic TFIID interactions with positive- and negative-acting transcription regulatory proteins. However, very little is known about the role of post-translational modifications in the regulation of TFIID. Here we show that the human TFIID subunits hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 are modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 in vitro and in human cells. We identify Lys-14 in hsTAF5 and Lys-19 in hsTAF12 as the primary SUMO-1 acceptor sites and show that SUMO conjugation has no detectable effect on nuclear import or intranuclear distribution of hsTAF5 and hsTAF12. Finally, we demonstrate that purified human TFIID complex can be SUMO-1-modified in vitro at both hsTAF5 and hsTAF12. We find that SUMO-1 conjugation at hsTAF5 interferes with binding of TFIID to promoter DNA, whereas modification of hsTAF12 has no detectable effect on TFIID promoter-binding activity. Our observations suggest that reversible SUMO modification at hsTAF5 contributes to the dynamic regulation of TFIID promoter-binding activity in human cells.

The initial, and rate-limiting, step for PIC assembly is binding of TFIID, a multiprotein complex composed of the TATA-binding protein TBP and at least 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), to core promoter sequence elements (1Roeder R.G.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to sequence-specific DNA binding, the TFIID complex provides several enzymatic activities that all reside in its largest subunit TAF1 (6Wassarman D.A. Sauer F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include histone acetyltransferase activity (7Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), protein kinase activity (8Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin-activating/-conjugating activity (9Pham A.-D. Sauer F. Science. 2000; 289: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). How exactly TFIID enzymatic activities contribute to RNAP II transcription is still unknown. In accordance with its crucial role in PIC assembly, TFIID is considered one of the key targets of transcription regulation pathways. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown that TFIID binding to promoters as well as the stability and functionality of TFIID-promoter complexes are subject to regulation by gene-specific activators and repressors (10Hoffmann A. Oelgeschläger T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and by an array of ubiquitous regulators of TFIID (TBP) activity, including NC2 (Dr1/DRAP1), Mot1/BTAF1, and the NOT complex (11Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Pugh B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Lee T.I.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, TFIID subunits are subject to post-transcriptional modifications. Earliest studies demonstrated that several subunits of TFIID are phosphorylated during mitosis and that TFIID isolated from mitotic cells fails to respond to transcription activators in vitro (15Segil N. Guermah M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Results of more recent studies demonstrated gene-specific effects upon hsTAF10 methylation by the SET9 protein methyltransferase (16Kouskouti A. Scheer E. Staub A. Tora L. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and that the C-terminal domain of TAF1 is a substrate for the protein kinase CKII (17Sawa C. Nedea E. Krogan N. Wada T. Handa H. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4734-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Exactly how and to what extent these TAF modifications modulate TFIID functions is not known. In recent years, regulation of transcription factor activity through modification with SUMO proteins has attracted considerable attention (18Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 19Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 20Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). SUMO proteins are small ubiquitin-related modifiers that are conjugated to target proteins through an enzymatic pathway, which is similar to ubiquitylation, but which involves a distinct set of enzymes (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 23Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Like ubiquitin, SUMO proteins are expressed as inactive precursors that have to be processed by SUMO-specific proteases to expose a C-terminal double-glycine motif required for conjugation. The processed form of SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent reaction in which a thioester bond is formed between its C-terminal glycine residue and a cysteine residue in the activating E1 enzyme (SAE1/2). Following transfer to a conjugating E2 enzyme (Ubc9), SUMO is covalently attached to a target protein lysine residue via isopeptide bond formation. Whereas SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes are sufficient to modify target proteins in vitro (23Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), several SUMO E3 ligases have been described that enhance transfer of SUMO from the E2 enzyme to specific substrates (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Importantly, SUMO modification is a reversible and dynamic process, and SUMO conjugates can be removed from substrate proteins by SUMO-specific proteases (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). SUMO modification occurs in many cases, but not exclusively, within a consensus motif ΨKXE, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid residue and X is any amino acid residue (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Here we investigated SUMO-1 modification of several TFIID subunits containing the ΨKXE motif. We show that hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 are SUMO-1-modified in human cells. We further show that recombinant hsTAF1, hsTAF5, hsTAF12, and hsTBP can be SUMO-1-modified using a minimal SUMO conjugation system composed of recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes and SUMO-1. TAF5 and TAF12 can also be efficiently sumoylated in purified TFIID complex, whereas SUMO acceptor sites in TAF1 and TBP appear to become inaccessible upon assembly into TFIID. We identified the principal SUMO-1 acceptor sites in hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 and show that SUMO modification does not affect nuclear import or the global nuclear distribution of hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 in human cells. Finally, we present results of in vitro DNA binding experiments showing that SUMO modification of purified human TFIID at hsTAF5 inhibits TFIID DNA-binding activity. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa-6His:Myc: SUMO-1 cells (25Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Peter O'Hare (Marie Curie Research Institute, Oxted, UK) and were grown in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin to select for 6His:Myc:SUMO-1 expression. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for hsTAF5, hsTAF6, hsTAF9, hsTAF12, and hsTBP were a kind gift of R. G. Roeder (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal part of VP22 (AGV31) has been described previously (26Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies for the HA:epitope tag (F7), hsTAF1 and hsSUMO-1, as well as rabbit polyclonal antibody for the 6His:epitope tag were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmids—pTOG5TdT(–41TATA/+33) contains five binding sites for the yeast activator GAL4 in front of a murine TdT core promoter variant with a consensus TATA box inserted 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site and was obtained by inserting the HindIII/BamHI fragment from pG5TdT(–41TATA/+33) (27Martinez E. Zhou Q. L'Etoile N.D. Oelgeschläger T. Berk A.J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids pcDNA5-(HA)3:SUMO1-hsTAF5(Δ1–13) and pcDNA5-(HA)3:SUMO1-hsTAF12(Δ1–18) were used to express in human cells (HA)3:epitope-tagged versions of the mature form of hsSUMO-1 (aa 1–97) fused to the N terminus of either hsTAF5 lacking the first 13 amino acids (Δ1–13) or hsTAF12 lacking the first 18 amino acids (Δ1–18), respectively. To prevent cleavage of the SUMO-1 moiety from the fusion proteins by SUMO-specific proteases, residue Gly-97 in the C-terminal double-glycine motif of the mature form of SUMO-1 was mutated to alanine (G97A). pET11d-6His:Myc:hsSUMO-1-(1–97) was used for expression of 6His:Myc:epitope-tagged mature form of SUMO-1 (aa 1–97) in Escherichia coli. To construct pET11d-6His:Myc:hsSUMO-1-(1–97), the cDNA for 6His:Myc:SUMO-1 (aa 1–97) was amplified from pcDNA3-Myc-SUMO-1 (25Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and inserted into pET11d (Novagen) using NcoI and ClaI restriction sites. Bacterial expression vectors for 6His: TBP and 6His:TAF12, 20-kDa and 15-kDa variants, were obtained from Robert G. Roeder (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Infection of HeLa and HeLa-6His:Myc:SUMO-1 Cells with HSV-1— HeLa or HeLa-6His:Myc:SUMO-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and infected the following day with wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn+ in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units per cell. The virus inoculum was allowed to adsorb to cells for 1 h at 37 °C, then replaced with fresh medium, and the infected cells were further incubated at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in SDS loading buffer containing 25 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) 17 h post infection and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cold Shock Treatment of Hela-6His:Myc:SUMO-1 Cells—6His:Myc: SUMO-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. The following day, cells were subjected to 4 °C for 10 min. After further incubation at 37 °C for 5 h cells were lysed in SDS loading buffer containing 25 mm NEM and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Transient Transfection—Transient transfections were performed using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Typically, transfections were performed in 10-cm tissue culture plates with 2 × 106 cells and 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Enrichment of SUMO-1-conjugated Proteins from Human Cell Lysates— Cells were lysed by 10-min incubation at 85 °C in 1 ml of preheated radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.2% protease inhibitor mix P-8340 (Sigma), and 25 mm NEM. After centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C, cleared lysates were incubated for 6 h at 4°C either with 100 μl (50% slurry in lysis buffer) of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) to enrich proteins conjugated to 6His:Myc:SUMO-1, or with 100 μl (50% slurry in lysis buffer) of anti-FLAG antibody resin (M2-agarose, Sigma) to enrich transiently expressed FLAG:epitope-tagged proteins. After binding, the resins were rinsed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NEM, and, in the case of Ni-NTA resin, 10 mm imidazole, and eluted with 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with either 250 mm imidazole (Ni-NTA resin) or 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide (M2-agarose, Sigma). 25-μl aliquots of the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast NuPAGE SDS gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using an XCell II™ blot module (Invitrogen). Membranes were washed in H2O for 10 min, stained with Aurodye Forte (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, blocked with 5% dried nonfat milk in TBS-T20 (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min in TBS-T20 and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed again three times for 10 min in TBS-T20 and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.43 mm Na2HPO4, 0.14 mm KH2PO4, 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl) for 10 min, washed three times for 5 min in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed again three times for 5 min in PBS, and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer), washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and further incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer). Coverslips were washed again three times with PBS and mounted on a slide using Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized using an Axiovert S100TV confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were processed using Metamorph version 4.1.4 (Universal Imaging Corp.) and Photoshop version 7 (Adobe) software. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Protein expression by coupled in vitro transcription/translation was carried out for 90 min at 30 °C in 25, μl reactions containing 0.5 μg of the relevant expression vectors, 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), and either 40 μm cold methionine (Promega) or 15 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences, 1000 Ci/mmol). Recombinant hsSAE1/2, hsUbc9, 6His:TBP, and the 20-kDa and 15-kDa variants of hsTAF12 were expressed and purified as detailed previously (28Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

The 6His:Myc: epitope-tagged mature form of human SUMO-1 (6His:Myc:SUMO-1 (aa 1–97)) was expressed in E. coli BL21codon+ (Stratagene) and purified from bacterial lysates on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FLAG:epitope-tagged TFIID complex (f:TFIID) was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the HeLa 3–10 P11 (Whatman) 0.85 m KCl/DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) 0.3 m KCl TFIID fraction as described before (34Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In Vitro SUMO-1 Conjugation Assay—SUMO-1 conjugation assays were performed either in buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units·ml–1 creatine kinase, 0.6 unit·ml–1 inorganic pyrophosphatase, 2 mm ATP) or in TMDA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP). 20-μl reactions contained 100 ng of purified recombinant hsSAE1/2 (E1), 400 ng of purified recombinant hsUbc9 (E2), 1 μg of purified recombinant human 6His:Myc: SUMO-1-(1–97), and either 100 ng of purified recombinant protein substrate or 5 μl of coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C for 1–2 h as indicated. Preparation of Immobilized Promoter DNA Templates—762-bp linear biotinylated G5TdT(–41TATA/+33) promoter DNA fragments were amplified by PCR from plasmid pTOG5TdT(–41TATA/+33) using a 5′-biotinylated reverse primer. PCR products were purified from agarose gels and immobilized on M-280 streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TFIID DNA Binding Assay—TFIID DNA binding was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 8.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). 50-μl binding reactions contained 10 ng of highly purified recombinant TBP or 200 ng of immunoaffinity-purified FLAG:epitope-tagged TFIID (f:TFIID), and 500 fmol of immobilized promoter template. f:TFIID-promoter complexes were separated from unbound proteins in a magnetic particle separator, washed with 200 μl of transcription buffer without FLAG peptide, and eluted from immobilized template with SDS loading buffer. Proteins present in the combined unbound and wash fractions were quantitatively recovered by binding to 16 μl of StrataClean suspension (Stratagene) for 30 min at 4 °C and elution with SDS loading buffer. In vitro SUMO-1 conjugation of f:TFIID prior to or after DNA binding was carried out in 50-μl reactions as described under “In Vitro SUMO-1 Conjugation Assay.” hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 Are Modified by SUMO-1 in Human Cells—Protein sequence analysis revealed that several human TFIID subunits, including hsTBP, hsTAF1, hsTAF2, hsTAF4, hsTAF5, and hsTAF12, contain the sumoylation target consensus sequence ΨKXE (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We therefore wanted to investigate whether sumoylation of TFIID subunits occurs in human cells. Detection of SUMO-1 conjugates is often difficult, because only a small percentage of cellular SUMO-1 target proteins is modified at any given time (22Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). For this reason, SUMO conjugation is generally investigated in cells that overexpress SUMO proteins, and, as a consequence, contain elevated levels of SUMO-1 conjugates. Detection of SUMO targets is further facilitated by expression of epitope-tagged versions of SUMO proteins, allowing for enrichment of SUMO conjugates from cell lysates by affinity chromatography methods. To investigate SUMO-1 modification of human TFIID subunits, we made use of a human cell line that constitutively expresses elevated levels of 6His:Myc:epitope-tagged human SUMO-1 protein (25Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in the presence of SDS and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to inhibit SUMO-specific proteases, and cell lysates were passed over nickel-charged agarose resin (Ni-NTA-agarose, Qiagen) to enrich proteins conjugated to 6His:Myc:SUMO-1. Analysis of Ni-NTA-bound fractions by immunoblotting using TAF-specific antibodies revealed immunoreactive bands with an apparent molecular weight expected for mono-sumoylated forms of hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 present in HeLa-6His:Myc:SUMO-1 cell lysates, but not in lysates of HeLa control cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3). SUMO-1-modified hsTAF5, but not SUMO-1-modified hsTAF12, could also be detected in whole cell lysates of HeLa-6His:Myc:SUMO-1 cells (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain evidence for SUMO-1 modification of other TFIID subunits with antibodies available to us. Previous studies reported that stress conditions such as heat shock, serum starvation, and infection by viruses affect SUMO-1 conjugation in human cells (25Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate whether sumoylation of TFIID subunits in HeLa-6His:Myc: SUMO-1 is regulated, we examined the sumoylation status of endogenous hsTAF5 protein in response to different stress conditions, including heat shock, cold shock, serum starvation, and virus infection. Heat treatment (1 h at 42 °C) and serum starvation (24 h at 37 °C) had no detectable effect on hsTAF5 sumoylation levels (data not shown). In contrast, cold shock (10 min at 4 °C) and infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) resulted in a dramatic loss of intracellular SUMO-1 conjugates and a corresponding loss of SUMO-1-modified hsTAF5 (Fig. 2B). Importantly, neither cold shock nor HSV-1 infection led to a detectable decrease in the absolute levels of cellular hsTAF5 protein. Thus, the observed loss of SUMO-1-modified hsTAF5 in response to stress can be attributed to either down-regulation of intracellular SUMO-1-activating/-conjugating activity and/or up-regulation of intracellular SUMO isopeptidase activity. In summary, these observations demonstrate that hsTAF5 and hsTAF12 are modified by SUMO-1 in human cells and that TAF SUMO-1 conjugation observed in HeLa-6His:Myc: SUMO-1 cells is a regulated event. Recombinant hsTBP, hsTAF1, hsTAF5, and hsTAF12 Are Substrates for SUMO-1 Modification in Vitro—Next, we analyzed SUMO-1 modification of single recombinant TFIID subunits in vitro. Highly purified bacterially expressed recombinant hsTAF12 or hsTBP, or recombinant hsTAF1, hsTAF4, or hsTAF5 expressed by coupled in vitro transcription/translation, were incubated with a minimal SUMO-1 conjugation system composed of purified recombinant human E1 (SAE1/2) and E2 (Ubc9) enzymes, and purified mature SUMO-1 (aa 1–97) (32Desterro J.M.

Immunoblot analysis of reaction products revealed SUMO-1 modification of hsTBP, hsTAF1, hsTAF5, and the 20-kDa variant of hsTAF12 (Fig. 3, A–D). SUMO-1 modification was not detected with hsTAF4 (Fig. 3D), which contains a SUMO consensus target site (Fig. 1), and with the 15-kDa variant of hsTAF12 (Fig. 3A), which lacks the N terminus of full-length TAF12 (28Hoffmann A.

PGI is a multifunctional dimeric protein that extracellularly acts as a cytokine with properties that include autocrine motility factor (AMF)-eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, and differentiation functions, and PGI has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Little is known of the biochemical regulation of PGI/AMF activities, although it is known that human PGI/AMF is phosphorylated at Ser185 by protein kinase CK2 (CK2); however, the physiological significance of this phosphorylation is unknown.

A Ser-to-Ala mutant protein (S185A) was generated to abolish phosphorylation. Biochemical analyses revealed that the phosphorylation mutant proteins of PGI exhibited decreased enzymatic activity, whereas the S185A mutant PGI protein retained full enzymatic activity. PGI phosphorylation by CK2 also led to down-regulation of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, CK2 knockdown by RNA interference was associated with up-regulation of cellular PGI enzymatic activity. The three recombinant mutant proteins exhibited indistinguishable cytokine activity and receptor-binding affinities compared with the wild-type protein. In both in vitro and in vivo assays, the wild-type and S185A mutant proteins underwent active species dimerization, whereas both the S185D and S185E mutant proteins also formed tetramers. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation affects the allosteric kinetic properties of the enzyme, resulting in a less active form of PGI, whereas non-phosphorylated protein species retain cytokine activity. The process by which phosphorylation modulates the enzymatic activity of PGI thus has an important implication for the understanding of the biological regulation of this key glucose metabolism-regulating enzyme.

Aberrations in the expression or activities of PGI due to mutations or deletions are of significant clinical importance since, in humans, they are associated with hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia diseases (10Schröter W.

Science. 1999; 286: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and its presence in serum and urine is of prognostic value associated with cancer progression (13Baumann M. Brand K.

PGI/AMF may act as a paracrine factor during cancer progression, as its binding to the endothelial cell AMF receptor promotes angiogenesis and vessel leakiness (3Funasaka T. Haga A. Raz A. Nagase H.

Biol. 2002; 318: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They revealed that active PGI is a dimer composed of a large and a small domain and that its sugar-binding site, which is responsible for its enzymatic activity, is located in the junction where the large and small domains and the C-terminal tail come together (24Tanaka N.

Mutagenesis of the sugar-binding motif of PGI results in abrogation of cytokine activity, suggesting that the active site of the enzyme overlaps with cytokine function (24Tanaka N. Haga A. Uemura H. Akiyama H. Funasaka T. Nagase H. Raz A. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the fact that the specific active-site sugar inhibitors erythrose 4-phosphate and 5-phosphoarabinonate also inhibit its cytokine activity (2Watanabe H. Takehana K.

Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase, resulting in down-regulation of activity (27Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol.

Protein kinase C phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase induces up-regulation of enzymatic activity (28Hofer H.W. Schlatter S. Graefe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of enolase precedes glycolysis (34Nettelblad F.A. Engstrom L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether the expression or activities of the rest of the glycolytic enzymes are also regulated by phosphorylation. Previously, it was reported that PGI is phosphorylated at Ser185 by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) (35Haga A. Niinaka Y. Raz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of such phosphorylation remained to be determined. Thus, to study the function(s) of phosphorylated PGI, we generated, by site-directed mutagenesis, non-phosphorylation- and phosphorylation-mimicking species of recombinant PGI proteins and analyzed their structures and enzymatic and cytokine activities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Monolayer Culture Conditions—The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 (CCL121) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.Site-directed Mutagenesis—A Ser-to-Ala substitution at residue 185 (S185A) to abolish phosphorylation and Ser-to-Asp (S185D) and Ser-to-Glu (S185E) substitutions to mimic phosphoserine were generated using with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pGEX6P vector containing human PGI/AMF cDNA was used as a template for PCR. The sequences of the primers used to generate point mutations were GGTATGTCGCCAACATTGATGGAAC, GGTATGTCGACAACATTGATGGAAC, and GGTATGTCGCGAACATTGATGGAAC for S185A, S185D, and S185E, respectively. The PCR conditions used for all mutants were as follows: 95 °C for 0.5 min and 16 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min. After the template DNA was digested with the DpnI restriction enzyme, the PCR product was transferred into One Shot® TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids including the mutants were purified and sequenced. We have previously established the crystal structure of human PGI (24Tanaka N. Haga A. Uemura H. Akiyama H. Funasaka T. Nagase H. Raz A. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and based on these data, the structural changes between the wild-type (WT) and mutant PGI proteins were examined using the program MODELLER (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar). We constructed an energy-minimized model of human PGI phosphorylated at Ser185 using the program REFMAC (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar).Transfection with Mutant PGI Genes and RNA Interference—WT and mutant PGI genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-His (Invitrogen). Parental HT1080 cells were transfected with the vectors using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed to serum-free medium 24 h after transfection. 24 h later, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm sodium deoxycholate), and the conditioned medium was collected. Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was probed by anti-Xpress™ antibody (Invitrogen). The small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences designed for human CK2 and firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (GL3) as a control were 5′-CCAGCUGGUAGUCAUCUUGUU-3′ and 5′-CUUACGUGAGUACUUCGATT-3′, respectively, as reported previously (38Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8078) Google Scholar). HT1080 cells were transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and Western-blotted 48 h after transfection. Anti-CK2α antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).In Vitro Phosphorylation of PGI—Affinity-purified recombinant human WT PGI was incubated with or without CK2 (Calbiochem) in reaction buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) at 30 °C for 1 h. To eliminate CK2, samples were immunoprecipitated with monospecific polyclonal antibodies directed against human PGI (2Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar) and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was detected by auto-radiography. For control assays, 200 μm unlabeled ATP was used.Measurement of PGI Enzymatic Activity—The enzymatic activities of affinity-purified recombinant WT and mutant PGI proteins were measured as described previously (40Gracy R.W. Tilley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.02 μg of each sample was added to a reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 4.0 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm NADPH, and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and its enzymatic activity was immediately monitored at A340 nm for 10 min using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Rabbit PGI (Sigma) was used as a control. To analyze in vivo mutant PGI enzymatic activity, 48 h after transfection with WT and mutant PGI genes, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and each sample at 30 μg/protein was used to measure their enzymatic activities.Transwell® and Phagokinetic Track Motility Assays—The directional motility was assayed using 6.5-mm Transwell® supports with 8.0-μm pore polycarbonate membrane inserts (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) according to the method of Repesh (41Repesh L.A. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. 100 μl of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/ml) was added to the upper compartment, and 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower one. After a 6-h incubation with 100 pg/ml recombinant PGI proteins at 37 °C, the membranes were fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 h, stained with 0.4% trypan blue, and washed with distilled water. The cells that invaded through the membrane were counted after the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were swiped with cotton swabs.For random motility assay, uniform carpets of gold particles were prepared on glass coverslips coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as described previously (42Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 12: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The coverslips were placed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes, and 2500 HT1080 cells were plated onto them. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C with or without 100 pg/ml PGI proteins, the phagokinetic tracks produced by the migratory cells were visualized under a microscope. The phagokinetic tracks of at least 30 individual cells were measured, and the S.E. reflecting a 95% confidence level was calculated.Cross-linking of WT, Mutant, and Phosphorylated PGI Proteins—WT and mutant PGI proteins were cross-linked using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the proteins were eluted in PBS, mixed with a 20-fold molar excess of DSP, and incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. After incubation with CK2, phosphorylated recombinant human PGI protein was also cross-linked as well. The reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine in vivo mutant protein structure, 48 h after transfection with WT and mutant PGI genes, cells were incubated in PBS with 1 mm DSP at 24 °C for 30 min. The reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris for 15 min, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with anti-Xpress™ antibody.Binding Analysis—Recombinant WT and mutant PGI proteins (10 μg/μl) in 100 μl of conjugation buffer (0.1 m phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.2)) were incubated with 10 μg of N-hydroxysuccinimide fluorescein (Pierce) on ice for 2 h. Labeled proteins were dialyzed to remove free N-hydroxysuccinimide fluorescein, and their concentrations were determined. HT1080 cells treated with trypsin after three washes with PBS were divided at 3 × 105 cells/sample and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% BSA with or without unlabeled PGI (2 mg) and differing concentrations of labeled WT and mutant PGI proteins (0, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mm) at 24 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and lysed in 1 m NaOH for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured using a SpectraMax® GEMINI XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) using the parameters λex = 490 nm and λem = 520 nm with a 515-nm emission cutoff filter.Statistical Analysis—Invasion and phagokinetic track assays were analyzed using Bonferroni's/Dunn's method by analysis of variance and the post-hoc test.RESULTSEffect of Ser185 Substitution or Phosphorylation of PGI on Its Enzymatic Activity and Secretion—It was previously reported that PGI undergoes post-translational modification by phosphorylation of Ser185 by CK2 (35Haga A. Niinaka Y. Raz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the evidence that phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes alters their enzymatic activities (27Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8656-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hofer H.W. Schlatter S. Graefe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Blair J.B. Cimbala M.A. James M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7595-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we questioned whether phosphorylation of PGI is of physiological significance. To address this, we constructed mutants by site-directed mutagenesis whereby we substituted Ser185 with aspartic acid (S185D) or glutamic acid (S185E), which introduces a negative charge and conformational changes that mimic phosphorylation (43Haase C. Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Ser185 with alanine (S185A), which abolishes phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1A (inset), the WT and S185A, S185D, and S185E mutant PGI proteins comigrated upon SDS-PAGE as a single protein band. Enzymatic analysis revealed that whereas the WT and S185A proteins exhibited a similar enzymatic activity, the S185D and S185E mutants showed markedly depressed PGI activities (Fig. 1A). To analyze mutant PGI functions in vivo, we used the pcDNA3.1-His mammalian expression vector, which can produce proteins with a unique antigen, the Xpress™ epitope, because expressed mutant proteins should be differentiated from the PGI protein that HT1080 cells originally express. As shown in Fig. 1B, the cells transfected with WT and all mutant PGI genes expressed and secreted PGI/AMF. Previously, we hypothesized that PGI phosphorylation provokes PGI secretion because PGI/AMF secreted to conditioned medium is phosphorylated (35Haga A. Niinaka Y. Raz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present study shows, however, that not only phosphorylation-mimicking mutant PGI proteins (S185D and S185E), but also WT and phosphorylation-abolishing (S185A) PGI proteins were secreted. As shown in Fig. 1, WT and S185A mutant PGI gene-transfected cells appeared to augment PGI activity, whereas null vector-, S185D, and S185E-transfected cells did not.Next, we questioned whether the reduced enzymatic activity of the S185D and S185E mutant PGI proteins results from mimicked phosphorylation status or amino acid substitutions. Thus, recombinant human CK2 (500 units) was used to phosphorylate affinity-purified human PGI (10 μg), and phosphorylated PGI was detected by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, inset, lower panel, lane a). The S185D mutant PGI protein we used for a control was not phosphorylated, as expected (Fig. 2, inset, lower panel, lane b), and PGI did not undergo autophosphorylation in the absence of CK2 (lane c). The enzymatic activity of phosphorylated PGI was measured (Fig. 2) and found to be reduced by ∼50% at the linear portion of the enzymatic curve. This significantly reduced activity was not as dramatic as that observed in the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant proteins (Fig. 1A), which could be attributed to the fact that not all of the PGI molecules in the phosphorylation reaction mixture were phosphorylated and gives credence to the use of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant proteins.Fig. 2Enzymatic activity of phosphorylated PGI/AMF. The enzymatic activity of phosphorylated PGI/AMF (♦) was 50% of that of non-phosphorylated PGI/AMF ⋄ in the linear phase, although it was higher than that of the S185D and S185E mutants, which mimic phosphorylation. Inset, detection of PGI/AMF phosphorylation by autoradiography. WT PGI/AMF was phosphorylated by CK2 (lane a) and was not phosphorylated without CK2 (lane b), whereas S185D was not phosphorylated even with CK2 (lane c). Comparison between Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CB) and autoradiography (32P) suggests incomplete phosphorylation of PGI/AMF. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, we transfected HT1080 cells with siRNA against CK2 to examine CK2 involvement with PGI activity. 2 days after transfection, CK2 expression was suppressed by <50% by siRNA, and the PGI activity of transfected cells increased 1.6-fold more compared with controls (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of suppressed CK2 on PGI enzymatic activity. HT1080 cells were transfected with siRNA against CK2 and firefly luciferase (GL3) as a control using Oligofectamine. CK2 expression in siRNA-transfected cells decreased to <50% in parental cells 48 h after transfection (inset), which led to >60% up-regulation of PGI enzymatic activity.

The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Ser185 Substitution of PGI on Its Cytokine Activity—To study the possible relationship between PGI phosphorylation and cytokine activity, we resorted to two independent motility assays: 1) invasion assay utilizing Transwell® for measuring direct motility (Fig. 4A) and 2) phagokinetic track assay for measuring overall random motility capabilities (Fig. 4B). The WT and S185A, S185D, and S185E mutant proteins at 100 pg/ml increased HT1080 cell invasion (directional motility) compared with controls in the invasion assay (analysis of variance; F4,70 = 8.156, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0005, 0.0033, and 0.0026, respectively) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in the phagokinetic track motility assay, the mutant proteins stimulated the motility of HT1080 cells to the same level as the WT protein relative to unstimulated control cells (analysis of variance; F4,245 = 3.622, p = 0.0007 (WT protein), 0.0041 (S185A), 0.008 (S185D), and 0.0074 (S185E)) (Fig. 4B). Next, to confirm that PGI phosphorylation does not affect cytokine activity, we tested binding to HT1080 cell surfaces and found that all of the Ser185 mutant PGI proteins exhibited cell-surface saturable binding kinetics similar to those of the WT protein (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Cytokine activity of WT and mutant PGI/AMF proteins and binding assay.

Activation of the JNK pathway has been implicated in the formation of several human tumors. We have previously demonstrated that a 55-kDa JNK isoform is constitutively activated in 86% of human brain tumors and more recently demonstrated that this isoform is either JNK2α2 or JNK2β2. Importantly, we have also found that among the 10 known JNK isoforms, the JNK2 isoforms are unique in their ability to autophosphorylate in vitro and in vivo. This does not require the participation of any upstream kinases and also leads to substrate kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. To clarify the mechanism of JNK2α2 autoactivation, we have generated a series of chimeric cDNAs joining portions of JNK1α2, which does not have detectable autophosphorylation activity, with portions of JNK2α2, which has the strongest autophosphorylation activity. Through in vivo and in vitro kinase assays, we were able to define a domain ranging from amino acids 218 to 226 within JNK2α2 that is required for its autophosphorylation. Mutation of JNK2α2 to its counterpart of JNK1α2 in this region abrogated the autophosphorylation activity and c-Jun substrate kinase activity in vivo and in vitro. Notably, switching of JNK1α2 to JNK2α2 at this 9-amino acid site enabled JNK1α2 to gain the autophosphorylation activity in vivo and in vitro. We also found two other functional sites that participate in JNK2α2 activity. One site ranging from amino acids 363 to 382 of JNK2α2 is required for efficient c-Jun binding in vitro, and a site ranging from amino acids 383 to 424 enhances autophosphorylation intensity, although it is not required for triggering the autophosphorylation in vitro. These findings have uncovered the regions required for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation, and this information could be used as potential targets to block JNK2α2 activation. c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are a group of mitogen-activated protein kinase family members that are important in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. together with ERK and p38, constitute the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. JNK contains the dual phosphorylation motif Thr-Pro-Tyr, which is phosphorylated by the upstream kinases MKK4 and MKK7 leading to JNK activation. Since the discovery of JNK as a “p54 microtubule-associated protein kinase” in 1990 (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17355-17363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the subsequent molecular cloning of JNK cDNAs in 1994 (2Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 3Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), much has been learned about the role of the JNK pathway in cell, molecular, and developmental biology. At present, at least 10 isoforms created by alternative splicing from the three JNK genes have been cloned (3Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The role of JNK in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and development is explained at least in part by its regulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity (4Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). JNK can phosphorylate c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73 (5Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), which up-regulates transcriptional activity as a result. In addition, JNK phosphorylates other AP-1 proteins, including JunB, JunD, and ATF2 (6Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the JNK pathway is involved in both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic processes (7Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), although there is also evidence that JNK activation plays no role in apoptosis (8Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas JNK3 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system. Although there may be redundancy between JNK1 and JNK2 (4Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar), several studies have described contexts in which JNK1 and JNK2 tend to play different roles. For example, JNK1 was found to preferentially mediate apoptosis (9Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Cioffi C.L. Monia B.P.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas JNK2 tends to contribute more to proliferation (13Arbour N. Naniche D. Homann D. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Oldstone M.B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in proliferation, JNK2-deficient mice were observed to be resistant to induction of skin papillomas, indicating JNK2 may play a more critical role in tumor formation (14Chen N. Nomura M. She Q.B. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Wang L. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3908-3912PubMed Google Scholar). Results from antisense studies using antisense JNKs also show antisense JNK2 had stronger inhibition than antisense JNK1 on the human T98G glioblastoma cell line and the PC3 prostate cancer cell line (15Bost F. McKay R. Bost M. Potapova O. Dean N.M. Mercola D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1938-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Yang Y.M. Bost F. Charbono W. Dean N. McKay R. Rhim J.S. Depatie C. Mercola D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that 86% of primary glial tumors show activation of a 55-kDa JNK isoform, but not the 46-kDa isoform (17Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A subsequent study from our laboratory demonstrated that this 55-kDa JNK is a member of the JNK2 gene family (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that all of the known JNK2 isoforms, but not the JNK1 or JNK3 isoforms, have autophosphorylation activity and constitutive substrate kinase activity in vitro and in vivo in the absence of upstream kinases (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the notion that JNK2 may play a more crucial role in tumor formation than JNK1 or JNK3. In the present study, we asked whether there were a specific domain(s) within JNK2 that leads to its constitutive activation. Identifying such a domain(s) will not only reveal a novel mechanism for how JNKs are activated but will also assist in the design of inhibitors that could be used to block the activation of this tumorigenic JNK isoform. Cell Culture—Human glioblastoma cell line U87-MG (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/kanamycin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Generation of JNK1α2/JNK2α2 Chimeric cDNA Constructs and Recombinant Protein Purification—A series of JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeric constructs was generated by multiple-step overlapping PCRs and expressed as fusion proteins by cloning in-frame with GFP into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or as bacterial fusion proteins with GST by cloning into pET42 (Novagen, Madison, WI) (Fig. 1A). Sequencing was performed for all constructs to verify that the construct was correctly generated and that the reading frame was maintained. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using immobilized glutathione beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Purified proteins were stored at –70 °C. The quality and quantity of proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Kinase Assay—1 μg of the GST fusion protein was incubated in 20 μl of the kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 30 μm ATP at 30 °C for 45 min. For the substrate kinase assay, 1 μg of GST-c-Jun was added in the kinase buffer mixture as the substrate. Reactions were terminated by adding protein loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Reactions results were further analyzed by Western blot using specific anti-phospho-JNK or anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Cellular Transfection—U87-MG cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were transfected with pEGFP-C1-JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After overnight incubation, the growing medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. Cells were then lysed with cold PBS/TDS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, one complete inhibitor cocktail; Roche Applied Science), and the total cell lysate was harvested, centrifuged, and used immediately or stored at –80 °C. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of proteins were loaded and run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with Blotto for 1 h and then incubated with monoclonal anti-phospho-JNK antibody or monoclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody after being washed with TBST (Tris-Buffered saline Tween-20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) three times. The signal was detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopic Analysis—Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis was carried out as described previously (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, U87-MG cells grown on coverslips were first transfected with pEGFP-JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen). After overnight incubation, cells were continuously cultured in serum-free medium for another 24 h. Cells were then fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by 0.2% Triton X-100 treatment for 5 min. The cells then were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole for visualization of the nuclei. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted with antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), and the results were observed with a Nikon immunofluorescence microscope. Cytoplasmic and nuclear green staining indicated successful transient transfection. The cells successfully transfected from five randomly chosen views under lower magnification (×100) were counted. Cells showing stronger nuclear staining than the cytoplasm were defined as nuclear GFP localization-positive. The percentage of positive GFP nuclear localization was defined as: (cells showing positive nuclear GFP localization)/(cells successfully transfected) × 100%. JNK2α2 Kinase Subdomains IX-XI Are Required for Its Autophosphorylation—All JNKs comprise eleven protein kinase subdomains, which are named I-XI (3Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). We have previously discovered that all of the JNK2 isoforms, namely, JNK2α1, JNK2α2, JNK2β1, and JNK2β2, possess autophosphorylation activity and substrate kinase activity without the participation of any upstream kinases (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). JNK2α2 has the strongest autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity for c-Jun and ATF2 in vitro and in vivo, whereas JNK1α2, an isoform that is otherwise structurally similar to JNK2α2, does not possess any detectable autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. The primary protein structures of JNK1α2 and JNK2α2 differ at subdomains I, IV, IX, X, and XI (see Fig. 1B). Domains I and IV are located in the N terminus, which has been shown to be critical for both catalytic function and ATP binding for all of the JNK isoforms. Thus, we first hypothesized that the more disparate domains IX, X, and XI would be required for the autophosphorylation of JNK2α2. To test our hypothesis, we first generated four JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras, which contained one, two, three, or four consecutive domains different between JNK1α2 and JNK2α2 (Fig. 1A, chimeras 1–4). GST fusion proteins obtained from the different chimeric constructs were first examined for in vitro kinase activity. Among these four chimeras, only chimera 1, which contained subdomains IX-XI of JNK2α2, retained autophosphorylation activity in vitro in the absence of any upstream activating kinase (Fig. 2A). We then asked whether chimera 1 still retained substrate kinase activity by incubating the different GST chimeras with kinase buffer, ATP, and GST-c-Jun, but in the absence of any other proteins. The results revealed that only chimera 1 possessed the ability to phosphorylate c-Jun (Fig. 2B). We then extended our analysis of the autophosphorylation activity of different chimeras in vivo. We constructed pEGFP-chimera expression vectors and transfected these into U87-MG cells. U87 cells normally have a rather weak or undetectable phospho-JNK signal even under serum starvation conditions (19Jiang Z. Zheng X. Lytle R.A. Higashikubo R. Rich K.M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Senger D.L. Tudan C. Guiot M.C. Mazzoni I.E. Molenkamp G. LeBlanc R. Antel J. Olivier A. Snipes G.J. Kaplan D.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2131-2140PubMed Google Scholar), which has also been confirmed by our present work (Fig. 2C). This property makes the U87-MG cell line a good model for the study of JNK autophosphorylation to avoid any confusion with endogenously activated JNK. We have previously shown that when JNK2α2 is transfected into U87-MG cells under serum depletion conditions it undergoes profound autophosphorylation, whereas JNK1α2 does not under the same conditions (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). We found that pEGFP-chimera 1 shows profound autophosphorylation under serum starvation as expected, whereas the other three chimeras showed no or very weak autoactivation (Fig. 2C). We then examined the subcellular localization of these chimeras in U87-MG cells. We have shown previously that when pEGFP-JNK2α2 is transfected into U87-MG cells it shows a predominantly nuclear localization when autophosphorylated, whereas GFP-JNK1α2 either remains in the cytoplasm or shows no preferential localization to the nucleus. Similar to JNK2α2, pEGFP-chimera 1 also showed a profound nuclear localization (Fig. 2, D and E). To further dissect the requirement of JNK2α2 kinase subdomains IX-XI for autophosphorylation, we generated another chimera that joined subdomains I-VIII of JNK2α2 with subdomains IX-XI of JNK1α2. As expected, this chimera showed neither in vitro nor in vivo autophosphorylation activity (data not shown). Overall, these results indicate that subdomains IX, X, and XI of JNK2α2 are required for its autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 Are Crucial for Its Autophosphorylation—As chimera 1 had profound autophosphorylation activity, whereas chimeras 2–4 did not, we speculated that the region between amino acids 208–245 is necessary for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation. Comparison of the amino acid sequences for JNK2α2, JNK1α2, and JNK3α2 at this portion showed that only amino acids 218–226 (LVKGCVIFQ) are unique to JNK2α2 (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that this is one of the regions crucial for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation. To test this notion, we generated another chimera largely based on the JNK1α2 backbone but bearing amino acids 218–226 from JNK2α2 (Fig. 1A, chimera 5). Because we also found weak autophosphorylation activity of chimera 2 (Fig. 2C), we generated another JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimera bearing amino acids 245–292 of JNK2α2 (Fig. 1A, chimera 6). Two other JNK2α2/JNK1α2 chimeras were also generated that represented the reciprocal of these new chimeras by using the JNK2α2 backbone replaced with amino acids 218–226 or 245–292 from JNK1α2, respectively (Fig. 1 A, chimeras 6 and 7). Interestingly, in vitro kinase assays showed that GST-chimera 5, which differs from JNK1α2 only at amino acids 218–226, gained autophosphorylation activity in vitro (Fig. 3, B and C). Surprisingly, it does not possess substrate kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 3C). However, chimera 6, essentially a JNK1α2 molecule only bearing amino acids 245–292 from JNK2α2, did not show any autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, when amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 were switched to the JNK1α2 sequences, as indicated in chimera 7, autophosphorylation and subsequent substrate kinase activity were lost (Fig. 3, B and C). However, chimera 8, a JNK2α2 molecule with amino acids 245–292 switched to its counterpart in JNK1α2, still retained strong autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 3, B and C). We then transfected these new chimeras into U87-MG cells to study their autophosphorylation in vivo. Similar to the results in vitro, chimeras 5 and 8 showed profound autophosphorylation. Chimera 8 actually showed the highest degree of autoactivation and was even stronger than JNK2α2 (Fig. 3D). The autoactivation of pEGFP-chimeras 5 and 8 was also supported by their predominant nuclear localization as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, E and F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that amino acids 218–226 are crucial for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Amino Acids 363–424 of JNK2α2 Are Required for Its Substrate Kinase Activity as Well as Enhancing Autophosphorylation in Vitro—Because the introduction of amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 into JNK1α2 did not restore its substrate kinase activity (Fig. 3C), we hypothesized that there is another portion within the C-terminal of JNK2α2 that is necessary for efficient substrate binding in vitro. Because chimera 8 with amino acids 245–292 mutated to its JNK1α2 counterpart showed autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity, this site was not likely to be involved in the substrate binding for c-Jun. To map the region responsible for c-Jun binding, we then generated another set of chimeras, chimeras 9–12. All of these retained amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 and amino acids 245–292 of JNK1α2, as shown in Fig. 1A. Kinase assays showed that GST-chimeras 9 and 12 possess much stronger autophosphorylation activity than GST-chimeras 10 and 11 (Fig. 4A). Substrate kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as the substrate also demonstrated that GST-chimeras 9 and 12 had much stronger substrate kinase activity than GST-chimeras 10 and 11 (Fig. 4B). Because GST-chimeras 9 and 12 share amino acids 218–226 and 363–424 in common, our data suggested amino acids 363–424 are required for substrate binding as well as enhancing autophosphorylation. We then transfected pEGFP-chimeras 9–12 into U87-MG cells to study their autophosphorylation in vivo. Surprisingly, all of these showed similar levels of autophosphorylation comparable with JNK2α2 (Fig. 4C). Their autophosphorylation is also supported by a high degree of GFP nuclear localization in transfected U87-MG cells (Fig. 4, D and E). In summary, these results suggest that the C-terminal tail ranging from amino acids 363 to 424 of JNK2α2 is responsible for c-Jun binding as well as for enhancing autophosphorylation in vitro. The Entire Sequence of JNK2α2 Is Required for Its Efficient Autophosphorylation in Vitro, but Not in Vivo—To determine the relative contribution of each domain to autophosphorylation, we directly compared all of the chimeras that showed autophosphorylation in vitro. Although we have shown that amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 are required for its autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, chimera 5 shows much less autophosphorylation activity than JNK2α2 in vitro (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, chimeras 1, 8, 9, and 12 also showed less autophosphorylation than JNK2α2, although their intensities are greater than chimera 5 (Fig. 5A). However, to our surprise, we found that all of these chimeras were autophosphorylated at similar levels in vivo (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that subdomains of JNK2α2 outside of amino acids 218–226 contribute collectively to enhancing efficient autophosphorylation in vitro, although these regions outside of 218–226 are not required for efficient autophosphorylation in the cell. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 (LVKGCVIFQ) are crucial for its autophosphorylation. By comparing the amino acid sequences of JNK1α2, which does not show any detectable autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, with JNK2α2, which has the strongest autophosphorylation and substrate kinase activity, we generated a series of JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras to refine which domain(s) is critical. Through autophosphorylation and substrate kinase assays, we have shown that all chimeras with this cluster of 9 amino acids maintain or gain autophosphorylation in vitro and in vitro, but those chimeras without this domain lose autophosphorylation activity. Chimeras 1, 5, 11, and 12 all show autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that subdomains I-VIII of JNK2α2 are not essential for autophosphorylation. Exchanging JNK1α2 at this 9-amino acid domain for its counterpart in JNK2α2 enabled this construct to fully gain autophosphorylation activity in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, exchange of JNK2α2 at this 9-amino acid domain for its counterpart in JNK1α2 resulted in a chimera that lost autophosphorylation activity in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 3, B–F). Although the in vitro autophosphorylation activities of all chimeras are not as strong as that of JNK2α2 (Fig. 5A), all of their autophosphorylation activities in vivo are similar to or even stronger than that of JNK2α2 (Fig. 5B). Notably, all constructs that lack 218–226 from JNK2α2 lack any autophosphorylation activity in vitro or in vivo. These results strongly suggest that amino acids 218–226 of JNK2α2 are indispensable for its autophosphorylation. We have previously ranked the autophosphorylation activity among the four JNK2 isoforms in the order JNK2α2 >JNK2β2 >JNK2α1 >JNK2β1 (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seems that the C-terminal tail ranging from amino acids 363 to 424, which is possessed by both JNK2α2 and JNK2β2, might be responsible for increased autophosphorylation. However, chimera 4, which includes amino acids 363–424 of the JNK2 isoforms, did not show any autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2, A–F), indicating this region is not crucial for triggering autophosphorylation but does enhance autophosphorylation when present, as can be seen in a comparison of chimeras 5 and 12 in Fig. 5A. This is further supported by our results from chimeras 10 and 11 (Fig. 4, A and B), both of which lack amino acids 363–424 of JNK2α2, showing less autophosphorylation in vitro than chimeras 1, 8, 9, and 12 (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5A). Notably, JNK1α and JNK3α drastically differ from JNK2α2 at this region (Fig. 3A). The crystal structure of JNK2 has not yet been determined, but the crystal structure of JNK3 could provide a framework for modeling the structures for this JNK isoform (21Xie X. Gu Y. Fox T. Coll J.T. Fleming M.A. Markland W. Caron P.R. Wilson K.P. Su M.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). At this site, the JNK3 structure shows that most of the nonconserved amino acid residues are solvent exposed and located on the protein surface (corresponding to substrate binding). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that this site may be a docking site for JNK2α2 itself during autophosphorylation. It has been shown that after activation all mitogen-activated protein kinases subsequently translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This was first elucidated for ERK2, which was demonstrated to dimerize first before its nuclear translocation (22Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). During homodimerization, phosphorylated ERK2s form dimers with other phosphorylated or unphosphorylated ERK2s, and the final ERK2 in the nuclei is predominantly the activated form. This dimerization and translocation mechanism is most likely utilized during JNK2α2 autophosphorylation as well. We have observed that JNK1α2, which does not possess autophosphorylation properties, mainly remains in the cytoplasm. For autophosphorylation to occur, JNK2α2 molecules have to bind each other first. The autoactivation of JNK2α2 probably follows a “binding first, phosphorylation second” manner. It is during the binding process that the 9-amino acid site may play a key role. The substrate-binding site in JNKs has been partially clarified. It has been demonstrated that amino acids 208–230 of JNK2 contain a specificity-determining region responsible for efficient c-Jun binding and phosphorylation, such that JNK2 binds c-Jun ∼25 times more efficiently than does JNK1 (23Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This site also enables JNK2α1 or JNK2α2 to bind to c-Jun at a 2-fold greater intensity than ATF-2. Our present data from chimeras 1, 8, 9, and 12 tend to support these findings (Figs. 2B, 3C, and 4B). Thus, the cluster of amino acids from 218 to 226 of JNK2α2 is likely to play a role in c-Jun binding as well as to be a potential binding site for JNK2α2 itself. A recent report has indicated that amino acids 162, 164, 326, 329, and 331 of JNK2α2 are required for efficient c-Jun docking and its subsequent phosphorylation (24Mooney L.M. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11843-11852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these amino acids are rather conserved among all JNK isoforms and all of them are identical in our JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras, which suggests they do not play a major role during JNK2α2 autophosphorylation. However, results from the present study indicate that another region of JNK2α2 ranging from amino acids 363 to 424 contains another domain responsible for c-Jun binding. This is supported by the fact that chimeras 5, 10, and 11, which possess the LVKGCVIFQ sequence required for autophosphorylation, but not amino acids 363–424 of JNK2α2, show autophosphorylation but much less c-Jun phosphorylation than chimeras 1, 8, 9, and 12 (Figs. 3C, 4B, and 5A). Interestingly, JNK2α1 and JNK2α2 have a similar efficiency in phosphorylating c-Jun when activated, yet JNK2α2 has a much stronger autophosphorylation activity in vitro than JNK2α1 (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). JNK2α2 differs from JNK2α1 in that it contains an additional C-terminal tail ranging from amino acids 383 to 424. Taking all these facts into account, we suggest that amino acids 363–382 of JNK2α2 comprise a region that would facilitate c-Jun binding, whereas amino acids 383–424 enhance the autophosphorylation of JNK2α isoforms when they are found. We observed a decrease in the autophosphorylation activity of JNK1α2/JNK2α2 chimeras in vitro versus in vivo. All of the chimeras that are capable of autophosphorylation show variable levels of autophosphorylation and substrate activity in in vitro assays (Fig. 5A). However, when transfected into cells the autophosphorylation activity of these chimeras is very similar in vivo with the exception of chimera 8 (Fig. 5B). Several explanations are possible. First, the upstream kinases MKK4 and MKK7 may preferentially phosphorylate these chimeras in cells. The JNK interaction protein (JIP) scaffold protein family members, which interact with mixed lineage kinases, MKK7, and JNKs, may differentially interact with these chimeras as well (25Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Finally, the interaction of these chimeras with JNK phosphatases, such as MKP-7 (29Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), may be diminished. The fact that none of the chimeras generated has in vitro autophosphorylation activity comparable with JNK2α2 indicates that, although subdomains of JNK2α2 outside of amino acids 218–226 are not required for its autophosphorylation, these domains may still play an important role for the efficient autophosphorylation of JNK2α2 in vitro. However, these findings do not alter the basic conclusion that the domains that we have identified are necessary for activity because chimeras lacking these regions (chimeras 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) fail to show autophosphorylation activity both in vitro and in vivo. Although JNK1 and JNK3 play an important role in proapoptosis, the function of JNKs, especially JNK2, during oncogenic transformation and tumor formation has been confirmed in several studies (28Dickens M.

Our previous study indicated that the active JNK isoform found in gliomas could be either JNK2α2 or JNK2β2 (18Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that gliomas express only JNK2α2 mRNA and this isoform can promote tumorigenesis in in vitro studies. 2J. Cui and A. Wong, manuscript in preparation. Understanding the mechanism underlying JNK2α2 autophosphorylation will provide insights into how to block these constitutively active JNK signals and perhaps lead to novel therapeutics."

Based on previous studies we postulated that PTH regulates sodium pump activity through isoform-specific PKC-dependent activation of ERK. In the present work utilizing opossum kidney cells, a model of renal proximal tubule, PTH stimulated membrane translocation of PKCα by 102 ± 16% and PKCβI by 41 ± 7% but had no effect on PKCβII and PKCζ. Both PKCα and PKCβI phosphorylated the Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit in vitro. PTH increased the activity of PKCα but not PKCβI. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that treatment with PTH enhanced the association between Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit and PKCα, whereas the association between Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit and PKCβI remained unchanged. A PKCα inhibitory peptide blocked PTH-stimulated serine phosphorylation of the Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit and inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK-1 blocked PTH-stimulated translocation of PKCα, whereas transfection of constitutively active MEK-1 cDNA induced translocation of PKCα and increased phosphorylation of the Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit. In contrast, PTH-stimulated ERK activation was not inhibited by pretreatment with the PKCα inhibitory peptide. Inhibition of PKCα expression by siRNA did not inhibit PTH-mediated ERK activation but significantly reduced PTH-mediated phosphorylation of the Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit. Pharmacologic inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase blocked PTH-stimulated ERK activation, translocation of PKCα, and phosphorylation of the Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit. We conclude that PTH stimulates Na+-K+-ATPase phosphorylation and decreases the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase by ERK-dependent activation of PKCα.

Na+-K+-ATPase is an energy-dependent enzyme responsible for the maintenance of intracellular sodium and potassium balance (1Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In the proximal renal tubule, the activity of this basolateral membrane protein provides the driving force for the vectorial transport of various solutes and ions, including sodium, from the tubular lumen to the renal vasculature. Regulation of proximal renal tubule sodium reabsorption by Na+-K+-ATPase activity is a major determinant of total body sodium homeostasis, extracellular fluid volume status, and blood pressure control. Abnormalities in the regulation of Na+-K+-ATPase activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some forms of hypertension associated with impaired salt excretion (2Zhang Y. Norian J.M.

However, the mechanisms for PTH-mediated ERK and PKC activation involved in Na+-K+-ATPase regulation have not been determined. Based on our previous work showing that PKC activates the ERK pathway, we postulated that PTH regulates Na+-K+-ATPase in OK cells by activation of ERK through a PKCα-dependent mechanism. To address this hypothesis, we examined the ability of PTH to stimulate activation of specific PKC isoforms, the ability of PTH to regulate Na+-K+-ATPase after inhibition of specific PKC isoforms, and the role of PKC isoforms and ERK in the regulation of phosphorylation and activity of the sodium pump.

These cells exhibit several characteristics of mammalian renal proximal tubules including a polarized morphology, basolateral expression of Na+-K+-ATPase, and regulation of Na+-K+-ATPase by PTH, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and PKC (17Khundmiri S.J. Lederer E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282 (2002): F512-F522Google Scholar). OK cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earl's salts (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The cells were fed twice a week and split once a week at a 1:4 ratio. All of the experiments were carried out using cells at 90–95% confluence. Cells grown on 6-well culture plates were washed with serum-free medium 24 h prior to use.Protein Kinase C Immunoblotting—Protein Kinase C translocation was determined by translocation of PKC isoforms to the membrane following the method of Clarke et al. (25Clarke H. Ginanni N. Peralta S. Mullin J.M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1004-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on Falcon 100-mm tissue culture plates were treated with 10–7m PTH (bovine 1–34) in the presence or absence of 100 nm PKC isoform-specific peptide inhibitor or 10–5m U0126 (MEK-1 inhibitor) for 15 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS without calcium and magnesium, pH 7.4, scraped, and homogenized into 1.5 ml of ice-cold PKC buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pipetted into ultracentrifuge tubes, and sonicated on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a separate tube, and a sample was taken for protein estimation. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue was added. The solution was boiled for 5 min and stored at –70 °C. To the pellet, 500 μl of PKC buffer with 1% Triton X-100 was added, homogenized, and left on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g as described above for 1 h. The supernatant (Triton-soluble fraction) was removed, a sample was taken for protein estimation, and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added, boiled for 5 min, and stored at –70 °C. Western blot was performed as described previously (18Khundmiri S.J. Bertorello A.M. Delamere N.A. Lederer E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17418-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—The whole cell lysate or crude membranes solubilized in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μl/ml phosphatase inhibitor mixture, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% SDS were centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. 100 μg of protein from the supernatant was precleared with Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min in a tabletop centrifuge (Spectrafuge; National Labnet Co.). The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 ng of anti-PKCα, PKCβ1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the α1 subunit of Na+-K+-ATPase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein G- (PKCα, or PKCβ1) or A- (Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit) Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min in a tabletop centrifuge. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added and boiled for 5 min. The beads were centrifuged as above, and the proteins in the supernatant were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit or anti-PKC isoform-specific antibodies.Determination of PKC Activity—The OK cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10–7m PTH for 15 min. The cells were washed two times with PBS, pH 7.4, and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. PKCα or β1 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of whole cell lysate proteins as described above. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer, and PKC activity was determined according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly 10 μl each of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm CaCl2), substrate mixture (500 μm PKC substrate), cAMP-dependent protein kinase/calmodulin kinase inhibitor mixture (2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide PKI, and 20 μm R24571 in assay dilution buffer), PKC lipid activator (0.5 mg/ml phosphatidyl serine and 0.05 mg/ml diacylglycerol in assay dilution buffer), and magnesium/ATP mixture (75 mm MgCl2, 500 μm ATP and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added to the protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After 10 min a 25-μl sample was slowly transferred to the center of a P81 phosphocellulose paper and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The P81 papers were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, dried, and transferred to scintillation vials. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by addition of 3 ml of scintillation fluid and reading in a scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences). A substrate control was measured to correct for nonspecific binding along with the samples. Control counts were subtracted from the sample counts to calculate the PKC activity according to the manufacturer's protocol. The activity is expressed as pmol of phosphate incorporated into the PKC substrate peptide/min/mg protein.Membrane Preparation—The cells were treated with 10–7m PTH (bovine, 1–34) in the presence or absence of PKC isoform-specific peptide inhibitors for a specified time (see “Results”), washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 50 mm mannitol, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The lysate was homogenized using a high speed polytron type homogenizer (3 strokes, 15 s) and incubated with 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at low speed (3000 rpm for 10 min) to remove cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing crude membrane material was resuspended in the homogenizing buffer.In Vitro Phosphorylation of Na+-K+-ATPase α1 Subunit by PKCα and PKCβ1—Crude membranes were prepared from OK cells as described above. Crude membranes were solubilized in IP buffer, and Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of membrane protein as described above. Protein A-Sepharose beads containing the immunoprecipitated Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit were incubated in 40 μl of PKC phosphorylation buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6.5 mm CaCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm IP20 (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitory peptide), PKC activator (1 mg/ml phosphatidyl serine, Promega), and 100 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of constitutively active recombinant PKCα or β1. At the end of the reaction, the beads were washed three times with IP buffer as described above, and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and autoradiographed. To determine equal loading of protein, Western blot analysis using Na+-K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibodies was performed.Determination of Na+-K+-ATPase Activity as K+-stimulated pNPPase Activity—K+-stimulated pNPPase activity was measured as described previously (26Lederer E.D. Khundmiri S.J. Weinman E.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) following the method of Hird et al. (27Hird R.B. Wakefield T.W. Mukherjee R. Jones B.U. Crawford F.A. Andrews P.C. Stanley J.C. Spinale F.G. Circulation. 1995; 92: 433-446Crossref Google Scholar) with slight modifications as described by Tran and Farley (28Tran C.M. Farley R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, Na+-K+-ATPase activity as K+-stimulated pNPPase activity is measured by assessing its ability to cleave p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol in the presence of high molar concentration of potassium. 20 μl of the membrane (25–30 μg of protein) was added to 0.88 ml of assay buffer (30 mm histidine, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and 10 mmp-NPP). The assay mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 5 n NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100. A standard curve was constructed by serial dilutions of p-nitrophenol, and the color was read at 410 nm. The samples and the standards were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min before spectrophotometric analysis. Ouabain-sensitive pNPPase activity was determined by subtracting the activity measured in the presence of 10 mm ouabain in the assay medium from total activity measured in absence of ouabain. The assay was run in triplicate, and activity is expressed as μmoles of p-nitrophenol released/mg protein/h.86Rb Uptake—Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake was measured as an index of Na+-K+-ATPase-mediated ion transport as described previously (18Khundmiri S.J. Bertorello A.M. Delamere N.A. Lederer E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17418-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) following the method of Okafor et al. (29Okafor M.C. Mukhopadhyay P. Delamere N.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 790-796PubMed Google Scholar). OK cells were pretreated with 5 μm monensin for 30 min in the presence or absence of PKC inhibitory peptides. The cells were exposed to PTH for 5 min prior to adding trace amount of 86Rb (∼1 μCi/ml 86RbCl) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's without serum. Half the cells received ouabain (final concentration, 1 mm) 15 min prior to the start of 86Rb uptake. 86Rb uptake was carried out for 10 min at room temperature after which the cells were washed five or six times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed overnight in 0.5 n NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C. An aliquot (100 μl) of the lysate was used to measure radioactivity. The difference between the 86Rb uptake measured in the presence of 1 mm ouabain and the absence of ouabain was used as a measure of Na+-K+-ATPase-mediated transport activity. The uptake data are expressed as nmol of rubidium (86Rb) accumulated/mg protein/min, and the results are plotted as percentages of control.PKCα siRNA Transfection—200 pmol of SMART-Pool PKCα or nonspecific control small inhibitory RNA (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was transfected into OK cells using Genesilencer Transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μl of Genesilencer reagent was diluted with 25 μl of serum-free EMEM. In another tube 25 μl of siRNA diluent was diluted with 15 μl serum-free EMEM, and 200 pmol of siRNA was added. The siRNA containing mixture was mixed with diluted Genesilencer reagent and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The siRNA, Genesilencer reagent mixture was added onto growing cells in serum-free EMEM and incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 for 6 h, following which 1 ml of EMEM containing 20% serum was added and further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2.MEK-1 cDNA Transfection—A cDNA for constitutively active MEK-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was transfected into OK cells using Geneporter transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cDNA and the Geneporter reagent were diluted separately in serum-free medium. The diluted cDNA was mixed with diluted Geneporter reagent and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The culture medium from the cells was replaced with the mixture containing Geneporter and MEK-1 cDNA and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2, following which the cells were lysed, and the membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated and processed for Western blot analysis. The supernatant proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using phospho-ERK antibodies to document successful transfection of MEK-1.Uptake of Constitutively Active Recombinant MEK-1—Wild type OK cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum 24 h prior to uptake of active recombinant MEK-1. 1 μg/ml GFP-linked constitutively active recombinant MEK-1 was mixed with 5 μl of dried Bioporter film in a 1.5-ml tube and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was then transferred to OK cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. After 4 h, the cells were washed thrice with 1× PBS and then lysed in 50 mm mannitol, 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The crude membranes were prepared as described above. The"
https://openalex.org/W2055761176,"OVCA1 is a tumor suppressor identified by positional cloning from chromosome 17p13.3, a hot spot for chromosomal aberration in breast and ovarian cancers. It has been shown that expression of OVCA1 is reduced in some tumors and that it regulates cell proliferation, embryonic development, and tumorigenesis. However, the biochemical function of OVCA1 has remained unknown. Recently, we isolated a novel mutant resistant to diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A from the gene trap insertional mutants library of Chinese hamster ovary cells. In this mutant, the Ovca1 gene was disrupted by gene trap mutagenesis, and this disruption well correlated with the toxin-resistant phenotype. We demonstrated direct evidence that the tumor suppressor OVCA1 is a component of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide on elongation factor 2, the target of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins. A functional genetic approach utilizing the random gene trap mutants library of mammalian cells should become a useful strategy to identify the genes responsible for specific phenotypes.

Even though the biological or cell biological functions have been elucidated, the biochemical function of OVCA1 has not been ascertained. Diphthamide is a unique post-translationally modified histidine residue found only on translational elongation factor 2 (EF-2), 1The abbreviations used are: EF-2, elongation factor 2; DT, diphtheria toxin; ETA, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: EF-2, elongation factor 2; DT, diphtheria toxin; ETA, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription. which catalyzes the translocation of peptidyl tRNA from the ribosome A site to the P site during peptide chain elongation. Diphthamide has been found in all eukaryote and archaebacteria, however not in eubacteria.

The biochemical function of diphthamide as a target of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins has been well characterized; however, its physiological role in cells has remained to be clarified. Bacterial toxins are useful and valuable tools for investigating cell functions; important knowledge concerning cell functions has been obtained by analyses of mutants of established cell lines. Indeed, much of knowledge concerning the mechanisms of toxicity of DT has been elucidated by the study of toxin-resistant mutants (7Chen J.-Y.C. Bodley J.W. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3357-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Danley D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23218-23225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although many of the DT-resistant mutants have been isolated, to clarify the genes involved in DT sensitive and/or resistant phenotype was time consuming and sometimes difficult work, especially in mammalian cells. To increase the efficiency of insertional mutagenesis in mammalian cells, retrovirus gene trap vectors have been developed (19von Melchner H. Reddy S. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3733-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Gene traps are based on the integration of a reporter gene lacking a promoter into the genome and its expression from a tagged endogenous promoter. When a gene trap vector integrates into expressed genes, insertional mutants can be easily selected by selectable phenotype conferred by the gene trap vector. It is possible to increase the proportion of cells with virus-induced mutations to two to three orders of magnitude higher than in cells containing unselected proviruses by retroviral gene trap selection (21Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). So far, mutants having a variety of phenotypes have been isolated from CHO cells. This is because CHO cells are hypodiploid and functionally hemizygous at a number of loci (22Gupta R.S. Chan D.Y. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1978; 14: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Siminovich L. Gottesman M.M. Molecular Cell Genetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 869-879Google Scholar). For that reason it was expected that a single gene trap insertional mutagenetic event might result in loss of gene functions in CHO cells. To identify the obligate genes involved in DT sensitivity and/or resistance, including diphthamide biosynthesis, we screened mutants resistant to DT from a random gene trap insertional mutants library of CHO cells. Recently, we have been able to isolate a novel mutant resistant to DT and ETA in which a mutant Ovca1 gene was disrupted by gene trap mutagenesis. Here we show genetic and biochemical evidence that the tumor suppressor OVCA1 is a component of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide on EF-2, the target of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins. Cells and Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. CHO-K1 cells and mutants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Retroviral Gene Trap Insertional Mutagenesis—The retroviral gene trap vector, ROSAβgeo (20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), was used to construct the random gene trap insertional mutants library of CHO cells. To infect the ROSAβgeo to CHO cells, pseudo-retrovirus of ROSAβgeo was produced using a pantropic retroviral expression system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pROSAβgeo (20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) and pVSV-G plasmid constructs were co-transfected to GP293 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48-h incubation, virus-containing supernatant was harvested, passed through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored at -80 °C until use. For gene trap mutagenesis, CHO-K1 cells were seeded in multiple dishes at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with a virus-containing medium. After an additional 48 h, the cells from each dish were re-seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish, and gene trapped mutagenized cells were selected by G418 (200 μg/ml) for 10–14 days. Typically we could get 1–2 × 103 G418-resistant colonies per dish. Cells from ∼1 × 106 independent colonies were combined and stored as the random gene trap insertional mutants library of CHO cells. Toxins—DT and fragment A of DT were purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (14Robbins A.R. Peng S.S. Marshall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ETA was purchased from List Biological Laboratories. Selection and Cloning of Diphtheria Toxin-resistant Cells—Toxinresistant CHO mutants were isolated from the gene trap insertional mutants library. Inocula of 106 gene trap mutagenized CHO cells were incubated for 6–10 h before the addition of 1 μg/ml of DT. After about 2 weeks of selection, colonies were isolated with cloning rings, and each isolated clone was cultured in DT-free medium. Cytotoxicity Assay with MTT—Toxin-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated by conventional 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay. Cells were seeded in 96-microwell plates at a density of 4 × 103/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum. After 16-h incubation, the medium was replaced and cells were exposed to serial dilutions of DT or ETA (0–1000 ng/ml) for 48 h. Then 10 μl of 0.4% MTT reagent and 0.1 m sodium succinate were added to each well. After 90-min incubation, 150 μl of Me2SO were added to dissolve the purple formazan precipitate. Formazan dye was measured spectrophotometrically (570–650 nm) using the MAXline Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (11Liu S. Leppla S.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka T. Tanimoto K. Otani K. Satoh K. Ohtaki M. Yoshida K. Toge T. Yahata H. Tanaka S. Chayama K. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Hiyama K. Nishiyama M. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated from CHO cells using PUREGENE DNA isolation kits (Gentra), digested with EcoRI, separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. A 0.8-kbp PCR fragment of the Neor gene, amplified with primers 5′-AACCATGGGATCGGCCATTGAACA-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCGCGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGGC-3′ from pROSAβgeo, was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by random priming. The membrane was hybridized with this probe, washed, and then autoradiographed. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), Cloning, and Sequence—5′-RACE analyses were conducted using the 5′-Full RACE core set (Takara Biomedicals) with total RNAs from DTR44 cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs were prepared from mutant cells with Sepasol RNA I (Nacalai Tesque). Single strand cDNAs were prepared from the total RNAs (∼1 μg of total RNA for each sample) with β-galactosidase-specific 5′-phosphorylated RT primer, 5′-ATGCGCTCAGGTCAAATTCA-3′ and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. After the degradation reaction of the hybridized RNAs by RNase H, cDNAs were circularized and/or concatemerized by using the 5′-Full RACE core set following the manufacturer's instructions. For PCR amplification of the trapped sequence, the following β-galactosidase-specific primers sets were used: 5′-GTTGATGAAAGCTGGCTACA-3′/5′-GTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGT-3′ (for the first PCR) and 5′-TGATGGCGTTAACTTGGCGT-3′/5′-TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′ (for nested PCR). Amplification products were subcloned to pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by using ABI PRISM™ 377 and 310 sequencing machines (Applied Biosystems). Homology of the trapped sequences was searched by the NCBI BLAST program. PCR Analyses of Chimera RNA and Genome DNA—Total RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified by using an RNA PCR kit (Takara Biomedicals). Genome DNAs were prepared from CHO cells using PUREGENE DNA isolation kits (Gentra). For PCR amplification of the cDNA and genome DNA, the following Ovca1 and β-galactosidase-specific primers sets were used: 5′-CGTTCCTCCAGCGCTGCCTT-3′ (P1)/5′-GTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGT-3′ (P3) (for the first PCR) and 5′-TCCAGCGCTGCCTTTTTGGT-3′ (P2)/5′-TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′ (P4) (for nested PCR) (see Fig. 2, B and C). cDNA Expression Experiments—The mouse Ovca1 (Ovca1 (m)), human DPH2L2 (DPH2L2 (h)), and mouse dph2l2 (dph2l2 (m)) cDNA expression vectors were constructed as described below. First, the cDNAs used in the expression experiments were RT-PCR amplified from the mouse kidney and human fibroblast mRNAs. The mRNAs were reverse transcribed with oligo dT primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The mouse Ovca1 cDNA fragments were amplified using 5′-primers for without tag Ovca1 (5′-ATGCTAGCGTGATGGCGGCGCTGGTTGTGT-3′ (the NheI site is underlined, and the start codon is in boldface)) or for with FLAG-tagged Ovca1 (5′-ATGCTAGCATGGCGGCGCTGGTTGTGTC-3′ (the NheI site is underlined and the start codon is in boldface)) and a 3′-primer (5′-ATGGATCCCCCTGCTGCTCTGGCCCTCTCA-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined)). The amplified cDNA fragments were then digested by NheI and BamHI and cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of pIREShyg3 (Clontech) or pFLAG-IREShyg3. The pFLAG-IREShyg3 plasmid was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotides, 5′-AGCTTAAGTCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGAC-3′ (the AflII site is underlined, and the start codon is in boldface) and 5′-TAGCTAGCGATCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATC-3′ (the NheI site is underlined) were annealed, purified by PAGE, digested by AflII and NheI, and cloned into AflII and NheI sites of pIREShyg3. The mouse dph2l2 cDNA fragment was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-ATGCTAGCAAGCTGCGCCCAATGGAGTCTA-3′ (the NheI site is underlined and the start codon is in boldface)) and a 3′-primer (5′-CTGATATCCAGACTTATCACTCTGGCTC-3′: the EcoRV site is underlined)). The amplified cDNA fragment was digested by NheI and EcoRV and cloned into the NheI and EcoRV sites of pIRESHyg3. The human DPH2L2 cDNA fragment was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CATGGATCCCAAGCTGTGCCTCATGGAGTC-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined and the start codon is in boldface) and a 3′-primer (5′-GATCTCGAGCACATGGTATCAGCCGCTTCC-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined)). The amplified cDNA fragment was digested by BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+) (Invitrogen). These expression plasmid constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme map and sequencing and were transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cells were selected by hygromycin B (400 μg/ml) for 10–14 days. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and analyzed. Western Blot Analysis—CHO cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated with or without 1 μg/ml DT at 37 °C for 1 h, and the cells were washed and lysed by 100 μl/ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were separated by native PAGE or SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in appropriate blocking buffers and incubated with goat anti EF-2 antibody (sc-13004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody. Reactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro ADP-ribosylating Assay—CHO cell lysates preparation and ADP-ribosylation reaction of EF-2 were performed as described previously (15Kohno K. Uchida T. Mekada E. Okada Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1985; 11: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Kohno K. Hayes H. Mekada E. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with [adenylate-14C]NAD (Amersham Biosciences, 248 mCi/mmol, catalog no. CFA 497) in the absence or presence of DT fragment A. The amount of ADP-ribosylated EF-2 was assessed by counting the radioactivity incorporated to the acid insoluble fraction in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, LSC-3500). ADP ribosylation of EF-2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Isolation of the Diphtheria Toxin-resistant Mutants—The random gene trap insertional mutants library of CHO cells was made by infecting the ROSAβgeo (20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) followed by growth in G418 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” By combining the cells from ∼1 × 106 independent G418-resistant colonies, we constructed a library of mutants. The gene trap mutagenized cells were inoculated at 20 × 105 cells per 100-mm culture dish and selected with DT. Colonies, ∼10 per dish, were observed 10–14 days later. A total of 24 clones were picked randomly from the 1 × 106 mutant library cells (Fig. 1A). One of these mutants, DTR44, was completely resistant to DT and ETA (Fig. 1, C and D). Southern blot analysis with a Neor gene fragment as a probe showed multiple insertions (>8 copies) in the DTR44 genome (Fig. 1B). Identification of the Disrupted Gene in DTR44 Cells—To identify the gene responsible for multiple toxin resistance in DTR44, we amplified the trapped sequences with a gene trap vector, ROSAβgeo, using 5′-RACE. A major PCR product was amplified from the DTR44 cDNA (data not shown) and 128-bp trapped sequences (DDBJ accession number AB194396) were clarified by sequencing. BLAST search revealed that 76 bp (number 53 to 128) of these 128-bp trapped sequences strongly matched those of the first exon of the mouse (25Chen C.-M. Behringer R.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and human OVCA1 genes (Fig. 2A). The amino acids sequence of Chinese hamster OVCA1 protein in this region completely matched with that of mouse OVCA1, and 85% of these amino acids are identical to those of human OVCA1 protein (Fig. 2A). The existence of the Ovca1-βgeo chimera RNA resulting from gene trap mutagenesis was confirmed by RT-PCR of DTR44 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Although multiple insertions of the gene trap vector into DTR44 genome were ascertained by Southern blot (Fig. 1B), PCR sequence analysis of the DTR44 genomic DNA with the primers correspond to Ovca1, and βgeo sequences clarified that one of the gene trap retrovirus was integrated within the first intron, ∼1kb downstream of exon 1, of the Ovca1 gene (Fig. 2C). Disruption of the Ovca1 Gene Renders a Toxin-resistant Phenotype—To define the role of OVCA1 in DTR44, Ovca1 cDNA expression plasmids were constructed and transfected into DTR44 cells; stable transformants were then established by selecting with hygromycin B (400 μg/ml). Stable transfectant colonies were picked and evaluated for sensitivity to the toxins. The majority of clones arising from DTR44 cells transfected with Ovca1 cDNA regained sensitivity to DT and ETA (Fig. 3A). In contrast, in cells transfected with the empty vector or DPH2L2, proteins that have higher similarity to DPH2 than OVCA1 (26Schultz D.C. Balasara B.R. Testa J.R. Godwin A.K. Genomics. 1998; 52: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), expression vector remained toxinresistant (Fig. 3A). Cytotoxicities of DT or ETA to DTR44 cells and the clones of DTR44 transfected with OVCA1 expression constructs were further analyzed by MTT assay. Clones R1 and R2, DTR44 stable transformants of mouse Ovca1 cDNA expression vector, regained their parental sensitivity and were fully sensitive to DT and ETA (Fig. 3, C and D). The presence of Ovca1-βgeo chimera RNA in these transformants (Fig. 3B) clearly showed that the recovery of toxin sensitivity was not caused by the deletion of the gene trap vector integrated in the Ovca1 gene. Taken together, we concluded that OVCA1 was required for the process involved in sensitivity to DT and ETA. OVCA1 Is Required for Diphthamide Biosynthesis—DTR44 cells showed the characteristics of the DTRII phenotype, that is, multiple toxin resistances and a resistant to high concentrations of toxins. DTRII mutants have shown that DT sensitivity was affected at the level of EF-2 (8Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Danley D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Moehring T.J. Moehring J.M. Cell. 1977; 11: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Moehring J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23218-23225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether DTR44 cells are altered in their susceptibility of EF-2 to ADP-ribosylation, CHO cell extracts were assayed for transfer of radiolabeling from NAD+ to EF-2. Lysates were incubated with [adenylate-14C]NAD in the absence or presence of DT fragment A. The amount of ADP-ribosylated EF-2 was assessed by counting the radioactivity incorporated to the acid insoluble fraction with a liquid scintillation counter (Fig. 4A). ADP ribosylation of EF-2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. (Fig. 4B). ADP-ribosylation assay clearly showed that ADP-ribosylated acceptor activity in DTR44 cell lysate was dramatically reduced compared with that of wild type parental CHO cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, the non-ribosylatable EF-2 from DTR44 cells restored the ADP-ribosyl acceptor activity when transfected with OVCA1 expression vector (Fig. 4, A and B). From these observations, we concluded that DTR44 cells are defective in diphthamide formation on EF-2 and that OVCA1 is required for the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Identification of Intermediate in Diphthamide Synthesis— ADP-ribosylated, the non-ADP-ribosylated form, and biosynthetic intermediate of diphthamide on EF-2 have been shown to be easily distinguished by native PAGE followed by Western blotting using an anti-EF-2 antibody (11Liu S. Leppla S.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using this detection system, we examined the diphthamide biosynthetic intermediate in DTR44 cells. ADP-ribosylated EF-2 has two added negative charges compared with EF-2, and this increased negative charge could be detected as faster migration on native PAGE. The EF-2 of DTR44 migrates between the ADP-ribosylated and non-ADP-ribosylated forms (Fig. 4C). This observation further confirmed that OVCA1 is required for the biosynthesis of diphthamide on EF-2, the target site for the ADP-ribosylating bacterial protein toxins. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying DT sensitivity and/or resistance, including diphthamide biosynthesis, we screened mutants resistant to DT from a library of random gene trap insertional mutants of CHO cells. CHO cells are functionally hemizygous at a number of loci (22Gupta R.S. Chan D.Y. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1978; 14: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Siminovich L. Gottesman M.M. Molecular Cell Genetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 869-879Google Scholar). It was expected that a single integration event of gene trap retrovirus might result in the loss of gene function in CHO cells, and we would be able to get mutants with specific phenotype by proper selection from this library of mutant cells. DTR44 mutant cells isolated from the gene trap insertional mutants library showed a phenotype with multiple toxin resistance to DT and ETA. It was revealed that the Ovca1 gene was disrupted by gene trap mutagenesis and that the expression of OVCA1 fully recovered the sensitivity to toxins and EF-2 diphthamide formation. These genetic and biochemical data clearly show that the tumor suppressor OVCA1 is a component of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide on EF-2. So far the amino acid sequences of OVCA1 did not reveal any functional protein domains suggesting its biochemical function except for low level sequence similarity (∼20%) (1Schultz D.C. Vanderveer L. Berman D.B. Hamilton T.C. Wong A.J. Godwin A.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1997-2002PubMed Google Scholar, 2Phillips N.J. Ziegler M.R. Deaven L.L. Cancer Lett. 1996; 102: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) between OVCA1 and DPH2, a yeast protein necessary for diphthamide formation (10Mattheakis L.C. Sor F. Collier R.J. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The forward genetic approach using gene trap mutagenesis in this study clearly demonstrated the biochemical function of OVCA1 in the formation of diphthamide in mammalian cells as described above. The retroviral gene trap mutagenesis approach described in this study is relatively simple and straightforward. Even though multiple copies of gene trap vectors are integrated into DTR44 mutant genome (Fig. 1B), we could easily identify the obligate gene for DT-resistant phenotype in DTR44 cells by analyzing the trapped sequences in the chimera RNA produced by gene trap mutagenesis. Retroviruses can be used as insertional mutagens to isolate specific genes in mammalian cells. However, in practice, conventional retroviruses are inefficient mutagens (27Varmus H.E. Quintrell N. Ortiz S. Cell. 1981; 25: 23-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In ROSAβgeo, the retroviral gene trap vector used in this study, βgeo is flanked by an upstream 3′-splice consensus sequence (splice acceptor) and a downstream polyadenylation site to ensure its activation from integrations into introns (“intron trap”), and the gene trap events by SAβgeo are estimated to ∼4.5 to 11.6% of integration events (20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). So even if multiple integration events occurred, it was estimated that a large portion of retroviral vector integrations were not involved in the specific phenotypes. After the isolation of the Ovca1 gene (1Schultz D.C. Vanderveer L. Berman D.B. Hamilton T.C. Wong A.J. Godwin A.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1997-2002PubMed Google Scholar, 2Phillips N.J. Ziegler M.R. Deaven L.L. Cancer Lett. 1996; 102: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the biological functions of OVCA1 were clarified by cell biological analyses and the study of gene knock-out mice. It was speculated that the loss or haploinsufficiency of OVCA1 might be an important event in ovarian tumorigenesis from the observation that expression of OVCA1 protein in ovarian tumor tissues or cell lines was reduced (3Bruening W. Prowse A.H. Schultz D.C. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Godwin A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4973-4983PubMed Google Scholar). It was also seen that exogenous expression of OVCA1 in ovarian cancer cells causes suppression of cell growth with an increased number of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that OVCA1 may play a role in the control of cell cycle/cell growth (3Bruening W. Prowse A.H. Schultz D.C. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Godwin A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4973-4983PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, study using knock-out mice demonstrated that OVCA1 regulates cell proliferation, embryonic development, and tumorigenesis (4Chen C.-M. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The fact that the tumor suppressor OVCA1 is involved in diphthamide biosynthesis on EF-2 suggests the possibility that aberrations in translational regulation may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis caused by the defect of OVCA1. So far it has been elucidated that components of the protein synthesis apparatus seem to be involved in the control of cell proliferation, and aberrations in protein synthesis are commonly encountered in established cancers (28Arora S. Yang J.-M. Kinzy T.G. Utsumi R. Okamoto T. Kitayama T. Ortiz P.A. Hait W.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6894-6899PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that removal of regulation of the expression of components of the translational machinery, such as elongation factor-1 α, a GTP-binding protein that catalyzes the binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the ribosome, predispose cells to become more susceptible to malignant transformation (29Tatsuka M. Mitsui H. Wada M. Nagata A. Nojima H. Okayama H. Nature. 1992; 359: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the activity of EF-2 kinase was markedly increased in several forms of malignancies and that inhibition of EF-2 kinase inhibited the growth of a variety of cancer cell lines (28Arora S. Yang J.-M. Kinzy T.G. Utsumi R. Okamoto T. Kitayama T. Ortiz P.A. Hait W.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6894-6899PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bagaglio D.M. Cheng E.H. Gorelick F.S. Mitsui K. Nairn A.C.

Phosphorylation of EF-2 by EF-2 kinase results in a drastic inhibition of protein synthesis, and dephosphorylation of EF-2 by phosphatase restores its activity. The phosphorylation of EF-2 directly affects the elongation stage of translation, and this represents a novel mechanism of translational control (33Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It is possible to speculate that the defect of OVCA1 also disturbs the translational regulation through the abnormal diphthamide formation on EF-2 and results in the cause of tumorigenesis. The fact that OVCA1 is a component of diphthamide biosynthetic pathway may also provide an important clue for a better understanding of the biological function of diphthamide. The biosynthesis of diphthamide represents one of the most complex post-translational modifications of an amino acid known to date and is widely well conserved (5Dunlop P.C. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4754-4758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Dunlop P.C. Adolph K.W. Bodley J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it has real importance for biological function. However, the function and role of diphthamide in cellular physiology still remains obscure. Thus far, the existence of endogenously ADP-ribosylated EF-2 and cellular ADP-ribosyltransferase activity has been found in a variety of animals and tissues. The enzyme transfers ADP-ribose from NAD to elongation factor 2, inactivating the factor like bacterial toxins (34Fendrick J.L. Iglewski W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Marzouki A. Lavergne J.-P. Reboud J.-P. Reboud A.-M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Iglewski W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the cellular ADP-ribosyltransferase and its physiological significance remain unknown. To clarify that the effect on cell proliferation, embryonic development, and tumorigenesis observed in the Ovca1 knock-out mice (4Chen C.-M. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) truly result from the defect of diphthamide, the generation of mice lacking other genes in the diphthamide biosynthesis may be helpful. The finding that OVCA1 is a component of the diphthamide synthetic pathway will shed light for the further understanding of the function of OVCA1, molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis in the defect of OVCA1, and the physiological role of diphthamide. Furthermore, a functional genetic approach utilizing the random gene trap mutants library of CHO cells described above should become a useful strategy to identify the genes responsible for specific phenotypes.

The protons are conducted from the cytoplasmic side, probably with the participation of two water channels. Mutations of titratable residues like Asp-L213 to Asn (inhibited mutant) or the double mutant Glu-L212 to Ala/Asp-L213 to Ala inhibit these electron transfer-coupled proton uptake events. The inhibition of the proton transfer (PT) process in the single mutant can be restored by a second mutation of Arg-M233 to Cys or Arg-H177 to His (revertant mutant). These revertant mutants shed light on the location of the main proton transfer pathway of wild type bRC. In contrast to the wild type and inhibited mutant bRC, the revertant mutant bRC showed notable proton uptake at Glu-H173 upon formation of the QB– state. In all of these mutants, the pKa of Asp-M17 decreased by 1.4–2.4 units with respect to the wild type bRC, whereas a significant pKa upshift of up to 5.8 units was observed at Glu-H122, Asp-H170, Glu-H173, and Glu-H230 in the revertant mutants. These residues belonging to the main PT pathway are arranged along water channel P1 localized mainly in subunit H. bRC possesses subunit H, which has no counterpart in photosystem II. Thus, bRC may possess alternative PT pathways involving water channels in subunit H, which becomes active in case the main PT pathway is blocked.

Thus, bRC may possess alternative PT pathways involving water channels in subunit H, which becomes active in case the main PT pathway is blocked. The primary event in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (bRC) 1The abbreviations used are: bRC, bacterial photosynthetic reaction center; AA mutant, E(L212)A/D(L213)A mutant; ET, electron transfer; inhibited mutant, proton transfer inactive D(L213)N single mutant; PSII, photosystem II; PT, proton transfer; QA and QB, ubiquinone in the A- and B-branch, respectively; Q–, ubiquinone in the reduced state; Q0, ubiquinone in the neutral charge state; revertant mutant, proton transfer active D(L213)A/R(M233)C double mutant. after electronic excitation of the bacteriochlorophyll a dimer, the special pair, is a charge-separation process. As a result, the special pair becomes oxidized while an electron is transferred along the A-branch cofactors from an accessory bacteriochlorophyll a via bacteriopheophytin to ubiquinone QA in the A-branch and subsequently to QB in the B-branch. After the first ET process, Q –B is protonated and forms QBH that is stabilized by a second ET and proton transfer (PT) event, resulting in the formation of the doubly protonated dihydroquinone QBH2. Seven residues (namely His-H126, His-H128, Asp-M17, Asp-L210, Glu-L212, Asp-L213, and Ser-L223) were suggested to be involved in these PT events (reviewed in Ref. 1.Nabedryk E. Breton J. Okamura M.Y. Paddock M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The single mutant Asp-L213 to Asn (D(L213)N) decreases the rate of these PT events by about a factor of 106 (2.Paddock M.L. Senft M.E. Graige M.S. Rongey S.H. Turanchik T. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 281-291Crossref Google Scholar). The decreased PT rate for the single mutant can be recovered by an additional mutation of Asn-M44 to Asp, since the side chain of Asp at M44 can substitute the removed carboxylate at L213 in the mutant bRC (3.Hanson D.K. Nance S.L. Schiffer M. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 32: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4.Rongey S.H. Paddock M.L. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9626-9632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PT in the D(L213)N mutant bRC was also restored by mutations of Arg-M233 to Cys or Arg-H177 to His, namely the double mutant D(L213)A/R(M233)C or D(L213)A/R(H177)H, respectively (2.Paddock M.L.

Similar revertants were also observed in the AA mutant bRC from Rhodobacter capsulatus (8.Maróti P. Hanson D.K. Baciou L. Schiffer M. Sebban P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 5617-5621Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in these two mutants, no carboxylate is reintroduced, and, based on the wild type bRC structure, the corresponding two mutated sites M233 and H177 have a distance of more than 10 Å from residue L213 (i.e. 13 and 17 Å, respectively) (9.Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Solitis S.M. Abresch E. Feher E. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Based on the observed structural changes close to Glu-H173 from wild type to revertant mutant bRC, the proposed mechanism to recover PT in the revertants involves Glu-H173 in the PT pathway (7.Paddock M.L. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10.Xu Q. Axelrod H.L. Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Structure. 2004; 12: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In experimental investigations on ET-coupled proton uptake at QB, it is suggested that the addition of Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions decreases the rates of ET from QA to QB (11.Utschig L.M. Ohigashi Y. Thurnauer M.C. Tiede D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8278-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12.Paddock M.L. Graige M.S. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6183-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure confirms that these metal ions bind at Asp-H124, His-H126, and His-H128 (13.Axelrod H.L. Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1542-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, these two histidines were proposed as the proton entry point. However, the rates of the first and second ET process in the H(H126)A/H(H128)A double mutant were reduced by only a factor of 10 and 4 relative to the wild type bRC (14.Adelroth P. Paddock M.L. Tehrani A. Beatty J.T. Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14538-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the metal binding effect on the ET rates was suggested to be due to electrostatic interactions rather than blocking of the proton entry point (15.Gerencser L. Maroti P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1850-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting to note that the metal binding decreases proton uptake by 2 pH units in response to the formation of Q –A and Q –B symmetrically, as suggested in the same study (15.Gerencser L. Maroti P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1850-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on spectroscopic measurements, seven titratable/polar residues His-H126, His-H128, Asp-M17, Asp-L210, Glu-L212, Asp-L213, and Ser-L223 were suggested to be involved in PT events of proton uptake at QB (reviewed in Ref. 1.Nabedryk E. Breton J. Okamura M.Y. Paddock M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These seven residues are located along three water channels, P1–P3 (reviewed in Ref. 16.Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Axelrod H.L. Soltis S.M. Rees D.C. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar), found in the crystal structure of bRC at 2.2-Å resolution (9.Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Solitis S.M. Abresch E. Feher E. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Two of these water channels, P1 and P2 (9.Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Solitis S.M. Abresch E. Feher E. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), were proposed to connect QB with the solvent on the cytoplasm side and are considered to participate in proton uptake at QB. Water channel P1 extends about 23 Å from QB via Glu-L212, Lys-H130, Glu-H122, Glu-M236 to Arg-H70, and His-H68 at the cytoplasmic side in an approximately orthogonal orientation to the membrane surface. It connects QB mainly through subunit H with Asp-H224 (P1a) or Asp-M240 (P1b) as surface residue. Water channel P2, which is oriented essentially parallel to the membrane surface, is 20 Å, slightly shorter than P1. It connects QB via Ser-L223, Asp-L213, Asn-M44, Glu-H173, and Gln-H174 with the surface residue Gln-M11 or Tyr-M3 (9.Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Solitis S.M. Abresch E. Feher E. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 16.Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Axelrod H.L. Soltis S.M. Rees D.C. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). Water channel P3, proposed more recently, connects QB via Asp-L213 with the surface-exposed Asp-M17 (16.Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Axelrod H.L. Soltis S.M. Rees D.C. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). Since there exists a patch of closely interacting acidic residues (Asp-L210, Asp-L213, Asp-M17, Asp-H124, Asp-H170, and Glu-H173) and an extended water cluster in the neighborhood, the water channels can be partially delocalized (16.Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Axelrod H.L. Soltis S.M. Rees D.C. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the changes in protonation pattern and pKa values of titratable residues with respect to the wild type bRC, focusing on the Q 0AQ –B state for inhibited (D(L213)N single mutant) and revertant (D(L213)A/R(M233)C or D(L213)A/R(H177)H double mutant) mutant bRC (10.Xu Q. Axelrod H.L. Abresch E.C. Paddock M.L. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Structure. 2004; 12: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The double mutant Glu-L212/Asp-L213 to Ala (AA mutant) is known to interrupt the ET-coupled PT reaction after the first ET event at QB (6.Hanson D.K. Baciou L. Tiede D.M. Nance S.L. Schiffer M.

To elucidate the PT pathway in bRC, we also investigated the AA mutant bRC, and the results were compared with those calculated for the revertant or wild type bRC. Atomic Coordinates and Charges—In our computations, we used crystal structures of the bRC from Rhodobacter sphaeroides for the D(L213)N single mutant with QB at the proximal position (Protein Data Bank code 1RY5), the D(L213)N/R(M233)C double mutant in the P+QB– state (Protein Data Bank code 1S00), the D(L213)N/R(H177)H double mutant (Protein Data Bank code 1RVJ) (10.Xu Q.

Abresch E. Feher E. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) in the P+Q –B state. The atomic coordinates were prepared in the same way as in previous applications (18.Ishikita H. Morra G. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3882-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8059-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Ishikita H.

The position of hydrogen atoms were energetically optimized with CHARMM (21.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) using the CHARMM22 force field. During this procedure, the positions of all nonhydrogen atoms were fixed, and all titratable groups were kept in their standard charge state (i.e. basic groups were considered to be protonated, and acidic groups were considered to be ionized). All of the other atoms whose coordinates were available in the crystal structure were not geometry optimized. Atomic partial charges of the amino acids were adopted from the all-atom CHARMM22 (21.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) parameter set. For cofactors and residues whose charges are not available in CHARMM22, we used atomic partial charges from previous applications (18.Ishikita H. Morra G. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3882-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8059-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Ishikita H.

Dielectric Volume—The dielectric volume of a protein complex is the spatial area and shape covered by molecular components of the protein that are polypeptide backbone, side chains, and cofactors but not water molecules. To facilitate a direct comparison with our past computational results, we used uniformly the same computational conditions and parameters such as atomic partial charges and dielectric constants. As a general and uniform strategy, all of the crystal waters are removed in our computations (18.Ishikita H. Morra G. Knapp E.W.

Cavities resulting after the removal of crystal water are uniformly filled with a solvent dielectric of ϵ = 80. Accordingly, the effect of the removed water molecules was considered implicitly by the high value of the dielectric constant in these cavities. A discussion on the appropriate value of the dielectric constant in proteins can be found in Refs. 26.Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Biophys.

Computation of Protonation Pattern and pKa—The computation of the energetics of the protonation pattern is based on the electrostatic continuum model by solving the linear Poisson Boltzmann equation with the program MEAD from Bashford and Karplus (31.Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). To sample the ensemble of protonation patterns by a Monte Carlo method, we used our own program Karlsberg (by B. Rabenstein; Karlsberg online manual available on the World Wide Web at agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/karlsberg/). For the first 3000 Monte Carlo scans, random protonation changes were applied for all individual titratable residues. For the remaining 7000 Monte Carlo scans, titratable residues whose protonation probability deviated by less than 10–6 from zero or unity were fixed at the corresponding pure protonation state. The detailed procedure is described in Refs. 18.Ishikita H. Morra G. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3882-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8059-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, and 23.Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10487-10496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. The dielectric constant was set to ϵP = 4 inside the protein and ϵW = 80 for water. All computations were performed at 300 K with pH 7.0 and an ionic strength of 100 mm. The linear Poisson Boltzmann equation was solved using a three-step gridfocusing procedure with a starting grid resolution of 2.5 Å, an intermediate grid resolution of 1.0 Å, and a final grid resolution of 0.3 Å. Monte Carlo sampling yields the probabilities [A–] and [HA] of the deprotonated and protonated state of the titratable residue A, respectively. With the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH=pKa+log[A−][HA] (Eq. 1) the pKa value can be calculated as the pH where the concentration of [A–] and [HA] are equal. The protonation patterns were computed for the QA0QB– redox state if not otherwise stated. The procedures to obtain pKa of titratable residues are equivalent to those of the redox potential for redox-active groups, although in the latter case the Nernst equation is applied instead of Equation 1 (33.Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Bophys. J. 1999; 28: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, the accuracy of the present pKa computations is directly comparable with that obtained for recent computations on redox-active cofactors in bRC (18.Ishikita H. Morra G. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3882-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8059-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20.Ishikita H. Loll B. Biesiadka J. Galstyan A. Saenger W. Knapp E.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), photosystem I (PSI) (34.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52002-52011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and PSII (35.Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem.

Remarkably, the proton uptake at Glu-L212 in the revertant mutants was slightly smaller than in the wild type and inhibited mutant bRC. The revertant mutants showed a small but significant increase of protonation also at Glu-H173, whereas the wild type bRC does not show a protonation at this residue. In experiments, the mutation of Glu-H173 to Gln was found to slow down the first and second ET process from QA to QB, presumably by affecting the kinetics of PT to QB, where Glu-H173 may participate (43.Takahashi E. Wraight C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2640-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in steady-state FTIR measurements (44.Nabedryk E. Breton J.

The latter fact implies a small pKa for Glu-H173, whereas at the same time, it does not exclude transient protonation that may be required for the PT events at QB. Hence, the protonation state at Glu-H173 in the revertant mutants may suggest also a participation of Glu-H173 in the PT process coupled with formation of Q –B (7.Paddock M.L. Feher G. Okamura M.Y.

This reduced proton uptake at Glu-L212 was approximately compensated by additional proton uptake at Glu-H173. The observed proton uptake at Glu-H173 in revertant mutant bRC implies a pKa increase upon formation of the QA0QB– state. Thus, with respect to wild type bRC, we observed a considerable increase of the calculated pKa for Glu-H173 by about 3.5 units in both revertant mutants (Table II). It has been suggested that a rearrangement of the side chains of charged residues like Arg-H177 increases the pKa for Glu-H173 such that it can function equally well as proton donor and acceptor as needed in the PT chain connecting the solvent with QB (10.Xu Q.

Notably, all mutant bRC considered here showed a pKa decrease for Asp-M17 by 1.4–2.4 units with respect to wild type bRC (Table II).

The vNTS2 polypeptide is 281 amino acids in length, which is 135 amino acids shorter than the full-length isoform. Immunohistochemical and radioligand binding studies revealed that the HA-tagged recombinant vNTS2 receptor is poorly targeted to plasma membranes in transfected COS-7 cells. Binding studies also showed that the truncated receptor displayed a 5000-fold lower affinity for neurotensin (NT) than its full-length counterpart (IC50 of 10 μm and 2 nm, respectively). Yet NT binding induced efficient internalization of receptor-ligand complexes in vNTS2-transfected cells. Furthermore, it produced a rapid (<5 min) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) pathway, indicating functional coupling of the variant receptor. This activation is sustained (>1 h) and is also produced by the NTS2 agonist levocabastine. Western blotting experiments suggested that vNTS2 is not expressed in monomeric form in the rat central nervous system. However, it does appear to form a variety of multimeric complexes, including homodimers and heterodimers, with the full-length NTS2. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation studies in dually transfected cells demonstrated that the two receptor isoforms can form stable associations.

NT signaling is mediated by interaction of the peptide with either one of three different receptor subtypes, referred to as NTS1, NTS2, and NTS3. NTS1 and NTS2 belong to the family of seven transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and exhibit high and low affinity for NT, respectively (10Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S.

Pharmacological and biochemical studies have indicated that NTS1 is also involved in the modulation of intracellular levels of cGMP (18Amar S. Mazella J. Checler F. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Biochem.

Stimulation of NTS2 was found to induce Ca2+-dependent chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing the mouse receptor (23Botto J.M. Guillemare E. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 223: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that stimulation of NTS2 with either NT or the selective NTS2 ligand, levocabastine, activates the ERK1/2 cascade both in CHO cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding rat or human NTS2 (24Gendron L. Perron A. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. Sarret P. Beaudet A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (25Sarret P.

The cDNA sequence of the mouse NTS2 receptor is composed of four exons separated by three introns (26Sun Y.J. Maeno H. Aoki S. Wada K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 95: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The first exon encodes the region containing TM domains 1–4, whereas exons 2–4 encode the region containing TM 5–6, TM 6, and TM 7, respectively. The existence of a deletion-type NTS2 mRNA encoding a C-terminally truncated form of the receptor, which lacks an internal 181-bp sequence, has been reported in the mouse (27Botto J.M. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both mouse NTS2 mRNA isoforms are derived from a single nts2 gene, the short form resulting from alternative splicing of the primary NTS2 transcript at intron 2a (26Sun Y.J. Maeno H. Aoki S. Wada K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 95: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The corresponding truncated NTS2 mRNA encodes a 282-amino acid protein (27Botto J.M. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other GPCRs encoding sequences have been shown to similarly generate truncated receptor isoforms through alternative splicing, exon skipping, or intron retention (28Kilpatrick G.J. Dautzenberg F.M. Martin G.R. Eglen R.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Many of these splice variants, such as the truncated forms of the prostanoid receptor EP3 and endothelin B receptor (29Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 30Nambi P. Wu H.L. Ye D. Gagnon A. Elshourbagy N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar), differ from their full-length counterparts in their intracellular C-terminal tail. Others show a disparity in the third intracellular loop (e.g. the D2 dopamine receptor variant (31Monsma Jr., F.J. McVittie L.D. Gerfen C.R. Mahan L.C. Sibley D.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar)) or in the transmembrane (TM) domains (e.g. the D3 dopamine receptor isoform (32Schmauss C. Haroutunian V. Davis K.L. Davidson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8942-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). Yet others differ from the full-length receptor in their extracellular N-terminal loop as exemplified by the truncated form of the angiotensin II receptor (33Nishimatsu S. Koyasu N. Sugaya T. Ohnishi J. Yamagishi T. Murakami K. Miyazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Splice variations may have little or no effect on ligand binding properties (34Minneman K.P. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 108-116PubMed Google Scholar). However, some deletions, particularly in TM domains, were shown to have significant impact on ligand recognition. For example, a short variant of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor lacking TM domains 6 and 7 was reported to be totally devoid of serotonergic binding activity (35Canton H. Emeson R.B. Barker E.L. Backstrom J.R. Lu J.T. Chang M.S. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the 5-TM domain isoforms of the D3 and endothelin A receptors exhibit no ligand binding (32Schmauss C. Haroutunian V. Davis K.L. Davidson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8942-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y.F. Jeffery S. Burchill S.A. Berry P.A. Kaski J.C. Carter N.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Shortened receptor isoforms may also display aberrant or impaired coupling, even in the face of normal ligand binding. For instance, the four alternatively spliced isoforms of the EP3 receptor, which vary only in their C-terminal tails, couple to different G proteins and activate diverse second messenger systems (29Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The generation of alternatively spliced GPCRs may also affect the function of their full-length counterparts. Thus, coexpression of the full-length gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor together with that of its C-terminally truncated isoform, which is incapable of ligand binding and signal transduction, was found to impair targeting of the full-length receptor to the plasma membrane (37Grosse R. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Finally, alternative splicing of GPCRs has been associated with a number of genetic disorders (38Grabowski P.J. Black D.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For instance, splice variants of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptors have been documented in primary human prostate carcinomas and diverse human cancer cell lines (39Rekasi Z. Czompoly T. Schally A.V. Halmos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10561-10566Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to determine whether the splice variant form of the NTS2 receptor originally identified in mouse brain extracts was also expressed in rat brain and to investigate the binding, internalization, and signaling properties of this receptor isoform, as compared with those of the full-length NTS2 receptor, in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate the existence of a functional 5-TM domain variant form of NTS2 (vNTS2) in rat brain and suggest that this truncated receptor may play a role in the modulation of NT effects in the CNS. Expression of Rat vNTS2 mRNA—In order to assess the expression of vNTS2 mRNA in rat CNS and spinal cord, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, St-Constant, Quebec, Canada) were killed by decapitation. The brain and spinal cord were rapidly removed, and the areas of interest were dissected on ice. Samples were solubilized in lysis buffer (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.97% β-mercaptoethanol), and total RNA was extracted using the SV RNA Isolation System kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. These total mRNAs (2 μg) were then reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega, Madison, WI). First strand cDNAs were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR in a final reaction volume of 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 unit of TaqDNA polymerase) using a set of primers (5′-GAATGTGCTGGTGTCCTTCGC-3′ and 5′-ACTTGTATTTCTCCCAGGCTG-3′) derived from bases 667–1287 in the sequence reported previously (11Chalon P. Vita N. Kaghad M. Guillemot M. Bonnin J. Delpech B. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) for the rat NTS2 receptor. The oligonucleotides used are flanking the region where the deletion occurs in the mouse vNTS2 receptor (27Botto J.M. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and allow the amplification of fragments of predicted sizes of 620 and 439 bp, as demonstrated previously (25Sarret P. Gendron L. Kilian P. Nguyen H.M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. Beaudet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36233-36243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in rat cerebellar granule cell cultures. As internal standard for semi-quantitative analysis, the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was concurrently amplified using primers 5′-CAAGATTGTCAGCAATGCAT-3′ (sense, nucleotides 511–530) and 5′-CTTGATGTCATCATACTTGGC-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 856 to 836), which target a 346-bp sequence in the rat GAPDH gene. The ratios of NTS2 over GAPDH mRNAs and between the NTS2 receptor isoforms were determined by densitometry, using NIH Scion Image Software. Calculations and statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2000 (Microsoft) and Prism 3.02 (Graph Pad Software). Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (Bonferroni's multiple comparison test). Total RNA samples were subjected to reverse transcription in the absence of the enzyme to control for intrinsic contamination by genomic DNA, and the reaction was performed without RNA to control for contamination during the experiment. Gene Constructs—The HA-tagged cDNA encoding the rat variant NTS2 receptor was obtained through reverse transcription of vNTS2 mRNA isolated from rat brain by PCR using nucleotides (5′-ACAGAGATGGCATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGAGACCAGCAGTCCGTGG-3′) and (5′-TCATACTTGTATTTCTCCCAGGCT-3′) as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The former contains the HA tag sequence followed by the 44–61-bp sequence of the rat NTS2 receptor mRNA (11Chalon P. Vita N. Kaghad M. Guillemot M. Bonnin J. Delpech B. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas the latter corresponds to the sequence 1268–1291 bp of the open reading frame of the rat nts2 receptor gene. The predicted sizes of the amplified fragments were 1.6 kb for the full-length NTS2 and 1.4 kb for the spliced variant form of the receptor. Fidelity of PCR amplification was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the ABIPRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer in the MOBIX laboratory (McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). The PCR product corresponding to vNTS2 was purified from a 1% low melting agarose gel and subcloned into the pTargeT expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfections—For MAPK kinase activity and radioligand binding experiments, CHO and COS-7 cells were stably transfected with the HA-vNTS2 construct. Briefly, cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) F-12 and DMEM with high glucose, respectively, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 70–80% confluence and transfected with 4 μg of the HA-vNTS2-pTargeT plasmid by using the Lipofectamine™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h at 37 °C, positive cells were selected with a FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences) following sequential labeling with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) directed toward the HA epitope (1/500; Roche Applied Science) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1/1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stable CHO (for MAPK kinase activity) and COS-7 (for radioligand binding experiments) transfectants were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. For Western blotting and immunocytochemistry experiments, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 7 ml of a mixture of 100 μm chloroquine and 0.25 mg/ml DEAE-dextran containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA (HA-vNTS2, HA-NTS2 (40Sarret P. Perron A. Stroh T. Beaudet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 461: 520-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), untagged NTS2, or a mixture of HA-vNTS2 and untagged NTS2) in DMEM high glucose. After 2 h at 37 °C, the solution was removed, and the cells were treated for 1 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), rinsed twice with PBS, and returned to the 37 °C incubator in growth medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Immunocytochemistry on COS-7 Cells—To assess the subcellular distribution of vNTS2, COS-7 cells transfected with HA-vNTS2 cDNA were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in PBS, pH 7.4, and preincubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) with a blocking solution consisting of 5% normal goat serum, 2% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (BDH, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody directed toward the 7–21-amino acid sequence in the N-terminal segment of the rat NTS2 receptor (1/25,000; made on demand by Affinity BioReagents, ABR, Golden, CO), which recognizes both short and long isoforms of the receptor (40Sarret P. Perron A. Stroh T. Beaudet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 461: 520-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), together with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5, 1/500) directed toward the HA epitope in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at RT with a mixture of Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1/750; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For specificity controls, cells were incubated with anti-NTS2 peptide antiserum preadsorbed with the antigenic peptide. For cell surface immunolabeling experiments, COS-7 cells expressing the HA-tagged vNTS2 receptor were stained using the Alexa 488-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA IgG (1/500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-depleted medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at RT, and washed again with PBS prior to examination. For dual immunolocalization of vNTS2 and NTS2, COS-7 cells co-expressing HA-tagged vNTS2 and the untagged NTS2 were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody in concert with rabbit NTS2 peptide antiserum (1/10,000) in PBS containing 1% NGS and 0.05% Triton X-100. This second NTS2 antiserum is directed toward a synthetic peptide (YSFRLWGSPRNPSLG) corresponding to the 397–412 predicted amino acid sequence in the C-terminal tail of the rat NTS2 receptor (custom-raised by Affinity BioReagents, ABR, Golden, CO) that specifically recognizes the full-length receptor. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at RT with a mixture of Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1/750; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were examined with a Zeiss 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with argon2 (488 nm) and He/Ne1 (543 nm) lasers (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were processed using the Zeiss 510 laser-scanning microscope software and Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—For immunoprecipitation studies, COS-7 cells expressing either the HA epitope-tagged vNTS2 or the untagged full-length NTS2 were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 nm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete™ inhibitor tablets; Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were then precleared with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 45 min at 4 °C and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10) directed toward the HA epitope (1/400; Roche Applied Science). The protein A-Sepharose was gently shaken in lysis buffer containing 1% BSA for 30 min at RT before use. Receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated with 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and resolved by using 10% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen). Nonspecific sites were blocked by 0.1% Tween 20 (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) and 10% milk powder (Carnation, Don Mills, Ontario, Canada) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with rabbit N-terminally directed NTS2 antibody (1/10,000) overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at RT (1/4000; Amersham Biosciences). Specificity of antiserum was confirmed by preadsorption of the NTS2 antibody overnight with an excess of immunizing peptide (2 μg/ml of adsorbing peptide at a final antibody dilution of 1/10,000). For cell surface labeling experiments, COS-7 cells expressing HA-vNTS2 or co-expressing HA-vNTS2 and untagged full-length NTS2 were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with the N-terminally directed NTS2 peptide antiserum (1/10,000) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 2 h at RT. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. They were treated with 100 μl of RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, lysed, and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate antibody-bound cell surface receptors. Immunoprecipitates were processed as described above. Membranes were probed with rabbit N-terminally directed NTS2 antibody (1/2000), followed by a 1-h incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1/4000; Amersham Biosciences). For heterodimerization experiments, COS-7 cells expressing the HA epitope-tagged vNTS2 together with the untagged full-length NTS2 were treated as described above. Receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated using the rat anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; 1/400), and immunoblotting was then carried out with the N-terminally or C-terminally directed NTS2 antisera (1/10,000). To determine which molecular forms of the vNTS2 protein are expressed in rat CNS, Western blotting experiments were performed on membranes from rat spinal cord, as this structure had been shown previously (27Botto J.M. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to express among the highest levels of vNTS2 mRNA in the mouse. Rat spinal cord membrane preparations were obtained as described previously (40Sarret P. Perron A. Stroh T. Beaudet A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 461: 520-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Approximately 70 μg of protein from each sample were loaded onto 8% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Membranes were incubated with the affinity-purified N-terminal specific anti-NTS2 rabbit antibody (1/1250) overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% ovalbumin and 1% BSA, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody in PBS with 5% milk powder. Specificity of antiserum was confirmed by preadsorption with the antigenic peptide. Receptor Binding Experiments—For radioactive ligand binding experiments, COS-7 cells expressing HA-vNTS2 were grown on 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in DMEM high glucose medium for 72 h before the assay. Cells were equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, HEPES 20 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.2% BSA and 0.1% glucose and incubated with 0.4 nm125I-labeled NT (1670 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C in 250 μl of Earle's buffer containing 0.8 mmortho-phenanthroline in the presence of increasing concentrations (from 10–10 to 10–3m) of nonradioactive NT. The cells were then washed twice with Earle's buffer and harvested in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and the radioactivity content was measured in a gamma counter. IC50 values were determined from competition curves as the concentration of unlabeled ligand necessary to inhibit 50% of 125I-labeled NT-specific binding. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of a 10,000-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, which represented less than 1% of total counts. For fluorescent ligand labeling, COS-7 cells expressing the HA epitope-tagged vNTS2 were grown on poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in DMEM high glucose medium for 24 h. They were then equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% glucose in the presence or in the absence of 10 μm phenylarsine oxide, an endocytosis inhibitor, and incubated for 30 min in the same buffer with 50 nm of Nα-BODIPY-NT-(2–13) (Fluo-NT) in the presence or absence of 1 mm nonfluorescent NT. Cells were air-dried, mounted on glass slides with Aquamount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and examined by confocal microscopy as described above. Measurement of MAP Kinase Activity—CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged vNTS2 were split into 6-well plates and incubated for 1–2 days in DMEM-F-12 at 37 °C. Cells were then serum-starved overnight, pretreated or not with MEK inhibitors PD98059 (50 μm) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or U0126 (10 μm) (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min, and incubated with NT (0.1–10 μm) or levocabastine (1 μm) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium and the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 μm staurosporine and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. After 30 min of incuba"

https://openalex.org/W2012213600,"The arsRDABC operon of Escherichia coli plasmid R773 encodes the ArsAB pump that catalyzes extrusion of the metalloids As(III) and Sb(III), conferring metalloid resistance. The catalytic subunit, ArsA, is an ATPase with two homologous halves, A1 and A2, connected by a short linker. Each half contains a nucleotide binding domain. The overall rate of ATP hydrolysis is slow in the absence of metalloid and is accelerated by metalloid binding. The results of photolabeling of ArsA with the ATP analogue 8-azidoadenosine 5′-[α-32P]-triphosphate at 4 °C indicate that metalloid stimulation correlates with a >10-fold increase in affinity for nucleotide. To investigate the relative contributions of the two nucleotide binding domains to catalysis, a thrombin site was introduced in the linker. This allowed discrimination between incorporation of labeled nucleotides into the two halves of ArsA. The results indicate that both the A1 and A2 nucleotide binding domains bind and hydrolyze trinucleotide, even in the absence of metalloid. Sb(III) increases the affinity of the A1 nucleotide binding domain to a greater extent than the A2 nucleotide binding domain. The ATP analogue labeled with 32P at the γ position was used to measure hydrolysis of trinucleotide at 37 °C. Under these catalytic conditions, both nucleotide binding domains hydrolyze ATP, but hydrolysis in A1 is stimulated to a greater degree by Sb(III) than A2. These results suggest that the two homologous halves of the ArsA may be functionally nonequivalent.

In Escherichia coli the ArsAB pump encoded by the ars operon of plasmid R773 confers resistance to arsenicals and antimonials (1Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). ArsA is the catalytic subunit of the pump that hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of the trivalent forms of the two metalloids. ATP hydrolysis is coupled to extrusion of As(III) or Sb(III) through ArsB, which serves both as a membrane anchor for ArsA and as the substrate-conducting pathway. Upon overexpression, ArsA exists primarily as a soluble protein in the cytosol. Soluble ArsA has been purified and characterized and has been shown to be an As(III)/Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase (2Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ArsA is composed of homologous N-terminal (A1) and C-terminal (A2) halves that are connected by a short linker (3Li J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and both NBDs are required for ATPase activity and metalloid transport (5Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

A novel metalloid binding domain located at the A1-A2 interface diametrically opposite to the NBDs modulates ATPase activity (4Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Two stretches of residues, D142TAPTGH148 in A1 and D447TAPTGH453 in A2, physically connect the metalloid binding domain to the A1 and A2 NBDs, respectively. The metalloid binding domain is composed of three metalloid atoms, each of which is coordinated by two protein ligands, one of which is donated by A1 and the other by A2. Thus the metalloid atoms serve as the “molecular glue” that brings the two halves of the protein together, activating catalysis. The basal rate of catalysis has been thought to reflect the activity of only NBD1 and thus was termed unisite catalysis (9Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23815-23820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The metalloid-activated rate, termed multisite catalysis, has been proposed to be the result of stimulation of the activity of both NBD1 and NBD2.In this study, that hypothesis was tested with the use of the ATP analogue 8-azidoATP, which has been used to examine the catalytic mechanism of other transport ATPases such as the F1 ATPase (11Hollemans M. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9307-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the P-glycoprotein (12Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the label from either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP at low temperature allows measurement of nucleotide binding. The apparent Kd value for trinucleotide of wild type ArsA was decreased more than 10-fold by Sb(III). Comparison of incorporation of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP under catalytic conditions indicates whether hydrolysis of the trinucleotide has occurred. As expected, nucleotide hydrolysis was stimulated by Sb(III). To distinguish between events at NBD1 and NBD2, a thrombin site was introduced into the linker that connects A1 and A2. Following labeling and thrombin digestion, A1 and A2 migrated with different mobilities on SDS-PAGE. Under noncatalytic conditions, both NBD1 and NBD2 bound 8-azido[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP. Under catalytic conditions, both NBD1 and NBD2 hydrolyzed the trinucleotide in the presence or absence of Sb(III). In both cases, hydrolysis was dominated by NBD1 activity. Thus the two NBDs have different properties, suggesting that they may have different functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—8-Azido[α-32P]ATP (15–20 Ci/mmol) and 8-azido[γ-32P]-ATP (15–20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies (Lexington, KY). Restriction grade thrombin was purchased from EMD Biosciences. Unless otherwise mentioned, all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.Introduction of a Thrombin Site in ArsA—A thrombin site was introduced in the arsA gene by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Plasmid pABH6 containing wild type arsA and arsB genes was used as template (14Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Biometals. 2000; 13: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The thrombin site was engineered using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-AACCAACGCAGAAAGTGAACGCGGAATCGCATCAGGCCGCTGTTGCAG-3′ that introduced an alanine residue following Asp-311 and an arginine residue following Pro-313 (changes are underlined). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire arsA gene using a CEQ2000 DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter). ArsA containing the thrombin site will henceforth be referred to as ThArsA.Purification of [His]6-tagged ArsA ATPases—Wild type or ThArsA were purified from cultures of E. coli strain JM109 harboring either the wild type or tharsA plasmids. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium to an A600 of 0.6, at which point 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce ArsA expression. The cells were grown for another 3 h before being harvested by centrifugation. The soluble ArsA proteins were purified as described earlier (14Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Biometals. 2000; 13: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The concentration of ArsA in purified preparations was determined from the absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 33,480 m–1 cm–1 (2Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was assayed using an NADH-coupled assay method (15Kuroda M. Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P.

The bandwidths for emission and excitation monochromators were 4 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 337 nm. The fluorescence of the buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5) alone was subtracted from the protein spectra. 1.25 μm ArsA, 5 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm potassium antimonyl tartrate were added as indicated.Binding of 8-AzidoATP to ArsA—Either ArsA or ThArsA (0.5 mg/ml) in buffer A (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA) was incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 10 min with either 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/nmol). Routinely, 10 μm of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP was used. However, for affinity measurements ArsA was incubated with increasing concentration of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP as indicated in the figure legends. The samples were cross-linked by irradiation with a UV lamp (365 nm) for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the ArsA band was quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software. The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 2000.Labeling and Separation of A1 and A2 Halves of ArsA—Purified ThArsA (0.5 mg/ml) in buffer A was incubated in the dark at 4 °C or 37 °C for 10 min with either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP (10 μCi/nmol) or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/nmol), in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III). The samples were cross-linked by irradiation with a UV lamp (365 nm) for 10 min at 4 °C. The labeled proteins were incubated at room temperature for 3 h in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit of thrombin. Following proteolysis, the two halves of ArsA were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels, and the radioactivity incorporated into the ArsA bands was quantified as described above. The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 2000.RESULTSSb(III) Increases the Affinity of ArsA for Trinucleotide—To determine the effect of metalloid on ArsA activity, purified wild type enzyme was incubated individually with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP at either 4 °C or 37 °C (Fig. 2). At 4 °C the amount of [32P] incorporated was similar whether the label was in the α or γ position, showing that the assay reflects trinucleotide binding under noncatalytic conditions. The addition of Sb(III) increased the amount of label incorporated with the label in either position. Under catalytic conditions (37 °C), the amount of label incorporated with 8-azido[α-32P]ATP remained the same as at 4 °C. The amount of label incorporated from 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP decreased substantially with higher temperature, both in the presence and absence of Sb(III), reflecting release of the γ-phosphate.Fig. 2Binding and hydrolysis of 8-azidoATP by wild type ArsA. Wild type ArsA (25 μg) was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C or 37 °C with either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III). Samples were photocross-linked and electrophoresed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP incorporation into the ArsA bands at 4 °C (filled bars) or 37 °C (open bars) was quantified on a PhosphorImager and expressed as arbitrary units. The error bars represent the average of three experiments calculated with SigmaPlot 2000. For clarity, incorporation was normalized to the value of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP incorporation at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of Sb(III) on the affinity of ArsA for 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was determined (Fig. 3). The apparent affinity for trinucleotide was ∼15 μm in the presence of Sb(III). In the absence of metalloid the affinity was difficult to measure accurately but appeared to be at least 10-fold less than in the presence of Sb(III). Thus, a major effect of metalloid binding was to increase the affinity of ArsA for trinucleotide.Fig. 3Affinity of wild type ArsA for 8-azidoATP.A, wild type ArsA (25 μg) was incubated with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III) and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP are depicted on the autoradiogram.

Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, limited trypsin treatment of ArsA results in nearly complete digestion of the A2 half of ArsA (18Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, the sequence for a thrombin enzyme cleavage site was introduced into the linker that connects the two halves of ArsA. Within limits, neither the length nor the sequence of the linker is critical for ArsA function (3Li J. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The site was created by the addition of an alanine residue following Asp-311 and an arginine residue following Pro-313. Thrombin cleavage would be predicted to produce an A1 fragment of 315 residues (33,746 Da) and an A2 fragment of 276 residues (30,507 Da).There was little difference between the arsenite resistance conferred by the wild type arsA gene and the tharsA gene containing the sequence for the thrombin site (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the gene product is functional in vivo. To compare their properties in vitro, wild type ArsA and ThArsA were purified. In an average of three separate preparations, wild type ArsA had a specific activity of 70 ± 17 nmol/min/mg of protein in the absence of Sb(III) and 779 ± 68 nmol/min/mg of protein in the presence of 0.1 mm Sb(III). The corresponding activities for the ThArsA were 74 ± 46 and 404 ± 49 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Thus, although lower than wild type, ThArsA exhibits substantial stimulation by Sb(III). ATP hydrolysis elicited similar conformational changes in the wild type enzyme and the thrombin site-containing derivative, as demonstrated by ligand-dependent changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence (Fig. 5). During ATP hydrolysis, ArsA attains a conformation in which the fluorescence of Trp-159 is enhanced (19Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the absence of Sb(III), the decay of this fluorescent conformer is a rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle. Binding of Sb(III) accelerates the decay of this intermediate and consequently stimulates the rate of hydrolysis (20Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and ThArsA exhibited similar enhancements of protein fluorescence during ATP hydrolysis and similar rates of quenching following addition of Sb(III). To measure binding of trinucleotide to ThArsA, the protein was labeled with 8-azido[α-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III) at 4 °C (Fig. 6). ThArsA exhibited binding of trinucleotide that was stimulated by Sb(III). The apparent Kd value in the presence of Sb(III) was ∼30 μm within a factor of two of that of the wild type. The Sb-stimulated catalytic properties of the ThArsA derivative warrant further analysis.Fig. 4ThArsA confers arsenite resistance in E. coli. Overnight cultures of E. coli strain JM109 bearing wild type and tharsA plasmids were diluted 100-fold into fresh Luria-Bertani medium containing the indicated concentrations of sodium arsenite. Expression of the ars genes was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 6 h of growth at 37 °C, the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Cells contained the following plasmids: triangles, wild type (arsA arsB); squares, ThArsA (tharsA arsB); and circles, pALTER-1 vector.

Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were acquired as described under “Experimental Procedures” upon the addition of ATP, Mg2+, and Sb(III) to wild type and ThArsA.

From Coomassie Blue staining, cleavage of wild type ArsA by thrombin with time was observed from the 63-kDa intact protein to a slightly smaller form (ArsA′) (Fig. 7A) even though ArsA does not contain an authentic thrombin site. From immunoblotting results, the cleavage site could be localized to the C-terminal end of the protein. Digestion at the C terminus was observed with every commercial batch of thrombin, so it is unlikely the result of a contaminating protease. Both forms were observed with a polyclonal antibody directed against entire ArsA (Fig. 7B) and against the N-terminal 18 kDa designated N18 (Fig. 7C). Only the full-length protein was observed when an antibody to the C-terminal six-histidine tag was used (Fig. 7D), indicating that the tag had been lost in the shorter form. Treatment of ThArsA with thrombin resulted in time-dependent formation of two fragments. The larger fragment corresponded to the A1 half of ArsA because it reacted with the N18 antibody but not the His-tag antibody. With time the lower band was converted to a slightly smaller form that differed in mass by about 5 kDa, similar to the difference between ArsA and ArsA′ (Fig. 7B). Neither reacted with anti-N18 (Fig. 7C), showing that they are derived from the A2 half of the protein. The larger of two reacted with the His-tag antibody but the smaller did not (Fig. 7D). Thus the larger is converted to the smaller by cleavage of about 5 kDa from the C terminus of ArsA.Fig. 7Thrombin digestion of wild type and ThArsA. Either wild type or ThArsA (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with thrombin (1 unit) at room temperature in a buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. At the indicated times, samples were withdrawn, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, followed by Coomassie Blue staining (A) or Western blot analysis using anti-ArsA (B), anti-N18 (C), and anti-His tag (D) antibodies. The experiment shown in this figure was repeated numerous times, and the data shown are representative of the results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding and Hydrolysis of 8-AzidoATP by NBD1 and NBD2—ThArsA was labeled with either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III) at either 4 °C or 37 °C. This allowed measurement of both binding and hydrolysis of nucleotide. The eight samples were digested with thrombin and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8A), and the autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 8B). Under noncatalytic conditions (4 °C), both NBDs were labeled with either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP. The amount of label incorporated into NBD1 was always greater than into NBD2. Although this assay does not permit one to obtain absolute Vmax values, the data indicate that there is an increase in Vmax for both NBD1 and NBD2. We conclude from the data in Fig. 8 that both NBD1 and NBD2 bind nucleotide, but the two are nonequivalent.Fig. 8Nucleotide hydrolysis mediated by NBD1 and NBD2.A, ThArsA (25 μg) was incubated with 10 μm of either 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP at 4 °C or 37 °C, photocross-linked, and digested with thrombin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental conditions are depicted on the autoradiogram.

The experiment shown in this figure was repeated twice, and the data shown are representative of the results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Notably, binding to both NBD1 and NBD2 was increased by Sb(III). Binding to the two NBDs was measured as a function of trinucleotide concentration (Fig. 9). In the absence of Sb(III), the apparent affinity at either site was too low to quantify. In the presence of Sb(III), binding was increased in both sites. Binding to NBD1 was saturable with an apparent Kd of ∼35 μm, which is similar to that of the intact ThArsA, but the affinity for NBD2 was greater than 70 μm.Fig. 9Affinity of 8-azidoATP for NBD1 and NBD2 in the presence and absence of Sb(III). ThArsA (25 μg) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III), photocross-linked and digested with thrombin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioactivity incorporated into (A) NBD1 and (B) NBD2 was quantified and expressed as a function of nucleotide concentration. The lines represent a nonlinear least squares fit to a hyperbolic function using SigmaPlot 2000. The error bars represent the average of three experiments calculated with SigmaPlot 2000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under catalytic conditions (37 °C), the amount of label derived from 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP was considerably less than under noncatalytic conditions, presumably from liberation of the γ-phosphate (Fig. 8B). Loss of label from 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP was observed in both NBD1 and NBD2. Thus, we can conclude that both nucleotide binding domains hydrolyze trinucleotide in the absence of Sb(III) and that ArsA does not conduct unisite hydrolysis. Hydrolysis in both NBDs was stimulated by Sb(III).Hydrolysis was measured as a function of trinucleotide concentration (Fig. 10). Because there was somewhat less binding of 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C compared with 4 °C, hydrolysis was determined from difference between incorporation of label from 8-azido[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C. The data shown in Fig. 10 are the average of three separate experiments, and the Km values are the best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot 2000. The apparent Km for 8-azidoATP in NBD1 in the absence of Sb(III) was >70 μm. The apparent Km for 8-azidoATP in NBD1 in the presence of Sb(III) was ∼18 μm. The apparent Km for 8-azidoATP in NBD2 in the absence of Sb(III) was >70 μm. The apparent Km for 8-azidoATP in NBD2 in the presence of Sb(III) was 35 μm. Thus, in NBD1 Sb(III) produced an ∼4-fold increase in affinity for trinucleotide, whereas in NBD2 the Sb(III)-dependent increase in affinity was somewhat less. Although there was lower incorporation in both, there was a clear and reproducible difference between NBD1 and NBD2 in the amount of trinucleotide hydrolyzed.Fig. 10ATP hydrolysis mediated by NBD1 and NBD2 in the presence and absence of Sb(III). ThArsA (25 μg) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Sb(III) photocrosslinked and digested with thrombin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following electrophoresis, the radioactivity incorporated into (A) NBD1 and (B) NBD2 was quantified. Each data point was generated by subtracting the amount of [32P] incorporated in the presence of 8-azido[γ-32P]ATP from the amount of [32P] incorporated in the presence of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP. This difference was taken as a measure of ATP hydrolysis. The data are expressed as a function of the nucleotide concentration. Km values and error bars were determined by the best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation from the average of three experiments calculated with SigmaPlot 2000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe ArsAB pump provides resistance to trivalent metalloids in E. coli.

To better understand the function of PRAM-1, we have undertaken the identification of its partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here, we show that the proline-rich domain of PRAM-1 interacted with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK-1)-interacting protein of 55 kDa (HIP-55, also called SH3P7 and Abp1) known to stimulate the activity of HPK-1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Overexpression of PRAM-1 in the NB4 APL cell line increased arsenic trioxide-induced JNK activation through a caspase 3-like-dependent activity. Dissociation of the SH3 domain from the rest of the HIP-55 protein was observed in the NB4 APL cell line treated with arsenic trioxide due to specific cleavage by caspase 3-like enzymes. The cleavage of HIP-55 correlated with the induction of PRAM-1 mRNA and protein expression. Taken together, our results suggest that the caspase 3-cleaved SH3 domain of HIP-55 is likely involved in PRAM-1-mediated JNK activation upon arsenic trioxide-induced differentiation of NB4 cells.

PML·RARα would therefore recruit a histone deacetylase complex to RA response elements leading to the repression of RA target genes critical to myeloid differentiation.

HIP-55 is also involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (31Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J.

HIP-55 is cleaved by caspase 3-like enzymes during apoptosis leading to the dissociation of its actin-binding domain from its SH3 domain (33Chen Y.R. Kori R. John B. Tan T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To decipher PRAM-1 mechanism of action, we have undertaken the identification of its partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here we show that the proline-rich domain of PRAM-1 interacts with the SH3 domain of HIP-55. Dissociation of the SH3 domain from the rest of the HIP-55 protein was found in NB4 APL cells treated with As2O3 due to a specific cleavage by caspase 3-like enzymes. We show that PRAM-1 mRNA and protein expressions were induced in As2O3-treated NB4 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of PRAM-1 in NB4 cells potentiated As2O3-induced JNK activation. Cell Lines, Culture, and Differentiation—NB4 cells (34Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The COS-7 cell line was grown in Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Exponentially grown NB4 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml 16 h prior to As2O3 (ICN) treatment. Cell differentiation was determined by: (i) the percentage of nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma)-positive cells and (ii) morphological changes on cytospin slides stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (VWR Scientific). For the caspase inhibition, cells were preincubated for 30 min with Z-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem) before As2O3 treatment. Plasmid Constructs—The PRAM-1 coding sequence was subcloned into the pGBKT7 (Clontech) and into a pSG5 (35Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar)-derived vector to direct the expression of PRAM-1. The PRAM-1Δ-(183–613) mutant was generated by the internal PvuII fragment deletion. The full-length PRAM-1 cDNA was subcloned into the pBabe retroviral vector (36Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). The human HIP-55 open reading frame was obtained by PCR amplification using bone marrow cDNA and subcloned into: (i) a pSG5-derived vector to direct the expression of HIP-55 fused to the FLAG epitope at its amino terminus (pSG5FN-HIP-55) and (ii) pGST, a derivative of pGEX-3X, in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) sequence. Constructs encoding the SH3 domain of HIP-55-(362–430) were amplified by PCR. The hemagglutinin-tagged HPK-1 (pcDNA3-HPK-1:HA) expression vector was a gift from Dr. F. Kiefer (23Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The pGST-c-Jun-(1–223) was a gift from Dr. B. Chatton. Construction of the pSG5FN-HIP-55D361A mutated vector was achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For this, we used a mutated oligonucleotide sequence as indicated in boldface: D361A, 5′-CTCTGAGCACATGCACCACCACATTC-3′. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify PRAM-1 cellular partners, a human bone marrow library was screened using the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System-3 protocol. Briefly, a Gal4-DBD (DNA binding domain) fusion of PRAM-1 (pGBKT7-PRAM-1) was employed as a bait in the screening carried out by mating AH109-MATa pre-transformed with pGBKT7-PRAM-1 to Y187-MATα library pre-transformed cells. The AH109 transformation was carried out by standard Li-acetate protocol; the library was maintained in the Y187 strain according to manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant pGBKT7-PRAM-1 clones were tested for protein expression by Western blotting (positive), autonomous lacZ reporter activation by the bait alone (negative), cell proliferation effects through the bait (negative), mating efficiency with Y187-MATα, and were constantly maintained under selection of the auxotrophy marker Trp–. Once AH109-MATa-pGBKT7-PRAM-1 were confirmed through the above protocol, mating of a sufficient large pool of these cells to the pretransformed Y187-MATα library-carrying strain (titer, 5 × 107 colony-forming units/ml) was conducted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mating efficiency was determined in this case at 77%, with a total of 1 × 108 independent clones, thus covering the library (3.5 × 106 independent inserts) ∼29 times. Mated cells were spread onto selective media (SD, Clontech) for Trp (bait), Leu (prey), His (reporter 1), Ala (reporter 2), and lacZ (reporter 3) (SD-HALTX). After plating, positive clones were collected from days 8 to 20, and restreaked on SD-HALTX, SD-LTX, and SD-LX plates for verification of growth phenotype. Clones confirmed through this secondary screening were amplified in SD-L media, selecting only for the prey library insert. Plasmid DNA was finally isolated for sequencing according to standard procedures. Recombinant Protein Production, in Vitro Binding Assays—An overnight starter culture (5 ml) of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) transformed with pGST-HIP-55, pGST-HIP-55-(362–430), or pGST-c-Jun-(1–223) was inoculated into 250 ml of culture medium and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. After isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction (0.5 mm, 2 h at 30 °C), bacteria were collected and sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, freshly supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, and the protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cell extracts (0.1%, Sigma). Cellular extracts were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C). One mg of these extracts was incubated with 150 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. One μg of T7 promoter-fused cDNA was incubated according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for 2 h at 30 °C. In vitro binding assays were performed using ∼1 μg of GST fusion protein and 8 μl of the translation products of a coupled in vitro transcription/translation of cDNAs for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes to remove unbound material in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the proteins were recovered in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Coomassie staining or autoradiography of dried gels. Protein Cleavage Assay—Recombinant HIP-55 proteins were incubated in 50 μl of caspase reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.2) with 100 ng of recombinant caspase 3 (Calbiochem) at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli buffer and a 2-min boiling. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot. Northern Blots—Total RNA extraction and hybridization were as described previously (14Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Singer A. Di Gioia Y. Dmowski S. Kamens J.

Transient Transfections and Protein Extracts—COS-7 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) of the appropriate amount of DNA vectors adjusted to 14 μg/9-cm Petri dish with pBluescript carrier DNA. The medium was changed after 16 h, and 36 h after transfection, the cells were washed one time in phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and resuspended in whole cell extract buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture) for use with mammalian cell extracts. After two freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, the resulting cell lysates were cleared by a 30-min 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C.

In Vitro Kinase Assays—Briefly, 2 μg of GST·c-Jun fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 5 μg of cell extracts. Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The beads were washed six times with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100), resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 2 min. Production of Retroviral Vectors and Retroviral Gene Transfer— Production of retroviral vectors and retroviral gene transfer were conducted as described previously (39Erkeland S.J. Valkhof M.

NB4 cells were infected with pBabe-PRAM-1 or with control pBabe-eGFP viruses and selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). Several independent pools of cells were expanded for further analysis. PRAM-1 Interacted with the SH3 Domain of HIP-55—In an attempt to identify binding partners for PRAM-1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used with full-length PRAM-1 as a bait, together with a cDNA library from human bone marrow cells. Four independent clones were recovered: two corresponding to the full-length SKAP-55HOM coding sequence (40Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41Liu J. Kang H. Raab M. da Silva A.J. Kraeft S.K. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The region covered by the two identical HIP-55 clones corresponded to amino acids 65–430 containing two tyrosine-based motifs, a caspase 3 recognition site, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 1A) (26Ensenat D.

The yeast AH109 strain was then transformed with SKAP-55HOM, HIP-55, or the pACT2 empty plasmid together with the PRAM-1 bait plasmid and grown onto selective media. As shown in Fig. 1B, SKAP-55HOM and HIP-55 cDNAs were found to specifically interact with PRAM-1 in yeast. A specific interaction between PRAM-1 and SKAP-55HOM was also found in myeloid cells (14Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Singer A. Di Gioia Y. Dmowski S. Kamens J. Cayre Y.E. Koretzky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22375-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We examined therefore the in vitro binding of HIP-55 to PRAM-1. Affinity-purified GST and GST-HIP-55 proteins expressed in E. coli were incubated with in vitro translated PRAM-1 and HPK-1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, PRAM-1 and HPK-1 did associate with both GST-HIP-55 and GST-HIP-55-(362–430) containing the SH3 domain but not with the GST alone. Deletion of type I and II SH3 recognition motifs within the PRAM-1 protein abolished PRAM-1 binding to the HIP-55 SH3 domain (Fig. 1D). Altogether, our results indicate that the SH3 domain of HIP-55 can associate with PRAM-1 through the proline-rich domain of PRAM-1. Because cleavage of HIP-55 by caspase 3 during apoptosis dissociated its SH3 domain from its actin-binding domain (33Chen Y.R. Kori R. John B. Tan T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we determined whether HIP-55 could be cleaved in response to As2O3 in NB4 cells. Western blot analysis using an anti-HIP-55 antibody revealed the decrease of full-length HIP-55 and the appearance of a cleavage product of ∼46 kDa in NB4 cells treated with increasing amounts of As2O3 (Fig. 2A). The cleavage of HIP-55 was suppressed by the Z-DEVD-fmk caspase inhibitor, suggesting that it was mediated through a caspase 3-like enzyme(s) (Fig. 2B). In vitro cleavage of recombinant HIP-55 by caspase 3 also resulted in a 46-kDa product (Fig. 2C). Mutation of the aspartic acid at position 361 to an alanine residue in HIP-55 protein abrogated its cleavage by caspase 3 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the EHID361 motif of HIP-55 is the caspase 3-specific cleavage site. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that caspase 3 is likely to mediate cleavage of HIP-55 in NB4 cells treated with As2O3. Overexpression of PRAM-1 in NB4 Cells Potentiated As2O3-induced JNK Activation—Increased PRAM-1 mRNA and protein expression occurred 6 and 12 h, respectively, after exposure of NB4 cells to As2O3 (Fig. 3A), which induced apoptosis with partial granulocytic differentiation (data not shown). Dose-response studies with As2O3-treated cells showed that 24 h of treatment with 2 μm As2O3 induced peak levels of the PRAM-1 protein, which correlated with the cleavage of HIP-55 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, this also correlated with JNK kinase activation as revealed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4A). To determine whether PRAM-1 was involved in the activation of JNK by As2O3, NB4 cells were stably transfected with a vector encoding PRAM-1 or eGFP as a control and treated with 2 μm As2O3 (Fig. 4B). Whereas the different pools of cells transfected with either vector showed a cleavage of HIP-55 in response to As2O3, overexpression of PRAM-1 resulted in a higher activation of the JNK kinase. The fact that HIP-55 is a modulator of HPK-1 (26Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Han J. Kori R. Shui J.W. Chen Y.R. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis, NB4 cells were pretreated with the Z-DEVD-fmk caspase inhibitor before As2O3 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, the caspase inhibitor, which suppressed the cleavage of pro-caspase 3, also suppressed the cleavage of HIP-55 and abolished PRAM-1-mediated activation of JNK (Fig. 5A). This had no effect on As2O3-induced apoptosis as assessed through cell viability (Fig. 5B) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that the stimulation of As2O3-induced JNK activity by PRAM-1 was dependent upon caspase 3 activation. Altogether, our results lend further support to the idea that the SH3 domain of HIP-55 resulting from the cleavage of HIP-55 by caspase 3 is involved in PRAM-1-mediated JNK activation upon As2O3-induced differentiation of NB4 cells.Fig. 4PRAM-1-enhanced JNK activity in NB4 cells stimulated As2O3-induced JNK activation.A, induction of JNK kinase activity by As2O3.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We found that PRAM-1 is repressed by PML·RARα and induced by RA (14Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Singer A. Di Gioia Y. Dmowski S. Kamens J. Cayre Y.E. Koretzky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22375-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and As2O3, suggesting that PRAM-1 is likely to be one of these genes. PRAM-1 is a novel adaptor molecule likely to be involved in an RA-signaling pathway, and we have reported the association between PRAM-1, LYN, SLP-76, and SKAP55-HOM in RA-treated NB4 cells (14Moog-Lutz C. Peterson E.J. Lutz P.G. Eliason S. Cave-Riant F. Singer A. Di Gioia Y. Dmowski S. Kamens J. Cayre Y.E. Koretzky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22375-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we have reported that the proline-rich domain of PRAM-1 interacted with the SH3 domain of the HIP-55 adaptor. HIP-55 was originally identified as an HPK-1-interacting protein (26Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HPK-1 was shown to activate the JNK kinase pathway (22Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and to function as a negative regulator for T-cell receptor-mediated AP-1 activation (25Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of the T-cell receptor, HIP-55 was shown to activate HPK-1 or other upstream kinases, which, in turn, activate the JNK kinase (29Han J. Kori R. Shui J.W. Chen Y.R. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52195-52202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SLP-76, SKAP55-HOM, and HIP-55 are essential components of T-cell receptor-signaling cascades regulating gene transcription, T-cell receptor and integrin clustering, endocytosis, and actin reorganization. The fact that PRAM-1 interacts with the SH3 domain of HIP-55 reinforces the view that PRAM-1 and ADAP may occupy a similar functional niche. Furthermore, in NB4 cells, overexpression of PRAM-1 potentiated As2O3-induced JNK activation. Cleavage of HIP-55 during apoptosis induced by Fas ligation in Jurkat cells is mediated through a caspase 3-like enzyme (33Chen Y.R. Kori R. John B. Tan T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This resulted in the dissociation of the SH3 domain of HIP-55 from its actin-binding domain. Indeed, activation of caspase 3 was observed after As2O3 treatment of NB4 cells as described previously (43Kitamura K. Minami Y. Yamamoto K. Akao Y. Kiyoi H. Saito H. Naoe T. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our data showed that HIP-55 was cleaved by a caspase 3-like activity in As2O3-treated NB4 cells. The resulting SH3-containing fragment may interact with a number of molecules and affect their biological functions. Indeed, the SH3 domain of HIP-55 was shown to bind dynamin (31Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), HPK-1 (26Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Fyn, and Cbl (30Le Bras S. Foucault I. Foussat A. Brignone C. Acuto O. Deckert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15550-15560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data strongly suggest that the fragment released upon caspase 3-like cleavage interacted with PRAM-1 and HPK-1. It should also be noticed that HPK-1 cleavage by a caspase 3-like enzyme separates the N-terminal kinase domain from the C-terminal regulatory domain and enhances HPK-1 kinase activity (44Chen Y.R. Meyer C.F. Ahmed B. Yao Z. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7370-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, As2O3-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis of promonocytic U937 cells is preceded by caspase 3 activation (45Park J.W. Choi Y.J. Jang M.A. Baek S.H. Lim J.H. Passaniti T. Kwon T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data emphasize the importance of proteolytic cleavage products in the regulation of cell fate and signal transduction pathways. Caspase 3 was also shown to be involved in the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U937 cells in the absence of cell death (46Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We showed that, in NB4 cells treated with As2O3, the Z-DEVD-fmk caspase inhibitor suppressed cleavage of HIP-55 as well as PRAM-1-mediated activation of JNK without affecting cell death. Considering that in our present observation, PRAM-1 interacted with the SH3 domain of HIP-55 and potentiated As2O3-induced JNK activation together with the well established fact that HIP-55 mediated JNK activation upon T-cell receptor stimulation (26Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Han J. Kori R. Shui J.W. Chen Y.R. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52195-52202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the SH3 domain of HIP-55 resulting from the caspase 3 cleavage of HIP-55 is involved in PRAM-1-mediated JNK activation. This will have to be further investigated. The fact that PRAM-1 is an adaptor molecule involved in both RA- and As2O3-signaling pathways suggests that PRAM-1 may be central to molecular complexes important for maturation of APL cells. The formation of such a complex may reactivate a normal signaling pathway that might be interrupted in leukemia cells. We thank Drs. B. Chatton for the generous gift of the GST-c-JUN expression vector, F. Kiefer for the HPK-1 expression vector, J. Wienands for anti-HIP-55 serum (88-B2), and M. Lanotte for NB4 cells. We also thank all the members of our group for stimulating discussions."

The sequence of Grx1<sub>as</sub> cDNA indicated that the open reading frame of the gene was identical to the open reading frame of the previously reported first human glutaredoxin (Grx1) cDNA, but the 3′-untranslated region of Grx1<sub>as</sub> was not homologous to Grx1 cDNA. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed Grx1<sub>as</sub> mRNA was expressed in normal human neutrophils and transformed cells including U937, HL-60, THP, and Jurkat cells. Cloning and sequencing of the genomic gene corresponding to Grx1<sub>as</sub> cDNA showed that two different glutaredoxin cDNAs (Grx1<sub>as</sub> and Grx1) were generated from the same genomic gene via alternative splicing. Origination of Grx1<sub>as</sub> and Grx1 from the same gene was confirmed by chromosomal localization of the Grx1<sub>as</sub> gene to chromosome 5q13, the same location where the Grx1 gene was localized previously. During screening of the Grx1<sub>as</sub> genomic gene, two additional glutaredoxin pseudogenes were also isolated. Surprisingly, these pseudogenes contained 3′-untranslated regions that were nearly identical to the 3′-untranslated regions of Grx1<sub>as,</sub> not Grx1, cDNA. Because 3′-untranslated regions may be important in stabilizing mRNAs, the effect of the two 3′-untranslated regions of Grx1 and Grx1<sub>as</sub> on mRNA stability was investigated using luciferase reporter vectors with the 3′-untranslated regions. Luciferase activity was 2.6-fold greater in cells transfected with the reporter vector containing the 3′-untranslated region of Grx1<sub>as</sub> cDNA compared with the 3′-untranslated region of Grx1 cDNA. These data indicate that Grx1<sub>as</sub> cDNA is an alternatively spliced human Grx1 cDNA and that the Grx1<sub>as</sub> 3′-untranslated region may have a role in stabilizing mRNA."

In this special issue, astronomical observations and theories constraining circumstellar disks, their lifetimes, and the formation of planetary to subplanetary objects are reviewed. At present, it is difficult to observe what is happening within disks and to determine if another disk environment is comparable to the early solar system disk environment (called the protoplanetary disk). Fortunately, we have chondritic meteorites, which provide a record of the processes that operated and materials present within the protoplanetary disk."
https://openalex.org/W1563101524,"The outer atmosphere of our Sun (the corona) is a tenuous, million-degree plasma environment. Given that the corona lies above the much cooler photosphere and chromosphere, some unknown energy source must be depositing extra heat into this region. In his Perspective,

 reviews recent progress toward identifying this additional source. It is now believed that the magnetic field that permeates the corona is the source of the heating; the challenge is to determine how that energy can be extracted. Theoretical modeling and the latest space-based observations suggest two possible coronal heating mechanisms: Energy is released either through the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic waves or by numerous small-scale electric current bursts."
