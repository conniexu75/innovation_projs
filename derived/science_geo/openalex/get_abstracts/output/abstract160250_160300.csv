https://openalex.org/W2035082265,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus likely contributes to learning and memory. The mechanisms underlying LTP at these synapses are not well understood, although phosphorylation and redistribution of AMPA receptors may be responsible for this form of synaptic plasticity. We show here that miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cultured hippocampal neurons reliably demonstrate LTP when postsynaptic NMDA receptors are briefly stimulated with glycine. LTP of these synapses is accompanied by a rapid insertion of native AMPA receptors and by increased clustering of AMPA receptors at the surface of dendritic membranes. Both LTP and glycine-facilitated AMPA receptor insertion are blocked by intracellular tetanus toxin (TeTx), providing evidence that AMPA receptors are inserted into excitatory synapses via a SNARE-dependent exocytosis during LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2043484965,"In monkeys, posterior parietal and premotor cortex play an important integrative role in polymodal motion processing. In contrast, our understanding of the convergence of senses in humans is only at its beginning. To test for equivalencies between macaque and human polymodal motion processing, we used functional MRI in normals while presenting moving visual, tactile, or auditory stimuli. Increased neural activity evoked by all three stimulus modalities was found in the depth of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), ventral premotor, and lateral inferior postcentral cortex. The observed activations strongly suggest that polymodal motion processing in humans and monkeys is supported by equivalent areas. The activations in the depth of IPS imply that this area constitutes the human equivalent of macaque area VIP."
https://openalex.org/W3103368869,"Glass is a microscopically disordered, solid form of matter that results when a fluid is cooled or compressed in such a manner that it does not crystallize. Almost all types of materials are capable of glass formation, including polymers, metal alloys and molten salts. Given such diversity, general principles by which different glass-forming materials can be systematically classified are invaluable. One such principle is the classification of glass-formers according to their fragility. Fragility measures the rapidity with which a liquid's properties (such as viscosity) change as the glassy state is approached. Although the relationship between the fragility, configurational entropy and features of the energy landscape (the complicated dependence of energy on configuration) of a glass-former have been analysed previously, a detailed understanding of the origins of fragility is lacking. Here I use simulations to analyse the relationship between fragility and quantitative measures of the energy landscape for a model liquid whose fragility depends on its bulk density. The results reveal that fragility depends on changes in the vibrational properties of individual energy minima in addition to their total number and spread in energy. A thermodynamic expression for fragility is derived, which is in quantitative agreement with kinetic fragilities obtained from the liquid's diffusivity."

https://openalex.org/W2012458221,"Evoked transmitter release depends upon calcium influx into synaptic boutons, but mechanisms regulating bouton calcium levels and spontaneous transmitter release are obscure. To understand these processes better, we monitored calcium transients in axons and presynaptic terminals of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures. Action potentials reliably evoke calcium transients in axons and boutons. Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from internal stores contributes to the transients in boutons and to paired-pulse facilitation of EPSPs. Store depletion activates store-operated calcium channels, influencing the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release. Boutons display spontaneous Ca2+ transients; blocking CICR reduces the frequency of these transients and of spontaneous miniature synaptic events. Thus, spontaneous transmitter release is largely calcium mediated, driven by Ca2+ release from internal stores. Bouton store release is important for short-term synaptic plasticity and may also contribute to long-term plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2063314066,"Spine function requires precise control of the actin cytoskeleton. Kalirin-7, a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rac1, interacts with PDZ proteins such as PSD-95, colocalizing with PSD-95 at synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons. PSD-95 and Kalirin-7 interact in vivo and in heterologous expression systems. In primary cortical neurons, transfected Kalirin-7 is targeted to spines and increases the number and size of spine-like structures. A Kalirin-7 mutant unable to interact with PDZ proteins remains in the cell soma, inducing local formation of aberrant filopodial neurites. Kalirin-7 with an inactivated GEF domain reduces the number of spines below control levels. These results provide evidence that PDZ proteins target Kalirin-7 to the PSD, where it regulates dendritic morphogenesis through Rac1 signaling to the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2131695915,"Kainate receptors alter the excitability of mossy fiber axons and have been reported to play a role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus. These previous studies have relied primarily on the use of compounds whose selectivity is unclear. In this report, we investigate short- and long-term facilitation of mossy fiber synaptic transmission in kainate receptor knockout mice. We find that LTP is reduced in mice lacking the GluR6, but not the GluR5, kainate receptor subunit. Additionally, short-term synaptic facilitation is impaired in GluR6 knockout mice, suggesting that kainate receptors act as presynaptic autoreceptors on mossy fiber terminals to facilitate synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate that kainate receptors containing the GluR6 subunit are important modulators of mossy fiber synaptic strength."

https://openalex.org/W2073308227,"The ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluR6 undergoes developmentally and regionally regulated Q/R site RNA editing that reduces the calcium permeability of GluR6-containing kainate receptors. To investigate the functional significance of this editing in vivo, we engineered mice deficient in GluR6 Q/R site editing. In these mutant mice but not in wild types, NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) could be induced at the medial perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse. This indicates that kainate receptors with unedited GluR6 subunits can mediate LTP. Behavioral analyses revealed no differences from wild types, but mutant mice were more vulnerable to kainate-induced seizures. Together, these results suggest that GluR6 Q/R site RNA editing may modulate synaptic plasticity and seizure vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2065511465,"cGMP-gated channels are essential for phototransduction in the vertebrate retina. Here we show that the affinity of these channels for cGMP in chick cones is substantially higher during the subjective night than during the subjective day. This effect persists in constant environmental conditions after entrainment to 12:12 hr light-dark cycles in vitro or in ovo. Circadian modulation of ligand affinity is a posttranslational effect and is driven by rhythms in the activities of two protein kinases: Erk and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Erk is maximally active during the subjective night, whereas CaMKII is maximally active during the subjective day. Acute inhibition of these signaling pathways causes phase-dependent changes in the affinity of the channels for cGMP."

Using simultaneous behavioral and neural (fMRI) measures, we identify neural bases of volume perception. Neural activity in the lateral occipital cortex increased with presentation of 3D volumes relative to presentation of 2D shapes. Neural activity also modulated with perceived volume, independent of image information. When behavioral responses indicated that observers saw ambiguous images as 3D volumes, neural response increased; when behavioral data revealed a 2D interpretation, neural response waned. Crucially, the physical stimulus was identical under both interpretations; only the percept of volume can account for the increased neural activity."

https://openalex.org/W1977477867,"Odor-induced neural activity was recorded by Ca2+ imaging in the cell body region of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), which is the second relay of the olfactory central nervous system. The signals recorded are mainly from the cell layers on the brain surface because of the limited penetration of Ca2+-sensitive dyes. The densely packed cell bodies and their accessibility allow visualization of odor-induced population neural activity. It is revealed that odors evoke diffused neural activities in the MB. Although the signals cannot be attributed to individual neurons, patterns of the population neural activity can be analyzed. The activity pattern, but not the amplitude, of an odor-induced population response is specific for the chemical identity of an odor and its concentration. The distribution pattern of neural activity can be altered specifically by genetic manipulation of an odor binding protein and this alteration is closely associated with a behavioral defect of odor preference. These results suggest that the spatial pattern of the distributed neural activity may contribute to coding of odor information at the second relay of the olfactory system."

Most transgenic components of foods currently on the market are plant-incorporated protectants or their inert ingredients. Therefore, they have been evaluated for safety by the Environmental Protection Agency (as well as the Food and Drug Administration), and their disclosure in labeling should not be required. If plant-incorporated protectants are considered safer than chemical pesticides, and chemical pesticides do not have to be disclosed in labels, then bioengineered foods should not be subject to stricter regulation, nor should they be required to be labeled.

https://openalex.org/W1990858035,"A bout 50% of human cancers have mutations in the tumor suppressor protein, p53. When activated in response to DNA damage, this master transcription factor switches on the expression of target genes that either halt the cell in G1 phase of the cell cycle so that its DNA can be repaired or induce it to self-destruct through an elaborate process called apoptosis. Now, Oda et al . ([1][1]) have identified a new p53 target gene, p53AIP1 , that, when activated by p53, alters the mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in cell death.

The investigators isolated p53AIP1 , which is not homologous to any other known genes, by searching for sequences in the human genome that bind to p53. In cultured fibroblasts exposed to γ irradiation, which damages the DNA and activates p53, expression of p53AIP1 increased after 12 hours, reaching a maximum at 24 hours. This was surprising given that other p53 target genes such as p21waf1 (which causes cell cycle arrest) are expressed 1 to 2 hours after radiation exposure, reaching maximum levels at 12 hours. When overexpressed in cultured glioblastoma cells, p53AIP1 becomes concentrated in the mitochondria and alters the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, inducing 50% of the cells to die within 48 hours.

Oda et al. next looked at whether the addition of phosphate groups (phosphorylation) to serine (Ser) residues in p53 changed after exposure of cells to different doses of ultraviolet radiation. At lower doses (10 to 15 J/m2), Ser-15 and Ser-20 in p53 were rapidly phosphorylated, reaching a maximum at the same time as p21waf1. In contrast, Ser-46 was phosphorylated only at doses of 20 J/m2 or higher—intriguingly, the only doses at which p53AIP1 was expressed. Apparently, Ser-46 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for p53AIP1 production because if Ser-46 is replaced by alanine (which cannot be phosphorylated), p53 is unable to bind to the p53AIP1 gene promoter and, thus, no p53AIP1 mRNA is made.

The authors propose that cells have a two-tiered system to respond to DNA damage. At lower radiation doses causing DNA damage that can still be repaired, p21waf1 and other p53 target genes that halt cell division or repair DNA are switched on; at higher doses causing DNA damage that is irreparable, p53AIP1 is expressed and the cells die. Elucidating the p53 target genes that induce cells to self-destruct is important, particularly given that missense mutations in amino acids close to Ser-46 in p53 have been reported in some bladder and lung cancers, suggesting that the normal mechanism for removing severely damaged cells has been circumvented in these tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2034581847,"C ells are faced with something of a problem when it comes to assembling ribosomes, the rotund two-tiered factories that produce proteins. Although mature ribosomes reside in the cytoplasm, the large 60 S and small 40 S subunits of which they are composed are assembled from ribosomal RNAs and proteins in a region of the nucleus called the nucleolus. To address the problem of making ribosomes in one place but needing them in another, cells have organized an intricate transport system to ensure that ribosomal proteins are moved into the nucleus, and ribosomal subunits are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Like traffic wardens directing cars at a busy intersection, a legion of proteins keep the stream of macromolecular traffic—proteins, RNAs, ribosomal subunits—flowing freely through pores in the nuclear membrane, the boundary between nucleus and cytoplasm. According to Johnson and colleagues ([1][1]), there are at least two traffic warden proteins involved in the nuclear export of the 60 S ribosomal subunit: Nmd3p, which carries a putative leucine-rich nuclear export signal, and Crm1p, an export receptor that recognizes this signal.

Having established that Nmd3p binds tightly to the yeast 60 S ribosomal subunit in the final stages of its assembly ([2][2]), the Johnson laboratory engineered yeast expressing mutant Nmd3p that lacked the carboxyl terminus containing the nuclear export signal. By tagging the large ribosomal subunit protein L25 with a green fluorescent marker, the authors could track the location of the 60 S subunit in these yeast mutants. In yeast lacking the nuclear export signal, L25 became sequestered in the nucleus (see left figure), whereas in yeast with fully functional Nmd3p, L25 moved into the cytoplasm (see right figure). Thus, 60 S ribosomal subunits continued to be exported from the nucleus as long as Nmd3p retained its nuclear export signal. The authors surmise that Nmd3p is an adapter protein that binds to the 60 S subunit, providing it with a nuclear export signal (such signals are necessary for any protein to leave the nucleus).

![Figure][3] 

The Crm1p export receptor transports protein cargo carrying a leucine-rich nuclear export signal through nuclear pores by interacting with proteins in the nuclear pore complex. When they inactivated yeast Crm1p with the antibiotic leptomycin B, Johnson and co-workers found that Nmd3p and fluorescent L25 were retained in the nucleus, whereas in leptomycin- insensitive yeast both Nmd3p and L25 moved freely into the cytoplasm. They propose that the 60 S subunit is exported from the nucleus by Crm1p, which binds to the nuclear export signal provided by Nmd3p.

Just as traffic on a freeway must pay a toll to pass through a toll booth, nuclear pores exact an energy payment as cargo proteins exit the nucleus. This payment takes the form of conversion of energy-rich guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate through the activity of the small GTPase, Ran. Ran has been identified in many different complexes of cargo proteins and their associated export receptors. In an in vitro assay, the Johnson group has found that Nmd3p, Crm1p and Ran associate together in a complex ([3][4]). The next step will be to examine how this complex interacts with the 60 S ribosomal subunit and what structural rearrangements of the nuclear pore complex are required to enable this large conglomerate to squeeze through the nuclear pores.
