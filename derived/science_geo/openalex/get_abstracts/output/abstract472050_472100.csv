https://openalex.org/W2060930865,"Cell cycle quiescence is a critical feature contributing to haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. Although various candidate stromal cells have been identified as potential HSC niches, the spatial localization of quiescent HSCs in the bone marrow remains unclear. Here, using a novel approach that combines whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging techniques and computational modelling to analyse significant three-dimensional associations in the mouse bone marrow among vascular structures, stromal cells and HSCs, we show that quiescent HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found in endosteal bone marrow. These arterioles are ensheathed exclusively by rare NG2 (also known as CSPG4)+ pericytes, distinct from sinusoid-associated leptin receptor (LEPR)+ cells. Pharmacological or genetic activation of the HSC cell cycle alters the distribution of HSCs from NG2+ periarteriolar niches to LEPR+ perisinusoidal niches. Conditional depletion of NG2+ cells induces HSC cycling and reduces functional long-term repopulating HSCs in the bone marrow. These results thus indicate that arteriolar niches are indispensable for maintaining HSC quiescence. Immunofluorescence imaging and computational modelling are used to study the spatial distribution of different cell types within the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche; findings show that quiescent HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found in the endosteal bone marrow and are essential in maintaining this quiescence. Paul Frenette and colleagues used whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging and computational modelling to study the spatial distribution of different cell types within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. They found that quiescent HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found in endosteal bone marrow and that these arterioles are essential in maintaining HSC quiescence. These results thus suggest that distinct HSC niches, quiescent or proliferative, are conferred by distinct blood vessel types."

Y. Sun et al. (p. 624 , published online 10 October) investigated the structural details that govern the binding between FLS2, its co-receptor BAK1, and the flagellin fragment flg22.

https://openalex.org/W2048120844,"Sequencing the human transcriptome using long, single-molecule reads identifies new transcript isoforms. Global RNA studies have become central to understanding biological processes, but methods such as microarrays and short-read sequencing are unable to describe an entire RNA molecule from 5′ to 3′ end. Here we use single-molecule long-read sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences to sequence the polyadenylated RNA complement of a pooled set of 20 human organs and tissues without the need for fragmentation or amplification. We show that full-length RNA molecules of up to 1.5 kb can readily be monitored with little sequence loss at the 5′ ends. For longer RNA molecules more 5′ nucleotides are missing, but complete intron structures are often preserved. In total, we identify ∼14,000 spliced GENCODE genes. High-confidence mappings are consistent with GENCODE annotations, but >10% of the alignments represent intron structures that were not previously annotated. As a group, transcripts mapping to unannotated regions have features of long, noncoding RNAs. Our results show the feasibility of deep sequencing full-length RNA from complex eukaryotic transcriptomes on a single-molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2123973342,"DNA methylation was first described almost a century ago; however, the rules governing its establishment and maintenance remain elusive. Here we present data demonstrating that active transcription regulates levels of genomic methylation. We identify a novel RNA arising from the CEBPA gene locus that is critical in regulating the local DNA methylation profile. This RNA binds to DNMT1 and prevents CEBPA gene locus methylation. Deep sequencing of transcripts associated with DNMT1 combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling extend the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Collectively, these results delineate the nature of DNMT1–RNA interactions and suggest strategies for gene-selective demethylation of therapeutic targets in human diseases. RNAs are shown to interact with DNA methyltransferase 1 and prevent DNA methylation of genes at their specific locus, providing evidence that active transcription directly regulates DNA methylation levels. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with silencing of gene expression. Here, Daniel Tenen and colleagues propose that active transcription directly regulates levels of DNA methylation. A non-coding RNA arising from the well-studied methylation-sensitive gene CEBPA interacts with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to prevent methylation at the CEBPA locus, thereby facilitating CEBPA expression. Functional associations between DNMT1 and RNAs seem to occur at numerous gene loci. These findings support the hypothesis that non-coding RNA participates in the regulation of genomic methylation patterns by interacting with DNMT1 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for site-specific alteration of aberrant DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1980744841,"Genome-wide studies have defined cell type-specific patterns of DNA methylation that are important for regulating gene expression in both normal development and disease. However, determining the functional significance of specific methylation events remains challenging, owing to the lack of methods for removing such modifications in a targeted manner. Here we describe an approach for efficient targeted demethylation of specific CpGs in human cells using fusions of engineered transcription activator-like effector (TALE) repeat arrays and the TET1 hydroxylase catalytic domain. Using these TALE-TET1 fusions, we demonstrate that modification of critical methylated promoter CpG positions can lead to substantial increases in the expression of endogenous human genes. Our results delineate a strategy for understanding the functional significance of specific CpG methylation marks in the context of endogenous gene loci and validate programmable DNA demethylation reagents with potential utility for research and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2078482008,"Progressive phases of multiple sclerosis are associated with inhibited differentiation of the progenitor cell population that generates the mature oligodendrocytes required for remyelination and disease remission. To identify selective inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed an image-based screen for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression using primary rat optic-nerve-derived progenitor cells. Here we show that among the most effective compounds identifed was benztropine, which significantly decreases clinical severity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when administered alone or in combination with approved immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from a cuprizone-induced model of demyelination, in vitro and in vivo T-cell assays and EAE adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the observed efficacy of this drug results directly from an enhancement of remyelination rather than immune suppression. Pharmacological studies indicate that benztropine functions by a mechanism that involves direct antagonism of M1 and/or M3 muscarinic receptors. These studies should facilitate the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that complement established immunosuppressive approaches. Multiple sclerosis is associated with a deficiency in generation of mature oligodendroctyes; an image-based screen for oligodendrocyte differentiation inducers identified the compound benztropine, which enhances remyelination acting through muscarinic receptors and decreases clinical severity in a multiple sclerosis model system. Peter Schultz and colleagues have performed a high-throughput, image-based screen with rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) of small molecules that enhance OPC in vitro differentiation. Using this approach they have identified and characterized small molecule drugs able to foster oligodendrocyte-based remyelination in disorders such as multiple sclerosis. The principal compound identified is benztropine, a drug licensed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Benztropine has efficacy in vivo in two models of demyelination disorders, with no measurable effects on the immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2096322639,"By monitoring the environment of a superconducting quantum bit in real time, the quantum bit can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution, as described by its ‘quantum trajectory’, can be tracked. A quantum state, such as a particle's superposition between two energy levels, quickly reverts to a classically described state on contact with the environment. To avoid this 'decoherence', large efforts are usually made to decouple quantum devices from their surroundings. But there is another way. Kater Murch et al. show that quantum coherence can be preserved by continuous, accurate monitoring of the environmental fluctuations. They studied a qubit consisting of a superconducting device embedded in a microwave cavity with fluctuations likely to cause decoherence. The act of accurately measuring either phase or amplitude of the fluctuations was found to steer the qubit's state along random trajectories that are purely quantum in nature. This work suggests a new type of control, harnessing action at a distance through measurement, for the manipulation of quantum systems in complex environments, ranging from biological systems to quantum computers. The length of time that a quantum system can exist in a superposition state is determined by how strongly it interacts with its environment. This interaction entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the environment. If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be viewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system from an initially pure state into a statistical mixture—a process known as decoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the quantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution described by a ‘quantum trajectory’1,2 determined by the measurement outcome. Here we use weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity containing a superconducting quantum bit (qubit), and track the individual quantum trajectories3 of the system. In this set-up, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations of a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited parametric amplifier4,5, we selectively measure either the phase or the amplitude of the cavity field, and thereby confine trajectories to either the equator or a meridian of the Bloch sphere. We perform quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory to verify that we have faithfully tracked the state of the quantum system as it diffuses on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can be mitigated by environmental monitoring, and validate the foundation of quantum feedback approaches based on Bayesian statistics6,7,8. Moreover, our experiments suggest a new means of implementing ‘quantum steering’9—the harnessing of action at a distance to manipulate quantum states through measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2025244019,"A dual-view light sheet microscope allows high-speed imaging with an isotropic spatial resolution Optimal four-dimensional imaging requires high spatial resolution in all dimensions, high speed and minimal photobleaching and damage. We developed a dual-view, plane illumination microscope with improved spatiotemporal resolution by switching illumination and detection between two perpendicular objectives in an alternating duty cycle. Computationally fusing the resulting volumetric views provides an isotropic resolution of 330 nm. As the sample is stationary and only two views are required, we achieve an imaging speed of 200 images/s (i.e., 0.5 s for a 50-plane volume). Unlike spinning-disk confocal or Bessel beam methods, which illuminate the sample outside the focal plane, we maintain high spatiotemporal resolution over hundreds of volumes with negligible photobleaching. To illustrate the ability of our method to study biological systems that require high-speed volumetric visualization and/or low photobleaching, we describe microtubule tracking in live cells, nuclear imaging over 14 h during nematode embryogenesis and imaging of neural wiring during Caenorhabditis elegans brain development over 5 h."
https://openalex.org/W2083890928,"Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual landmarks to orient in their environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features and its short- and long-term memory for visual patterns. But whether and how neurons of the fly central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons--a class of central complex neurons that have been implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies and memory for visual patterns in tethered flying flies. We show that dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses in flies. Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of locomotion, not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate motor commands. More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection in the Drosophila central complex."

However, 11,000 to 5000 years ago, it was a relatively lush region containing savannah grasslands and humid tropical forests. This interval, the Early Holocene African Humid Period, ended, of course, but whether the drying occurred rapidly or gradually is unclear. Tierney and deMenocal (p. 843 , published online 10 October; see the Perspective by Bard ) report results from the Horn of Africa that suggest that the transitions both into and out of the humid period were abrupt—occurring within centuries rather than over millennia."
https://openalex.org/W2065840402,"In systemic sclerosis (SSc), a common and aetiologically mysterious form of scleroderma (defined as pathological fibrosis of the skin), previously healthy adults acquire fibrosis of the skin and viscera in association with autoantibodies. Familial recurrence is extremely rare and causal genes have not been identified. Although the onset of fibrosis in SSc typically correlates with the production of autoantibodies, whether they contribute to disease pathogenesis or simply serve as a marker of disease remains controversial and the mechanism for their induction is largely unknown. The study of SSc is hindered by a lack of animal models that recapitulate the aetiology of this complex disease. To gain a foothold in the pathogenesis of pathological skin fibrosis, we studied stiff skin syndrome (SSS), a rare but tractable Mendelian disorder leading to childhood onset of diffuse skin fibrosis with autosomal dominant inheritance and complete penetrance. We showed previously that SSS is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the gene (FBN1) encoding fibrillin-1, the main constituent of extracellular microfibrils. SSS mutations all localize to the only domain in fibrillin-1 that harbours an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif needed to mediate cell-matrix interactions by binding to cell-surface integrins. Here we show that mouse lines harbouring analogous amino acid substitutions in fibrillin-1 recapitulate aggressive skin fibrosis that is prevented by integrin-modulating therapies and reversed by antagonism of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Mutant mice show skin infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, T helper cells and plasma cells, and also autoantibody production; these findings are normalized by integrin-modulating therapies or TGF-β antagonism. These results show that alterations in cell-matrix interactions are sufficient to initiate and sustain inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programmes and highlight new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2129804244,"Irisin was recently identified as a putative myokine that is induced by exercise. Studies suggest that it is produced by cleavage of the FNDC5 (fibronectin domain-containing protein 5) receptor; irisin corresponds to the extracellular receptor ectodomain. Data suggesting that irisin stimulates white-to-brown fat conversion have led to the hypothesis that it does so by binding an unknown receptor, thus functioning as a myokine. As brown fat promotes energy dissipation, myokines that elicit the transformation of white to brown fat have potentially profound benefits in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders. Understanding the molecular basis for such exercise-induced phenomena is thus of considerable interest. Moreover, FNDC5-like receptors are highly conserved and have been shown to be critical for neuronal development. However, the structural and molecular mechanisms utilized by these proteins are currently unknown. Here, we describe the crystal structure and biochemical characterization of the FNDC5 ectodomain, corresponding to the irisin myokine. The 2.28 Å structure shows that irisin consists of an N-terminal fibronectin III (FNIII)-like domain attached to a flexible C-terminal tail. Strikingly, the FNIII-like domain forms a continuous intersubunit β-sheet dimer, previously unobserved for any FNIII protein. Biochemical data confirm that irisin is a dimer and that dimerization is unaffected by glycosylation. This finding suggests a possible mechanism for receptor activation by the irisin domain as a preformed myokine dimer ligand or as a paracrine or autocrine dimerization module on FNDC5-like receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1971479618,"Crossover recombination events between homologous chromosomes are required to form chiasmata, temporary connections between homologues that ensure their proper segregation at meiosis I. Despite this requirement for crossovers and an excess of the double-strand DNA breaks that are the initiating events for meiotic recombination, most organisms make very few crossovers per chromosome pair. Moreover, crossovers tend to inhibit the formation of other crossovers nearby on the same chromosome pair, a poorly understood phenomenon known as crossover interference. Here we show that the synaptonemal complex, a meiosis-specific structure that assembles between aligned homologous chromosomes, both constrains and is altered by crossover recombination events. Using a cytological marker of crossover sites in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that partial depletion of the synaptonemal complex central region proteins attenuates crossover interference, increasing crossovers and reducing the effective distance over which interference operates, indicating that synaptonemal complex proteins limit crossovers. Moreover, we show that crossovers are associated with a local 0.4-0.5-micrometre increase in chromosome axis length. We propose that meiotic crossover regulation operates as a self-limiting system in which meiotic chromosome structures establish an environment that promotes crossover formation, which in turn alters chromosome structure to inhibit other crossovers at additional sites."
https://openalex.org/W2061190113,"The pattern of geomagnetic secular variation observed on the Earth’s surface is shown to be reproduced by two mechanisms relying on the inner core; this bottom-up heterogeneous driving of outer-core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities. Julien Aubert et al. show that the pattern of geomagnetic secular variation observed on the Earth's surface can be reproduced by two mechanisms relying on the inner core — gravitational coupling aligning the inner core with the mantle and differential inner-core growth, which is fastest below Indonesia. They conclude that this bottom-up heterogeneous driving of outer-core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic. Temporal changes in the Earth’s magnetic field, known as geomagnetic secular variation, occur most prominently at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere1,2 (that is, from −90 degrees east to 90 degrees east), whereas in the Pacific hemisphere there is comparatively little activity. This is a consequence of the geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux patches at the core surface3. Despite successes in explaining the morphology of the geomagnetic field4, numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling5 aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre6. The resulting shear concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core–mantle boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported westward. Second, differential inner-core growth7,8, fastest below Indonesia6,9, causes an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre, forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions6,10,11. This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective translation7,8."

https://openalex.org/W2101994946,"Mammalian genomes encode two provitamin A-converting enzymes as follows: the β-carotene-15,15'-oxygenase (BCO1) and the β-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2). Symmetric cleavage by BCO1 yields retinoids (β-15'-apocarotenoids, C20), whereas eccentric cleavage by BCO2 produces long-chain (>C20) apocarotenoids. Here, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to clarify the contribution of these enzymes to provitamin A metabolism. We subjected wild type, Bco1(-/-), Bco2(-/-), and Bco1(-/-)Bco2(-/-) double knock-out mice to a controlled diet providing β-carotene as the sole source for apocarotenoid production. This study revealed that BCO1 is critical for retinoid homeostasis. Genetic disruption of BCO1 resulted in β-carotene accumulation and vitamin A deficiency accompanied by a BCO2-dependent production of minor amounts of β-apo-10'-carotenol (APO10ol). We found that APO10ol can be esterified and transported by the same proteins as vitamin A but with a lower affinity and slower reaction kinetics. In wild type mice, APO10ol was converted to retinoids by BCO1. We also show that a stepwise cleavage by BCO2 and BCO1 with APO10ol as an intermediate could provide a mechanism to tailor asymmetric carotenoids such as β-cryptoxanthin for vitamin A production. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that mammals employ both carotenoid oxygenases to synthesize retinoids from provitamin A carotenoids."
https://openalex.org/W2009427913,"Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms responsible for ∼25% of organic carbon fixation on the Earth. These bacteria began to convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into bioenergy and oxygen more than two billion years ago. Cyanophages, which infect these bacteria, have an important role in regulating the marine ecosystem by controlling cyanobacteria community organization and mediating lateral gene transfer. Here we visualize the maturation process of cyanophage Syn5 inside its host cell, Synechococcus, using Zernike phase contrast electron cryo-tomography (cryoET). This imaging modality yields dramatic enhancement of image contrast over conventional cryoET and thus facilitates the direct identification of subcellular components, including thylakoid membranes, carboxysomes and polyribosomes, as well as phages, inside the congested cytosol of the infected cell. By correlating the structural features and relative abundance of viral progeny within cells at different stages of infection, we identify distinct Syn5 assembly intermediates. Our results indicate that the procapsid releases scaffolding proteins and expands its volume at an early stage of genome packaging. Later in the assembly process, we detected full particles with a tail either with or without an additional horn. The morphogenetic pathway we describe here is highly conserved and was probably established long before that of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting more complex organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2093762253,"Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (EIF2AK3) is essential for normal development and function of the insulin-secreting β-cell. Although genetic ablation of PERK in β-cells results in permanent neonatal diabetes in humans and mice, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used a newly developed and highly specific inhibitor of PERK to determine the immediate effects of acute ablation of PERK activity. We found that inhibition of PERK in human and rodent β-cells causes a rapid inhibition of secretagogue-stimulated subcellular Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion. These dysfunctions stem from alterations in store-operated Ca(2+) entry and sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. We also found that PERK regulates calcineurin, and pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin results in similar defects on stimulus-secretion coupling. Our findings suggest that interplay between calcineurin and PERK regulates β-cell Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion, and that loss of this interaction may have profound implications in insulin secretion defects associated with diabetes."

DNA repair mediated by HR requires a homologous template, which in proliferating cells is generally the sister chromatid generated in S-phase (1Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In diploid organisms, HR can also utilize the homologous chromosome as a template, but this is disfavored wherever possible because it can lead to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a potential driver of tumorigenesis (2Luo G. Santoro I.M. McDaniel L.D. Nishijima I. Mills M. Youssoufian H. Vogel H. Schultz R.A. Bradley A. Cancer predisposition caused by elevated mitotic recombination in Bloom mice.Nat.

Indeed, many of the homozygous mutations found in tumor suppressor genes in neoplastic cells probably arose via LOH following an initial, monoallelic mutational event. A pivotal player in HR is the RAD51 protein (RecA in bacteria), a DNA-dependent ATPase that polymerizes on ssDNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. This structure is a central intermediate in HR and is necessary for DNA strand invasion to occur as part of the search for a homologous DNA sequence (1Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J.

Similarly, RAD51 is subject to negative regulation in order to prevent inadvertent or unwanted HR reactions. One form of regulation is via the disruption of RAD51 filaments. The best characterized factor to perform this task is the yeast Srs2 protein, a superfamily 1 DNA helicase belonging to the highly conserved UvrD family (7Wu L. Hickson I.D. DNA helicases required for homologous recombination and repair of damaged replication forks.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Srs2 utilizes the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate on ssDNA, a process that serves to progressively disrupt the Rad51 filament (8Antony E. Tomko E.J. Xiao Q. Krejci L. Lohman T.M.

Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. DNA helicase Srs2 disrupts the Rad51 presynaptic filament.Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition to Srs2, there are other UvrD family members expressed in eukaryotic cells. A recently identified family member in human cells is PARI (11Moldovan G.L. Dejsuphong D. Petalcorin M.I. Hofmann K. Takeda S. Boulton S.J. D'Andrea A.D. Inhibition of homologous recombination by the PCNA-interacting protein PARI.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This protein also binds to RAD51, but it contains amino acid substitutions in critical residues required for ATPase function, and hence PARI is not an active helicase/translocase. How PARI regulates RAD51 function at a mechanistic level is not known. Another eukaryotic UvrD family member is the F-box helicase 1 (FBH1), which is found in fission yeast and higher eukaryotes but not in budding yeast (12Kim J. Kim J.H. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Kang H.Y. Bae S.H. Pan Z.Q. Seo Y.S. The novel human DNA helicase hFBH1 is an F-box protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24530-24537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). FBH1 is a bifunctional protein comprising an N-terminal F-box domain and a centrally located helicase domain. Previous biochemical studies have indicated that human FBH1 is an active DNA helicase/translocase (12Kim J. Kim J.H. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Kang H.Y. Bae S.H. Pan Z.Q. Seo Y.S. The novel human DNA helicase hFBH1 is an F-box protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24530-24537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The F-box domain is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins as part of the so-called SCF complex (Skp1-Cul1-Fbh1), which serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (13Kim J.H. Kim J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. SCFhFBH1 can act as helicase and E3 ubiquitin ligase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The targets for the FBH1 F-box in human cells remain to be identified. Genetic studies in the fission yeast, S. pombe, have provided strong evidence that Fbh1 regulates Rad51 function in that organism. Deletion of S. pombe fbh1 leads to mild sensitivity to certain DNA-damaging agents as well as to the formation of spontaneous foci containing Rad51 (called Rhp51 in S. pombe) (14Morishita T. Furukawa F. Sakaguchi C. Toda T. Carr A.M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Role of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe F-Box DNA helicase in processing recombination intermediates.Mol.

The F-Box DNA helicase Fbh1 prevents Rhp51-dependent recombination without mediator proteins.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 8084-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fbh1 is essential for viability in the absence of anti-recombinases, such as Rqh1 and Srs2, and this synthetic lethality can be suppressed by inactivation of HR factors that promote presynaptic filament assembly (14Morishita T. Furukawa F. Sakaguchi C. Toda T. Carr A.M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Role of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe F-Box DNA helicase in processing recombination intermediates.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 8074-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, Fbh1 limits Rad51-dependent recombination at blocked replication forks in a manner dependent on its helicase/translocase activity (16Lorenz A. Osman F. Folkyte V. Sofueva S. Whitby M.C. Fbh1 limits Rad51-dependent recombination at blocked replication forks.Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 4742-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Fbh1 regulates HR through directly regulating Rad51 function, at least in S. pombe. Disruption of the Fbh1 gene in the chicken DT40 cell line leads to elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange, a marker of crossover during HR-mediated DNA repair (17Kohzaki M. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Yamazoe M. Kikuchi K. Vu Trung N. Szüts D. Sale J.E. Shinagawa H. Watanabe M. Takeda S. Cooperative roles of vertebrate Fbh1 and Blm DNA helicases in avoidance of crossovers during recombination initiated by replication fork collapse.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse Fbh1-deficient cells display no clear defect in HR-mediated repair of DSBs but do show a moderate increase in RAD51 focus formation at sites of DNA damage (17Kohzaki M. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Yamazoe M. Kikuchi K. Vu Trung N. Szüts D. Sale J.E. Shinagawa H. Watanabe M. Takeda S. Cooperative roles of vertebrate Fbh1 and Blm DNA helicases in avoidance of crossovers during recombination initiated by replication fork collapse.Mol.

Mammalian Fbh1 is important to restore normal mitotic progression following decatenation stress.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In human cells, FBH1 accumulates at sites of DNA damage and replication stress in a manner dependent on its helicase activity (19Fugger K. Mistrik M. Danielsen J.R. Dinant C. Falck J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mailand N. Human Fbh1 helicase contributes to genome maintenance via pro- and anti-recombinase activities.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the role of FBH1 in mammalian cells, we have taken a combined biochemical, biophysical, and molecular genetic approach. We show that purified human FBH1 is able to bind directly to RAD51 and to disrupt RAD51 filaments. Consistent with this, analysis of a mouse cell line with a defective FBH1 helicase indicates that the association of RAD51 with chromatin is normally restrained by FBH1. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the role of FBH1 as a negative regulator of RAD51 function in order to prevent unwanted HR. A totipotent, adherent mouse ES cell line, designated R1, was obtained from Yusa et al. (20Yusa K. Horie K. Kondoh G. Kouno M. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Genome-wide phenotype analysis in ES cells by regulated disruption of Bloom's syndrome gene.Nature. 2004; 429: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A derivative of R1, containing both copies of the Fbh1 gene inactivated, was generated by the use two targeting vectors differing only in their drug resistance cassette. These vectors were designed to delete helicase domains II and III, along with the insertion of either a puromycin (pur)- or neomycin (neo)-resistant gene plus an HSV domain. Confluent Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells were grown for 7 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2.4 mm glutamine, and non-essential amino acids. The medium was collected and used as conditioned medium for ES cell culture. ES cells were grown in 50% DMEM and 50% medium conditioned by BRL cells, supplemented with 10% FCS, 2.4 mm glutamine, 1,000 units/ml murine leukemia inhibitory factor required by ES cells to maintain their pluripotent state, non-essential amino acids, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BrdU for 20 min. Then cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were stained with BrdU antibody (1:10; BD Biosciences), 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS. Cells were then labeled with secondary anti-mouse AF488 antibody (1:200; Invitrogen). Cell cycle distributions and BrdU population were measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The sensitivity of mouse ES cells to increasing doses of DNA-damaging agents was determined using a clonogenic assay. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated into 60-mm dishes coated with 0.1% porcine skin type A gelatin at a density of 1,000 cells/dish. Incubation was for a further 24 h, following which the cells were either exposed to ionizing radiation or treated with drug-containing medium for 2 h (cisplatin) or 24 h (camptothecin). After the treatment period, cells were washed in PBS and then grown in fresh medium. Incubation was for 6–8 days, following which cells were washed in PBS, fixed, and stained with crystal violet. Colonies were then counted using a Stuart Scientific Colony Counter. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted as survivors, and the number of colonies at each time point or drug dose was expressed as a percentage of the colony number in the untreated control. All time points were performed in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated three times. Mouse ES cells were grown in medium containing 10 μg/ml BrdU for 24 h. 100 ng/ml KaryoMAX Colcemid was added for the final 30 min of the treatment period. The cells were then washed in PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cells were swelled in hypotonic buffer containing 50 mm KCl before being incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Fixing was in freshly made ice-cold fixative solution (methanol/acetic acid, 3:1), and fixed cells were stored at −20 °C. To prepare the slides, the stored cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh, ice-cold fixative solution, and single droplets from a Gilson P200 pipette were dropped from a height of ∼30 cm onto glass coverslips, followed by incubation overnight in the dark at 42 °C. The slides were then stained with 20 μg/ml bis-benzimide for 30 min, followed by exposure to 254-nm UV light in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for 3 h. The slides were then incubated in prewarmed 2× SSC at 65 °C for 2 h before staining with 0.8% MSG Giemsa for 3.5 min. Slides were scored blindly using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with Lucia G software. 800–1,000 metaphase chromosomes/cell line were examined, and an unpaired t test was used to determine the significance in any difference in the distribution of SCEs. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with 0.5% gelatin at ∼25% confluence. 24 h later, cells were left untreated or were treated with 100 nm camptothecin and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed in PBS, and stored at 4 °C. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were washed and exposed to the primary antibody (anti-Rad51 (1:5,000) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Kanaar) or anti-γH2AX (1:500) (Upstate)) for 16 h. Following this, the samples were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then exposed for 30 min to secondary antibody. After final washes in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI Vectashields® before the coverslips were sealed onto glass slides. Nuclear staining patterns were visualized with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta), and images were stored and analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser software. Scoring was done either blindly by counting the number of nuclear foci or alternatively by using ImageJ software to measure the relative total nuclear fluorescence from RAD51 staining. The differences between the cell lines were evaluated statistically using unpaired t tests. The puromycin-resistant gene in the DR-GFP plasmid was excised using EcoRV and BspEI and blunt end-ligated with a hygromycin-resistant gene under the control of a PGK promotor to generate the DR-GFP-Hyg plasmid. Mouse ES cells were electroporated with the DR-GFP-Hyg by using a Bio-Rad electroporator (GenePulser XcellTM) at a single pulse of 800 V and 3.0 microfarads. Stable transfected clones were selected with 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells containing the DR-GFP-Hyg plasmid were subjected into the DR-GFP assay as described previously (21Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Measuring recombination proficiency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 291: 373-384PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid hFBH1/pAS2-1 encoding for human FBH1 isoform 4 (2.91 kb, 969 amino acids) served as a source of FBH1 cDNA in this study (12Kim J. Kim J.H. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Kang H.Y. Bae S.H. Pan Z.Q. Seo Y.S. The novel human DNA helicase hFBH1 is an F-box protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24530-24537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). FBH1 was subcloned as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (N terminus) and hexahistidine tags (C terminus) in pFastBac1 via SalI and KpnI sites to yield a transfer vector for bacmid production. The D698N mutant of FBH1 was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To produce antigen for anti-FBH1 antibody preparation, the N-terminal part of FBH1 (isoform 4) including amino acids 1–484 was subcloned into the pTYB12 vector via NheI/XhoI sites, creating a fusion with an N-terminal self-cleavable affinity tag containing a chitin-binding domain (CBD-FBH1(1–484)). A polyclonal antibody against an FBH1 fragment spanning amino acids 1–484 was raised in a chicken. The antibody was extracted from egg yolk and affinity-purified using a column conjugated with the antigen. A polyclonal antibody against the full-length human RAD51 was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified using a RAD51-conjugated column. GST-FBH1-His6 (or its D698N mutant) was produced in Sf9 insect cells by means of a baculovirus system. Typically, 1.5 × 108 cells were infected by appropriate virus and incubated for 2 days at 28 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in GST-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The soluble protein extract obtained by centrifugation (47,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C) was incubated with 2 ml of 50% GSH-agarose for 2–4 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Beads were washed three times with 30 ml of GST-lysis buffer (centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min; 4 °C). FBH1 protein was eluted from the beads by GST elution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mm glutathione. Elution fractions containing FBH1 protein were pooled and incubated with 0.5 ml of 50% heparin beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After binding, beads were washed three times with 20 ml of Hep-buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and protein was eluted with Hep-buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The heparin-elution fractions (1 ml) containing FBH1 were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The final protein preparation was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by a Bradford assay. RAD51, RAD51K133R, RPA, and RECQ5 were produced and purified as described previously (22Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P.

Semiconfluent cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, and counted. A pellet of ∼2 × 106 cells was washed three times in PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of freshly made protein buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The sample was centrifuged at 210 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and stored (cytoplasmic soluble fraction). The pellet was washed in 200 μl of protein buffer A and centrifuged at 210 × g for 4 min at 4 °C before the nuclei were lysed in 175 μl of freshly made buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). Incubation was for 10 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 270 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored (nuclear soluble fraction). The pellet was resuspended in 175 μl of buffer B and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C before the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended (chromatin-associated fraction) in 175 μl of Laemmli buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), boiled, and sheared with a 25-gauge needle. Storage of all samples was at −80 °C. For analysis, 10× BFB-2-ME (0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 5% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol) was added, the samples were boiled, and the soluble fractions were combined. Proteins were separated on a 10% BisTris gel with MOPS buffer. Proteins were transferred to a membrane and probed with Rad51 antibody (1:200; Abcam), ORC4L antibody (1:1,000; Abcam), or GRB2 antibody (1:1,000; BD Transduction Laboratories). 100 ng of purified RAD51 and 200 ng of GST-FBH1-His (or 200 ng of GST) were added to 0.4 ml of NET-N150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Where required, DTT was present at a concentration of 1 mm. 15 μl of GSH-agarose slurry was added to the protein mixtures, followed by incubation for another 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation (300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C), washed four times with 1 ml of NET-N150 buffer, and incubated with 12 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, followed by Western blot analysis. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer R (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA) supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 12 mm creatine phosphate, and 2 mm ATP. 2 μm RAD51K133R was preincubated with circular M13mp8.32 ssDNA (9 μm nucleotides) for 6 min, followed by the addition of 150 nm RPA and a DNA helicase (RECQ5 (80 and 160 nm), FBH1 (50, 160, 210, and 320 nm), or FBH1D698N (320 nm)). After a 6-min incubation, topologically relaxed pGEM-7Zf(+) DNA (7 μm base pairs) and 3 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I (Promega) were added to complete the reaction, which was then incubated for a further 8 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of STOP buffer (6% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 m EDTA, 5 mg/ml proteinase K), followed by a 25-min incubation at 37 °C. Deproteinized DNA species were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel run in 0.5× TBE buffer at 100 V for 2 h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and photographed on a UV transilluminator. DNA bands were quantified using ImageQuant software, and the quantity of supercoiled DNA products was expressed as a percentage of the amount of product generated in the reaction containing only RAD51K133R and dsDNA (100%). To generate topologically relaxed dsDNA, 4 μg of supercoiled pGEM-7Zf(+) DNA were incubated with 1.6 μg of Escherichia coli topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of buffer R supplemented by 100 μg/ml BSA. Reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 min. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Reactions were carried out in buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and supplemented by an oxygen-scavenging system (1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.4% (w/v) d-glucose, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, and 2 mm Trolox) (25Rothenberg E. Ha T. Single-molecule FRET analysis of helicase functions.Methods Mol.

Briefly, DNA FRET constructs (30 pm) were specifically tethered to the surface of a biofunctionalized microfluidic chamber through a biotin-neutravidin link, followed by the addition of proteins. Data were recorded and analyzed by scripts written in IDL to generate fluorescence intensity time trajectories of individual molecules. A time resolution of 0.03 s was used for all experiments. Single-molecule fluorescence time trajectories were viewed and analyzed using programs written in Matlab. FRET efficiency (EFRET) was approximated as the ratio between the acceptor intensity and the sum of the acceptor and donor intensities. Histograms were generated using a sample size of over 100 individual molecular trajectories. To investigate the function of the FBH1 helicase in the maintenance of genome stability, we undertook a multidisciplinary study combining cellular, biochemical, and biophysical approaches. To investigate the functional consequences of inactivating the helicase activity of FBH1, we characterized a previously described mouse ES cell line with a deletion in the FBH1 helicase domain (27Fugger K. Chu W.K. Haahr P. Kousholt A.N. Beck H. Payne M.J. Hanada K. Hickson I.D. Sørensen C.S. FBH1 co-operates with MUS81 in inducing DNA double-strand breaks and cell death following replication stress.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this cell line, a replacement of each allele of the mouse Fbh1 gene region encoding helicase domains II and III was made using a drug resistance cassette, leading to termination of both Fbh1 open reading frames. Helicase domain II contains the Walker B box that is required for binding the ATP-Mg2+ complex and is essential, therefore, for ATPase activity and hence DNA translocation-unwinding. The correct targeting of the two Fbh1 alleles was verified previously by PCR using multiple primer pairs along the Fbh1 gene (27Fugger K. Chu W.K. Haahr P. Kousholt A.N. Beck H. Payne M.J. Hanada K.

Polyphosphate (polyP) 3The abbreviations used are: polyPpolyphosphatePCFprocyclic formBSFbloodstream formgDNAgenomic DNAaaamino acidsTBETris borate-EDTA. is an inorganic, linear polymer of orthophosphate (Pi) units linked by phosphoanhydride bonds. PolyP can exist as short (3 to ∼300 Pi) or long chain (∼300 to ∼1,000 Pi) polymers, is abundant in nature, and has been conserved during evolution (1Rao N.N. Gómez-Garcia M.R. Kornberg A.

Recently, the first eukaryotic enzyme involved in synthesis and translocation of polyP, ScVtc4p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar transporter chaperone 4), was identified (13Hothorn M. Neumann H.

The Vtc complex consists of four proteins (Vtc1–4) that form hetero-oligomeric complexes and are able to synthesize and transfer polyP into the vacuole as well as impacting membrane trafficking and vacuole fusion (14Cohen A.

Vtc4 forms the catalytic core of the complex, although null mutations of each of the Vtc proteins result in reduced accumulation of polyP. Vtc proteins are present in fungi, algae, trypanosomatids, and Apicomplexan parasites but are absent in mammalian cells. In many cells, short and long chain polyP accumulate in acidocalcisomes, acidic calcium stores (17Patel S. Docampo R. Acidic calcium stores open for business.

T. brucei belongs to the group of trypanosomes that causes human African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness), an endemic disease of Sub-Saharan Africa. There is no vaccine available for this disease, and chemotherapy also remains unsatisfactory, especially for advanced cases when a neurological phase has been reached and the disease becomes potentially fatal. Previous work has shown that polyP has a critical role in survival of trypanosomes under sharp environmental changes, including osmotic stress (22Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R.

Regulation of cell volume is, in addition, a homeostatic process needed at all times by all cells. PolyP hydrolysis occurs during hyposmotic stress of trypanosomes (22Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O.

On the other hand, an increase in long chain polyP levels has been observed in T. cruzi during hyperosmotic stress (22Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R.

This latter work suggested that polyP could play an important role at the early stages of hyperosmotic stress response by sequestering ions into the acidocalcisomes to reduce the ionic strength of the cytosol (23Li Z.H.

DNA sequence corresponding to the TbVtc4 catalytic core (nucleotides 595–1518 of the TbVtc4 open reading frame, amino acids 199–506 of the full-length protein) was PCR-amplified from T. brucei 29-13 strain gDNA (forward primer, 5′-GACGACGACAAGATACCTTGTGGTACCGTTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTGTGGAAGCGCGAATGTCAA-3′) and ligation-independently cloned into vector pET32 Ek/LIC for heterologous expression in bacteria. The sequence of several recombinant clones was verified, and they were transformed by heat shock into E. coli BL21 Codon Plus (DE3)-RIPL chemically competent cells. Induction of TbVtc4(199–506) expression was performed with MagicMedia following the manufacturer's dual temperature protocol to avoid aggregation of protein in inclusion bodies for purification under native conditions. Protein expression was alternatively induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in LB broth for 3 h at 37 °C for purification under denaturing conditions.

The fragment was cloned with a TOPO-TA cloning kit, verified by sequencing, and ligated into the expression vector pQE-2 (Qiagen) using SacI and PmlI sites that were added to the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. E. coli (BL21 Codon Plus DE3 RIPL, Stratagene) were transformed with ScVtc4p(189–480)/pQE-2. Histidine-tagged ScVtc4p(189–480) was induced overnight at 25 °C with 0.5 m isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, isolated by metal ion affinity chromatography, and desalted on a HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) with 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT (13Hothorn M.

Cell pellets from a 200-ml culture of recombinant E. coli BL21 expressing TbVtc4(199–506) grown in MagicMedia were resuspended and incubated for 30 min on ice in 20 ml of cold lysis buffer: 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 25 units/ml Benzonase® nuclease and protease inhibitor mixture for purification of histidine-tagged proteins (Sigma; 50 μl/g of cell paste). Then three sonication pulses (40% amplitude, 30 s, on ice) were applied to ensure the complete disruption of cells. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatant was passed through a 0.8-μm pore nitrocellulose filter in order to obtain a clarified crude protein extract that was kept on ice and used for immediate purification of recombinant TbVtc4(199–506). Protein purification was performed at 4 °C using HIS-Select® Cartridge (Sigma), in an immobilized nickel-ion affinity chromatography system, following the manufacturer's protocol for histidine-tagged protein purification under native conditions. One-ml fractions were eluted (elution buffer: 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 250 mm imidazole), and buffer exchange was performed immediately using PD-10 desalting columns to finally obtain the protein in assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.5). All purification steps were verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using anti-histidine tag commercial antibodies or S-protein HRP conjugate. For antibody production, recombinant TbVtc4(199–506) was purified under denaturing conditions using HIS-Select® Cartridge (Sigma). Polyclonal anti-TbVtc4 antibodies were generated in a guinea pig by Covance (Princeton, NJ) against a synthetic peptide (CSRSRRVYARRKIRYDDRRG) that corresponds to a conserved hydrophilic region located between the second and the third predicted transmembrane domains of the TbVtc4 amino acid sequence. In addition, polyclonal anti-TbVtc4 antibodies were produced in mice using recombinant TbVtc4(199–506) as an antigen. These antibodies were generated at the Monoclonal Antibody Facility of the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia (Athens, GA). Final bleeds from five inoculated mice were affinity-purified by immunoadsorption to the recombinant protein immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. The adsorbed antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutral pH was restored immediately by adding 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. For immunofluorescence assays, T. brucei PCF trypanosomes were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C; washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4; and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h on ice. Afterward, cells were adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips; permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 3 min; washed three times; and blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, 1% fish gelatin, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 5% goat serum for 1 h. Next, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies: polyclonal guinea pig anti-TbVtc4 (1:50) or rat anti-HA tag high affinity mAb (Roche Applied Science; diluted 1:10) and polyclonal rabbit anti-TbVP1 (1:250), as acidocalcisome marker. After washing three times with 3% BSA in PBS (pH 8.0), cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig or anti-rabbit (1:1,000) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:1,500). Then, cells were counterstained with 5 μg/ml DAPI to label nuclei and kinetoplast (mitochondrial DNA). Finally, all preparations were washed again three times with 3% BSA in PBS (pH 8.0) and mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology). Differential interference contrast and fluorescence optical images were captured under non-saturating conditions and identical exposure times using an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope with a Photometrix CoolSnapHQ charge-coupled device (CCD) camera driven by DeltaVision software (Applied Precision). BSF trypanosomes were washed twice in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and fixed for 1 h on ice with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were processed for cryo-immunoelectron microscopy at the Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility, Washington University School of Medicine. HA fusion protein localization was detected with a polyclonal antibody against HA and anti-rabbit gold-conjugated as a secondary antibody. Mouse anti-TbVP1 polyclonal antibodies and anti-mouse gold-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. For determination of TbVtc4 and ScVtc4p kinetic parameters, the specific activity of the enzyme was assayed using an ADP determination kit (PhosphoWorksTM fluorimetric ADP assay kit, AAT Bioquest, Inc.) to quantify the amount of ADP or GDP synthesized during polyP polymerization at different ATP or GTP concentrations. Analysis of ATP conversion by the recombinant catalytic domain of ScVtc4p was carried out in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm ATP, at room temperature using 1 μm ScVtc4p. TbVtc4 polyP kinase activity was assayed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MnCl2, at room temperature using 1 μm TbVtc4 and 1 mm ATP or different concentrations of ATP or GTP. When indicated, 1 mm PPi was included in the reactions. Twenty-μl reactions were incubated 1 h at room temperature. Components A and B of the ADP/GDP determination kit were added immediately, and after a 30-min incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was detected at a 540/590-nm excitation/emission ratio in a Molecular Devices plate reader. An ADP (or GDP) standard curve was obtained for quantification purposes. The data were fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation, and GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 was used for data analysis and determination of Km, Vmax, and kcat. ATP hydrolysis was also monitored via NADH oxidation enzymatically coupled to the rephosphorylation of produced ADP. NADH concentration was measured optically at 340 nm in buffer containing 150 μm NADH, 0.15 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATP, and the incubations were done under the same conditions described above. To visualize TbVtc4 and ScVtc4p reaction products, newly synthesized polyP chains were detected by autoradiography using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate. PolyP was separated by electrophoresis on Tris borate-EDTA (TBE)-polyacrylamide gels. Reactions were carried out as described above using 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 50 μl for 8 h at room temperature and stopped by adding EDTA (final concentration = 1 mm) and 10× sample buffer (2 mg/ml Orange G, 30% glycerol). Before loading the samples, TBE-polyacrylamide gels (0.1 × 16 × 20 cm, 1× TBE, 10% polyacrylamide ("

The stability of Far1 is regulated by a mechanism that is dependent on cellular plasmalogen levels. However, the membrane topology of Far1 and how Far1 is targeted to membranes remain largely unknown. Here, Far1 is shown to be a peroxisomal tail-anchored protein. The hydrophobic C terminus of Far1 binds to Pex19p, a cytosolic receptor harboring a C-terminal CAAX motif, which is responsible for the targeting of Far1 to peroxisomes. Far1, but not Far2, was preferentially degraded in response to the cellular level of plasmalogens. Experiments in which regions of Far1 or Far2 were replaced with the corresponding region of the other protein showed that the region flanking the transmembrane domain of Far1 is required for plasmalogen-dependent modulation of Far1 stability. Expression of Far1 increased plasmalogen synthesis in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, strongly suggesting that Far1 is a rate-limiting enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094536853,"Myofibroblast (MF) differentiation, marked by the de novo expression of smooth muscle α-actin (αSMA) stress fibers, plays a central role in wound healing and its persistence is a hallmark of fibrotic diseases. We have previously shown that Akt1 is necessary for wound healing through matrix regulation. However, the role of Akt1 in regulating MF differentiation with implications in fibrosis remains poorly defined. Here, we show that sustained activation of Akt1 was associated with a 6-fold increase in αSMA expression and assembly; an effect that is blunted in cells expressing inactive Akt1 despite TGFβ stimulation. Mechanistically, Akt1 mediated TGFβ-induced αSMA synthesis through the contractile gene transcription factors myocardin and serum response factor (SRF), independent of mammalian target of rapamycin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and fibroblasts overexpressing active Akt1. Akt1 deficiency was associated with decreased myocardin, SRF, and αSMA expressions in vivo. Furthermore, sustained Akt1-induced αSMA synthesis markedly decreased upon RNA silencing of SRF and myocardin. In addition to its integral role in αSMA synthesis, we also show that Akt1 mediates fibronectin splice variant expression, which is required for MF differentiation, as well as total fibronectin, which generates the contractile force that promotes MF differentiation. In summary, our results constitute evidence that sustained Akt1 activation is crucial for TGFβ-induced MF formation and persistent differentiation. These findings highlight Akt1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2037469042,"Dendritic cell inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2) is a C-type lectin expressed on classical dendritic cells. We recently identified the unique ligand specificity of mouse DCIR2 (mDCIR2) toward biantennary complex-type glycans containing bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Here, we report the crystal structures of the mDCIR2 carbohydrate recognition domain in unliganded form as well as in complex with an agalactosylated complex-type N-glycan unit carrying a bisecting GlcNAc residue. Bisecting GlcNAc and the α1-3 branch of the biantennary oligosaccharide asymmetrically interact with canonical and non-canonical mDCIR2 residues. Ligand-protein interactions occur directly through mDCIR2-characteristic amino acid residues as well as via a calcium ion and water molecule.

The innate immune system uses a variety of pattern recognition receptors on the cell surface to recognize molecular structures shared among pathogens. C-type lectin receptors on dendritic cells are carbohydrate binding receptors that interact with pathogens primarily through the recognition of foreign or endogenous carbohydrate structures (1Sancho D.

Adema G.J. C-type lectin receptors on dendritic cells and Langerhans cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These C-type lectin receptors recognize mannose, fucose, and glucan carbohydrate structures that comprise the cell walls of pathogens (4Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. The C-type lectin-like domain superfamily.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The recognition of pathogens by C-type lectin receptors is essential for immune activation and antigen presentation. Proteins containing the C-type lectin domain constitute a superfamily of proteins, and more than 1000 of such proteins are classified into 17 groups (group I-XVII) on the basis of domain organization and phylogeny (4Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. The C-type lectin-like domain superfamily.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding is the most common function of the C-type lectin domain. Group II C-type lectin receptors are type II transmembrane proteins consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane helix, an extracellular stalk region, and a single C-type lectin domain. This group consists of asialoglycoprotein receptor, dendritic cell (DC) 4The abbreviations used are: DCdendritic cellmDCIR2mouse DCIR2DC-SIGNDC-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrinDCIRdendritic cell inhibitory receptorBDCA-2blood DC antigen-2HBSHEPES-buffered salineMDmolecular dynamicsE-PHAerythroagglutinating P. vulgaris agglutininGnT-IIIN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IIIBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), Langerin, scavenger receptor, and members of DC-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1) and the DC inhibitory receptor (DCIR) family.

Recently we found that mDCIR2 specifically binds to complex-type N-glycan containing bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). 5T. Nishimura et al., manuscript in preparation. Mouse DCIR2 is the first example of an animal lectin that specifically binds bisected N-glycan. Bisecting GlcNAc is a β1–4-linked GlcNAc residue attached to a β-mannose of the N-glycan core, and the reaction is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III/Mgat-III) (14Narasimhan S.

We couple the structures with a site-directed mutagenesis study and present a unique carbohydrate binding mode.

Hanashima et al., manuscript in preparation. Pyridylaminated biantennary glycans for NMR titration study were prepared from sheep immunoglobulin G (IgG). Briefly, the N-glycans attached to IgG were liberated by hydrazinolysis. After acetylation, the released oligosaccharides were pyridylaminated as described previously (22Takahashi N. Nakagawa H.

The pyridylamino derivatives of the oligosaccharides were separated on an ODS column, and the two target oligosaccharides (Fig. 6A) isolated. Each chemical structure was identified by 1H NMR based on previous reports (24Fujii S. Nishiura T. Nishikawa A. Miura R. Taniguchi N. Structural heterogeneity of sugar chains in immunoglobulin G.

A DNA fragment encoding mDCIR2 CRD (Cys-107–Lys-233) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of a pCold-TEV vector that had been modified to include a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence between the hexahistidine tag and mDCIR2. The expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C, and the expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 16 h at 15 °C. The harvested cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl (pH 7.4)) containing Bugbuster (Novagen) and then sonicated. After centrifugation, the inclusion bodies were washed 3 times with PBS. The resulting protein was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Solubilized protein was diluted into 2 liters of buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 m l-arginine, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione. The mixture was equilibrated at 4 °C for 16 h with slow stirring and then concentrated to a volume of 200 ml by the QuixStand Benchtop system (GE Healthcare). The concentrated protein solution was extensively dialyzed against 2 liters of PBS containing 10% (v/v) glycerol at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein was applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with PBS containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was treated with tobacco etch virus protease for 16 h at 4 °C to remove the hexahistidine tag. The digest was applied onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. The protein fraction was concentrated to 3∼5 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra (molecular weight cutoff, 10,000) and then subjected to crystallization screening. All the crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 0.8-μl drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of protein and reservoir solution at 20 °C. The crystallization conditions were determined by screening using the Crystal Screen and Index (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Crystals of the ligand-free form were grown in a reservoir containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals in complex with hexasaccharide ligand were obtained in 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350. Before x-ray diffraction experiments, crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data sets for the crystals were collected at the synchrotron radiation source at AR-NW12A and BL17A in the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). All data sets were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab mDCIR2 CRD was dissolved at a concentration of 20 μm in a volume of 0.2 ml with 5 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) containing 25 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2. All NMR experiments were carried out on a DRX-500 spectrometer (BrukerBiospin) equipped with a triple resonance cryogenic probe with the temperature set to 283 K. 1H chemical shift values are given in ppm calibrated with external reference DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) at 0 ppm. Data processing was performed by XWIN-NMR Version 3.5 (BrukerBiospin), and the spectra were displayed using XWIN-PLOT Version 3.5 (BrukerBiospin). To express the extracellular part of mDCIR2 on the surface of the reporter cells, the pMXs-IRES-GFP vector, containing cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic region of mouse CD3ζ as well as the Ly49A transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain of mDCIR2 (residues 70–236), was constructed and used for the transduction of BWZ.36 cells to establish the mDCIR2 reporter cell line BWZ.mDCIR2. The empty vector (without the DCIR2 extracellular domain) was used to establish the control cell line BWZ.Myc. The lectin-resistant CHO cell line, Lec8 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was transfected with mouse GlcNAc-transferase III cDNA (mgatIII), and the stably expressing cell clone, Lec8mgatIII, was used. BWZ.mDCIR2 reporter cells were cocultured with Lec8 or Lec8mgatIII cells in ELISA plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) for 16 h, and then the β-galactosidase activity was determined by colorimetric assay using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) as the substrate. mDCIR2 clones containing the individual mutations N198A, Q199A, W201A, D223A, or H225A were also generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The presence of complex-type N-glycans with bisecting GlcNAc on the cell surface was confirmed by E-PHA binding using flow cytometry. Lec8 or Lec8mgatIII cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated with biotinylated E-PHA (1 μg/ml) in 40 μl of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl (HEPES-buffered saline (HBS)) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% NaN3, and 0.1% BSA at 25 °C for 60 min. After washing with HBS, the cells were stained with 10 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark. After washing 3 times with HBS, the cells were suspended in 300 μl of HBS containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. The cells were analyzed by a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosystems) and a FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Our aim was to reveal how mDCIR2 specifically recognizes the glycans that have a bisecting GlcNAc residue. To investigate the binding mode of mDCIR2, we determined the crystal structures of the mDCIR2 CRD in the absence and presence of the carbohydrate ligand. The crystals of the ligand-free form of mDCIR2 CRD belong to space group P6522 and diffracted to 2.15 Å resolution. The initial phase of mDCIR2 CRD was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of DC-SIGN CRD as a search model, sharing 34% amino acid sequence identity with the mDCIR2 CRD (Fig. 1). The asymmetric unit contains one mDCIR2 CRD molecule. mDCIR2 CRD is composed of two α-helices (α1 and α2) and seven β-strands (β1, β1′, β2, β2′, β3, β4, and β5) with three disulfide bridges (Cys-107–Cys-118, Cys-136–Cys-229, and Cys-204–Cys-221) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, upper panel). There are two antiparallel β-sheets; one is formed by the β1′, β1, and β5 strands, and the other is formed by the β3 and β4 strands. The architecture of mDCIR2 CRD thus preserves key features of a typical long-form C-type lectin-like domain (33Drickamer K. C-type lectin-like domains.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A difference observed in the mDCIR2 CRD structure compared with other CRDs is that the β2 strand is short and, therefore, does not participate in the β-sheet composed of the β3 and β4 strands. Instead, an additional short β-hairpin loop is formed between Leu-169 (β2) and Trp-179 (β2′). There is no discernable electron density corresponding to a calcium ion in the ligand-free mDCIR2 molecule. The high concentration (2.0 m) of ammonium sulfate, used as precipitant, may have significantly lowered the free Ca2+ concentration. Structural superposition of mDCIR2 and DC-SIGN reveals that the loop connecting the β3 and β4 strands (His-209–Trp-214) of mDCIR2 is relatively long and kinked toward the carbohydrate binding site (Fig. 2, lower panel). The DALI server (34Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server. Conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) revealed that mouse scavenger receptor C-type lectin (SRCL) CRD has the closest structural similarity to mDCIR2 CRD (PDB code 2OX9; Z score = 22.1, root mean square deviation = 1.0 Å for 116 Cα atoms) (35Feinberg H.

To clarify the recognition mechanism of the bisecting GlcNAc-containing glycan, we co-crystallized mDCIR2 with a truncated hexasaccharide of biantennary complex-type glycan containing bisecting GlcNAc (Fig. 3B). Co-crystals of mDCIR2 CRD with the hexasaccharide diffracted to 1.5 Å resolution in the P3221 space group. The asymmetric unit contains one protein-carbohydrate complex. The electron density for the hexasaccharide, with all six carbohydrate residues, was readily identified (Fig. 3C). The dispersive difference Fourier map calculated from the data set at a wavelength of 1.7 Å revealed only one strong peak density (above 10 σ), corresponding to a calcium ion located in the canonical binding site (Fig. 3D). The calcium ion is octa-coordinated by the acidic oxygen atoms of Glu-196, Glu-202, and Asp-218, the oxygen atoms from amides Asn-198 and Asn-217, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp-218 and OH3 and OH4 hydroxyl groups of α1-3-linked mannose (Man-4). The hexasaccharide forms a “trident”-like structure, with mDCIR2 CRD interacting with three carbohydrate residues; that is, Man-4 and GlcNAc-5 in the α1-3 branch as well as bisecting GlcNAc (GlcNAc-7) (Fig. 4A). Carbohydrate recognition by mDCIR2 is mediated by several hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds. For the recognition of bisecting GlcNAc (GlcNAc-7), mDCIR2 CRD interacts with two hydroxyl groups, OH4 and OH6 (Fig. 4B). The OH4 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc-7 forms a hydrogen bond with the Oδ atom of Asp-223, and the OH6 hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the Oϵ atom of Glu-202. One water molecule bridges the Oϵ atom of Gln-199, OH6 of GlcNAc-7, and OH1 of Man-4. Thus, the recognition of bisecting GlcNAc is associated with the α1-3 branch. In this branch Man-4 is mainly stabilized by coordination bonds between the OH3/OH4 groups and a calcium ion (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the OH3 group of Man-4 binds to the side chain of Glu-202. The OH4 group of Man-4 hydrogen bonds with the Oϵ atom of Glu-196 and the Nδ atom of Asn-198. mDCIR2 CRD interacts with two hydroxyl groups (OH4 and OH6) and the acetyl oxygen atom (O7) of GlcNAc-5 in the α1-3 branch (Fig. 4D). The OH4 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc-5 interacts with the Nϵ atom of His-225. The OH6 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc-5 forms a hydrogen bond with the Oδ atom of Asp-223. The acetyl oxygen (O7) of GlcNAc-5 hydrogen bonds with the Nδ atoms of two asparagine residues (Asn-208 and Asn-217) and forms water-mediated contacts with the Oϵ atom of Glu-196 and the Nζ atom of Lys-210. In contrast to the extensive interaction of the α1-3 branch with mDCIR2, the α1-6 branch does not interact with mDCIR2 CRD. The α1-6 branch is located far from mDCIR2 CRD and is completely solvent-exposed. R"

In the present study, we found that CQ induced blood cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs). CQ accumulated the acetylation levels of several key proteins including histone H3 (H3), p53, HSP90, and α-tubulin. In the mechanistic study, CQ was found to down-regulate HDAC1, -3, -4, and -5 in both myeloma and leukemia cells. Computer modeling analysis revealed that CQ was well docked into the active pocket of the enzyme, where the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in CQ formed stable coordinate bonds with the zinc ion, and the hydroxyl group from CQ formed an effective hydrogen bond with Asp-267. Moreover, co-treatment with CQ and zinc/copper chloride led to decreased Ac-H3. Furthermore, CQ inhibited the activity of Class I and IIa HDACs in the cell-free assays, demonstrating that CQ interfered with HDAC activity. By inhibiting HDAC activity, CQ induced expression of p21, p27, and p53, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and cell apoptosis. This study suggested that the HDAC enzymes are targets of CQ, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of CQ in the treatment of hematological malignancies.

Acetylation is an important modification of lysine residues on histones and other proteins and plays a critical role in modulating gene expression as an epigenetic regulator (1Rodríguez-Paredes M. Esteller M. Cancer epigenetics reaches mainstream oncology.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C.

This acetylation/deacetylation process is controlled by two kinds of enzymes: histone acetyltransferases, which add acetyl groups to lysine residues, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), 2The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylaseAc-H3acetylated histone H3CQclioquinolMMmultiple myelomaTSAtrichostatin A. which remove the acetyl groups from substrate proteins. Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge in histone proteins by changing amines into amides, thus decreasing the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows chromatin expansion, providing access for transcription factors to bind to their target promoters and permitting genetic transcription to take place. In contrast, HDACs remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high affinity binding between histones and the DNA backbone. Thus HDACs modulate gene expression and cellular processes by deacetylating histones (1Rodríguez-Paredes M. Esteller M. Cancer epigenetics reaches mainstream oncology.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M.

Pallaoro M. Steinkühler C. HDACs, histone deacetylation and gene transcription. From molecular biology to cancer therapeutics.Cell Res. 2007; 17: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because deacetylation of histones condenses chromatin structure and represses gene transcription, it is hypothesized that by this mechanism, inhibition of HDACs slows down replication forks, activates dormant origins, and induces DNA damage and cancer cell apoptosis (5Conti C.

HDACs are up-regulated in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate cancer, and the depletion of HDACs could inhibit the growth of various human cancer cell lines (3Yang X.J.

A review of depsipeptide and other histone deacetylase inhibitors in clinical trials.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2289-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). HDACs could be divided into two groups based on their zinc dependence (4Gallinari P. Di Marco S. Jones P. Pallaoro M. Steinkühler C. HDACs, histone deacetylation and gene transcription. From molecular biology to cancer therapeutics.Cell Res. 2007; 17: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Zinc-dependent HDACs include 11 members covering Classes I (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8), II (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10), and IV (HDAC11). The classic pharmacophore for HDAC inhibitors consists of three distinct structural motifs: the zinc-binding group, a hydrophobic linker, and a recognition cap group (13Chen P.C. Patil V. Guerrant W. Green P. Oyelere A.K. Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors with triazole-linked cap group.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2008; 16: 4839-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The HDAC-specific zinc-binding motif adjacent to the active site is likely to participate in substrate recognition and protein-protein interaction and may provide a site for modulation of activity (14Schuetz A.

Clioquinol (CQ) is an antifungal and antiparasitic drug and is also a strong chelator of divalent metal ions such as zinc and copper (15Mao X. Schimmer A.D. The toxicology of clioquinol.Toxicol.

Chen D. Orlu S. Cui Q.C. Miller F.R. Dou Q.P.

Various mechanisms have been proposed in cell death by these agents. For example, nitroxoline kills bladder cancer by inhibiting type 2 methionine aminopeptidase protein and angiogenesis (19Shim J.S. Matsui Y. Bhat S. Nacev B.A. Xu J. Bhang H.E. Dhara S. Han K.C. Chong C.R. Pomper M.G. So A. Liu J.O. Effect of nitroxoline on angiogenesis and growth of human bladder cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2010; 102: 1855-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although 5-amino-8-hydroxyl-quinoline is associated with proteasome inhibition (20Li X. Wood T.E. Sprangers R. Jansen G. Franke N.E. Mao X. Wang X. Zhang Y. Verbrugge S.E. Adomat H. Li Z.H. Trudel S. Chen C. Religa T.L. Jamal N. Messner H. Cloos J. Rose D.R. Navon A. Guns E. Batey R.A. Kay L.E. Schimmer A.D. Effect of noncompetitive proteasome inhibition on bortezomib resistance.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2010; 102: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CQ is the most studied one. In the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, CQ acts as a chelator to bind to zinc and copper highly accumulated in the brain tissue (21Bareggi S.R. Cornelli U. Clioquinol. Review of its mechanisms of action and clinical uses in neurodegenerative disorders.CNS Neurosci. Ther. 2012; 18: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the presence of zinc and copper, CQ displays great activity to inhibit proteasome activity and induces cancer cell death. CQ-induced cancer cell death is probably associated with lysosomal blockage (22Yu H. Zhou Y. Lind S.E. Ding W.Q. Clioquinol targets zinc to lysosomes in human cancer cells.Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and reactive oxygen species induction (23Chen H.L. Chang C.Y. Lee H.T. Lin H.H. Lu P.J. Yang C.N. Shiau C.W. Shaw A.Y. Synthesis and pharmacological exploitation of clioquinol-derived copper-binding apoptosis inducers triggering reactive oxygen species generation and MAPK pathway activation.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 7239-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the induction of cancer cell death, CQ is also found to inhibit NFκB and TNF signaling pathway, as well as modulation of zinc or copper transportation (24Schimmer A.D. Clioquinol. A novel copper-dependent and independent proteasome inhibitor.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2011; 11: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CQ probably acts in a broad panel of mechanisms. However, the capacity to chelate divalent metal ions is probably a key nature in the biological activity of CQ. Because divalent metal ions are essential for HDAC activity, we hypothesized that CQ may induce apoptosis by inhibiting HDAC activity via interfering with zinc in the active sites of these enzymes. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of CQ on HDAC activity by computer modeling and cell-free and cell-based assays and found that CQ-induced leukemia and myeloma cell death is associated with HDAC inhibition. Human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines (RPMI-8226 and OPM2) and leukemia cell lines (U937, K562, and THP-1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and MM cell lines (OCI-My5 and LP1) and leukemia cell line OCI-AML2 were generously provided by Dr. Aaron Schimmer (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada).

The structure of TSA complexed with HDAC8 (Protein Data Bank entry 1t64) (27Somoza J.R. Skene R.J. Katz B.A. Mol C. Ho J.D. Jennings A.J. Luong C. Arvai A. Buggy J.J. Chi E. Tang J. Sang B.C.

The Amber10 molecular simulation package was used to add hydrogen atoms and assign protonation states of residues in 1t64 (28Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6520) Google Scholar). The atomic partial charges of CQ were derived by semiempirical AM1 geometry optimization and subsequent single-point Hartree-Fock/6-31G* calculations of the electrostatic potential, to which the charges were fitted using the RESP technique (29Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. A well-behaved electrostatic potential based method using charge restraints for deriving atomic charges. The Resp model.J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5635) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential was calculated using Gaussian09, and the partial charges and force field parameters of CQ were generated automatically using the antechamber program in AMBER10 (28Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput.

Cieplak P. Luo R. Lee T. Caldwell J. Wang J. Kollman P. A point-charge force field for molecular mechanics simulations of proteins based on condensed-phase quantum mechanical calculations.J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (3731) Google Scholar), and the general AMBER force field was used for ligands (31Wang J. Wolf R.M. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Development and testing of a general amber force field.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1157-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (11699) Google Scholar). The whole system was immersed in a rectangular box of TIP3P water molecules. The water box was extended 9 Å from solute atoms in all three dimensions. Then the complex was relaxed by 5,000 cycles of minimization procedure (500 cycles of steepest descent and 4,500 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization). The last structure from minimization was selected for the molecular docking studies. Then the inhibitor and the water molecules were removed from the minimized complex, and CQ was docked into the active site of HDAC8 using the Glide program in Schrodinger. The docking sites were restricted to a cube with a 15 Å radius around the zinc ion in the active site, and no additional constraints were defined. In molecular docking calculations, the precision level was set to extra precision. The effects of CQ on recombinant HDAC enzyme activities were performed by the Reaction Biology Corporation and determined with specific HDAC substrates. Briefly, recombinant HDACs and substrates were diluted in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide). 5 nl of serial diluted CQ (in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added with the Echo 550 liquid handler (Labcyte Inc). According to the enzymatic specificity, a fluorogenic peptide from p53 residues 379–382 (RHKK(Ac)) was used as the substrate for Class I (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -5), Class IIb (HDAC6 and -10), and class IV HDACs (HDAC11), and a fluorogenic peptide from p53 residues 379–382 (RHK(Ac)K(Ac)) was used for HDAC8, whereas Boc-Lys(trifluoroacetyl)-AMC was used for Class IIA HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9). The reaction was started by adding substrates into the reaction mixture and was stopped after 2 h of incubation at 30 °C. Substrate concentrations were analyzed at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm. The structure of a luciferase reporter driven by cyclin D2 promoter was reported earlier (32Mao X. Stewart A.K. Hurren R. Datti A. Zhu X. Zhu Y. Shi C. Lee K. Tiedemann R. Eberhard Y. Trudel S. Liang S. Corey S.J. Gillis L.C. Barber D.L. Wrana J.L. Ezzat S. Schimmer A.D. A chemical biology screen identifies glucocorticoids that regulate c-maf expression by increasing its proteasomal degradation through up-regulation of ubiquitin.Blood. 2007; 110: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid (5 μg) was transfected in murine NIH3T3 cell line for 24 h, followed by splitting and treatment with CQ for another 24 h. Luciferase activity in these cells were then measured with a Bright-GloTM luciferase assay system as reported previously (32Mao X. Stewart A.K. Hurren R. Datti A. Zhu X. Zhu Y. Shi C. Lee K. Tiedemann R. Eberhard Y. Trudel S. Liang S. Corey S.J. Gillis L.C. Barber D.L. Wrana J.L. Ezzat S. Schimmer A.D.

To determine the inhibition of CQ on HDAC, we first evaluated the effects of CQ on the acetylation status of histone H3, one of the main targets of HDACs and the biomarker of HDAC inhibition (1Rodríguez-Paredes M. Esteller M. Cancer epigenetics reaches mainstream oncology.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Lysine acetylation targets protein complexes and co-regulates major cellular functions.Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3152) Google Scholar). After incubation with 0, 5, 10, or 20 μm of CQ or 100 nm of TSA for 24 h, the Ac-H3 level was analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that the pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA markedly increased the Ac-H3 level (Fig. 1). Similar to TSA, CQ increased Ac-H3 in both leukemia (THP-1) and myeloma (RPMI-8226) cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). To confirm this finding, we analyzed Ac-H3 expression in another leukemia (OCI-AML2) and MM cell line (LP1). Cells were treated with 10 μm of CQ for 12 -48 h and were found that Ac-H3 was induced by CQ in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). In addition to Ac-H3, CQ also raised the acetylation level of p53, HSP90 (Fig. 1c), and α-tubulin (Fig. 1d), but p53 and HSP90 acetylation levels were seen at higher concentrations only, which was probably due to varied response sensitivity of individual proteins. Because p21 and p27 expression is closely modulated by histone hyperacetylation and inhibition of HDACs induces their expression (33Mercurio C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G.

Anticancer activities of histone deacetylase inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar), we next examined the expression of p21 and p27 in MM cell lines LP1 and OCI-My5 using specific antibodies and found that both p21 and p27 were induced by CQ (Fig. 1e), which was consistent with previous studies (34Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Anticancer activities of histone deacetylase inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). This effect was also observed in primary myeloma and leukemia cells. CQ raised the Ac-H3 level in primary cells, along with increased p27 (Fig. 1f) and p53 proteins (Fig. 1g). Increase of Ac-H3 may result from down-regulation of the expression of HDACs and/or the inhibition of HDAC activity (8Mao X. Hou T. Cao B. Wang W. Li Z. Chen S. Fei M. Hurren R. Gronda M. Wu D.

https://openalex.org/W2113038839,"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria is an increasing threat to global health that underscores an urgent need for an expanded antibacterial armamentarium. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, have become increasingly important clinical pathogens with limited treatment options. This is due in part to their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane components, which dually serve as endotoxins while also protecting Gram-negative bacteria from antibiotic entry. The LpxC enzyme catalyzes the committed step of LPS biosynthesis, making LpxC a promising target for new antibacterials. Here, we present the first structure of an LpxC enzyme in complex with the deacetylation reaction product, UDP-(3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl))-glucosamine. These studies provide valuable insight into recognition of substrates and products by LpxC and a platform for structure-guided drug discovery of broad spectrum Gram-negative antibiotics."

In cystic fibrosis, 17β-estradiol (E2) may inhibit store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) to impinge upon airway secretions, leaving females at greater risk of contracting lung infections. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)-mediated SOCE is essential for cell homeostasis and regulates numerous processes including cell proliferation, smooth muscle contraction, and secretion. E2 can signal nongenomically to modulate Ca2+ signaling, but little is known of the underlying mechanisms. We found that E2 exposure inhibited STIM1 translocation in airway epithelia, preventing SOCE. This correlated with a decrease in STIM1-STIM1 FRET and STIM1 mobility in E2-exposed HEK293T cells co-expressing estrogen receptor α. We also examined the role of STIM1 phosphorylation in E2-mediated inhibition of STIM1 mobility. STIM1 is basally phosphorylated at serine 575, which is required for SOCE. Exposure to E2 significantly decreased STIM1 serine phosphorylation. Mutating serine 575 to an alanine blocked STIM1 phosphorylation, reduced basal STIM1 mobility, and rendered STIM1 insensitive to E2. These data indicate that E2 can signal nongenomically by inhibiting basal phosphorylation of STIM1, leading to a reduction in SOCE.

In airway epithelia, one important consequence of agonist-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i is the subsequent activation of transepithelial Cl− secretion through the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC). In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), who the lack the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel, CaCC is still present and represents a “rescue” channel that may help maintain airway hydration in the absence of the CFTR (9Tarran R.

We have previously shown that 17β-estradiol (E2) inhibits agonist-mediated Ca2+ signaling through estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in a nongenomic fashion in airway epithelia, which ultimately prevents CaCC activation and leads to airway dehydration (16Coakley R.D. Sun H. Clunes L.A. Rasmussen J.E. Stackhouse J.R. Okada S.F. Fricks I. Young S.L.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that E2 inhibits key components of SOCE. We found that STIM1 was specifically inhibited by E2/ESR1, leading to an inhibition of SOCE but not ER Ca2+ release. 17β-Estradiol and all salts and buffers were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thapsigargin, Fura-2/AM, and phalloidin were obtained from Life Technologies. Antibodies were from Abcam (anti-GFP, also recognizes YFP), Millipore (anti-mpm-2), and Sigma-Aldrich (anti-STIM1). cDNAs encoding YFP-tagged STIM1 and 570STOP-STIM1 (truncation mutant) were kindly provided by T. Meyers (Stanford, CA) and J. Putney (NIEHS, NC), respectively. mCherry-tagged STIM1 was created by replacing the YFP tag on STIM1 with mCherry. ESR1-CFP was kindly provided by R. Day (University of Virginia) and subsequently tagged with mOrange. Orai1-YFP and EB1-GFP constructs were purchased from Addgene (19756 and 39299, respectively). Human excess donor lungs and excised recipient lungs were obtained at the time of lung transplantation from portions of main stem or lumbar bronchi, and cells were harvested by enzymatic digestion as described previously under a protocol approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board (17Randell S.H.

Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were plated on either glass coverslips to perform siRNA knockdown experiments or on polyester membrane Transwells (Corning) to induce polarization. HBECs that were plated on Transwells were grown in an air-liquid interface for 3 weeks prior to experiments. HEK293T cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin solution. HEK293T cells were typically used 2–3 days after seeding. Cultures were transfected for 4–6 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfecting, cultures were washed and placed in phenol-free medium and allowed to incubate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight. STIM1 and Orai1 were transiently knocked down in HBECs using the Amaxa Nucleofector system according to the manufacturer's instructions with at least two different siRNA sequences obtained from Dharmacon. STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown were verified by quantitative PCR and at the functional level by measuring changes in intracellular Ca2+ with Fura-2. Intracellular Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed as described previously (16Coakley R.D. Sun H. Clunes L.A. Rasmussen J.E. Stackhouse J.R. Okada S.F. Fricks I. Young S.L. Tarran R. 17β-Estradiol inhibits Ca2+-dependent homeostasis of airway surface liquid volume in human cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 4025-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T and nonpolarized HBEC cultures were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM at 37 °C for 15 min. Polarized HBECs were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM while in the presence of 1 mm probenecid at 37 °C for 1 h. Cultures were washed with a standard Ringer's solution and then with Ca2+-free Ringer's solution. Cultures were then placed in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution, and images were collected with a 60 × 1.2 NA water objective on a Nikon Ti-S inverted microscope. Fura-2 fluorescence was acquired alternately at 340 and 380 nm (emission >450 nm) using LUDL filter wheels, obtained with an Orca CCD camera (Hammamatsu), and controlled with SimplePCI software. Background light levels were measured and subtracted from the corresponding signal measured in Fura-2-loaded cells before calculating the ratio (340/380). The background light levels in polarized HBECs were obtained by measuring the signals in non-Fura-2-loaded HBECs. Polarized HBECs were fixed bilaterally with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, HBECs were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated in blocking buffer (1% IgG-free BSA, 1% normal goat serum) at room temperature for 1 h. HBECs were then incubated with an antibody against STIM1 in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, HBECs were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature. Actin was stained with phalloidin-488 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All antibodies and stains were applied bilaterally. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). HEK293T cells expressing STIM1-mCherry and ESR1-CFP were treated with vehicle, thapsigargin (TG), E2, or E2 + TG and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Each culture was assigned a random number that was unknown to the researcher to reduce bias. Multiple images were collected, and each cell was visually analyzed. A cell was deemed positive for puncta if any puncta were visible. A Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× glycerol immersion objective was used for all confocal-based assays. Acceptor-photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies were performed on HEK293T cells expressing ESR1-CFP, STIM1-YFP, and STIM1-mCherry as described previously (18Sheridan J.T. Worthington E.N. Yu K. Gabriel S.E. Hartzell H.C. Tarran R. Characterization of the oligomeric structure of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel Ano1/TMEM16A.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1381-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Basal FRET was measured in cells that were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle or 10 nm E2 for 15 min. 2 μm thapsigargin was used to deplete ER-Ca2+ stores, and FRET measurements were collected. FRET images were analyzed using ImageJ. The FRET efficiency (%E) was calculated as: ((donopostbleach − donorprebleach)/donorpostbleach)*100. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was measured in HEK293T cells expressing ESR1-mOr and YFP-STIM1, YFP-STIM1570STOP, or YFP-STIM1S575A, unless stated otherwise. Prebleach images were obtained before a circular region of interest was bleached. Subsequent images were collected every 30 s until maximum recovery had occurred. STIM1 FRAP curves were calculated by measuring the average fluorescence intensity in the bleached region of interest per time point and dividing it by the average fluorescence intensity of a nonbleached region of interest within the same cell per time point. To account for variations in protein expression and photobleaching, the average intensity ratio was normalized to the initial prebleach ratio. Immunoprecipitation was performed in HEK293T cells transfected with ESR1-mOrange and YFP-STIM1 or YFP-STIM1–570STOP truncation mutant (STIM1570STOP). Cells were washed in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaMoO4, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1× complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 2× Halt phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific). Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein (600 μg) were diluted to 1.2 μg μl−1 with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer in spin columns (Pierce) and mixed with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Abcam; 1:500) and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G-agarose beads (30 μl; Pierce) were added to lysate and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and protein was eluted by boiling in sample buffer (2× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 1× reducing agent (Life Technologies)). Protein was resolved on a 4–12% gradient NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose using iBlot (Life Technologies). For Western blotting, immunoblots were blocked in 3% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (anti-mpm-2, 1:500 (Millipore); anti-GFP 1:2000 (Abcam), and incubated with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or ant-rabbit 1:10,000 (GE Healthcare)) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Pierce). All experiments were conducted on at least three separate occasions. Data were analyzed using the method stated in the figure legend. All statistical analyses were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. We have shown previously that E2 indirectly inhibits ligand-evoked Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion due to a reduction in Ca2+ signaling in human airway epithelia (16Coakley R.D. Sun H. Clunes L.A. Rasmussen J.E. Stackhouse J.R. Okada S.F. Fricks I. Young S.L. Tarran R. 17β-Estradiol inhibits Ca2+-dependent homeostasis of airway surface liquid volume in human cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 4025-4035PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this depression of cytoplasmic Ca2+ was due to an E2-mediated reduction in SOCE, we performed Ca2+ imaging experiments in polarized, Fura-2-loaded HBECs. HBECs were placed in Ca2+-free Ringer's bilaterally and treated apically with thapsigargin (2 μm) to deplete ER Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). Because E2 would physiologically reach the epithelium through the blood, we applied it basolaterally. A 15-min pretreatment with E2 (10 nm) had no effect on ER Ca2+ release (Fig. 1A). We then added 2 mm Ca2+ to the apical surface to induce SOCE. Cells that were pretreated with E2 displayed a significantly reduced change in the Fura-2 ratio emission upon Ca2+ addition relative to untreated cells, suggesting that basolateral E2 specifically inhibits apical Ca2+ entry in polarized HBECs without affecting ER Ca2+ release (Fig. 1A). Little is known regarding the molecular identity of the proteins involved in SOCE in the airway. Therefore, we next determined whether STIM1 and Orai1 were essential for SOCE in HBECs. Nonpolarized HBECs were transfected with STIM1, Orai1, or scrambled siRNA constructs or treated with vehicle (control). Quantitative PCR measurements indicated that both genes were successfully knocked down (Fig. 1B). We then performed Ca2+ imaging in these cells. Nonpolarized HBECs were placed in a Ca2+-free Ringer's solution and stimulated with thapsigargin to specifically analyze ER Ca2+ dynamics. Knockdown of STIM1 or Orai1 had no effect on ER Ca2+ release compared with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1C). However, knockdown of either STIM1 or Orai1 completely abolished SOCE, whereas scrambled siRNA was without effect (Fig. 1C). This indicated that STIM1 and Orai1 were essential for SOCE in HBECs. Although these observations were made in nonpolarized HBECs, it is reasonable to assume that STIM1 and Orai1 are necessary for SOCE in polarized HBECs. We have shown previously that GPCR-mediated IP3 formation and ER Ca2+ release are unaffected by E2 (16Coakley R.D. Sun H. Clunes L.A. Rasmussen J.E. Stackhouse J.R. Okada S.F. Fricks I. Young S.L. Tarran R. 17β-Estradiol inhibits Ca2+-dependent homeostasis of airway surface liquid volume in human cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 4025-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Because STIM1 is next in the SOCE pathway, we tested whether this protein was sensitive to E2. Under basal conditions, STIM1 was found to be diffusely located in polarized HBECs (Fig. 2A). However, after thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+ depletion, STIM1 translocated toward the apical membrane. HBECs that were basolaterally pretreated with E2 for 15 min displayed no difference in STIM1 localization compared with untreated cells. However, when ER Ca2+ was depleted in cultures pretreated with E2, STIM1 failed to translocate apically (Fig. 2A). Data from several experiments were quantified by measuring STIM1 fluorescence intensity using an actin counterstain as a marker of polarity (Fig. 2B). Analysis of these data revealed that the subapical concentration of STIM1 was significantly reduced after E2 exposure and suggested that E2 interrupted normal STIM1 function. To further study the effects of E2/ESR1 on STIM1 function, we performed additional experiments in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with ESR1-mOrange because they do not endogenously express estrogen receptors (19Thomas P. Pang Y. Filardo E.J. Dong J. Identity of an estrogen membrane receptor coupled to a G protein in human breast cancer cells.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). As seen in HBECs, E2 did not affect ER Ca2+ release, but significantly reduced Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that ESR1-transfected HEK293T cells were a valid model for studying the effects of E2/ESR1 on STIM1 function. Oligomerization of STIM1 is an essential step in the initiation of SOCE after ER Ca2+ depletion (20Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oligomerization of STIM1 couples ER calcium depletion to CRAC channel activation.Nature. 2008; 454: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether STIM1 oligomerization after ER Ca2+ depletion was inhibited by E2. To characterize the effect of E2 on STIM1 oligomerization, we performed acceptor photobleaching FRET. As a positive control, we linked YFP to mCherry with 5 glycines, which returned a FRET efficiency of ∼42% using acceptor photobleaching, which is close to the theoretical maximum of 50% that can be measured with GFP-type proteins (n = 21). Conversely, unlinked YFP and mCherry did not undergo FRET (n = 10). We then performed FRET between STIM1-YFP and STIM1-mCherry in HEK293T cells. Note: these cells were also expressing ESR1-CFP. However, this construct was only used to verify ESR1 localization and was not excited during acceptor photobleaching. In agreement with previous studies (20Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7391-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we found that STIM1-STIM1 FRET significantly increased after thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+ depletion, suggesting that STIM1 had oligomerized (Fig. 3, C and D). A 15-min pretreatment with E2 alone did not affect STIM1-STIM1 FRET. However, when cells were pretreated with E2 and then stimulated with thapsigargin, no significant increase in FRET was observed (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggest that acute exposure to E2 inhibits STIM1 oligomerization. Following oligomerization, STIM1 redistributes to the ER-plasma membrane junction where it interacts with Orai1 and can been seen as puncta (20Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Essential role for the CRAC activation domain in store-dependent oligomerization of STIM1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To determine whether E2 affects STIM1 puncta formation, we transfected HEK293T cells with STIM1-mCherry and ESR1-CFP and collected images before and after ER Ca2+ depletion in the presence/absence of E2 (Fig. 4A). We did not observe STIM1 puncta under basal conditions, whereas after ER Ca2+ depletion, STIM1 formed puncta in ∼90% of the cells (Fig. 4, A and B). E2 alone did not induce STIM1 puncta formation. However, in the presence of E2, STIM1 puncta formation was significantly decreased after ER Ca2+ depletion, suggesting that its ability to oligomerize had been impaired (Fig. 4, A and B). We next performed FRET studies between STIM1 and Orai1. Under control conditions, STIM1-Orai1 FRET significantly increased after ER Ca2+ depletion as described previously (23Navarro-Borelly L. Somasundaram A. Yamashita M. Ren D. Miller R.J. Prakriya M. STIM1-Orai1 interactions and Orai1 conformational changes revealed by live-cell FRET microscopy.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 5383-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This indicated that STIM1 and Orai1 were in close proximity. However, this increase in FRET was abolished by a 15-min E2 pretreatment, suggesting that E2 prevented STIM1 from interacting with Orai1 (Fig. 4, C and D). Because STIM1 oligomerization precedes the STIM1-Orai1 interaction, it is likely that loss of STIM1-Orai1 FRET in cells pretreated with E2 is a result of inhibiting STIM1 oligomerization. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that E2/ESR1 also independently affect Orai1. Because E2 impaired the ability of STIM1 to oligomerize and interact with Orai1 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), we characterized the effects of E2 on STIM1 mobility. Previous studies have utilized FRAP to demonstrate that STIM1 is highly mobile under basal conditions (20Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, upon ER Ca2+ depletion, STIM1 mobility significantly decreased (20Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Live-cell imaging reveals sequential oligomerization and local plasma membrane targeting of stromal interaction molecule 1 after Ca2+ store depletion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). FRAP experiments were performed on HEK293T cells co-expressing YFP-STIM1 and ESR1-CFP (Fig. 5A). Under basal conditions, we observed an ∼80% recovery of STIM1 into the bleached area (Fig. 5, B and C). However, when ER Ca2+ was depleted with thapsigargin, the recovery of STIM1 decreased significantly by ∼50% postbleaching, indicating that STIM1 became less mobile (Fig. 5, B and C), in agreement with previous reports (20Liou J.

https://openalex.org/W2098260634,"Hyperekplexia is a syndrome of readily provoked startle responses, alongside episodic and generalized hypertonia, that presents within the first month of life. Inhibitory glycine receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels with a definitive and clinically well stratified linkage to hyperekplexia. Most hyperekplexia cases are caused by mutations in the α1 subunit of the human glycine receptor (hGlyR) gene (GLRA1). Here we analyzed 68 new unrelated hyperekplexia probands for GLRA1 mutations and identified 19 mutations, of which 9 were novel. Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that the dominant mutations p.Q226E, p.V280M, and p.R414H induced spontaneous channel activity, indicating that this is a recurring mechanism in hGlyR pathophysiology. p.Q226E, at the top of TM1, most likely induced tonic activation via an enhanced electrostatic attraction to p.R271 at the top of TM2, suggesting a structural mechanism for channel activation. Receptors incorporating p.P230S (which is heterozygous with p.R65W) desensitized much faster than wild type receptors and represent a new TM1 site capable of modulating desensitization. The recessive mutations p.R72C, p.R218W, p.L291P, p.D388A, and p.E375X precluded cell surface expression unless co-expressed with α1 wild type subunits. The recessive p.E375X mutation resulted in subunit truncation upstream of the TM4 domain. Surprisingly, on the basis of three independent assays, we were able to infer that p.E375X truncated subunits are incorporated into functional hGlyRs together with unmutated α1 or α1 plus β subunits. These aberrant receptors exhibit significantly reduced glycine sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first suggestion that subunits lacking TM4 domains might be incorporated into functional pentameric ligand-gated ion channel receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2035494443,"The survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on mycolic acids, very long α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids comprising 60-90 carbon atoms. However, despite considerable efforts, little is known about how enzymes involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis recognize and bind their hydrophobic fatty acyl substrates. The condensing enzyme KasA is pivotal for the synthesis of very long (C38-42) fatty acids, the precursors of mycolic acids. To probe the mechanism of substrate and inhibitor recognition by KasA, we determined the structure of this protein in complex with a mycobacterial phospholipid and with several thiolactomycin derivatives that were designed as substrate analogs. Our structures provide consecutive snapshots along the reaction coordinate for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction and support an induced fit mechanism in which a wide cavity is established through the concerted opening of three gatekeeping residues and several α-helices. The stepwise characterization of the binding process provides mechanistic insights into the induced fit recognition in this system and serves as an excellent foundation for the development of high affinity KasA inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2015456200,"Advances in phosphoproteomics have made it possible to monitor changes in protein phosphorylation that occur at different steps in signal transduction and have aided the identification of new pathway components. In the present study, we applied this technology to advance our understanding of the responses of melanoma cells to signaling initiated by the secreted ligand WNT3A. We started by comparing the phosphopeptide patterns of cells treated with WNT3A for different periods of time. Next, we integrated these data sets with the results from a siRNA screen that targeted protein kinases. This integration of siRNA screening and proteomics enabled us to identify four kinases that exhibit altered phosphorylation in response to WNT3A and that regulate a luciferase reporter of β-catenin-responsive transcription (β-catenin-activated reporter). We focused on one of these kinases, an atypical PKC kinase, protein kinase N1 (PKN1). Reducing the levels of PKN1 with siRNAs significantly enhances activation of β-catenin-activated reporter and increases apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. Using affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry, we then found that PKN1 is present in a protein complex with a WNT3A receptor, Frizzled 7, as well as with proteins that co-purify with Frizzled 7. These data establish that the protein kinase PKN1 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and sensitizes melanoma cells to cell death stimulated by WNT3A."
https://openalex.org/W1967616726,"Ligand binding to extracellular domains of G protein-coupled receptors can result in novel and nuanced allosteric effects on receptor signaling. We previously showed that the protein-protein interaction of carboxypeptidase M (CPM) and kinin B1 receptor (B1R) enhances B1R signaling in two ways; 1) kinin binding to CPM causes a conformational activation of the B1R, and 2) CPM-generated des-Arg-kinin agonist is efficiently delivered to the B1R. Here, we show CPM is also a positive allosteric modulator of B1R signaling to its agonist, des-Arg(10)-kallidin (DAKD). In HEK cells stably transfected with B1R, co-expression of CPM enhanced DAKD-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca(2+) or phosphoinositide turnover by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without changing the maximum. CPM increased B1R affinity for DAKD by ∼5-fold but had no effect on basal B1R-dependent phosphoinositide turnover. Soluble, recombinant CPM bound to HEK cells expressing B1Rs without stimulating receptor signaling. CPM positive allosteric action was independent of enzyme activity but depended on interaction of its C-terminal domain with the B1R extracellular loop 2. Disruption of the CPM/B1R interaction or knockdown of CPM in cytokine-treated primary human endothelial cells inhibited the allosteric enhancement of CPM on B1R DAKD binding or ERK1/2 activation. CPM also enhanced the DAKD-induced B1R conformational change as detected by increased intramolecular fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Thus, CPM binding to extracellular loop 2 of the B1R results in positive allosteric modulation of B1R signaling, and disruption of this interaction could provide a novel therapeutic approach to reduce pathological B1R signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1977204598,"Many agonists, acting through G-protein-coupled receptors and Gα subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, induce contraction of smooth muscle through an increase of [Ca(2+)]i as well as activation of the RhoA/RhoA-activated kinase pathway that amplifies the contractile force, a phenomenon known as Ca(2+) sensitization. Gα12/13 subunits are known to activate the regulator of G-protein signaling-like family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), which includes PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG) and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). However, their contributions to Ca(2+)-sensitized force are not well understood. Using permeabilized blood vessels from PRG(-/-) mice and a new method to silence LARG in organ-cultured blood vessels, we show that both RhoGEFs are activated by the physiologically and pathophysiologically important thromboxane A2 and endothelin-1 receptors. The co-activation is the result of direct and independent activation of both RhoGEFs as well as their co-recruitment due to heterodimerization. The isolated recombinant C-terminal domain of PRG, which is responsible for heterodimerization with LARG, strongly inhibited Ca(2+)-sensitized force. We used photolysis of caged phenylephrine, caged guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) in solution, and caged GTPγS or caged GTP loaded on the RhoA·RhoGDI complex to show that the recruitment and activation of RhoGEFs is the cause of a significant time lag between the initial Ca(2+) transient and phasic force components and the onset of Ca(2+)-sensitized force."

In the substrate-free structure, the proximal and distal helices, which tightly bracket the substrate heme in the substrate-bound heme complex, move apart, and the proximal helix is partially unwound. These features are supported by the molecular dynamic simulations. The structure implies that the heme binding fixes the enzyme active site structure, including the water hydrogen bond network critical for heme degradation. The biliverdin groups assume the helical conformation and are located in the heme pocket in the crystal structures of the Fe(3+)-biliverdin-bound and the biliverdin-bound HmuO, prepared by in situ heme oxygenase reaction from the heme complex crystals. The proximal His serves as the Fe(3+)-biliverdin axial ligand in the former complex and forms a hydrogen bond through a bridging water molecule with the biliverdin pyrrole nitrogen atoms in the latter complex. In both structures, salt bridges between one of the biliverdin propionate groups and the Arg and Lys residues further stabilize biliverdin at the HmuO heme pocket. Additionally, the crystal structure of a mixture of two intermediates between the Fe(3+)-biliverdin and biliverdin complexes has been determined at 1.70 Å resolution, implying a possible route for iron exit."

Here we evaluate the role of GITR-L, whose expression is restricted to APCs, in the development of enterocolitis. On injecting naive CD4(+) T cells, GITR-L(-/-)Rag(-/-) mice develop a markedly milder colitis than Rag(-/-) mice, which correlates with a 50% reduction of Ly6C(+)CD11b(+)MHCII(+) macrophages in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. The same result was observed in αCD40-induced acute colitis and during peritonitis, suggesting an altered monocyte migration. In line with these observations, the number of nondifferentiated monocytes was approximately 3-fold higher in the spleen of GITR-L(-/-)Rag(-/-) mice than in Rag(-/-) mice after αCD40 induction. Consistent with the dynamic change in the formation of an active angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) dimer in GITR-L(-/-) splenic monocytes during intestinal inflammation, the migratory capability of splenic monocytes from GITR-L-deficient mice was impaired in an in vitro transwell migration assay. Conversely, αGITR-L reduces the number of splenic Ly6C(hi) monocytes, concomitantly with an increase in AT1 dimers. We conclude that GITR-L regulates the number of proinflammatory macrophages in sites of inflammation by controlling the egress of monocytes from the splenic reservoir."

https://openalex.org/W2059783078,"Genomic instability and a predisposition to cancer are hallmarks of Bloom syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease arising from mutations in the BLM gene. BLM is a RecQ helicase component of the BLM-Topo III α-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex, which maintains chromosome stability at the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Other members of the BTR complex include Topo IIIa, RMI1, and RMI2. All members of the BTR complex are essential for maintaining the stable genome. Interestingly, the BTR complex is posttranslationally modified upon SAC activation during mitosis, but its significance remains unknown. In this study, we show that two proteins that interact with BLM, RMI1 and RMI2, are phosphorylated upon SAC activation, and, like BLM, RMI1, and RMI2, are phosphorylated in an MPS1-dependent manner. An S112A mutant of RMI2 localized normally in cells and was found in SAC-induced coimmunoprecipitations of the BTR complex. However, in RMI2-depleted cells, an S112A mutant disrupted the mitotic arrest upon SAC activation. The failure of cells to maintain mitotic arrest, due to lack of phosphorylation at Ser-112, results in high genomic instability characterized by micronuclei, multiple nuclei, and a wide distribution of aberrantly segregating chromosomes. We found that the S112A mutant of RMI2 showed defects in redistribution between the nucleoplasm and nuclear matrix. The phosphorylation at Ser-112 of RMI2 is independent of BLM and is not required for the stability of the BTR complex, BLM focus formation, and chromatin targeting in response to replication stress. Overall, this study suggests that the phosphorylation of the BTR complex is essential to maintain a stable genome."

We have analyzed the functional impact of the E1015K amino acid substitution located in the ""synprint"" domain of the α1A subunit. This variant was identified in two families with hemiplegic migraine and in one patient with migraine with aura. The wild type (WT) and the E1015K forms of the GFP-tagged α1A subunit were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons and HEK cells to understand the role of the variant in the transport activity and physiology of CaV2.1. The E1015K variant does not alter CaV2.1 protein expression, and its transport to the cell surface and synaptic terminals is similar to that observed for WT channels. Electrophysiological data demonstrated that E1015K channels have increased current density and significantly altered inactivation properties compared with WT. Furthermore, the SNARE proteins syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 were unable to modulate voltage-dependent inactivation of E1015K channels.
