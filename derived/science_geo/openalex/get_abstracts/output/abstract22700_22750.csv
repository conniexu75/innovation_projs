https://openalex.org/W1987107175,"Multipotent neural cell lines were generated via retrovirus-mediated v-myc transfer into murine cerebellar progenitor cells. When transplanted back into the cerebellum of newborn mice, these cells integrated into the cerebellum in a nontumorigenic, cytoarchitecturally appropriate manner. Cells from the same clonal line differentiated into neurons or glia in a manner appropriate to their site of engraftment. Engrafted cells, identified by lacZ expression and PCR-mediated detection of a unique sequence arrangement, could be identified in animals up to 22 months postengraftment. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that some engrafted cells were similar to host neurons and glia. Some transplant-derived neurons received appropriate synapses and formed normal intercellular contacts. These data indicate that generating immortalized cell lines for repair of, or transport of genes into, the CNS may be feasible. Such lines may also provide a model for commitment and differentiation of cerebellar progenitor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1568436538,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a potent human motility-stimulating protein that has been identified in the conditioned medium from A2058 melanoma cells. This protein has been purified to homogeneity utilizing a strategy involving five column steps. Homogeneity of ATX was verified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The molecular size of ATX is 125 kDa, and it has an isoelectric point of 7.7 +/- 0.2. Purified ATX was digested with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, and the resulting ATX peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Eleven peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis, and 114 residues were identified. The partial amino acid sequences and the amino acid composition obtained for ATX show that it does not exhibit any significant homology to known growth factors or previously described motility factors. At picomolar concentrations, ATX stimulates both random and directed migration of human A2058 melanoma cells. Pretreatment of the melanoma cells with pertussis toxin abolishes the response to purified ATX, indicating that ATX stimulates motility through a receptor acting via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1583256888,"We have found that a fungal strain, Talaromyces wortmannin KY12420, produces a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This active product, designated as MS-54, was isolated and purified from the culture broth of the fungus and identified as wortmannin. The inhibition of MLCK by wortmannin was prevented by a high concentration of ATP. The activity of the catalytic domain, which was disclosed by partial tryptic digestion, was also inhibited by wortmannin. These results suggest that wortmannin acts at or near to the catalytic site of the enzyme. It was shown clearly by kinetic analyses, preincubation studies, and dialysis experiments that the inhibitory action of wortmannin on MLCK was irreversible. Under the condition of preincubation for 3 min, 0.3 microM wortmannin inhibited the activity of MLCK, while 10 microM wortmannin had no effect on the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and had little effect on protein kinase C activity. These data expressed clearly the marked selectivity of the compound for MLCK. Furthermore, wortmannin also inhibited both the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and the contraction in rat thoracic aorta stimulated with KCl, which indicates the effectiveness of the compound in the cellular level as an MLCK inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W2121156875,"We have isolated from seeds of Mirabilis jalapa L. two antimicrobial peptides, designated Mj-AMP1 and Mj-AMP2, respectively. These peptides are highly basic and consist of 37 and 36 residues for Mj-AMP1 and Mj-AMP2, respectively. Both peptides contain three disulfide bridges and differ from one another only by 4 amino acids. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the reduced and unreduced peptides suggests that the peptides associate into dimers in their native form. The Mj-AMPs exhibit a broad spectrum of antifungal activity since they are active against all 13 tested plant pathogenic fungi. Concentrations required for 50% inhibition of fungal growth vary from 6 to 300 micrograms/ml for Mj-AMP1 and from 0.5 to 20 micrograms/ml for Mj-AMP2. These peptides were also active on two tested Gram-positive bacteria but were apparently nontoxic for Gram-negative bacteria and cultured human cells. Although the Mj-AMPs show sequence similarity to mu-agatoxins, a class of insecticidal neurotoxic peptides isolated from the venom of spiders, they do not affect pulse transmission in insect nerves."
https://openalex.org/W2170861064,"The chromosomes of eukaryotes are characterized by the mosaic nature of their replication â€” large regions of DNA that replicate early in S phase are interspersed with regions that replicate late. This pattern of early and late synthesis appears to be the consequence of a temporal program that activates replication origins at different times. The basis of this temporal regulation in the yeast S. cerevisiae has been investigated by changing the chromosomal locations of two origins, one activated early in the S phase (ARS1) and one activated late (ARS501). We show that the cis-acting information controlling time of activation can be separated from the element that determines origin function. For the ARS501 origin, late activation appears to be a consequence of its proximity to the telomere."

https://openalex.org/W1544101325,"Protein L is an immunoglobulin light chain-binding protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus. The major variable region subgroups of human kappa and lambda light chains were tested for protein L binding; V kappa I, V kappa III, and V kappa IV bound protein L, whereas no binding occurred with proteins of the V kappa II subgroup or with any lambda light chain subgroups. Studies of the protein L binding capacity of naturally occurring VL fragments, and VL- and CL-related trypsin- and pepsin-derived peptides prepared from a kappa I light chain, localized the site of interaction to the VL domain. The affinity constant for the binding to an isolated V kappa I fragment was comparable to that for the native protein (Ka 0.9 x 10(9) M-1 and Ka 1.5 x 10(9) M-1, respectively). No binding occurred with CL-related fragments. Extensive reduction and alkylation of the V kappa fragment or the native kappa chain resulted in complete loss of protein L binding. Although it is possible, from comparative amino acid sequence data, to identify certain VL-framework region residues that account for the selective binding of protein L by kappa I, kappa III, and kappa IV proteins, our studies indicate that this interaction is essentially dependent upon the tertiary structural integrity of the kappa chain VL domain."
https://openalex.org/W1503310668,"We have partially purified a protein kinase that phosphorylates muscarinic receptors (mAChR) in the presence of agonists and have shown that the phosphorylation is stimulated by the beta gamma subunits of the GTP binding protein Go (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1990) FEBS Lett. 268, 43-47). We report here that rhodopsin is also phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner by the same kinase preparation and that beta gamma subunits derived from Gs, Gi, and Go stimulate the phosphorylation of both rhodopsin and mAChRs. The rhodopsin- and mAChR-phosphorylating activities were eluted in the same fractions using a purification procedure that is essentially the same as that used for the purification of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (Benovic, J.L., Strasser, R.H., Caron, M.G., and Lefkowitz, R.J. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 2797-2801) and were inhibited by low concentrations of heparin, an inhibitor of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, (IC50 = 15 nM), suggesting that both mAChR and rhodopsin are phosphorylated by the same or very similar kinase(s) belonging to the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase family. G protein beta gamma subunits increased the Vmax of the phosphorylation of rhodopsin 12-fold. Kinetic data were consistent with the assumptions that the protein kinase (mAChR kinase) binds rhodopsin and beta gamma subunits in a random order and that the reaction rate is proportional to concentration of the ternary complex. By contrast, the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin by the rhodopsin kinase was not stimulated by the beta gamma subunits. These results indicate that beta gamma subunits may interact with and activate the mAChR kinase but not rhodopsin kinase and suggest that the beta gamma subunit of G proteins may take part in the desensitization of G protein-linked receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1667210186,"Abstract The three-dimensional structure of recombinant human lymphotoxin (residues 24-171 of the mature protein) has been determined by x-ray crystallography at 1.9-A resolution (Rcryst = 0.215 for I greater than 3 sigma (I)). Phases were derived by molecular replacement using tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) as a search model. Like TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin (LT) folds to form a jellyroll beta-sheet sandwich. Three-fold related LT subunits form a trimer stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions. A cluster of 6 basic residues around the 3-fold axis may account for the acid lability of the trimer. Although the structural cores of TNF-alpha and LT are similar, insertions and deletions relative to TNF-alpha occur in loops at the top of the LT trimer and significantly alter the local structure and the overall shape trimer is highly conserved. The sites of two mutations (Asp-50 and Tyr-108) that abolish the cytotoxicity of LT are contained within poorly ordered loops of polypeptide chain that flank the cleft between neighboring subunits at the base of the molecule, suggesting that the receptor recognizes an intersubunit binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2088956217,"DNA recognition sequences for dimeric proteins typically contain two types of information. The first is the DNA sequence of each half-site, and the second is the arrangement of these half-sites. We show that dimers of the yeast homeodomain protein alpha 2, although able to read the first type of information, lack the ability to assess the second type. Rather, alpha 2 dimers bind with equal affinity to artificial operators in which the two half-sites are arrayed as inverted repeats, as direct repeats, or as everted (inside-out) repeats. We show that a second protein-MCM1-sets the exact spacing and orientation of the homeodomains in the alpha 2 dimer so that they accommodate only the geometry of the naturally occurring operators. These experiments show directly how the target specificity of a homeodomain protein is raised by an auxiliary protein, allowing it to distinguish the biologically correct operators from closely related sequences in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2023770662,"The avidity of integrin CR3 (also known as alpha M beta 2, Mac-1, Mo-1, and CD11b/CD18) may be reversibly altered without changes in the number of cell surface receptors. Here we describe a molecule termed integrin modulating factor (IMF-1), which controls CR3 avidity. Addition of IMF-1 to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) or to purified CR3 causes enhanced binding of ligand. IMF-1 is not present in resting PMNs, but stimulation of cells results in a transient rise in IMF-1 content that parallels a transient rise in CR3 activity. We suggest that PMNs control adhesivity by controlling synthesis of IMF-1, which then acts as an allosteric activator of leukocyte integrins. IMF-1 is an acidic, amphiphilic molecule of Mr340 +/- 16 that does not contain ester, phosphate, amide, sialic acid, or glycosidic or vicinal hydroxyl functionalities, but does contain a carbon-carbon double bond. These results suggest that IMF-1 is an unsaturated fatty acid or an isoprenoid acid."

https://openalex.org/W2083591449,"We generated by gene disruption Dictyostelium cells that lacked both the F-actin cross-linking proteins, alpha-actinin and gelation factor. Several major cell functions, such as growth, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and pinocytosis, were apparently unaltered. However, in all double mutants, development was greatly impaired. After formation of aggregates, cells were very rarely able to form fruiting bodies. This ability was rescued when mutant and wild-type strains were mixed in a ratio of 70 to 30. The developmental program in the mutant was not arrested, since the expression pattern of early and late genes remained unchanged. Development of the mutant was rendered normal when a functional alpha-actinin gene was introduced and expressed, showing the morphogenetic defect to be due to the absence of the two F-actin cross-linking proteins. These findings suggest the existence of a functional network allowing mutual complementation of certain actin-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1615671655,"Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is a homodimeric glycoprotein that humorally regulates the proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytic cells and locally regulates cells of the female reproductive tract. Alternative splicing of the human CSF-1 mRNA leads to alternative expression of the CSF-1 homodimer as a secreted glycoprotein or as a membrane-spanning molecule with cell surface biological activity. In the present study, analysis of immunoaffinity-purified CSF-1 from mouse L929 cell medium by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that CSF-1 is predominantly secreted as highly sulfated species of 375- and 250-kDa with a smaller amount of a 100-kDa species. Analysis by gel filtration in 4 M guanidine HCI buffer, indicated that, in contrast to the 100-kDa species, the highly sulfated species exhibit anomalously high molecular weights and self-association on SDS-PAGE similar to the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, biglycan. The three predominant CSF-1 species were shown to be an 80-kDa homodimer, an 80-kDa/50-kDa heterodimer, and a 50-kDa homodimer. The 80-kDa subunit contained a single 18-kDa chondroitin sulfate chain that was absent from the 50-kDa subunit. Furthermore, treatment of the 80- and 50-kDa subunits, synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin, with chondroitinase ABC, neuraminidase, and endo-alpha-N-acetyl galactosaminidase reduced their apparent molecular masses to 60 and 25 kDa, respectively. These results are consistent with intracellular proteolytic cleavage of the 80-kDa chondroitin sulfate containing subunits from the membrane spanning CSF-1 precursor at a point carboxyl-terminal to the single consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan addition and cleavage of the 50-kDa glycoprotein subunit at a position aminoterminal to this site. The predominance of the proteoglycan form of secreted CSF-1, which represents only 3-4% of the total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts released from 35SO4(2-)-labeled L cells, has important implications for regulation by this growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1499461187,"We report purification of an 18-kDa heparin-binding growth factor secreted from human cancer cells which is homologous to a developmentally regulated, neurotrophic factor, heparin-binding growth-associated molecule/pleiotrophin (HB-GAM/PTN; Merenmies, J., and Rauvala, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16721-16724; Li, Y. S., Milner, P. G., Chauhan, A. K., Watson, M. A., Hoffman, R. M., Kodner, C. M., Milbrandt, J., and Deuel, T. F. (1990) Science 250, 1690-1694). We have purified the protein from tissue culture supernatants of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) and have used soft agar cloning of an epithelial cell line (SW-13) to detect its growth stimulating activity. A 32,000-fold purification was achieved by isoelectric focusing, heparin affinity chromatography, and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular mass of the protein was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of detergent and bioassay of the fractions. The N-terminal sequence was homologous to HB-GAM/PTN, and polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing confirmed that the respective transcript was present in the cancer cells. We conclude that HB-GAM/PTN can function as a tumor growth factor in addition to its role during neuronal development."

https://openalex.org/W1596298107,"The A-Kinase Anchor Protein AKAP 75 (formerly designated bovine brain P75) is a particulate brain protein that avidly binds the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (Bregman, D. B., Hirsch, A.H. and Rubin, C.S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7207-7213). The formation of stable AKAP 75.RII beta complexes provides a potential mechanism for targeting physiological signals carried by cAMP to specific effector sites within neurons and other brain cells. We have now cloned and characterized the AKAP 75 gene. Its coding sequence is novel and unexpectedly short (1284 base pairs) and contains no introns. When the AKAP 75 gene was transfected into HEK 293 cells, a new RII beta-binding protein with an apparent Mr of 75,000 accumulated. A high proportion (approximately 65%) of the AKAP 75 gene product was excluded from the cytoplasm and was recovered in the 40,000 x g pellet derived from disrupted transfected cells. In contrast, cells transfected with a construct encoding 249 amino acids from the central and C-terminal regions of AKAP 75 produced an RII beta-binding protein (apparent Mr = 45,000) that was exclusively cytosolic. AKAP 75 is a novel protein composed of only 428 amino acid residues (Mr = 47,878). A highly acidic C-terminal region mediates the binding of RII beta (and cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta), whereas a positively charged N-terminal segment contains structural features that are essential for the association of AKAP 75 with the cytoskeleton and/or intracellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1508695353,"The rat alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase gene produces three different sized mRNAs (4.7, 4.3, and 3.6 kilobases (kb)) which exhibit striking tissue-specific expression. Recently, we characterized the cDNA and genomic organization of the 4.3-kb mRNA which is unique to rat liver. In this report cDNAs of the 4.7-kb mRNA found in most tissues and the 3.6-kb mRNA(s) unique to kidney have been cloned and characterized as well as the corresponding genomic sequences which differed from those of the previously characterized 4.3-kb mRNA. The 4.7-kb mRNA was found to be identical to the 4.3-kb mRNA with the exception of two additional exons at the 5'-untranslated end of the transcript. The constitutively expressed 4.7-kb mRNA therefore codes for the same sialyltransferase as the liver-restricted 4.3-kb mRNA. The additional 5'-exons of the 4.7-kb mRNA are located at least 15-40 kb upstream of the promoter responsible for the production of the 4.3-kb liver message. The 3.6-kb mRNA of rat kidney was found to be comprised of three transcripts of similar size. They were only expressed in kidney and were found to be generated from the alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase gene by alternative splicing and alternative promoter utilization. The results reveal the complexity of the alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase gene which produces at least five transcripts via alternative splicing in a tissue-specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1585074435,"We characterized the membrane-associated form of lymphotoxin (surface LT) on the activated II-23.D7 T cell hybridoma. Antibodies to rLT precipitated both surface LT and a distinct 33-kDa glycoprotein (p33). Because p33 and surface LT were antigenically unrelated, their coprecipitation suggested a physical association of p33 and surface LT on the membrane. Pulse-chase analysis indicated that LT and p33 associate with each other early in the LT biosynthetic pathway, precluding the possibility that LT is secreted and bound to p33 or a surface receptor. Furthermore, no p33 was associated with the secreted form of LT. Isoelectric focusing of surface LT and p33 under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions confirmed that surface LT and p33 existed as a complex. Treatment of cells with a high concentration of salt or with acid indicated that surface LT is a peripheral membrane protein. Although secreted LT is a homologous trimer, protein cross-linking studies revealed that surface LT existed as a monomer associated with a dimer of p33. Together the results demonstrate a novel mechanism for stable membrane expression of LT by activated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521896571,"Calreticulin (CR) is a calcium binding protein that resides in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum and is reactive with human Ro/SS-A autoimmune sera. We have used human CR cDNA to isolate a human 6-kilobase genomic clone that contains 529 base pairs upstream of the presumed transcription start site, 9 exons, 8 introns, and several hundred base pairs 3' of a polyadenylation sequence. Analysis of the human CR promoter region reveals a number of potential regulatory sites also found in the human GRP78, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase promoters, including multiple Sp1 and CCAAT consensus sequences, an AP-2 recognition sequence (absent in protein disulfide isomerase), and multiple GC-rich areas. DNA footprint and gel shift analysis on the CR 5'-flanking region demonstrates an area that is bound by protein found in human but not murine nuclear extracts. This sequence is homologous with previously determined regulatory sequences of the human GRP78 and GRP94 promoters. These data indicate that CR, GRP78, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase may in part have similar transcriptional regulation and suggest that their gene products while structurally distinct may have similar functions or co-functions. These observations are of additional interest as all four of these genes encode acidic proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1597895492,"Abstract The process of phosphate dissociation during the muscle cross-bridge cycle has been investigated by photoliberation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) within skinned fibers of rabbit psoas muscle. This permitted a test of the idea that Ca2+ controls muscle contraction by regulating the Pi release step of the cycle. Photoliberation of Pi from structurally distinct Pi precursors initiated a rapid tension decline of up to 12% of active tension, and this was followed by a slower tension decline. The apparent rate constant of the fast phase, kPi, depended on both [Pi] and [Ca2+], whereas the slow phase generally occurred at 2-4 s-1. At maximal Ca2+, kPi increased in a nonlinear manner from 43 +/- 2 s-1 to 118 +/- 7 s-1, as Pi was raised from 0.9 to 12 mM. This was analyzed in terms of a three-state kinetic model in which a force-generating transition is coupled to Pi dissociation from the cross-bridge. As Ca(2+)-activated tension was reduced from maximal (Pmax) to 0.1 Pmax, (i) kPi decreased by up to 2.5-fold, (ii) the relative amplitude of the rapid phase increased 2-fold, and (iii) the relative amplitude of the slow phase increased about 6-fold. Changes in the rapid phase are compatible with Ca2+ influencing an apparent equilibrium constant for the force-generating transition. By comparison, kPi was faster than the rate constant of tension redevelopment, ktr, and was influenced less by Ca2+. Ca2+ effects on the caged Pi transient cannot account for the large effects of Ca2+ on actomyosin ATPase rates or cross-bridge cycling kinetics but may be a manifestation of reciprocal interactions between the thin filament and force-generating cross-bridges, and may represent Ca2+ regulation of the distribution of cross-bridges between non-force-and force-generating states."
https://openalex.org/W1518535443,"We have investigated the import pathway of the nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein ferredoxin. By using purified precursor protein and washed intact chloroplasts in a defined in vitro uptake system, we show that preferredoxin is fully import-competent by itself. In addition, we show also that the in vitro, in a wheat germ lysate, synthesized preferredoxin is not stably associated with another protein. Import is dependent only on ATP and does not require the presence of cytosolic proteins. Translocation could be largely stimulated by the thiol reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). To determine whether DTT acts on the precursor or on the chloroplast, we modified the 5 cysteines in the precursor by a reaction with iodoacetamide, thereby preventing the formation of disulfide bridges in the precursor. The import of this modified precursor was still stimulated by the addition of DTT, indicating that DTT had a stimulating effect on the chloroplast import machinery. In the case of the modified precursor, the import must have taken place without iron-sulfur cluster attachment in the stroma. The modified precursor could be imported with a similar efficiency as the parent precursor showing that import takes place independently from cofactor assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1606204471,"Interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulate the proliferation of several kinds of cultured hematopoietic cell lines. Growth signals from IL-3 and GM-CSF cause accumulation of active Ras.GTP complexes in PT18 mouse mast cell line (Satoh, T., Nakafuku, M., Miyajima, A., and Kaziro, Y. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 3314-3318). In this paper we describe the effect of herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, on the activation of Ras. The increase of Ras.GTP induced by IL-3 and GM-CSF diminished in cells treated with 0.5 approximately 1 micrograms/ml of herbimycin A for 24 h prior to the addition of the growth factors. Under this condition, the extent of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of proteins decreased. However, the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C did not change. Growth of cells in the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF was also completely inhibited. These observations suggest that tyrosine kinases are involved in the pathways between IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors and Ras and that they are essential for the growth stimulated by these growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1508214061,"Vertebrate smooth muscle myosin heavy chains (MHCs) exist as two isoforms with molecular masses of 204 and 200 kDa (MHC204 and MHC200) that are generated from a single gene by alternative splicing of mRNA (Nagai, R., Kuro-o, M., Babij, P., and Periasamy, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9734-9737). A dimer of two MHCs associated with two pairs of myosin light chains forms a functional myosin molecule. To investigate the isoform composition of the MHCs in native myosin, antibodies specific for MHC204 were generated and used to immunoprecipitate purified bovine aortic smooth muscle myosin from a solution containing equal amounts of each isoform. MHC204 quantitatively removed from this mixture was completely free of MHC200. Immunoprecipitation of the supernatant with an antiserum that recognizes both isoforms equally well revealed that only MHC200 remained. We conclude that only homodimers of MHC204 and MHC200 exist under these conditions. A method is described for the purification of enzymatically active MHC204 and myosin on a protein G-agarose high performance liquid chromatography column containing immobilized MHC204 antibodies. We show, using an in vitro motility assay, that the movement of actin filaments by myosin containing 204-kDa heavy chains (0.435 +/- 0.115 microns/s) was not significantly different from that of myosin containing 200-kDa heavy chains (0.361 +/- 0.078 microns/s) or from myosin containing equal amounts of each heavy chain isoform (0.347 +/- 0.082 microns/s)."
https://openalex.org/W1514300815,"A unique form of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), TGF-beta 2.3 heterodimer, has been purified from bovine bone extract. TGF-beta 2.3 migrated as a single 25-kDa band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas under reducing conditions it migrated as a 12.5 kDa band. The TGF-beta 2.3 reacted positively with anti-TGF-beta 2 and anti-TGF-beta 3 antibodies on immunoblots. Equal levels of TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 sequences were detected by N-terminal sequencing. TGF-beta 2.3 eluted as a single sharp peak by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. However, prior reduction of the protein with dithiothreitol resulted in the protein eluting in two peaks, one containing predominantly TGF-beta 3 and the other containing predominantly TGF-beta 2. TGF-beta 2.3 inhibited proliferation of mink lung epithelial cells and promoted the formation of colonies of normal rat kidney fibroblasts in culture with specific biological activity similar to those of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2. These results demonstrate that the protein is TGF-beta 2.3 heterodimer, consisting of one polypeptide chain each of TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 linked by one or more disulfide bonds. In addition, TGF-beta 1.2 heterodimer, previously found only in porcine platelets, has also been purified from bovine bone extract."
https://openalex.org/W2138859769,"We developed an improved method of linker insertion mutagenesis for introducing 2 or 16 codons into the Bordetella pertussis cyaA gene which encodes a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase. A recombinant kanamycin resistance cassette, containing oligonucleotide linkers, was cloned in plasmids which carried a truncated cyaA gene, fused at its 3' end to the 5' end of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, specifying the alpha-peptide. This construction permitted a double selection for in-frame insertions by using screening for kanamycin resistance and for lactose-positive phenotype, resulting from alpha-complementation. We showed that most of the two-amino acid insertions within the N-terminal moiety of the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase abolished enzymatic activity and/or altered the stability of the protein. All two-amino acid insertions within the C-terminal part of adenylate cyclase resulted in fully stable and active enzymes. These results confirm the modular structure of the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase, previously proposed on the basis of proteolytic studies. Two-amino acid insertions between residues 247-248 and 335-336 were shown to affect the calmodulin responsiveness of adenylate cyclase, suggesting that the corresponding region in the enzyme is involved in the binding of calmodulin or in the process of calmodulin activation. In addition, we have identified within the primary structure of adenylate cyclase several permissive sites which tolerate 16-amino acid insertions without interfering with the catalytic activity or calmodulin binding. By inserting foreign antigenic determinants into these permissive sites the resulting recombinant adenylate cyclase toxin could be used to deliver specific epitopes into antigen-presenting cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572671858,"Previous studies have shown that the glycoprotein oligosaccharides synthesized by adult Schistosoma mansoni, the organism responsible for human schistosomiasis, are unusual in that they contain terminal beta-GalNAc residues and lack sialic acid. These observations and other studies indicating that schistosome glycoproteins and glycolipids are antigenic in infected animals led us to investigate the structures of the glycosphingolipids synthesized by these organisms and to determine whether they are structurally related to those synthesized by their vertebrate hosts. For our studies, adult schistosomes were metabolically radiolabeled with either [3H]galactose or [3H]glucosamine, and the newly synthesized glycosphingolipids were isolated and characterized. The major glycosphingolipids synthesized by adult schistosomes were found to be galactosylceramide and glucosylceramide. The adult worms synthesized no lactosylceramide (Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide), a common constituent of vertebrate cells; however, another disaccharide-containing glycosphingolipid cleavable by ceramide glycanase was found. The results of compositional and methylation analyses and exoglycosidase treatments demonstrated that this ceramide-disaccharide has the structure GalNAc beta 1-4Glc-ceramide. We also found that extracts of adult schistosomes are unable to transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to glucosylceramide, whereas extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells, as a control, are able to do so, confirming that schistosomes are unable to synthesize lactosylceramide. Low levels of higher molecular weight glycosphingolipids were also found to be synthesized by adult schistosomes, and although their levels were too small to allow definitive characterization, compositional analyses indicated that they also contained GalNAc. We have tentatively designated the new disaccharide structure GalNAc beta 1, 4Glc- the schistocore, which may represent a new type of glycosphingolipid core series."
https://openalex.org/W1483267297,"Epoxycreatine (N-(2,3-epoxypropyl)-N-amidinoglycine) is an affinity label of creatine kinase that irreversibly and completely inactivates the enzyme (Marletta, M. A., and Kenyon, G. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1879-1886). To identify active site residues of rabbit muscle creatine kinase, the site of modification of it by epoxycreatine has been determined. Separation by high performance liquid chromatography of a tryptic digest of [14C]epoxycreatine-modified creatine kinase yielded two radiolabeled peptides. The larger of these consisted of amino acids Ala-266 through Arg-291 and was labeled with epoxycreatine at Cys-282. Attempts to purify completely the other labeled peptide were not successful; however, it was possible to obtain, by tandem mass spectrometry, a collision-induced dissociation spectrum of it from a mixture of several peptides. This peptide was a fragment (amino acids Val-279 through Arg-291) of the previously identified peptide and was also labeled at Cys-282. Model studies with cysteine and epoxycreatine have demonstrated that opening of the oxirane ring occurs by attack of the cysteine thiolate at the terminal carbon of the epoxide. These results are consistent with previous studies on the base lability of the label; however, a carboxyl group in the active site is not labeled, as had been previously suggested. These results provide evidence that Cys-282 is located in or near the creatine-binding site and will also be important in identifying and delineating the boundaries of the active site of creatine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1547621531,"Antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to several regions of the rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter. According to our model, this glycoprotein has 12 transmembrane alpha-helices with both amino and carboxyl termini located in the cytoplasm. The antibodies recognized the intact transporter on Western blots. Upon papain treatment, a reconstitutively active transporter can be isolated upon lectin chromatography (Kanner, B. I., Keynan, S., and Radian, R. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3722-3728). The papainized transporter runs on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass between about 58 and 68 kDa as compared to 80 kDa for the untreated transporter. The transporter fragment was recognized by all the antibodies, except for that raised against the amino terminus. Pronase cleaves the transporter to a relatively sharp 60-kDa band, which reacts with the antibodies against the internal loops but not with either the amino- or the carboxyl-terminal. This pronase-treated transporter, upon isolation by lectin chromatography, was reconstituted. It exhibits full GABA transport activity. This activity exhibits the same features as the intact system including an absolute dependence on sodium and chloride as well as electrogenicity. We conclude that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal parts of the transporter, possibly including transmembrane alpha-helices 1, 2, and 12, are not required for the transport function."
https://openalex.org/W1490336029,"The last step of heparin biosynthesis is thought to involve the action of 3-O-sulfotransferase resulting in the formation of an antithrombin III (ATIII) binding site required for heparin's anticoagulant activity. The isolation of a significant fraction of heparin chains without antithrombin III-binding sites and having low affinity for ATIII suggests the presence of a precursor site, lacking the 3-O-sulfate group. Porcine mucosal heparin was depolymerized into a mixture of oligosaccharides using heparin lyase. One of these oligosaccharides was derived from heparin's ATIII-binding site. In an effort to find the ATIII-binding site precursor, the structures of several minor oligosaccharides were determined. A greater than 90% recovery of oligosaccharides (on a mole and weight basis) was obtained for both unfractionated and affinity-fractionated heparins. An oligosaccharide arising from the ATIII-binding site precursor was found that comprised only 0.8 mol % of the oligosaccharide product mixture. This oligosaccharide was only slightly enriched in heparin having a low affinity for ATIII and only slightly disenriched in high affinity heparin. The small number of these ATIII-binding site precursors, found in unfractionated and fractionated heparins, suggests the existence of a low ATIII affinity heparin may not simply be the result of the incomplete action of 3-O-sulfotransferase in the final step in heparin biosynthesis. Rather these data suggest that some earlier step, involved in the formation of placement of these precursor sites, may be primarily responsible for high and low ATIII affinity heparins."
https://openalex.org/W1594546409,"The enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) is thought to confer specificity on the nonselective Type I adrenocorticoid receptor by converting glucocorticoids to receptor-inactive metabolites in mineralocorticoid target tissues. S1 nuclease analyses using a rat liver 11-HSD probe demonstrated tissue-specific expression of the 5' region of the 11-HSD gene in the liver, lung, and kidney not evident in previous studies. Renal tissue contained a unique protected species which mapped to a position within the coding region, consistent with a divergence in liver and kidney protein sequences. Screening of a rat kidney cDNA library resulted in the isolation of several clones (11-HSD1B) noncolinear in their 5' regions with the liver sequence (11-HSD1A). Nucleic acid sequence analysis showed that the divergent clones code for a protein lacking a 26-amino acid NH2-terminal putative membrane-spanning signal peptide. The deletion of the leader sequence from the microsomal 11-HSD1A protein may result in a nuclear localization of the 11-HSD1B isoform. The renal 11-HSD1A and 11-HSD1B species increased coordinately during ontogeny and in parallel with the developmental surge in glucocorticoids. At least three alternate sites of polyadenylation were found to be utilized by the 11-HSD gene. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of a single gene in the rat. This study shows the expression of a kidney-specific 11-HSD isoform which may protect the Type I adrenocorticoid receptor from occupation by glucocorticoids in the nucleus of a mineralocorticoid target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1571717307,"Specific binding of IciA protein to the 13-mers in the origin of a minichromosome (oriC) inhibits initiation of replication in vitro by blocking the opening of this region effected by the initiator DnaA protein (Hwang, D.S., and Kornberg, A. (1990) Cell 63, 325-331). Isolation of the iciA gene (Thony, B., Hwang, D.S., Fradkin, L., and Kornberg, A. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 4066-4070) has made possible the construction of an IciA-overproducing strain, which in turn has simplified the isolation of a large quantity of the protein, indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. Based on sedimentation and gel filtration, the IciA protein is an elongated dimer of a 33.4-kDa subunit. The specific binding of IciA protein to the 13-mers was stable for 2 h at 30 degrees C. The amounts of IciA protein, detected by immunoassays, increased 4-fold compared with levels (about 100 dimers) in log-phase cells whereas levels of DnaA protein decreased upon entry of cells into the stationary phase."
https://openalex.org/W1590769279,"To investigate the ability of a protein to accommodate potentially destabilizing amino acid substitutions, and also to investigate the steric requirements for catalysis, proline was substituted at different sites within the long alpha-helix that connects the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of T4 lysozyme. Of the four substitutions attempted, three yielded folded, functional proteins. The catalytic activities of these three mutant proteins (Q69P, D72P, and A74P) were 60-90% that of wild-type. Their melting temperatures were 7-12 degrees C less than that of wild-type at pH 6.5. Mutant D72P formed crystals isomorphous with wild-type allowing the structure to be determined at high resolution. In the crystal structure of wild-type lysozyme the interdomain alpha-helix has an overall bend angle of 8.5 degrees. In the mutant structure the introduction of the proline causes this bend angle to increase to 14 degrees and also causes a corresponding rotation of 5.5 degrees of carboxyl-terminal domain relative to the amino-terminal one. Except for the immediate location of the proline substitution there is very little change in the geometry of the interdomain alpha-helix. The results support the view that protein structures are adaptable and can compensate for potentially destabilizing amino acid substitutions. The results also suggest that the precise shape of the active site cleft of T4 lysozyme is not critical for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1491713991,"In a preliminary study we demonstrated that the formation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-ligand complex requires the participation of the highly conserved arginine 41 side chain of the growth factor peptide (Engler, D.A., Montelione, G.T., and Niyogi, S.K. (1990) FEBS Lett. 271, 47-50). In an attempt to gain further insight into the nature of this interaction(s), we used both site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification reagents to produce human EGF (hEGF) analogues with altered chemical properties of the residue 41 side chain. Eight mutant analogues of hEGF were generated, substituting arginine 41 with lysine, glutamine, isoleucine, tyrosine, glycine, alanine, aspartate, or glutamate. Although each of the mutant analogues was able to displace wild-type hEGF fully in receptor competition binding assays, affinity of the receptor for the mutants was substantially reduced, varying from 0.4 to less than 0.01% of that observed for wild-type growth factor. At sufficiently high concentrations these mutants were able to stimulate DNA synthesis in mouse keratinocytes. Substitution of lysine for arginine 41 reduced the receptor affinity 250-fold from that observed for wild type, despite retention of the positive electrostatic charge. The lysine substitution leaves a reactive amine at position 41 and made it possible, using amine-specific chemical modification reagents, to produce selected arginine homologues that were tested for their effects on receptor binding, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and stimulation of DNA synthesis in mouse keratinocytes. The reaction of lysine 41 with methyl acetimidate resulted in a lysineacetamidine product which only partially restored activity of the lysine hEGF mutant. However, reaction with O-methylisourea resulted in generation of an arginine 41 homologue (homoarginine) which restored full activity. The results indicate that the chemical properties inherent in the guanidinium group of the arginine 41 side chain of hEGF are responsible for optimal receptor-ligand association."
https://openalex.org/W1567697522,"The gene encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (denoted pheC) was cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa by functional complementation of a pheA auxotroph of Escherichia coli. The gene was highly expressed in E. coli due to the use of the high-copy number vector pUC18. The P. aeruginosa cyclohexadienyl dehydratase expressed in E. coli was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The latter enzyme exhibited identical physical and biochemical properties as those obtained for cyclohexadienyl dehydratase purified from P. aeruginosa. The activity ratios of prephenate dehydratase to arogenate dehydratase remained constant (about 3.3-fold) throughout purification, thus demonstrating a single protein having broad substrate specificity. The cyclohexadienyl dehydratase exhibited Km values of 0.42 mM for prephenate and 0.22 mM for L-arogenate, respectively. The pheC gene was 807 base pairs in length, encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 30,480 daltons. This compares with a molecular mass value of 29.5 kDa determined for the purified enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since the native molecular mass determined by gel filtration was 72 kDa, the enzyme probably is a homodimer. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of pheC from P. aeruginosa with those of the prephenate dehydratases of Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, and Pseudomonas stutzeri by standard pairwise alignments did not establish obvious homology. However, a more detailed analysis revealed a conserved motif (containing a threonine residue known to be essential for catalysis) that was shared by all of the dehydratase proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1579308575,"Attempts to change enzyme specificity by charge polarity reversal have so far met with little success, probably due to a destabilization of the resulting ion pair in an environment naturally optimized for the inverted pair. In the zinc metallopeptidase neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11), Arg102, involved in substrate binding, is probably located at the edge of the active site (Bateman, R.C., Jr., Kim, Y.-A., Slaughter, C., and Hersh, L.B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8365-8368; Beaumont, A., Le Moual, H., Boileau, G., Crine, P., and Roques, B.P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 214-220). This environment may be favorable for polarity reversal, as in water the energies of reverse ion pairs would be identical. We show here that, while mutating Arg102 to Glu reduces the specificity of a C-terminally negatively charged substrate 16-fold, it increases that of a substrate with an optimally positioned positive charge 29-fold. The concept of charge polarity reversal can be extended to other zinc metallopeptidases, and the mutated enzyme could also have applications in the enantiomeric separation of unnatural amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1578289547,"In the liver, glutamine utilization may be limited by the rate of transport across the plasma membrane by the System N carrier. System N-mediated transport activity has been solubilized from rat liver plasma membrane, partially purified, and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes. To identify the System N carrier protein, monoclonal antibodies were generated against the protein fraction enriched for System N activity. Two antibodies , 3E1-2 and 1E7-3, inhibited System N activity in hepatocytes. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated System N activity from a mixture of solubilized proteins and were specific for antigen recognition in that neither immunoprecipitated System A activity. The antibody recognized a single protein of molecular size 100 kDa by immunoblot analysis. Recognition of this protein by the antibody increased in parallel with the enrichment of System N activity in solubilized membrane fractions. These data suggest that a 100-kDa plasma membrane protein mediates System N transport activity in rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1590348891,"Adenylosuccinate synthetases from different sources contain an N-terminal glycine-rich sequence GDEGKGK, which is homologous to the conserved sequence GXXXXGK found in many other guanine nucleotide-binding proteins or enzymes. To determine the role of this sequence in the structure and function of Escherichia coli adenylosuccinate synthetase, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate five mutant enzymes: G12V (Gly12----Val), G15V (Gly15----Val), G17V (Gly17----Val), K18R (Lys18----Arg), and I19T (Ile19----Thr). Comparison of the kinetic properties of the wild-type enzyme and those of the mutant enzymes revealed that the sequence is critical for enzyme activity. Replacement of Gly12, Gly15, or Gly17 with Val, or replacement of Lys18 with Arg, resulted in significant decreases in the kcat/Km values of the enzyme. Because the consensus sequence GXXXXGK(T/S) has been found in many GTP-binding proteins, isoleucine at position 19 in the E. coli adenylosuccinate synthetase was changed to threonine to produce the sequence GDEGKGKT. This mutation, which more closely resembles the consensus sequence, resulted in a 160-fold increase in the Km value for substrate GTP; however, there were no great changes for the other two substrates, IMP and aspartate. Based on these data, we suggest that the N-terminal glycinerich sequence in E. coli adenylosuccinate synthetase plays a more important role in enzyme catalysis than in substrate binding. In addition, a hydrophobic amino acid residue such as isoleucine, leucine, or valine, rather than threonine, may play a critical role in GTP binding in adenosuccinate synthetase. These findings suggest that the glycine-rich sequence in adenylosuccinate synthetase functions differently relative to those in other GTP binding proteins or enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1535074101,"A single alpha-helical polypeptide segment of 21 amino acids near the carboxyl terminus of the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli has been shown recently to be important for the in vivo folding of the chains and assembly of the enzyme (Peterson, C. B., and Schachman, H. K. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 458-462). Calorimetric measurements on purified mutant enzymes showed that single amino acid replacements within this secondary structural element affect the overall thermal stability of the oligomeric enzyme and the energetics of the interactions between polypeptide chains within the holoenzyme. Studies presented here demonstrate that marked changes in cooperativity occur due to single amino acid substitutions. Replacement of Gln288 by either Ala or Glu leads to a striking increase in the Hill coefficient of the holoenzymes and a substantial increase in the aspartate concentration corresponding to one-half Vmax. In contrast, the isolated catalytic trimers harboring these same substitutions were similar in activity to the wild-type subunit, with the same affinity for aspartate as indicated by the values of Km. Substituting Ala for the only charged residue in the helix, Arg296, caused a marked reduction in enzyme activity, as well as a greatly reduced stability of the holoenzyme due to a substantial weakening of the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory subunits. A subunit exchange method was used to demonstrate the changes in interchain interactions resulting from the amino acid substitutions and to show the additional weakening upon the binding of the bisubstrate ligand, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, at the active sites. Taken together, the results on this series of mutant enzymes illustrate how the effects of single amino acid replacements in one element of secondary structure are propagated throughout the molecule to positions remote from the site of the substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1509862652,"Recently we reported that a P-450c27/25 cDNA probe hybridizes to two RNA species of about 1.9 and 2.3-2.4 kilobase pairs (kb) in some rat tissues. To understand the molecular relationship between the two mRNAs, we have isolated and characterized a cDNA for the larger, previously uncharacterized 2.3-kb mRNA species. The 2.3-kb cDNA is identical to the previously reported 1.9-kb P-450c27/25 cDNA excepting a 400-nucleotide-long 5' extension. The terminal 291 nucleotides of this extension exhibit 100% complementarity with the 5'-translated region of the mRNA belonging to a family of growth hormone-inducible serine protease inhibitors (SPI). Northern blot analysis, using strand-specific probes, and S1 nuclease protection revealed the presence of the 2.3-kb mRNA exhibiting the sequence characteristics of the larger cDNA. These results were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse transcribed RNA. Expression of the 2.3-kb cDNA in COS cells resulted in the correct mitochondrial targeting of a 52-kDa protein exhibiting the properties of P-450c27/25. Furthermore, both the 1.9- and 2.3-kb mRNAs appear to direct the synthesis of a similarly sized 55-kDa precursor protein in a reticulocyte lysate system. Restriction mapping, polymerase chain reaction amplification and partial sequencing of a 25-kb genomic DNA clone suggest the proximal location of the SPI and the P-450c27/25 protein coding regions in the rat genome on either side of a common overlap region. The results also show that the P-450c27/25 mRNAs are regulated by growth hormone in parallel to the SPI mRNAs. These results collectively suggest that a growth hormone-inducible SPI family mRNA and the P-450c27/25 mRNA are encoded by two closely linked, possibly overlapping genes."
https://openalex.org/W1531298766,"Basic fibroblast growth factor has 4 cysteine residues in its amino acid sequence, two of which are perfectly conserved within the fibroblast growth factor family of proteins suggesting a disulfide bond at this position. Furthermore, thiol titration of bovine pituitary basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) indicates the presence of two free thiols, which is consistent with an intramolecular disulfide. Direct analysis of natural and recombinant fibroblast growth factor proteins have not confirmed the existence of such a disulfide. Instead, the two nonconserved cysteines of bFGF purified from bovine pituitaries are S-thiolated with glutathione. Inclusion of 75 mM N-ethylmaleimide during the homogenization of the pituitaries effectively blocks the S-thiolation, demonstrating that this modification is an artifact of the purification procedure. Analysis of the N-ethylmaleimide purified bovine pituitary bFGF suggests that the natural protein is in the correct redox state when all 4 cysteines are in the reduced form."
https://openalex.org/W1486082571,"Rapid reduction of cyano-met hemoglobin (Hb+CN-) leads to the formation of an intermediate species, the cyanide derivative of ferrous hemoglobin, which dissociates to unliganded hemoglobin because of the extremely low affinity of the ligand for the ferrous heme iron. The properties of the intermediate were studied by transient spectroscopy in human hemoglobin and its isolated alpha and beta chains, in the presence and absence of CO. When mixing with dithionite, the time courses of reduction of the heme iron and dissociation of cyanide overlap considerably; addition to the reaction mixture of the redox indicator methyl viologen considerably increases the rate of reduction and allows unequivocal determination of the spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the intermediate. The results show that (i) the dissociation of cyanide from the isolated alpha and beta chains (as well as the (alpha CO)2(beta + CN-)2 hybrid) is a simple process; (ii) the two chains display similar rate parameters, but show spectroscopic inequivalence, both in the Soret and the visible regions; (iii) cooperative effects are shown to control the rate of dissociation of cyanide from hemoglobin, similarly to what happens for oxygen; and (iv) allosteric effectors (typically inositol hexaphosphate) increase the overall rate of dissociation by stabilization of the T state. We have, therefore, shown for the first time that the dissociation of cyanide from ferrous hemoglobin is controlled by the quaternary state, thereby adding one more ligand to the analysis of the structure-function relationships in hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1501741246,"The sulfhydryl-directed fluorescent reagent, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF), reacts differently with proteins from the 60 S ribosomal subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae when this subunit is free as opposed to being contained within the 80 S ribosome. When the 80 S ribosomes and the free 60 S subunits were labeled with IAF, the specific fluorescence intensity (fluorescence intensity unit/A260 60 S subunit) of the subsequently derived 60 S was 16.3 and 5.4, respectively. Gel analysis showed that proteins L7 and L26 were selectively labeled and contained greater than 90% of the total fluorescent label, when 80 S ribosomes were labeled. When free 60 S subunits were labeled, six additional proteins were labeled. Both types of modified 60 S subunits were equally capable to support protein synthesis in vitro. Reassociation of the IAF-labeled derived and free 60 S subunits with unmodified 40 S subunits resulted in a maximum of 5-7% decrease and a 3-fold increase, respectively, in the fluorescence intensity without a shift in the emission maxima. The data suggest that ribosomal proteins L7 and L26 contain SH groups that respond to ribosomal subunit association and become more reactive in the intact ribosome than in the subunit. The environments of some or all of the additionally labeled proteins are also sensitive to subunit reassociation."
https://openalex.org/W1581417213,"I am investigating the role of protein folding in the transport of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), a membrane-bound protein, along the exocytotic pathway. From a previous work (Gething, M.-J., McCammon, K., and Sambrook, J. (1986) Cell 46, 939-950), it has been shown that a subset of alterations of the COOH-terminal sequences of the HA molecule inhibit folding and impede its transport to the cell surface. Current studies establish that the integrity of the NH2-terminal sequences of the HA is essential for assembly and transport of the molecule. Mutants lacking just 1 or 2 amino acids immediately COOH-terminal to the signal cleavage site are translocated and core glycosylated, but also incorrectly folded. The mutant molecules are not terminally glycosylated and are thus confined inside the cells. A hypothesis will be presented to explain why sequences at opposite ends of the HA molecule are essential for the assembly of native structures and why correct folding is necessary for transport along the exocytotic pathway of mammalian cells."
