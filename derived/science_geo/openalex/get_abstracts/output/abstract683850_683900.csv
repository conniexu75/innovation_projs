CF-specific deletion of Hif-1a resulted in decreased HIF-1 target gene expression and increased mesenchymal progenitors in uninjured hearts and increased CF activation without proliferation following sham injury, as demonstrated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After myocardial infarction (MI), however, there was ∼50% increased CF proliferation and excessive scarring and contractile dysfunction, a scenario replicated in 3D engineered cardiac microtissues. CF proliferation was associated with higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) as occurred also in wild-type mice treated with the mitochondrial ROS generator MitoParaquat (MitoPQ). The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO rescued Hif-1a mutant phenotypes. Thus, HIF-1α in CFs provides a critical braking mechanism against excessive post-ischemic CF activation and proliferation through regulation of mitochondrial ROS. CFs are potential cellular targets for designer antioxidant therapies in cardiovascular disease.

https://openalex.org/W3213010871,"The study aims to shed new lights on the lead-lag relationships between the financial sector (RFSI) and economic growth (GDP) in the midst of global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU) shocks for BRICS economies. Hence, the bivariate, partial, and wavelet multiple correlations techniques are employed. From the bivariate analysis, we document positive bi-directional causality between the RFSI and economic growth over the sample period. The partial wavelet reveals that GEPU shocks distort the significance and directional comovements between the RFSI and GDP. Moreover, the outcome from the wavelet multiple cross correlations (WMCC) indicates that the RFSI is a first mover at most time scales for the BRICS economies. This is followed by GEPU which either leads or lags for most scales, especially for South Africa. The impact of GEPU on RFSI and GDP is worst for South Africa in about four cases in the medium-, and long-terms. This signifies that South Africa's financial markets and economic growth are vulnerable to GEPU. However, the impetus for GEPU to drive the comovements between the financial sector and economic activity was less pronounced in the pre-COVID analysis conducted with the WMCC. The study supports both the supply-leading and demand-following hypotheses. Our findings also underscore the need for policymakers, investors and academics alike to incessantly observe the dynamics between finance and growth across time and periodicity while considering adverse shocks from global economic policy uncertainty in tandem."
https://openalex.org/W3212648179,"The rapid, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical in responding to the current COVID-19 outbreak. In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the potential of targeted mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in both research samples and clinical specimens. First, we assessed the limit of detection for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS in infected Vero E6 cells. For tryptic peptides of Nucleocapsid protein, the limit of detection was estimated to be in the mid-attomole range (9E-13 g). Next, this PRM methodology was applied to the detection of viral proteins in various COVID-19 patient clinical specimens, such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected in these samples with high sensitivity in all specimens with PCR Ct values <24 and in several samples with higher CT values. A clear relationship was observed between summed MS peak intensities for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Ct values reflecting the abundance of viral RNA. Taken together, these results suggest that targeted MS based proteomics may have the potential to be used as an additional tool in COVID-19 diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3214196383,"AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold represent a transformative advance for predicting protein structure. They are able to make very high-quality predictions given a high-quality alignment of the protein sequence with related proteins. These predictions are now readily available via the AlphaFold database of predicted structures and AlphaFold or RoseTTAfold Colaboratory notebooks for custom predictions. However, predictions for some species tend to be lower confidence than model organisms. Problematic species include Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum: important unicellular eukaryotic human parasites in an early-branching eukaryotic lineage. The cause appears to be due to poor sampling of this branch of life (Discoba) in the protein sequences databases used for the AlphaFold database and ColabFold. Here, by comprehensively gathering openly available protein sequence data for Discoba species, significant improvements to AlphaFold2 protein structure prediction over the AlphaFold database and ColabFold are demonstrated. This is made available as an easy-to-use tool for the parasitology community in the form of Colaboratory notebooks for generating multiple sequence alignments and AlphaFold2 predictions of protein structure for Trypanosoma, Leishmania and related species."
https://openalex.org/W3214726972,"An understanding of the types of shocks that disrupt and negatively impact urban household food security is of critical importance to develop relevant and targeted food security emergency preparedness policies and responses, a fact magnified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. This gap is addressed by the current study which draws from the Hungry Cities Partnership (HCP) city-wide household food insecurity survey of Nairobi city in Kenya. It uses both descriptive statistics and multilevel modelling using General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to examine the relationship between household food security and 16 different shocks experienced in the six months prior to the administration of the survey. The findings showed that only 29% of surveyed households were completely food secure. Of those experiencing some level of food insecurity, more experienced economic (55%) than sociopolitical (16%) and biophysical (10%) shocks. Economic shocks such as food price increases, loss of employment, and reduced income were all associated with increased food insecurity. Coupled with the lack of functioning social safety nets in Nairobi, households experiencing shocks and emergencies experience serious food insecurity and related health effects. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a major negative economic impact on many vulnerable urban households. As such, there is need for new policies on urban food emergencies with a clear emergency preparedness plan for responding to major economic and other shocks that target the most vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W3212170437,"Dry eye is a common, complex, and multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and tear film that results in discomfort and visual disturbances. Prevalence rates vary and largely rely on studies involving older populations. This study sought to evaluate dry eye among a sample of young students in Brazil.Cross-sectional survey included 2,140 students using 2 self-applicable questionnaires of dry eye symptoms: the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the Women's Health Study (WHS) questionnaire and a list of risk factors associated with dry eye. Participants with dry eye symptoms underwent a clinical evaluation.Participants were 23.4±5.2 years of age, 56.1% female and 43.9% male, 34.4% had an OSDI score greater than 22, and 23.5% had dry eye according to the WHS. Dry eye frequency differed consistently between the sexes: 42.6% women and 24.0% men based on the OSDI, and 27.1% women and 18.5% men based on the WHS. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that female sex, contact lens wear, the screen use for more than 6 hours per day, less than 6 hours of sleep a night, and certain medications were relevant related risk factors for dry eye. Despite symptoms, clinical evaluations demonstrated mild signs of dry eye.Dry eye symptoms were found to be a prevalent condition among Brazilian undergraduate students. Compared to the rates of dry eye among the general Brazilian population over 40 years of age, students present at higher dry eye symptoms rates and distinct odds for related risk factors were identified."
https://openalex.org/W3213320995,"Low-cost optical scattering particulate matter (PM) sensors report total or size-specific particle counts and mass concentrations. The PM concentration and size are estimated by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) proprietary algorithms, which have inherent limitations since particle scattering depends on particles' properties such as size, shape, and complex index of refraction (CRI) as well as environmental parameters such as temperature and relative humidity (RH). As low-cost PM sensors are not able to resolve individual particles, there is a need to characterize and calibrate sensors' performance under a controlled environment. Here, we present improved calibration algorithms for Plantower PMS A003 sensor for mass indices and size-resolved number concentration. An aerosol chamber experimental protocol was used to evaluate sensor-to-sensor data reproducibility. The calibration was performed using four polydisperse test aerosols. The particle size distribution OEM calibration for PMS A003 sensor did not agree with the reference single particle sizer measurements. For the number concentration calibration, the linear model without adjusting for the aerosol properties and environmental conditions yields an absolute error (NMAE) of ~ 4.0% compared to the reference instrument. The calibration models adjusted for particle CRI and density account for non-linearity in the OEM's mass concentrations estimates with NMAE within 5.0%. The calibration algorithms developed in this study can be used in indoor air quality monitoring, occupational/industrial exposure assessments, or near-source monitoring scenarios where field calibration might be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3213413685,"Radiation therapy plays a major role in the treatment of lung cancer patients. However, cancer cells develop resistance to radiation. Tumor radioresistance is a complex multifactorial mechanism which may be dependent on DNA damage and repair, hypoxic conditions inside tumor microenvironment, and the clonal selection of radioresistant cells from the heterogeneous tumor site, and it is a major cause of treatment failure in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present investigation caveolin-1 ( CAV-1 ) has been observed to be highly expressed in radiation resistant A549 lung cancer cells. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of CAV-1 reverted the cells to a radio sensitive phenotype. In addition, CAV-1 overexpression in parental A549 cells, led to radiation resistance. Further, gene expression analysis of A549 parental, radiation resistant, and caveolin-1 overexpressed cells, exhibited overexpression of DNA repair genes RAD51B, RAD18, SOX2 cancer stem cell marker, MMPs, mucins and cytoskeleton proteins in resistant and caveolin-1 over expressed A549 cells, as compared to parental A549 cells. Bioinformatic analysis shows upregulation of BRCA1, Nuclear Excision DNA repair, TGFB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in radioresistant and caveolin-1 overexpressed cells, which may functionally mediate radiation resistance. Immunohistochemistry data demonstrated heterogeneous expression of CAV-1 gene in human lung cancer tissues, which was analogous to its enhanced expression in human lung cancer cell line model and mouse orthotopic xenograft lung cancer model. Also, TCGA PanCancer clinical studies have demonstrated amplification, deletions and missense mutation in CAV-1 gene in lung cancer patients, and that CAV-1 alteration has been linked to poor prognosis, and poor survival in lung cancer patients. Interestingly, we have also optimized ELISA assay to measure caveolin-1 protein in the blood of A549 radiation resistant human xenograft preclinical mouse model and discovered higher level of caveolin-1 (950 pg/ml) in tumor bearing animals treated with radiation, as compared to xenograft with radiosensitive lung cancer cells (450 pg/ml). Thus, we conclude that caveolin-1 is involved in radio-resistance and contributes to tumor aggression, and it has potential to be used as prognostic biomarker for radiation treatment response, and tumor progression for precision medicine in lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3214270674,"Today, the only living genus of coelacanth, Latimeria is represented by two species along the eastern coast of Africa and in Indonesia. This sarcopterygian fish is nicknamed a ""living fossil"", in particular because of its slow evolution. The large geographical distribution of Latimeria may be a reason for the great resilience to extinction of this lineage, but the lack of fossil records for this genus prevents us from testing this hypothesis. Here we describe isolated bones (right angular, incomplete basisphenoid, fragments of parasphenoid and pterygoid) found in the Cenomanian Woodbine Formation in northeast Texas that are referred to the mawsoniid coelacanth Mawsonia sp. In order to assess the impact of this discovery on the alleged characteristic of ""living fossils"" in general and of coelacanths in particular: 1) we compared the average time duration of genera of ray-finned fish and coelacanth in the fossil record; 2) we compared the biogeographic signal from Mawsonia with the signal from the rest of the vertebrate assemblage of the Woodbine formation; and 3) we compared these life traits with those of Latimeria. The stratigraphical range of Mawsonia is at least 50 million years. Since Mawsonia was a fresh, brackish water fish with probably a low ability to cross large sea barriers and because most of the continental components of the Woodbine Fm vertebrate assemblage exhibit Laurasian affinities, it is proposed that the Mawsonia's occurrence in North America is more likely the result of a vicariant event linked to the break-up of Pangea rather than the result of a dispersal from Gondwana. The link between a wide geographic distribution and the resilience to extinction demonstrated here for Mawsonia is a clue that a similar situation existed for Latimeria, which allowed this genus to live for tens of millions of years."
https://openalex.org/W4225917706,"Complement component C3, mainly synthesized by hepatocytes, acts as the convergence point of three different pathways in activating the complement cascade. Besides its well-established roles in the extracellular milieu, C3 performs various intracellular functions such as immunomodulation and pathogen recognition. Although C3 is present at extremely high concentrations in hepatocytes, little is known about its intrahepatic function. In this study, we found that C3 knockout (C3-/- ) mice displayed accelerated hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation compared with C57BL/6J wild type mice. Mechanistically, C3 deficiency impaired lipophagy in hepatocytes, owing to the disrupted interaction between C3 and autophagy-related 16 like 1, which is essential for autolysosome assembly. Furthermore, lipophagy deficiency affected the function of the endoplasmic reticulum in C3-/- mice, subsequently affecting the expression of protein disulfide isomerase and activity of microsomal TG transfer protein, and ultimately impairing the production of hepatic very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Rapamycin and thapsigargin treatment accelerated VLDL secretion and alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation in C3-/- mice. Our study demonstrates that C3 promotes lipophagy to facilitate VLDL secretion in hepatocytes, thus playing an essential role in balancing TG levels in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W3213405180,"Racial/ethnic disparities are among the top-selective underlying determinants associated with the disproportional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human mobility and health outcomes. This study jointly examined county-level racial/ethnic differences in compliance with stay-at-home orders and COVID-19 health outcomes during 2020, leveraging two-year geo-tracking data of mobile devices across ~4.4 million point-of-interests (POIs) in the contiguous United States. Through a set of structural equation modeling, this study quantified how racial/ethnic differences in following stay-at-home orders could mediate COVID-19 health outcomes, controlling for state effects, socioeconomics, demographics, occupation, and partisanship. Results showed that counties with higher Asian populations decreased most in their travel, both in terms of reducing their overall POIs' visiting and increasing their staying home percentage. Moreover, counties with higher White populations experienced the lowest infection rate, while counties with higher African American populations presented the highest case-fatality ratio. Additionally, control variables, particularly partisanship, median household income, percentage of elders, and urbanization, significantly accounted for the county differences in human mobility and COVID-19 health outcomes. Mediation analyses further revealed that human mobility only statistically influenced infection rate but not case-fatality ratio, and such mediation effects varied substantially among racial/ethnic compositions. Last, robustness check of racial gradient at census block group level documented consistent associations but greater magnitude. Taken together, these findings suggest that US residents' responses to COVID-19 are subject to an entrenched and consequential racial/ethnic divide."
https://openalex.org/W3213481566,"Shared decision-making (SDM) refers to the collaboration between patients and their healthcare providers to make clinical decisions based on evidence and patient preferences, often supported by patient decision aids (PDAs). This study explored practitioner experiences of SDM in a context where SDM has been successfully implemented. Specifically, we focused on practitioners' perceptions of SDM as a paradigm, factors influencing implementation success, and outcomes.We used a qualitative approach to examine the experiences and perceptions of 10 Danish practitioners at a cancer hospital experienced in SDM implementation. A semi-structured interview format was used and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data was analyzed through thematic analysis.Prior to SDM implementation, participants had a range of attitudes from skeptical to receptive. Those with more direct long-term contact with patients (such as nurses) were more positive about the need for SDM. We identified four main factors that influenced SDM implementation success: raising awareness of SDM behaviors among clinicians through concrete measurements, supporting the formation of new habits through reinforcement mechanisms, increasing the flexibility of PDA delivery, and strong leadership. According to our participants, these factors were instrumental in overcoming initial skepticism and solidifying new SDM behaviors. Improvements to the clinical process were reported. Sustaining and transferring the knowledge gained to other contexts will require adapting measurement tools.Applying SDM in clinical practice represents a major shift in mindset for clinicians. Designing SDM initiatives with an understanding of the underlying behavioral mechanisms may increase the probability of successful and sustained implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3214549550,"The objective of this study was to calculate the extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in 96 crossbred Vrindavani cattle genotyped with Bovine SNP50K Bead Chip. After filtering, 43,821 SNPs were retained for final analysis, across 2500.3 Mb of autosome. A significant percentage of SNPs was having minor allele frequency of less than 0.20. The extent of LD between autosomal SNPs up to 10 Mb apart across the genome was measured using r2 statistic. The mean r2 value was 0.43, if pairwise distance of marker was less than10 kb and it decreased further to 0.21 for 25-50 kb markers distance. Further, the effect of minor allele frequency and sample size on LD estimate was investigated. The LD value decreased with the increase in inter-marker distance, and increased with the increase of minor allelic frequency. The estimated inbreeding coefficient and effective population size were 0.04, and 46 for present generation, which indicated small and unstable population of Vrindavani cattle. These findings suggested that a denser or breed specific SNP panel would be required to cover all genome of Vrindavani cattle for genome wide association studies (GWAS)."
https://openalex.org/W3213665257,"Mutations in the PINK1 and PRKN genes are the most common cause of early-onset familial Parkinson disease. These genes code for the PINK1 and Parkin proteins, respectively, which are involved in the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy. An early step in PINK1 -Parkin mediated mitophagy is the ubiquitination of the mitofusin proteins MFN1 and -2. The ubiquitination of MFN1 and -2 in patient samples may therefore serve as a biomarker to determine the functional effects of PINK1 and PRKN mutations, and to screen idiopathic patients for potential mitophagy defects. We aimed to characterise the expression of the PINK1 -Parkin mitophagy machinery in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and assess if these cells could serve as a platform to evaluate mitophagy via analysis of MFN1 and -2 ubiquitination. Mitophagy was induced through mitochondrial depolarisation by treatment with the protonophore CCCP and ubiquitinated MFN proteins were analysed by western blotting. In addition, PINK1 and PRKN mRNA and protein expression levels were characterised with reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. Whilst CCCP treatment led to MFN ubiquitination in primary fibroblasts, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and Jurkat leukaemic cells, treatment of PBMCs did not induce ubiquitination of MFN. PRKN mRNA and protein was readily detectable in PBMCs at comparable levels to those observed in Jurkat and fibroblast cells. In contrast, PINK1 protein was undetectable and PINK1 mRNA levels were remarkably low in control PBMCs. Our findings suggest that the PINK1 -Parkin mitophagy signalling pathway is not functional in PBMCs. Therefore, PBMCs are not a suitable biosample for analysis of mitophagy function in Parkinson disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W3213981235,"Introduction Post-stroke depression is a disabling condition that occurs in approximately one-third of stroke survivors. There is limited information on changes in depressive symptoms shortly after stroke survivors return home. To identify factors associated with changes in post-stroke depressive symptoms during the early recovery period, we conducted a secondary analysis of patients enrolled in a clinical trial conducted during the transition period shortly after patients returned home (MISTT). Methods The Michigan Stroke Transitions Trial (MISTT) tested the efficacy of social worker case management and access to online information to improve patient-reported outcomes following an acute stroke. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were collected via telephone interviews conducted at 7 and 90 days post-discharge; higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify independent predictors of baseline PHQ-9 score at 7 days and of changes over time to 90 days. Results Of 265 patients, 193 and 185 completed the PHQ-9 survey at 7 and 90 days, respectively. The mean PHQ-9 score was 5.9 at 7 days and 5.1 at 90 days. Older age, being unmarried, and having moderate stroke severity (versus mild) were significantly associated with lower 7-day PHQ-9 scores (indicating fewer depressive symptoms). However, at 90 days, both unmarried patients and those with moderate or high stroke severity had significant increases in depressive symptoms over time. Conclusions In stroke patients who recently returned home, both marital status and stroke severity were associated with depressive symptom scores; however, the relationships were complex. Being unmarried and having higher stroke severity was associated with fewer depressive symptoms at baseline, but both factors were associated with worsening depressive symptoms over time. Identifying risk factors for changes in depressive symptoms may help guide effective management strategies during the early recovery period."
https://openalex.org/W3211590855,"Recently, Cicer species have experienced increased research interest due to their economic importance, especially in genetics, genomics, and crop improvement. The Cicer arietinum, Cicer reticulatum, and Cicer echinospermum genomes have been sequenced and provide valuable resources for trait improvement. Since the publication of the chickpea draft genome, progress has been made in genome assembly, functional annotation, and identification of polymorphic markers. However, work is still needed to identify transposable elements (TEs) and make them available for researchers. In this paper, we present CicerSpTEdb, a comprehensive TE database for Cicer species that aims to improve our understanding of the organization and structural variations of the chickpea genome. Using structure and homology-based methods, 3942 C. echinospermum, 3579 C. reticulatum, and 2240 C. arietinum TEs were identified. Comparisons between Cicer species indicate that C. echinospermum has the highest number of LTR-RT and hAT TEs. C. reticulatum has more Mutator, PIF Harbinger, Tc1 Mariner, and CACTA TEs, while C. arietinum has the highest number of Helitron. CicerSpTEdb enables users to search and visualize TEs by location and download their results. The database will provide a powerful resource that can assist in developing TE target markers for molecular breeding and answer related biological questions.

https://openalex.org/W3213742640,"Background Traditional gender roles (GRs) have a considerable influence on relationships among couples. These can lead to negative health effects in women; however, their impact on intimate partner violence (IPV) has been less explored, especially among younger women. Objective To explore the association between traditional GRs and several indicators of IPV on a sample of Spanish female university students involved in heterosexual dating relationships. Methods A cross-sectional study involving female university students (n = 1,005) pursuing ten degrees (four Health Science degrees and six Social Sciences degrees). Data were collected using two validated scales: 1) the Questionnaire on the Gender Determinants of Contraception (COGANT), used to examine four traditional GRs (submissive, blind, and passive attitudes of female students, and male dominance), and 2) the Dating Violence Questionnaire-R (DVQ-R) scale, used to measure five types of IPV-behaviors (coercion, detachment, humiliation, sexual violence, and physical violence), perceived fear, entrapment, and abuse. Logistic and linear regressions were conducted to study the association between GR and a series of IPV indicators in dating relationships. Results Traditional GRs were highly prevalent (57.0% submissive, 52.0% blind attitude, 75.7% passive, and 31.7% identified their boyfriend as being dominant). Up to 66.3% experienced some type of violent behavior. All GRs were significantly associated with IPV indicators. A submissive attitude in female students was the GR that was most strongly associated to total IPV-behavior (adjusted odd ratio [OR] = 3.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.29–4.42), followed by male dominance (OR = 2.79: 95% CI:1.71: 4.54). Both GRs were also highly associated with perceived fear, entrapment, and abuse. Conclusions A high presence of traditional GRs was found in the relationships held by female university students, which was significantly associated with IPV indicators. Universities must adopt policies for gender equality and raise awareness on dating violence."
https://openalex.org/W3214012341,"Unexpected questing activity of ticks was noted during the winter months of January and February in the Central Midwestern states of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. From nine geographically distinct locations, four species of ticks were collected using the flagging method, of which the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum , was most abundant, followed by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis , the Gulf coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum , and the Black legged tick, Ixodes scapularis . More A . americanum nymphs were caught questing than male or female adults. The winter activity of these medically important ticks in this region poses concern for public health and offers an insight into future tick activity in light of ongoing climate change. More studies on the seasonality of these tick species, and how different climate parameters affect their seasonal activity in this region are warranted and would be expected to benefit for both human and veterinary medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3212354445,"With the development of economic integration, Beijing has become more closely connected with surrounding areas, which gradually formed the Beijing metropolitan area (BMA). The authors define the scope of BMA from two dimensions of space and time. BMA is determined to be the built-up area of Beijing and its surrounding 10 districts. Designed questionnaire survey the personal characteristics, family characteristics, and travel characteristics of residents from 10 districts in the surrounding BMA. The statistical analysis of questionnaires shows that the supply of public transportation is insufficient and cannot meet traffic demand. Further, the travel mode prediction model of Softmax regression machine learning algorithm for BMA (SRBM) is established. To further verify the prediction performance of the proposed model, the Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), model are introduced to compare the prediction accuracy. The results show that the constructed SRBM model exhibits high prediction accuracy, with an average accuracy of 88.35%, which is 2.83% and 18.11% higher than the SVM and MNL models, respectively. This article provides new ideas for the prediction of travel modes in the Beijing metropolitan area."
https://openalex.org/W3213970900,"In this study, 90 (51 males, 39 females) tennis players performed single-leg quiet stance and single-leg landing tasks. For the static standing task, center-of pressure (CoP) velocities, amplitudes, frequency and area were calculated. For the landing tasks, time to stabilization as well as dynamic postural stability index were considered. The analysis of differences between the legs was done based on two methods for a priori determination of leg preference, one based on the preference of kicking a ball and one based on the preference for single-leg jumping. An additional analysis was done based on the leg dominance (determined post hoc), based on the observed performance of the tasks. In case of the classification based on kicking a ball, there was a statistically significantly lower CoP anterior-posterior velocity and anterior-posterior amplitude in static balance task (p ≤ 0.017; 0.17 ≤ d ≤ 0.28) for the preferred leg. The CoP frequency was higher in the preferred leg for both directions (p ≤ 0.002; 0.10 ≤ d ≤ 0.22). For the landing task, CoP medial-lateral time to stabilization was statistically significantly shorter for the preferred leg (0.28 ± 0.38 s) compared to the non-preferred leg (0.47 ± 0.60 s) (p = 0.012; d = 0.38). There were no differences between the legs for the landing task. Moreover, there were no differences between the legs when we used the preference based on jumping for either of the tasks (d ≤ 0.14). The differences between legs in terms of observed dominance were larger than the differences based on the preference, which stresses the need for clear distinction of limb preference and limb dominance in research and practice. Regarding the effect of leg preference, small differences in static balance may exist between the legs (when the preference is based on kicking a ball)."
https://openalex.org/W3214572006,"With the pending implementation of the Closing the Gap 2020 recommendations, there is an urgent need to better understand the contributing factors of, and pathways to positive educational outcomes for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. This deeper understanding is particularly important in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia, in which the majority of Aboriginal children lived in remote communities and have language backgrounds other than English (i.e. 75%).This study linked the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) to the attendance data (i.e. government preschool and primary schools) and Year 3 National Assessment Program for Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the pathway from self-regulation and executive function (SR-EF) at age 5 to early academic achievement (i.e. Year 3 reading/numeracy at age 8) for 3,199 NT children.The study confirms the expected importance of SR-EF for all children but suggests the different pathways for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. For non-Aboriginal children, there was a significant indirect effect of SR-EF (β = 0.38, p<0.001) on early academic achievement, mediated by early literacy/numeracy skills (at age 5). For Aboriginal children, there were significant indirect effects of SR-EF (β = 0.19, p<0.001) and preschool attendance (β = 0.20, p<0.001), mediated by early literacy/numeracy skills and early primary school attendance (i.e. Transition Years to Year 2 (age 5-7)).This study highlights the need for further investigation and development of culturally, linguistically and contextually responsive programs and policies to support SR-EF skills in the current Australian education context. There is a pressing need to better understand how current policies and programs enhance children and their families' sense of safety and support to nurture these skills. This study also confirms the critical importance of school attendance for improved educational outcomes of Aboriginal children. However, the factors contributing to non-attendance are complex, hence the solutions require multi-sectoral collaboration in place-based design for effective implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3210386137,"Cities and towns have often developed infrastructure that enabled a variety of socio-economic interactions. Street networks within these urban settings provide key access to resources, neighborhoods, and cultural facilities. Studies on settlement scaling have also demonstrated that a variety of urban infrastructure and resources indicate clear population scaling relationships in both modern and ancient settings. This article presents an approach that investigates past street network centrality and its relationship to population scaling in urban contexts. Centrality results are compared statistically among different urban settings, which are categorized as orthogonal (i.e., planned) or self-organizing (i.e., organic) urban settings, with places having both characteristics classified as hybrid. Results demonstrate that street nodes have a power law relationship to urban area, where the number of nodes increases and node density decreases in a sub-linear manner for larger sites. Most median centrality values decrease in a negative sub-linear manner as sites are larger, with organic and hybrid urban sites' centrality being generally less and diminishing more rapidly than orthogonal settings. Diminishing centrality shows comparability to modern urban systems, where larger urban districts may restrict overall interaction due to increasing transport costs over wider areas. Centrality results indicate that scaling results have multiples of approximately ⅙ or ⅓ that are comparable to other urban and road infrastructure, suggesting a potential relationship between different infrastructure features and population in urban centers. The results have implications for archaeological settlements where urban street plans are incomplete or undetermined, as it allows forecasts to be made on past urban sites' street network centrality. Additionally, a tool to enable analysis of street networks and centrality is provided as part of the contribution."
https://openalex.org/W3212258121,"Cestodes are platyhelminth parasites with a wide range of hosts that cause neglected diseases. Neurotransmitter signaling is of critical importance for these parasites which lack circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems. For example, serotonin (5-HT) and serotonergic G-protein coupled receptors (5-HT GPCRs) play major roles in cestode motility, development and reproduction. In previous work, we deorphanized a group of 5-HT7 type GPCRs from cestodes. However, little is known about another type of 5-HT GPCR, the 5-HT1 clade, which has been studied in several invertebrate phyla but not in platyhelminthes. Three putative 5-HT GPCRs from Echinococcus canadensis , Mesocestoides vogae ( syn . M . corti ) and Hymenolepis microstoma were cloned, sequenced and bioinformatically analyzed. Evidence grouped these new sequences within the 5-HT1 clade of GPCRs but differences in highly conserved GPCR motifs were observed. Transcriptomic analysis, heterologous expression and immunolocalization studies were performed to characterize the E . canadensis receptor, called Eca-5-HT 1a . Functional heterologous expression studies showed that Eca-5-HT 1a is highly specific for serotonin. 5-Methoxytryptamine and α-methylserotonin, both known 5-HT GPCR agonists, give stimulatory responses whereas methysergide, a known 5-HT GPCR ligand, give an antagonist response in Eca-5-HT 1a . Mutants obtained by the substitution of key predicted residues resulted in severe impairment of receptor activity, confirming that indeed, these residues have important roles in receptor function. Immunolocalization studies on the protoscolex stage from E . canadensis , showed that Eca-5-HT 1a is localized in branched fibers which correspond to the nervous system of the parasite. The patterns of immunoreactive fibers for Eca-5-HT 1a and for serotonin were intimately intertwined but not identical, suggesting that they are two separate groups of fibers. These data provide the first functional, pharmacological and localization report of a serotonergic receptor that putatively belongs to the 5-HT1 type of GPCRs in cestodes. The serotonergic GPCR characterized here may represent a new target for antiparasitic intervention."

The objective of this research was to investigate the relation between factors that define cross-border business interaction and innovativeness. From the cross-border regional innovation systems literature, we operationalized thirty-five factors which potentially influence cross-border business interaction; these factors concern availability of science and knowledge bases, socio-cultural proximity, accessibility, institutional set-up, and governance. We conducted a survey focusing on these factors and analyzed the data using Cronbach's alpha and linear regression. The cross-border interaction factors identified in the survey results served as independent variables and the differences in innovativeness levels in different European cross-border regions served as our dependent variable. This study confirmed that differences in innovativeness levels between countries can be related to factors hindering cross-border business interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3213056242,"The complex design of transportation infrastructure hinders communication between different roles in the project, which makes it difficult to promote the Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) mode. This paper discusses a design simulation and communication system based on Building Information Modeling and Virtual Reality for transportation infrastructure (DSC-BV-TI system), integrated with BIM, with VR developed by using a game engine. Based on an analysis of the user's demand, the system introduces a three-dimensional BIM model of traffic infrastructure in an immersive VR environment and realizes the simulation design, weather simulation, virtual driving, sight distance calculation, visual simulation and other functions of traffic infrastructure project by using the system's safety assessment and scheme decision. The system is applied to the design of the Jinjiazhuang Extra-Long Tunnel project of the Yan-Chong Expressway in Hebei Province, which was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The results show that, using the DSC-BV-TI system, the designer has completed a display of the overall scheme: the user can use the steering wheel to drive a vehicle; use the head-mounted display to play the picture; realize the simulation and interaction in a variety of simulated weather conditions and environments; and use IPD mode to communicate and make decisions on the design scheme of the traffic infrastructure, tunnel speed limit and other aspects that play a key role. The DSC-BV-TI system has 8 advantages and 4 disadvantages identified through a questionnaire survey, the advantages including high fidelity, high efficiency and low cost. At the same time, according to the research results, three suggestions to help improve the system are discussed. DSC-BV-TI system as a communication bridge between the design team and other stakeholders reduces the communication gap and promotes the implementation of the IPD mode in transportation infrastructure projects."

Currently, there are no small animal models and connected tools to help study the functional impacts of SM. The objective of this study was to determine the detectability of subtle locomotion deficits due to syrinx formation/expansion in post-traumatic syringomyelia (PTSM) rat model using the recently reported method of Gait Analysis Instrumentation, and Technology Optimized for Rodents (GAITOR) with Automated Gait Analysis Through Hues and Areas (AGATHA) technique. First videos of the rats were collected while walking in an arena (using GAITOR) followed by extracting meaningful locomotion information from collected videos using AGATHA protocol. PTSM injured rats demonstrated detectable locomotion deficits in terms of duty factor imbalance, paw placement accuracy, step contact width, stride length, and phase dispersion parameters compared to uninjured rats due to SM. We concluded that this technique could detect mild and subtle locomotion deficits associated with PTSM injury, which also in future work could be used further to monitor locomotion responses after different treatment strategies for SM."
https://openalex.org/W3213508318,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all dimensions of lives and has become a social problem as it continues to spread widely through the continuous interactions of people in public spaces where they earn a living. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 requires restrictions in these public spaces, however, the compliance to these measures depends largely on the understanding and interpretations of COVID 19 by users of these public spaces. This study examined the contextual interpretations of public space users about COVID-19 prevention in Ibadan Metropolis, Oyo State. The study was a rapid ethnographic survey in selected public spaces (markets and commercial motor parks) in Ibadan metropolis. Data were collected through participant observation, key informant interviews (3 females; 3 males) and in-depth interviews (30) with, traders, head porters, clients/buyers and commercial vehicle drivers in these public spaces. Interviews conducted were transcribed, sorted into themes using Atlas-ti 7.5.7 and subjected to interpretive-content analysis. Findings revealed that some respondents felt COVID-19 was brought into Nigeria by rich frequent global voyagers, others felt it was through ""uncultured"" sexual life or wrath of God. Some also doubted the existence of the disease and many of the respondents perceived COVID-19 as a disease reported by the government or a political propaganda to siphon funds. The users of the public spaces in Ibadan Metropolis have variegated perception about the existence and severity of this rapidly spreading virus and this has grave implications for COVID-19 control in the State. Thus, regular interaction with public space users are essential for control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3213821757,"Amazonia and the Northeast region of Brazil exhibit the highest levels of climate vulnerability in the country. While Amazonia is characterized by an extremely hot and humid climate and hosts the world largest rainforest, the Northeast is home to sharp climatic contrasts, ranging from rainy areas along the coast to semiarid regions that are often affected by droughts. Both regions are subject to extremely high temperatures and are susceptible to many tropical diseases. This study develops a multidimensional Extreme Climate Vulnerability Index (ECVI) for Brazilian Amazonia and the Northeast region based on the Alkire-Foster method. Vulnerability is defined by three components, encompassing exposure (proxied by seven climate extreme indicators), susceptibility (proxied by sociodemographic indicators), and adaptive capacity (proxied by sanitation conditions, urbanization rate, and healthcare provision). In addition to the estimated vulnerability levels and intensity, we break down the ECVI by indicators, dimensions, and regions, in order to explore how the incidence levels of climate-sensitive infectious and parasitic diseases correlate with regional vulnerability. We use the Grade of Membership method to reclassify the mesoregions into homoclimatic zones based on extreme climatic events, so climate and population/health data can be analyzed at comparable resolutions. We find two homoclimatic zones: Extreme Rain (ER) and Extreme Drought and High Temperature (ED-HT). Vulnerability is higher in the ED-HT areas than in the ER. The contribution of each dimension to overall vulnerability levels varies by homoclimatic zone. In the ER zone, adaptive capacity (39%) prevails as the main driver of vulnerability among the three dimensions, in contrast with the approximately even dimensional contribution in the ED-HT. When we compare areas by disease incidence levels, exposure emerges as the most influential dimension. Our results suggest that climate can exacerbate existing infrastructure deficiencies and socioeconomic conditions that are correlated with tropical disease incidence in impoverished areas."
https://openalex.org/W3214465483,"Background For patients, seclusion during psychiatric treatment is often a traumatic experience. To prevent such experiences, adjustments in the design of seclusion rooms have been recommended. Methods As there have been no empirical studies on the matter, we used a quasi-experimental design to compare the experiences in seclusion of two groups of patients: 26 who had been secluded in a room designed according to the principles of healing environment, a so called ‘Enriched Environment Seclusion room’ (EES), and 27 who had been secluded in a regular seclusion (RS) room. The enrichment included audio-visual facilities, a fixed toilet, a couch and a self-service system to adjust light, colour, blinds and temperature according to the patient’s preferences. Insight into their experiences was obtained using the Patient View-of-Seclusion Questionnaire, which comprises nine statements on seclusion, supplemented with open-ended questions. Results The responses regarding seclusion experiences between the two groups did not differ significantly ( U = 280.00, p = .21, r = -.17). Although those who had been secluded in the specially designed room had greatly appreciated the opportunities for distraction, and those who had been secluded in a regular seclusion room expressed the need for more distracting activities during seclusion, both groups described seclusion as a dreadful experience. If seclusion cannot be avoided, patients recommend facilities for distraction (such as those provided in an enriched environment seclusion room) to be available. Conclusion Whatever the physical environment and facilities of a seclusion room, we may thus conclude that seclusion is a burdensome experience."

However, due to the lack of a valid instrument for assessing drivers' sleep quality, few studies have examined drivers' sleep quality and its associations with driving behaviours and traffic accidents in China. The aim of this paper is to revise the Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) and assess its reliability and validity in Chinese drivers.522 Chinese drivers aged from 18 to 56 years old agreed to complete the SQS, Daytime Sleepiness Perception Scale version 4 (DSPS-4), Self-report of Risky Driving Behavior (RD-SR) and Self-assessment of the Likelihood of Being Involved in a Risky Driving Situation (RD-SA).The final Chinese version of the SQS contained 23 items across four factors: difficulty in getting up, difficulty in falling asleep, sleep recovery and daytime dysfunction. Second, man scored lower on the difficulty in falling asleep factor but higher on the sleep recovery factor than women. Third, low to moderate correlations were found between the SQS factors and the DSPS-4, RD-SA and RD-SR, indicating that the validity of the revised scale was satisfactory. More importantly, daytime dysfunction factor is an effective predictor of violation involvement and accident involvement.The revised SQS has acceptable reliability and validity and can be used as a tool to measure the sleep quality of Chinese drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3212408565,"The relatively high frequency of marine mammal stranding events in the Philippines provide many research opportunities. A select set of stranders (n = 21) from 2017 to 2018 were sampled for bacteriology and histopathology. Pertinent tissues and bacteria were collected from individuals representing eight cetacean species (i.e. Feresa attenuata, Kogia breviceps, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Grampus griseus, Lagenodelphis hosei, Peponocephala electra, Stenella attenuata and Stenella longirostris) and were subjected to histopathological examination and antibiotic resistance screening, respectively. The antibiotic resistance profiles of 24 bacteria (belonging to genera Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Shigella) that were isolated from four cetaceans were determined using 18 antibiotics. All 24 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic class, and 79.17% were classified as multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR). The MAR index values of isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.39 with all the isolates resistant to erythromycin (100%; n = 24) and susceptible to imipenem, doripenem, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin (100%; n = 24). The resistance profiles of these bacteria show the extent of antimicrobial resistance in the marine environment, and may inform medical management decisions during rehabilitation of stranded cetaceans. Due to inadequate gross descriptions and limited data gathered by the responders during the stranding events, the significance of histopathological lesions in association with disease diagnosis in each cetacean stranding or mortality remained inconclusive; however, these histopathological findings may be indicative or contributory to the resulting debility and stress during their strandings. The findings of the study demonstrate the challenges faced by cetacean species in the wild, such as but not limited to, biological pollution through land-sea movement of effluents, fisheries interactions, and anthropogenic activities."

Surgical intervention is the best management choice, although it is associated with high recurrence rates and serious complications. Also, the commonly used chemotherapeutics exhibited serious side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the protoscolicidal effects of eugenol (Eug) essential oil and its nanoemulsion (Eug-NE) against protoscoleces (PCs) of hydatid cysts in vitro.Eug-NE was prepared and characterized. Their cytotoxicity on macrophages was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. E. granulosus PCs were treated with various concentrations of Eug and Eug-NE at different exposure times. The viability of protoscoleces was evaluated by the eosin exclusion test, and the changes in the morphology of protoscoleces were assessed. Albendazole (ABZ) was used as a positive control.The cellular cytotoxicity of Eug and Eug-NE on macrophage cells, in minimum and maximum concentrations (0.2 and 1 μl/mL), were nearly negligible ranging from 4.7% to 8.3% and 3.7% to 7.2%, respectively. The results showed highly significant activity of Eug-NE and Eug against hydatid PCs compared to ABZ (P < 0.05). Eug and Eug-NE have similar protoscolicidal effects at all used concentrations. Their highest scolicidal activity (100% mortality rate) was recorded at 1 μl/ml after 30 min incubation (LC50 = 0.298-LC90 = 0.521 and LC50 = 0.309-LC90 = 0.646, respectively). Both formulations showed time- and dose-dependent effects.This study suggested the potent scolicidal activities of Eug and Eug-NE as promising alternative scolicidal agents. Future studies are recommended to explore the mechanism of action and treatment response in vivo and clinical settings."

The school food environment is important because children spend a significant part of their time at school and consume one-third to one-half of their daily meals there. In 2014, a Federal Government guideline for the sale and distribution of food and beverages in Mexican schools was published (the AGREEMENT) but the extent of its implementation is not known.Descriptive cross-sectional study in a representative, random sample of elementary schools, using the tools of the INFORMAS network. Data collection included: a) an interview with a school authority; b) a checklist of items available in the school canteen; c) a checklist of the school breakfast menu; and d) an evaluation of the physical environment. The main indicators were: percentage of implementation (self-report) of the AGREEMENT and percentage of compliance (researcher verified) with the AGREEMENT (based on tools b and c).119 schools participated (response rate 87.5%), with 15.1% (95%CI 9.2-22.8) of the schools reporting having fully implemented the AGREEMENT. However, only 1% (95%CI 0-5.3) of the school canteens and 71.4% (95%CI 57.8-82.7) of the school breakfast menus fully complied with the AGREEMENT. A variety of sugar-sweetened beverages and energy-dense, nutrient poor products were found in the school canteens. Further, only 43.7% of the water fountains in schools were functional and 23.4% were clean. In only 24.4% of schools had the school authorities received formal training related to the AGREEMENT and in 28.6% of schools had the parents received information about the AGREEMENT.The AGREEMENT has been poorly implemented in elementary schools in Mexico.

There rhizosphere have complex bacterial communities, which mediate a variety of interactions between plants and soil. High-throughput sequencing was used to investigated rhizosphere bacterial community changes under the typical halophyte species in arid China. Three typical halophytes were Leymus chinensis (LC), Puccinellia tenuiflora (PT), Suaeda glauca (SG). The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes, Suaeda glauca rhizosphere has stronger enrichment of Nitrospirae and Cyanobacteria. The Ace, Chao and Shannon indices were significantly higher in soils under LC and SG (P<0.05). Functional predictions, based on 16S rRNA gene by PICRUSt, indicated that Energy metabolism, Amino acid metabolism, Carbohydrate metabolism and Fatty acid metabolism are dominant bacterial functions in three halophytes rhizosphere soil. Carbon metabolism, Oxidative phosphorylation, Methane metabolism, Sulfur metabolism and Nitrogen metabolism in SG were significantly higher than that in LC and PT. Regression analysis revealed that rhizosphere soil bacterial community structure is influenced by soil organic matter (SOM) and soil water content (SWC), while soil bacterial community diversity is affected by soil pH. This study contributes to our understanding of the distribution characteristics and metabolic functions under different halophyte rhizosphere bacterial communities, and will provide references for the use of rhizosphere bacteria to regulate the growth of halophytes and ecological restoration of saline soil."
https://openalex.org/W3214482975,"Transcription factors (TFs) are key proteins that modulate gene transcription and thereby lead to changes in the gene expression profile and the subsequent alteration of cellular functions. In the silk gland (SG) of silkworm Bombyx mori, an important silk-producing insect, TFs are of vital importance in the regulation of silk protein synthesis in this organ. However, which TFs exist and express in the SG remains largely unknown. Here, we report the large-scale identification of TFs in the SG based on available full-length transcript sequences and the most recent version of silkworm genome data. In total, 348 candidate TFs were identified by strict filtration and were classified into 56 TF families. Chromosomal distribution, motif composition, and phylogenetic relationship analyses revealed the typical characteristics of these TFs. In addition, the expression patterns of 348 TFs in various tissues of B. mori, especially the SG of fourth-molt (4LM) and day-3 and day-4 fifth-instar (5L3D and 5L4D) larvae, were investigated based on public RNA-seq data and gene microarray data, followed by spatiotemporal verification of TF expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This report describes the first comprehensive analysis of TFs in the B. mori SG. The results can serve as a baseline for further studies of the roles of TFs in the B. mori SG."
https://openalex.org/W3214704428,"Background People at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 have experienced greater restrictions during the pandemic, yet there is a paucity of research exploring their lived experience. Objectives This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on people identified as at high risk of severe illness by UK Government, and in particular, the impact of the first lockdown on access to healthcare, medications and use of technological platforms. Methods 1038 UK adults who identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 in line with UK Government guidance or self-identified with acute or other chronic health conditions, completed the Awareness, Attitudes and Actions survey which explored the impact of COVID-19 on access to healthcare, management of long-term health condition, mental health, and health behaviours. Results Most participants reported feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and isolation, noticed that other people changed their behaviour towards them including a feeling of being stigmatised by people not categorised as high risk. Participants described the largely negative impact that the COVID-19 lockdown had on to health-related behaviours and access to healthcare, which had resulted in large declines in mental health and wellbeing. Participants also indicated disappointment at the UK Governments response and handling of the COVID-19 lockdown. Implications This study provides novel evidence of the lived experience of the first COVID-19 lockdown for people identified as at high risk of severe illness. In the context of behavioural health interventions, the ubiquity of digital technologies and their adoption into day-to-day life translates into greater potential reach than traditional interventions, and consequently, greater potential for positive public health impact. Findings should be considered by policymakers and healthcare professionals to support people now and as we transition through the recovery phase with a particular emphasis on supporting mental health and changes to the management of long-term health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3211400446,"Human activities have been changing the global biogeographic patterns by the introductions of invasive species. For reptiles, the invasion rate increase of non-native species is remarkably related to the pet trade, especially for freshwater turtles. Here we estimated the invasive potential of the South American turtle Trachemys dorbigni in the Americas using a combination of climatic and human activity variables. We built species distribution models based on data from the native and invasive ranges, using the ensemble model from five different algorithms (GAM, MAXENT, BRT, RF and GBM). We compared the two models' performance and predictions, one calibrated with only climatic variables (climate-driven), and the second also included a descriptive variable of human activity (climate plus human-driven). Suitable areas for T. dorbigni covered occurrence areas of its congeners and highly diversified ecoregions, such as the eastern USA, the islands of Central America, and the south eastern and eastern Brazilian coast. Our results indicate that human activities allow T. dorbigni to establish populations outside of its original climatic niche. Including human activity variables proved fundamental to refining the results to identify more susceptible areas to invasion and to allow the efficient targeting of prevention measures. Finally, we suggested a set of actions to prevent T. dorbigni becoming a highly impacting species in the areas identified as more prone to its invasion."

To decrease this overload, patients without a life-threating condition are transferred to wards that offer ED support. This study aimed to evaluate if implementing a rapid response team (RRT) triggered by the modified early warning score (MEWS) in high-risk wards offering ED support is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality rate. Methods A before-and-after cross-sectional study compared in-hospital mortality rates before and after implementation of an RRT triggered by the MEWS ≥4 in two wards of a tertiary hospital that offer ED support. Results We included 6863 patients hospitalized in these wards before RRT implementation from July 2015 through June 2017 and 6944 patients hospitalized in these same wards after RRT implementation from July 2018 through June 2020. We observed a statistically significant decrease in the in-hospital mortality rate after intervention, 449 deaths/6944 hospitalizations [6.47% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.91%– 7.07%)] compared to 534 deaths/6863 hospitalizations [7.78% (95% CI 7.17–8.44)] before intervention; with an absolute risk reduction of -1.31% (95% CI -2.20 –-0.50). Conclusion RRT trigged by the MEWS≥4 in high-risk wards that offer ED support was found to be associated with a decreased in-hospital mortality rate. A further cluster-randomized trial should evaluate the impact of this intervention in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3212484863,"Because of limited infrastructure and skilled human capital, the etiology of meningitis is rarely identified in developing countries like Ethiopia. This results in unnecessary antibiotics use, economic crisis, hospitalization, and related nosocomial infections. Thus, we aimed to assess the epidemiology of human enteroviruses (HEVs) among clinically suspected meningitis cases in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to August 2020 at selected Hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from 146 clinically suspected meningitis and bacterial culture-negative patients. SPSS v 21.0 was used for data analysis and bivariate correlation was done for the association between variables of interest.HEVs were detected in 39 (26.7%) of the 146 clinically suspected meningitis cases. Most of the HEVs cases 28 (71.9%) were detected in younger-aged infants less than 1 year. The most commonly observed clinical manifestations were vomiting (75.5%) followed by fever (56.8%) and impaired consciousness or irritability (50.7%). The mean length of hospital stay for patients with enteroviral meningitis was 9 days. Many patients with HEVs were recovered with sequelae (46.2%), and HEVs has contributed for one out of the nine meningeal deaths (11.1%).HEVs were found to be the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in all age groups. Many of the patients were mistreated with antibiotics and hospitalized. The detection of HEVs in 26.7% of clinically suspected meningitis cases indicated the need for molecular tests in investigating the etiology of meningitis. Therefore, we suggest the introduction of molecular tests as a routine practice in referral hospitals and the need to further characterize circulating HEVs strains."

They are often distinguished by their histopathologic differences, but little is known about potential differences in regulation of epithelial proliferation and apoptosis.We conducted a protein expression analysis using tissue microarrays of 625 colorectal adenomas and 142 serrated lesions to determine potential differences in regulation of epithelial proliferation and apoptosis. We quantitated proliferation with Ki-67; apoptosis with activated caspase-3 (CASP3); up- and down-regulators of proliferation with cyclin D1, p16INK2, and p21Cip1; and apoptosis regulators with BAX, BCL2, and survivin. Linear mixed effects models and circos diagrams were used to determine relationships among expression and lesion characteristics.Adenomas had a significantly higher CASP-3 labeling index (LI) than serrated lesions, resulting in a lower net growth ratio (Ki-67 LI/activated CASP-3 LI, p-value<0.0001). Cyclin D1 LI, p16 LI and p21 LI were lower in adenomas compared to serrated lesions, while expression of both BCL2 and BAX were higher (p <0.001). Among adenomas, cyclin D1 LI and p16 LI levels increased with greater villous component, and the highest BAX expression was detected in adenomas larger than 2 cm (both p<0.0001). Right-sided adenomas had higher CASP3 LI than left colorectal adenomas (p = 0.008). Significant differences in cyclin D1 LI, p21 LI and survivin LI were also observed across histopathologic subtypes of serrated lesions.Our findings demonstrate different patterns of regulatory protein expression in adenomas than serrated lesions, especially involving apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W3212771860,"The models of linguistic networks and their analytical tools constitute a potential methodology for investigating the formation of structural patterns in actual language use. Research with this methodology has just started, which can hopefully shed light on the emergent nature of linguistic structure. This study attempts to employ linguistic networks to investigate the formation of modern Chinese two-character words (as structural units based on the chunking of their component characters) in the actual use of modern Chinese, which manifests itself as continuous streams of Chinese characters. Network models were constructed based on authentic Chinese language data, with Chinese characters as nodes, their co-occurrence relations as directed links, and the co-occurrence frequencies as link weights. Quantitative analysis of the network models has shown that a Chinese two-character word can highlight itself as a two-node island, i.e., a cohesive sub-network with its two component characters co-occurring more frequently than they co-occur with the other characters. This highlighting mechanism may play a vital role in the formation and acquisition of two-character words in actual language use. Moreover, this mechanism may also throw some light on the emergence of other structural phenomena (with the chunking of specific linguistic units as their basis)."

The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity ratio and distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened prior hospitalization or surgery, stratified by age category.We retrospectively studied data on SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients screened pre-hospitalization or pre-surgery in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders over a 12-month period (1 April 2020-31 March 2021).In total, 255925 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and 2421 positive results for which a viral load was reported, were included in this study. An unweighted overall SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR positivity ratio of 1.27% was observed with strong spatiotemporal differences. SARS-CoV-2 circulated predominantly in 80+ year old individuals across all time periods except between the first and second COVID-19 wave and in 20-30 year old individuals before the second COVID-19 wave. In contrast to the first wave, a significantly higher positivity ratio was observed for the 20-40 age group in addition to the 80+ age group compared to the other age groups during the second wave. The median viral load follows a similar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80+ year old individuals.There was a high SARS-CoV-2 circulation among asymptomatic patients with a predominance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly. Moreover, ahead of the second COVID-19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20-30 year old individuals, indicating they could have been the hidden drivers of this wave."

For patients prescribed without providing appropriate indicators, 2.2% had no indication for medication and 13.3% had an indication for medication, but not a specific OAC. For patients with inappropriate drug selection, 1, 5 patients were on rivaroxaban, dabigatran respectively. The distribution of NOAC doses was as follows: dabigatran standard dose (45.2%), the low dose (54.8%). Rivaroxaban standard dose (58.9%), low dose (36.8%), high dose (4.3%). A total of 44 patients (9.6%) experienced bleeding events, 12 patients (2.6%) experienced embolic events, and 7 patients experienced other adverse events after dosing.In clinical practice, it is common for patients with AF to receive inappropriate prescriptions of OACs. Therefore there is a need to enhance anticoagulation management in patients with AF to improve the appropriate use of OACs."
https://openalex.org/W3212936231,"A predicted metalloproteinase gene, HypZn, was cloned from Aspergillus niger CGMCC 3.7193 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, and the physicochemical characteristics of recombinant HypZn were investigated after separation and purification. The results showed that the specific activity of the purified HypZn reached 1859.2 U/mg, and the optimum temperature and pH value of HypZn were 35°C and 7.0, respectively. HypZn remained stable both at 40°C and at pH values between 5.0 and 8.0. The preferred substrate of HypZn was soybean protein isolates, and the Km and Vmax values were 21.5 μmol/mL and 4926.6 μmol/(mL∙min), respectively. HypZn was activated by Co2+ and Zn2+ and inhibited by Cu2+ and Fe2+. The degree of soybean protein isolate hydrolysis reached 14.7%, and the hydrolysates were of uniform molecular weight. HypZn could tolerate 5000 mM NaCl and completely lost its activity after 30 min at 50°C. The enzymological characterizations indicated that HypZn has great application potential in the food industry, especially in fermented food processing."
https://openalex.org/W3214491645,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in Europe, often causing severe physical, cognitive and emotional impairments. Currently, it is unclear whether the healthcare provisions of people with MS (PwMS) are in line with the recommendations for treatment based on guidelines or patients' needs. The main objectives of the study are as follows: (a) to investigate how well PwMS are treated; and (b) to develop a needs-oriented, patient-centred care model.This mixed-methods study focuses on adult PwMS living in Lower Saxony, a federal state in Germany. The qualitative study comprises focus groups with PwMS, physicians and people involved in the healthcare process as well as a future workshop. The quantitative study comprises a cross-sectional online survey and addresses the patient-relevant outcomes and needs, as previously determined by literature searches and focus groups. It will be administered to all PwMS who are insured by the statutory health insurance company involved in the project (n~7,000). The survey data will be linked to the longitudinal secondary data from the statutory health insurance company and data from the German MS registry where available. The linked and single data sources will be statistically analysed.By comprehensively comparing the current healthcare provisions with the needs and requirements of PwMS, the strengths and weaknesses of the overall healthcare process and provision of assistive devices can be identified. The barriers and facilitators of the health service providers and their impact on daily life will be explored (qualitative analyses). Reliable recommendations for improvements will be given based on a study population drawn from the largest statutory health insurance company in Lower Saxony (quantitative analyses). However, the inherent advantages and limitations of the qualitative and quantitative research approaches need to be considered.The study is registered at German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00021741."
https://openalex.org/W3170172286,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number cause of death worldwide. In Ghana CVD has been the leading cause of death since 2001. The prevalence of CVD risk factors among adolescents in Ghana has been increasing. This study seeks to develop, implement and evaluate the effects of a behavioral modification intervention program to reduce CVD risk factors among secondary school students in Brong Ahafo, Ghana.A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with schools as clusters over a period of six-months with pre and post intervention evaluations. Participants were public secondary school students (14-19 years) from four schools in Brong Ahafo, Ghana. Students in the intervention group were trained by the researchers whereas those of the control group received no intervention. The intervention included health education and physical activity modules. Follow-up data using same questionnaire were collected within two weeks after the intervention was completed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed after replacing missing values using the multiple imputation method. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to assess the effects of the intervention study.The GLMM analyses showed the intervention was effective in attaining 0.77(p<0.001), 0.72(p<0.001), 0.47(p<0.001), 0.56(p<0.001), and 0.39(p = 0.045) higher total physical activity, fruits, vegetables, seafood, and water scores respectively for the intervention group over the control group. The intervention was also significant in reducing -0.15(p<0.001),-0.23(p<0.001),-0.50(p<0.001),-0.32(p<0.001),-0.90(p<0.001),-0.87(p<0.001),-0.38(p<0.001), -0.63(p<0.001), -1.63(p<0.001), 0.61(p<0.001), and -1.53(p = 0.005) carbohydrates, fats and oils, fried eggs, fried chicken, carbonated drinks, sugar, sweet snacks, salted fish, weight, BMI, and diastolic BP. The odds of quitting alcohol use in the intervention group were 1.06 times more than the control group. There was no significant effect on reducing smoking and systolic BP.There is an urgent need for the intervention program to be integrated into the existing curriculum structure of secondary school schools. Implementing the intervention will allow for longer and more consistent impact on the reduction of CVD risk factors among secondary school students."
https://openalex.org/W3213286730,"Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been applied in epidemiological surveillance studies of insect vectors of parasitic diseases, such as the Dengue's mosquitoes. However, regarding mollusks, vectors of important worldwide helminth diseases such as schistosomiasis, fascioliasis and angiostrongyliasis, NIRS studies are rare. This work proposes to establish and standardize the procedure of data collection and analysis using NIRS applied to medical malacology, i.e., to mollusk vectors identifications. Biomphalaria shells and live snails were analyzed regarding several operational aspects, such as: moisture, shell side and position of the live animal for acquisition of NIR spectra. Representative spectra of Biomphalaria shells and live snails were collected using an average of 50 scans per sample and resolution of 16 cm-1. For shells, the sample should first be dried for a minimum of 15 days at an average temperature of 26±1°C, and then placed directly in the equipment measurement window with its left side facing the light beam. Live animals should be dried with absorbent paper; placed into a glass jar, and analyzed similarly to the shells. Once standardized, the technique was applied aiming at two objectives: identification of Biomphalaria using only the shells and parasitological diagnosis for Schistosoma mansoni infection. The discrimination of the three Biomphalaria species intermediate hosts of S. mansoni only by shell has technical limit due to the scarcity of organic material. Nevertheless, it was possible to differentiate B. straminea from B. tenagophila and B. glabrata with 96% accuracy. As for the parasitological diagnosis, it was possible to differentiate infected mollusks shedding S. mansoni cercariae from the non-infected ones with 82, 5% accuracy. In conclusion, the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR's) technique has proven to be an innovative and sound tool to detect infection by S. mansoni in the different species of Biomphalaria intermediate hosts."
https://openalex.org/W3213847840,"Although recent clinical guidelines do allow primary radiotherapy for selected patients with early-stage oral tongue cancer, there has been little knowledge on the treatment outcomes of non-operative radiotherapy using modern treatment techniques. This study evaluated recent prognostic differences between primary radiotherapy and surgical resection in T1‒2N0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma.Patients diagnosed with T1‒2N0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After propensity score matching, the disease-specific survival of primary radiotherapy and surgery was compared.From a total of 8,458 patients initially identified, we defined matched cohorts: cohort A, comparing surgery alone vs. primary radiotherapy (n = 230 vs. 230), and cohort B, comparing surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy vs. primary radiotherapy (n = 230 vs. 230). The 7-year disease-specific survival rates were 77% vs. 35% (cohort A) and 65% vs. 35% (cohort B) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Primary radiotherapy was independently associated with worse disease-specific survival in both cohorts A (hazard ratio 4.06; 95% confidence interval 2.53‒6.52) and B (hazard ratio 2.81; 95% confidence interval 1.96‒4.04). Time-course hazard rate function plots showed a distinct short-term risk increment in disease-specific mortality in the primary radiotherapy group.In the contemporary treatment era, the use of radiotherapy as a definitive treatment resulted in an inferior prognosis in patients with T1‒2N0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. The present population-based data suggest that primary radiotherapy cannot be used as an alternative to surgical management and it needs to be avoided as much as possible in early-stage tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3214371476,"This study establishes a new method for estimating the monthly Average Population Present (APP) in Australian regions. Conventional population statistics, which enumerate people where they usually live, ignore the significant spatial mobility driving short term shifts in population numbers. Estimates of the temporary or ambient population of a region have several important applications including the provision of goods and services, emergency preparedness and serve as more appropriate denominators for a range of social statistics. This paper develops a flexible modelling framework to generate APP estimates from an integrated suite of conventional and novel data sources. The resultant APP estimates reveal the considerable seasonality in small area populations across Australia’s regions alongside the contribution of domestic and international visitors as well as absent residents to the observed monthly variations. The modelling framework developed in the paper is conceived in a manner such that it can be adapted and re-deployed both for use with alternative data sources as well as other situational contexts for the estimation of temporary populations."
https://openalex.org/W3214672930,"To investigate the effect of systemic administration of salicylate as a tinnitus inducing drug in the auditory cortex of guinea pigs.Extracellular recording of spikes of the primary auditory cortex and dorsocaudal areas in healthy male albino Hartley guinea pigs was continuously performed (pre- and post-salicylate).We recorded 160 single units in the primary auditory cortex from five guinea pigs and 156 single units in the dorsocaudal area from another five guinea pigs. The threshold was significantly elevated after the administration of salicylate in both the primary auditory cortex and dorsocaudal areas. The Q10dB value was significantly increased in the primary auditory cortex, whereas it has significantly decreased in the dorsocaudal area. Spontaneous firing activity was significantly decreased in the primary auditory cortex, whereas it has significantly increased in the dorsocaudal area.Salicylate induces significant changes in single units of both stimulated and spontaneous activity in the auditory cortex of guinea pigs. The spontaneous activity changed differently depending on its cortical areas, which may be due to the neural elements that generate tinnitus."
