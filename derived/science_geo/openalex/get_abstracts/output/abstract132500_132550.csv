https://openalex.org/W2008632158,"Adaptive thermogenesis is an important component of energy homeostasis and a metabolic defense against obesity. We have cloned a novel transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors, termed PGC-1, from a brown fat cDNA library. PGC-1 mRNA expression is dramatically elevated upon cold exposure of mice in both brown fat and skeletal muscle, key thermogenic tissues. PGC-1 greatly increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and the thyroid hormone receptor on the uncoupling protein (UCP-1) promoter. Ectopic expression of PGC-1 in white adipose cells activates expression of UCP-1 and key mitochondrial enzymes of the respiratory chain, and increases the cellular content of mitochondrial DNA. These results indicate that PGC-1 plays a key role in linking nuclear receptors to the transcriptional program of adaptive thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2079698171,"Bacteria in nature often exist as sessile communities called biofilms. These communities develop structures that are morphologically and physiologically differentiated from free-living bacteria. A cell-to-cell signal is involved in the development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. A specific signaling mutant, a lasI mutant, forms flat, undifferentiated biofilms that unlike wild-type biofilms are sensitive to the biocide sodium dodecyl sulfate. Mutant biofilms appeared normal when grown in the presence of a synthetic signal molecule. The involvement of an intercellular signal molecule in the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms suggests possible targets to control biofilm growth on catheters, in cystic fibrosis, and in other environments where P. aeruginosa biofilms are a persistent problem."
https://openalex.org/W2067817921,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulator of angiogenesis, binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1. We now describe the purification and the expression cloning from tumor cells of a third VEGF receptor, one that binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121. This isoform-specific VEGF receptor (VEGF165R) is identical to human neuropilin-1, a receptor for the collapsin/semaphorin family that mediates neuronal cell guidance. When coexpressed in cells with KDR, neuropilin-1 enhances the binding of VEGF165 to KDR and VEGF165-mediated chemotaxis. Conversely, inhibition of VEGF165 binding to neuropilin-1 inhibits its binding to KDR and its mitogenic activity for endothelial cells. We propose that neuropilin-1 is a novel VEGF receptor that modulates VEGF binding to KDR and subsequent bioactivity and therefore may regulate VEGF-induced angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027775552,"Recombinant v- and t-SNARE proteins reconstituted into separate lipid bilayer vesicles assemble into SNAREpins—SNARE complexes linking two membranes. This leads to spontaneous fusion of the docked membranes at physiological temperature. Docked unfused intermediates can accumulate at lower temperatures and can fuse when brought to physiological temperature. A supply of unassembled v- and t-SNAREs is needed for these intermediates to form, but not for the fusion that follows. These data imply that SNAREpins are the minimal machinery for cellular membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1983751803,"The INK4a-ARF locus encodes two unrelated proteins that both function in tumor suppression. p16INK4 binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK4 and CDK6, and ARF arrests the cell cycle in a p53-dependent manner. We show here that ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the exon 1beta-encoded N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal region of MDM2. ARF-promoted MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 modification and concurrent p53 stabilization and accumulation. The functional consequence of ARF-regulated p53 levels via MDM2 proteolysis is evidenced by the ability of ectopically expressed ARF to restore a p53-imposed G1 cell cycle arrest that is otherwise abrogated by MDM2. Thus, deletion of the ARF-INK4a locus simultaneously impairs both the INK4a-cyclin D/CDK4-RB and the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2039463309,"The INK4a gene encodes two distinct growth inhibitors—the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16Ink4a, which is a component of the Rb pathway, and the tumor suppressor p19Arf, which has been functionally linked to p53. Here we show that p19Arf potently suppresses oncogenic transformation in primary cells and that this function is abrogated when p53 is neutralized by viral oncoproteins and dominant-negative mutants but not by the p53 antagonist MDM2. This finding, coupled with the observations that p19Arf and MDM2 physically interact and that p19Arf blocks MDM2-induced p53 degradation and transactivational silencing, suggests that p19Arf functions mechanistically to prevent MDM2's neutralization of p53. Together, our findings ascribe INK4a's potent tumor suppressor activity to the cooperative actions of its two protein products and their relation to the two central growth control pathways, Rb and p53."
https://openalex.org/W1990204893,"Recognition of an avirulent pathogen stimulates an oxidative burst generating O2− and H2O2, and these reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) cue the induction of defense genes and cell death in the development of a restricted lesion. This localized hypersensitive response (HR) is accompanied by the development of systemic acquired resistance to virulent pathogens. Here we show that inoculation of Arabidopsis leaves with avirulent Pseudomonas syringae induces secondary oxidative bursts in discrete cells in distant tissues, leading to low-frequency systemic micro-HRs. The primary oxidative burst induces these systemic responses, and both the primary burst and the secondary microbursts are required for systemic immunity. Hence, ROIs mediate a reiterative signal network underlying systemic as well as local resistance responses."
https://openalex.org/W1966300079,"Smad proteins transmit TGFbeta signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Here we analyze Smad2 mutant embryos created using ES cell technology. Smad2 function is not required for mesoderm production per se, but, rather unexpectedly, in the absence of Smad2 the entire epiblast adopts a mesodermal fate giving rise to a normal yolk sac and fetal blood cells. In contrast, Smad2 mutants entirely lack tissues of the embryonic germ layers. Smad2 signals serve to restrict the site of primitive streak formation and establish anterior-posterior identity within the epiblast. Chimera experiments demonstrate these essential activities are contributed by the extraembryonic tissues. Thus, the extraembryonic tissues play critical roles in establishing the body plan during early mouse development."
https://openalex.org/W2022572800,"Secretory proteins are cotranslationally translocated across the mammalian ER membrane through an aqueous pore in the translocon while the permeability barrier is maintained by a tight ribosome-membrane junction. The lumenal end of the pore is also blocked early in translocation. Extraction of soluble lumenal proteins from microsomes and reconstitution with purified proteins demonstrate, by fluorescence collisional quenching, that BiP seals the lumenal end of this pore. BiP also seals translocons that are assembled but are not engaged in translocation. These ribosome-free translocons have smaller pores (9-15 A diameter versus 40-60 A in functioning translocons) and are generated when ribosomes dissociate from functioning translocons with large pores. BiP therefore maintains the permeability barrier by sealing both nontranslocating and newly targeted translocons."
https://openalex.org/W2319007677,"The expression of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA de novo, is suppressed in normal somatic human cells but is reactivated during tumorigenesis. This reactivation appears to arrest the normal loss of telomeric DNA incurred as human cells divide. Since continual loss of telomeric DNA is predicted to eventually limit cell proliferation, activation of telomerase in cancer cells may represent an important step in the acquisition of the cell immortalization which occurs during tumor progression. The telomerase holoenzyme is composed of both RNA and protein subunits. In humans, mRNA expression of hTERT (hEST2), the candidate telomerase catalytic subunit gene, appears to parallel the levels of telomerase enzyme activity, suggesting that induction of hTERT is necessary and perhaps sufficient for expression of telomerase activity in tumor cells. To test this model directly, we ectopically expressed an epitope-tagged version of hTERT in telomerase-negative cells and show that telomerase activity was induced to levels comparable to those seen in immortal telomerase-positive cells and that the expressed hTERT protein was physically associated with the cellular telomerase activity. We conclude that synthesis of the hTERT telomerase subunit represents the rate-limiting determinant of telomerase activity in these cells and that this protein, once expressed, becomes part of the functional telomerase holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1937783148,"A novel protein complex has been identified in human cells that has a molecular mass of approximately 450 kDa. It consists of at least eight different subunits including JAB1, the Jun activation-domain binding protein 1, and Trip15, the thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 15. The purified complex contains COP9 and COP11 protein homologs and is very similar, if not identical, to the plant COP9 complex involved in light-mediated signal transduction. The isolated JAB1-containing particle has kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, the carboxy terminus of p105, and Ser63 and/or Ser73 of the amino-terminal activation domain of c-Jun. The phosphorylation of c-Jun requires the carboxy terminus of the protein containing the DNA binding and dimerization domains. Three subunits of the new complex--Sgn3, Sgn5/JAB1, and Sgn6--exhibit sequence similarities to regulatory components of the 26S proteasome, which could indicate the existence of common substrate binding sites. Immunofluorescence staining reveals that the new complex shows a subcellular distribution similar to that of the 26S proteasome. The functional relationship of the two particles in regulating transcriptional activity is discussed. Considering the putative role of the complex in signal transduction and its widespread occurrence, we suggest the name JAB1-containing signalosome."
https://openalex.org/W1685518911,"Cells induced to apoptosis extrude glutathione in the reduced form concomitantly with (U937 cells) or before (HepG2 cells) the development of apoptosis, much earlier than plasma membrane leakage. Two specific inhibitors of carrier-mediated GSH extrusion, methionine or cystathionine, are able to decrease apoptotic GSH efflux across the intact plasma membrane, demonstrating that in these cell systems GSH extrusion occurs via a specific mechanism. While decreasing GSH efflux, cystathionine or methionine also decrease the extent of apoptosis. They fail to exert anti-apoptotic activity in cells previously deprived of GSH, indicating that the target of the protection is indeed GSH efflux. The cells rescued by methionine or cystathionine remained viable after removal of the apoptogenic inducers and were even able to replicate. This shows that a real rescue to perfect viability and not just a delay of apoptosis is achieved by forcing GSH to stay within the cells during apoptogenic treatment. All this evidence indicates that extrusion of reduced glutathione precedes and is responsible for the irreversible morphofunctional changes of apoptosis, probably by altering the intracellular redox state without intervention of reactive oxygen species, thus giving a rationale for the development of redox-dependent apoptosis under anaerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2066123272,"unc-73 is required for cell migrations and axon guidance in C. elegans and encodes overlapping isoforms of 283 and 189 kDa that are closely related to the vertebrate Trio and Kalirin proteins, respectively. UNC-73A contains, in order, eight spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl/Pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) element, an SH3-like domain, a second DH/PH element, an immunoglobulin domain, and a fibronectin type III domain. UNC-73B terminates just downstream of the SH3-like domain. The first DH/PH element specifically activates the Rac GTPase in vitro and stimulates actin polymerization when expressed in Rat2 cells. Both functions are eliminated by introducing the S1216F mutation of unc-73(rh40) into this DH domain. Our results suggest that UNC-73 acts cell autonomously in a protein complex to regulate actin dynamics during cell and growth cone migrations."
https://openalex.org/W2080318925,"The expression of several genes involved in intra- and extracellular lipid metabolism, notably those involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, is mediated by ligand-activated receptors, collectively referred to as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). To gain more insight into the control of expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) genes, which are regulated by fatty acids, we have examined the transcriptional regulation of the human MCPT I gene.

CPT I, the outer membrane component of this system, is the main control point in the β-oxidation pathway. CPT I is thus a suitable site for pharmacological control of fatty acid oxidation in conditions such as diabetes or heart diseases. Two isoforms of CPT I have been described, which have been designated LCPT I and MCPT I since these isoforms are mainly expressed in liver and muscle respectively. The MCPT I gene is expressed not only in skeletal muscle but also in heart and brown and white adipose tissue (1Weiss B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol.

This expression pattern may be of great significance since fatty acids are a major source of energy for heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue.

We have amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the 5′ region of the human heart and brown adipose tissue CPT I gene and demonstrate, first, the transcriptional activity of this fragment and, second, the presence of a PPRE in the 5′-flanking region of this gene. In CV1 cells, the activation of the CPT I gene by PPAR was dependent on the addition of exogenous ligands. pCPTCAT, containing an 882-base pair fragment of the human MCPT I gene, was constructed by the application of the PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers, CPTF (5′-CCTGGCTGCAGCTTAGAATAA) and CPTR (5′-GGAGTTGATCCCAGACAGG TAGAC), corresponding to coordinates −909 to −889 and +126 to +92, respectively, of the human MCPT I gene (12Yamazaki N. Yamanka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and human genomic DNA as a template. The PstI-AvrII-digested PCR product was cloned into the PstI-XbaI sites of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector pCAT-BASIC reporter gene (Promega). To confirm the sequence, the PCR-amplified fragment was automatically sequenced using the fluorescent terminator kit (Perkin-Elmer). Heterologous promoter plasmids were constructed in the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene promoter upstream of the CAT reporter gene pBLCAT2 (13Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). pTKCATCPT contains a fragment corresponding to coordinates −774 to −755 of the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase gene. It was constructed by cloning the oligonucleotide 5′-agctTGACCTTTTCCCTACATTTG annealed to 5′-tcgaCAAATGTAGGGAAAAGGTCA into pBLCAT2 (nucleotides designated in lowercase were added to provide cohesive HindIII-SalI ends at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively). The insert in this plasmid had the same 5′ → 3′ orientation as found in the human MCPT I gene promoter. DNA sequence analysis, by the fluorescent terminator kit was performed to confirm insert orientation. CV1 cells were cultured in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were typically cotransfected with 10 μg of the reporter MCPT I-CAT gene construct and, when indicated, with 1 μg of effector plasmids expressing full-length cDNAs for mouse PPARα, PPARγ2, or PPARδ. 4 μg of plasmid pRSVβGAL (Rous sarcoma virus promoter β-galactosidase) was included as internal control in cotransfections. Transfection experiments were carried out by the calcium-phosphate method as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). After removal of the calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitate, cells were re-fed with medium supplemented with 10% delipidated calf serum. Experiments with ligand included either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide or ethyl alcohol) or ligand (10 μm PGJ2 (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2), 30 μm LY-171883, or 30 μm linoleic acid). All ligands used were from Sigma. Cells were harvested 48 h after re-feeding. Extracts of harvested cells were prepared by liquid nitrogen freeze/thaw disruption (three times) after resuspension in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. β-Galactosidase activity was determined (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar) in a 10–20-μl volume of extract to normalize for transfection efficiency. All samples assayed for CAT activity were first incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. CAT assays were performed (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 9.1.4-9.1.6Google Scholar) for 60 min. Radioactivity of samples was measured on an LKB-1217 liquid scintillation counter. cDNAs for the receptors (mouse PPARα, PPARγ2, PPARδ, and human RXRα) were transcribed and translated by using a commercially available kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). 2 μl of mPPARα, mPPARγ, and mPPARδ with or without hRXRα (2 μl) synthesizedin vitro were preincubated on ice for 10 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The total amount of reticulocyte lysate was kept constant in each reaction (4 μl) by the addition of unprogrammed lysate. For competition experiments, a 25–100-fold molar excess of MCPT I PPRE or MCPT I MPPRE double-stranded probes, relative to the labeled probe, was included during preincubation. MCPT I PPRE is the fragment corresponding to coordinates −774 to −755 of the MCPT I gene, which was used to prepare pTKCATCPT. MCPT I MPPRE is the fragment corresponding to coordinates −782 to −748 of the MCPT I gene, but the nucleotides corresponding to the PPAR binding sequence have been mutated (CACATCGGTGACCctcgagggatccTTGGCTATTT, nucleotides described in lowercase correspond to those that have been changed from the wild type sequence). Next, 2 ng of MCPT I PPRE, 32P-labeled by fill-in with Klenow polymerase, was added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature. The final volume for all reactions was 20 μl. Samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PPAR α, γ, and δ bind to the MCPT I PPRE as heterodimers with RXR. To elucidate the control of CPT I gene expression by fatty acids, we have examined the transcriptional regulation of CPT I genes. A BLAST search performed using the NCBI BLAST WWW Server revealed that the sequence for the human muscle type CPT I gene was included in the sequence of a BAC clone containing a part of the q arm of chromosome 22 (GenBankTM accession number U62317). The analysis of the 5′-flanking region of this gene by the TFSEARCH routine, performed using the Kyoto Center's GenomeNet WWW Server, shows the presence of a putative PPAR binding sequence upstream of exon 1A. The comparison of this sequence with the consensus sequence required for the binding of the PPAR-RXR heterodimer, as proposed by Palmer et al. (16Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M-H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16114-16121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), shows the coincidence of 17 out of 20 bases (Fig. 1). We performed gel mobility shift assays to analyze whether PPAR-RXR heterodimers bind to the putative PPAR binding sequence of the human muscle type CPT I gene. As can be seen in Fig. 2 neither PPARs nor RXR alone binds significantly to this sequence. However, incubation of this probe with a mixture of PPAR (α, β, or γ) and RXRα resulted in a prominent complex. An oligonucleotide containing a mutated PPRE was not able to compete with the wild-type probe for the formation of the complex. The binding of the three subtypes of PPAR to the MCPT I PPRE is as strong as the binding to the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase PPRE, which allows the formation of the strongest complexes for all PPAR subtypes (17Juge-Aubry C.

PPAR α, γ, and δ and RXRα were translated in vitro, incubated with the proposed CPT I PPRE labeled probe, and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Additions were as indicated on the topof the figure. Shown in panel B is a competition of the complex PPARα-RXR-PPRE with a 25–100-fold molar excess of two different unlabeled oligonucleotides: MCPT I PPRE, containing the proposed PPRE, or MCPT I MPPRE, with the proposed PPRE mutated. All isoforms of PPAR are identically competed (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of the observed binding of PPAR to the human MCPT I gene promoter on its transcriptional activity, we made constructs in which the 5′-flanking region of this gene was linked to a promoter-less bacterial CAT gene. These plasmids were introduced into cultured CV1 cells by the calcium-phosphate method, with or without an expression vector for PPARs, together with a plasmid that contains the β-galactosidase coding region driven by the SV40 promoter as a control of the efficiency of the transfection. Following transfection, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a PPAR activator, and after 48 h, the cells were harvested and CAT activity measured. As can be seen in Fig. 3 cotransfection of PPAR expression vectors lead to a marked increase in CAT activity in the presence of the PPAR activators. Surprisingly, even though PPARδ is able to bind the MCPT I PPRE in vitro, it does not activate the expression of the chimeric gene even in the presence of linoleic acid as activator. Next a pair of oligonucleotides containing the human MCPT I PPRE were inserted into pBLCAT2, a plasmid containing the CAT gene under the control of the thymidine kinase gene promoter. As can be seen in Fig. 4, this sequence conferred PPAR responsiveness to the otherwise unresponsive thymidine kinase gene promoter. The results demonstrate that this human MCPT I element is able to confer PPARα and γ responsiveness both on its natural context and on a normally unresponsive promoter. Our data provide evidence that extends the influence of PPARs in the regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. They influence not only activation, through the control of acyl-CoA synthetase (18Schoonjans K. Watanabe M. Suzuki H. Mahfoudi A. Krey G. Wahli W. Grimaldi P. Staels B. Yamamoto T. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

These results also support the suggestion that in higher organisms, as well as in bacteria and yeast, there is metabolic control of gene expression. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) affects between 5 and 20% of the population in Western industrialized societies (21Harris M.I. Diabetes Care. 1989; 12: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of NIDDM remains incompletely understood. It has recently been suggested that NIDDM may have more to do with abnormalities in fat than in carbohydrate metabolism (22McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). There is evidence that free fatty acids are an important link between obesity and insulin resistance and NIDDM (reviewed in Ref. 23Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the antidiabetic action of the thiazolidinediones (insulin sensitizers that significantly reduce glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in animal models of NIDDM and obesity) are directly mediated through binding to PPARγ and the resulting active conformation of the receptor (24Berger J.

Our hypothesis is that the transcriptional control of the muscle type CPT I gene produced by thiazolidinedione-activated PPARγ may contribute to the antidiabetic effect of these agents by controlling glucose utilization in skeletal muscle through modulation of fatty acids catabolism in such cells, and studies to examine this hypothesis are now under way.

https://openalex.org/W2076517048,"The NFKB1 gene encodes two functionally distinct proteins termed p50 and p105. p50 corresponds to the N terminus of p105 and with p65 (RelA) forms the prototypical NF-κB transcription factor complex. In contrast, p105 functions as a Rel-specific inhibitor (IκB) and has been proposed to be the precursor of p50. Our studies now demonstrate that p50 is generated by a unique cotranslational processing event involving the 26S proteasome, whereas cotranslational folding of sequences near the C terminus of p50 abrogates proteasome processing and leads to p105 production. These results indicate that p105 is not the precursor of p50 and reveal a novel mechanism of gene regulation that ensures the balanced production and independent function of the p50 and p105 proteins."

Cells isolated from CPs of the small intestine that were c-kit positive (c-kit+) but lineage markers negative (Lin-) gave rise to T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta and TCR gammadelta intestinal intraepithelial T cells after in vivo transfer or tissue engraftment into severe combined immunodeficient mice. In contrast, cells from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, which belong in the same intestinal immune compartment but lack c-kit+Lin- cells, failed to do so. These findings and results of electron microscopic analysis provide evidence of a local intestinal T cell precursor that develops in the CPs."
https://openalex.org/W1996506684,"Optical emission from individual strained indium arsenide (InAs) islands buried in gallium arsenide (GaAs) was studied. At low excitation power density, the spectra from these quantum dots consist of a single line. At higher excitation power density, additional emission lines appeared at both higher and lower energies, separated from the main line by about 1 millielectron volt. At even higher excitation power density, this set of lines was replaced by a broad emission peaking below the original line. The splittings were an order of magnitude smaller than the lowest single-electron or single-hole excited state energies, indicating that the fine structure results from few-particle interactions in the dot. Calculations of few-particle effects give splittings of the observed magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W1969779044,"We have determined the sequence of 23 peptides from bovine thioredoxin reductase covering 364 amino acid residues. The result was used to identify a rat cDNA clone (2.19 kilobase pairs), which contained an open reading frame of 1496 base pairs encoding a protein with 498 residues. The bovine and rat thioredoxin reductase sequences revealed a close homology to glutathione reductase including the conserved active site sequence (Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys). This also confirmed the identity of a previously published putative human thioredoxin reductase cDNA clone. Moreover, one peptide of the bovine enzyme contained a selenocysteine residue in the motif Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly (where SeCys represents selenocysteine). This motif was conserved at the carboxyl terminus of the rat and human enzymes, provided that TGA in the sequence GGC TGC TGA GGT TAA, being identical in both cDNA clones, is translated as selenocysteine and that TAA confers termination of translation. The 3′-untranslated region of both cDNA clones contained a selenocysteine insertion sequence that may form potential stem loop structures typical of eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence elements required for the decoding of UGA as selenocysteine. Carboxypeptidase Y treatment of bovine thioredoxin reductase after reduction by NADPH released selenocysteine from the enzyme with a concomitant loss of enzyme activity measured as reduction of thioredoxin or 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid).

Thioredoxin reductase is a dimeric enzyme with a redox-active disulfide and an FAD in each monomer, and it is a member of a larger family of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, which includes the closely related enzymes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, and mercuric ion reductase (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) 1The abbreviations used are: TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; TpR, trypanothione reductase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; SECIS, selenocysteine insertion sequence; SeCys or U, selenocysteine; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the active site disulfide in oxidized thioredoxin (Trx-S2) to give a dithiol in reduced thioredoxin (Trx-(SH)2).

Reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein-disulfide reductase catalyzing either electron transport to ribonucleotide reductase and other reductive enzymes or redox regulation of enzymes and transcription factors. Secreted thioredoxin has cytokine-like effects on certain mammalian cells (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. Björnstedt M.

Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar), and a high resolution x-ray structure shows surprisingly large differences from the other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family (8Waksman G.

Thus, the subunits of about 35 kDa are smaller than the ∼50-kDa subunits present in glutathione reductase from all species. Furthermore, the active site cysteine residues of E. coli TrxR are located in the NADPH domain and separated by two amino acids (Cys-Ala-Thr-Cys), in comparison with the active site in glutathione reductase, which is Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys and located in the FAD domain, suggesting convergent evolution (9Kuriyan J. Krishna T.S.R. Wong L. Guenther B. Pahler A. Williams Jr., C.H. Model P. Nature. 1991; 352: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The structural features of TrxR from E. coli with a high specificity for its homologous Trx are also typical for TrxR from prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes like yeast, or plants (1Williams Jr., C.H.

It has long been known that TrxR from mammalian cells has very different properties compared with that from E. coli and lower organisms (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev.

The wide substrate specificity indicates an unusual structure of the active site, which is also demonstrated by the inhibition of mammalian TrxR by several drugs in clinical use including antitumor quinones (19Mau B.-L.

Recently, two proteins from transformed human cells having thioredoxin reductase activity, a 55-kDa subunit enzyme from a Jurkat T-cell line (24Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl.

A peptide sequence from the protein purified from the human T cell line (24Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) agreed with a putative human placental TrxR cDNA sequence showing homology to glutathione reductase but not prokaryotic TrxR (26Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The putative human placental cDNA clone did not give any active enzyme, since expression inE. coli resulted in a protein of the correctMr, which, however, did not incorporate FAD (26Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have sequenced peptides from calf thymus and liver TrxR. Together with the sequence of the translated open reading frame of a rat TrxR cDNA clone, the close structural homology to glutathione reductase was evident, and the earlier published putative human cDNA clone could be confirmed. We found that a carboxyl-terminal motif containing cysteine and selenocysteine was conserved among human, rat, and bovine TrxR, and we present evidence that the carboxyl terminus is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Preliminary results have been reported (27Holmgren A. Arnér E. Åslund F. Björnstedt M. Liangwei Z. Ljung J. Nakamura H. Nikitovic D. Montagnier R. Olivier L. Pasquier C.

Recombinant human Trx was prepared as described (28Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chemicals for peptide sequencing were delivered by Perkin-Elmer, and chemicals for DNA sequencing were delivered by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All additional chemicals were of analytical grade or better, and sources have been given in previous publications (11Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Calf liver and thymus were obtained from a local slaughter house and stored frozen at −20 °C. TrxR was purified by the method described earlier (11Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) with some modifications summarized as follows. Crude extract was acidified to pH 5.0, the neutralized supernatant was fractionated with solid (NH4)2SO4, and proteins precipitated between 40 and 80% saturation were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (TE buffer). Following extensive dialysis, the sample was incubated with 2 mm DTT and applied to a column of DEAE-cellulose in TE buffer, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 mKCl. Fractions containing TrxR activity were pooled, dialyzed against TE buffer, and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl. Fractions from this chromatography that contained TrxR activity were dialyzed and applied to a Q-Sepharose column eluted with a linear 0–0.4m NaCl gradient. The enzyme was finally dialyzed against TE buffer and applied to an ω-aminohexyl-agarose column eluted with a 0–0.7 m NaCl gradient in TE buffer. This purification scheme typically resulted in 2.5 mg of homogeneous enzyme with a specific activity in DTNB reduction (3Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 12Luthman M. Holmgren A.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The selenium content of TrxR was determined on homogenous preparations from calf thymus or human placenta (28Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using 60 μg of enzyme. The method used was graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry with Zeeman background correction using a Perkin-Elmer 5000 instrument, with a commercial selenium standard and background subtraction from buffer as described by Björkmanet al. (29Björkman L. Langworth S. Lind B. Elinder C.-G. Nordberg M. J. Trace Elem. Electrolytes Health Dis. 1993; 7: 157-164PubMed Google Scholar). The generous help of Birger Lind (Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute) is acknowledged. Thioredoxin reductase (35 μg) was dissolved in 50 μl of 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and reduced in 5 mm DTT for 60 min at 37 °C. Then sulfhydryl groups were carboxymethylated in 100 mm iodoacetic acid overnight at room temperature in the dark, followed by desalting on Sephadex G-25 in TE buffer prior to automated Edman degradation using a Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). This revealed a blocked NH2 terminus. In a separate experiment, however, the enzyme was desalted only in distilled water and then incubated at room temperature for 24 h in 30% acetic acid prior to Edman degradation, which in that case gave an NH2-terminal sequence as described. Bovine TrxR (50 μg) was reduced and denatured by incubation at room temperature for 15 min in 10 mm DTT, 3 mguanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 7.5. Subsequently, alkylation was carried out by either the addition of 1 μl of vinylpyridine to 100 μl of reduced and denatured TrxR or by the addition of neutralized iodoacetic acid to a final concentration of 50 mm. The alkylation reactions were allowed to proceed during 2 h in the dark. Reduced and alkylated protein was desalted on a fast desalting (Sephadex G-25) column with the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using TE buffer as eluent and was then concentrated by centrifugation in a Microsep concentrator (Filtron, 10-kDa cut-off). Peptides were generated upon 10-fold dilution in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and incubation at 37 °C overnight with either trypsin or lysine protease at a ratio of 1:10 (protease:TrxR), in the presence of 1m guanidine hydrochloride. Peptides were separated using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system with a C2/C18 Sephasil column and a linear gradient of 5–80% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid during 90 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Eluted peptides were detected at 215, 280, and 254 nm and fractionated by automatic peak detection using the absorbance at 215 nm. Peptides were then analyzed by peptide sequencing on a Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TrxR (150 μg) was dissolved in 80 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. The SH groups were carboxymethylated using 300 nmol of iodoacetic acid overnight in the dark at room temperature. The carboxymethylated enzyme was desalted by gel filtration (Fast desalting PC 3.2/10 column). To this protein solution was added 720 nmol of NADPH. After an additional 15 min of incubation, the nascent SH groups were derivatized with 250 nmol of 4-vinylpyridine for 4 h at room temperature in the dark. The mixture was desalted again, and 5 μl of endoproteinase Lys-C (2 μg/μl) was added. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C overnight. After the addition of another 5 μl of endoproteinase Lys-C and an additional incubation for 2 h, the resulting peptides were separated on a μRPC (C2/C18; SC2.1/10) column with the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 190 min at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The Edman procedure was used for analyzing the peptides on a Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Carboxypeptidase Y (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and stored for no more than 24 h at −20 °C prior to use to avoid autodigestion. EDTA was included to inhibit possible contaminant activities of yeast protease A or aminopeptidase. TrxR activity was determined as the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5 mm DTNB or 5 μm human Trx and insulin disulfides by previously developed methods (12Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). One unit of TrxR activity is defined as the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH min−1 at 25 °C (12Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To determine the time course of TrxR inactivation by carboxypeptidase Y, 2.7 μg of calf liver TrxR was preincubated with 8 nmol of NADPH in 10 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 10 μl. To the reduced enzyme, 1 μl of carboxypeptidase Y (1 mg/ml) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (2.5 μl) were removed at various times and assayed for catalytic activity. Control incubations were identical except that carboxypeptidase and/or NADPH was not included. Calf liver TrxR (108 μg) was diluted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.0, with 320 nmol of NADPH in a final volume of 380 μl. After preincubation for 30 min at room temperature, 20 μl of carboxypeptidase Y (1 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h, 60-μl aliquots were withdrawn and stored at −20 °C. To monitor the effect of digestion, 0.5-μl aliquots from each sample were taken for analysis of TrxR activity, as described above. This showed that no more than 60% inactivation had occurred up to 24 h of incubation, and therefore an additional 10-μl carboxypeptidase Y was added to each 60-μl aliquot, and incubation was continued at 37 °C, for each of the samples for the same time period as before the second addition of carboxypeptidase Y, i.e. 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h. These incubations were again terminated by moving the samples to −20 °C. For analysis of amino acids released after carboxypeptidase Y digestion, protein was removed from the low molecular weight fraction. To do this and to stop further digestion, samples were thawed and centrifuged in Millipore Ultrafree-MC filters (10-kDa cut-off). The filtrates containing buffer, salts, and released amino acid residues were lyophilized, 7 μl of 0.5 m DTT was added, and then the samples were subjected to amino acid analysis with ion exchange chromatography and ninhydrin derivatization using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech 4151 Alpha Plus analyzer. Standard amino acids were analyzed under the same conditions. Using part of a bovine TrxR peptide with a unique amino acid sequence (KVMVLDFVTPTPLGTRCG), a rat cDNA clone was identified in GenBankTM searches as coding for rat thioredoxin reductase, 2N. H.

Sequence determination of the complete insert was carried out using an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (A.L.F., Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to protocols from the manufacturer, with subsequent primers based on the new sequence data. We started structural studies of bovine (11Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (12Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) thioredoxin reductase several years ago with the aim of cloning the enzyme and to explain its unique structural characteristics (27Holmgren A. Arnér E. Åslund F. Björnstedt M. Liangwei Z. Ljung J. Nakamura H. Nikitovic D. Montagnier R. Olivier L. Pasquier C. Oxidative Stress in Cancer, AIDS and Neurodegenerative Diseases. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 229-246Google Scholar). Due to the recent report of selenium in TrxR isolated from transformed human cells (24Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), we analyzed TrxR, classically purified from calf thymus (11Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine if this also contained selenium. We found that TrxR from calf thymus as well as human placenta contained 0.6 selenium atoms/58-kDa subunit, which was less than the corresponding value of 0.74 selenium atoms (24Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) or, as recently reported for TrxR from human placenta, 0.93 selenium atoms (32Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) per subunit. Since we found that human and calf TrxR contained the same amount of selenium, we continued our ongoing study of the calf enzyme, with a special emphasis on the structure of the enzyme and the significance of the selenium content for its catalytic properties. Sequence analysis of reduced and carboxymethylated TrxR from calf liver revealed a blocked NH2 terminus. Interestingly, following incubation in 30% acetic acid, an NH2-terminal sequence KDLPEPYDYDLIIIGGGSGGYD could be determined, which we later found starts four residues after the initiating methionine based on alignments to human and rat TrxR (see below). Initial sequence information of TrxR purified from calf thymus was obtained by cleavage of the enzyme with trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C followed by reverse phase HPLC and sequence determination of the resulting peptides. In total, we determined the sequence of 23 peptides, covering in total 364 reliable amino acid residues. None of these peptide sequences showed high homology with earlier determined thioredoxin reductase sequences from lower organisms. However, the close homology with glutathione reductase was evident for several of the peptides, especially to a probable glutathione reductase fromC. elegans 3J. Sulston, Z. Du, K. Thomas, R. Wilson, L. Hillier, R. Staden, N. Halloran, P. Green, J. Thierry-Mieg, L. Qiu, and S. Dear, Swiss-Prot accession number P30635. that is probably a thioredoxin reductase. The peptides also showed very high homology to the deduced amino acid sequence of a putative cDNA clone of human placental TrxR (26Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), thereby confirming this putative sequence, since all peptides were derived from purified native and enzymatically active thioredoxin reductase. In a separate experiment, we selectively derivatized residues of calf liver TrxR that were reduced by NADPH. This was done by carboxymethylation of sulfhydryl groups in the oxidized enzyme with unlabeled iodoacetic acid prior to incubation with NADPH and with subsequent alkylation of NADPH-dependently reduced residues with 4-vinylpyridine. This modified enzyme was then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Using this approach, several peptides labeled with 4-vinylpyridine could be detected by increased absorption at 254 nm (Fig. 1). One of these peptides (Fig. 1,peak A) had the determined sequence VMVLDFVTPTPLGTRCGLGGTCVNVGCIP. The COOH-terminal part of this peptide is identical to the active site of glutathione reductase, Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Both Cys residues had been derivatized with 4-vinylpyridine, indicating that only after incubation with NADPH were the nascent sulfhydryl groups susceptible to alkylation. In the oxidized enzyme, a disulfide would be present. The unique NH2-terminal part of this peptide, not homologous to glutathione reductase or other enzymes of this family, was subsequently used to identify a rat TrxR cDNA clone (see below). A second peptide selectively labeled with 4-vinylpyridine upon incubation with NADPH (Fig. 1, peak C) had the sequence RSGGNILQTGCXG, where X represents a pyridylethylated uncommon amino acid, eluting immediately after the standard for proline in the amino acid sequencing. The cysteine immediately before X was also pyridylethylated, showing that both this cysteine residue and the X residue were made accessible for alkylation by incubation of the enzyme with NADPH.

A C-terminal catalytic domain, Topo(81-314), suffices for transesterification chemistry. The domain contains a constellation of five amino acids, conserved in all eukaryotic type IB topoisomerases, that catalyzes attack of the tyrosine nucleophile on the scissile phosphate. The structure of the catalytic domain, consisting of ten alpha helices and a three-strand beta sheet, resembles the catalytic domains of site-specific recombinases that act via a topoisomerase IB-like mechanism. The topoisomerase catalytic pentad is conserved in the tertiary structures of the recombinases despite scant sequence similarity overall. This implies that the catalytic domains of type IB topoisomerases and recombinases derive from a common ancestral strand transferase."

Interestingly, Skn7, a yeast two-component protein, shows genetic interactions with the PKC1 pathway and exhibits several properties that suggest that it too may be a Rho1 effector (31Brown J.L. North S. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Brown J.L. Bussey H. Stewart R.C.

Sequence elements involved in the interaction between Rho family GTPases and their effectors are of considerable interest since their definition should permit the identification of further potential effector proteins. The first such motif to be identified was the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif, which specifies interaction with Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, and has the consensus sequence ISXPX2 or 3FXHX2(H/T)(V/A)(G/D/Q) (34Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). A second motif, REM-1 (Rho effector motif class 1), is found in the N-terminal Rho-binding domains of the RhoA effectors PKN/PRK1, PRK2, Rhotekin, and Rhophilin and has the consensus (L/I/F)X2(E/K)X2(V/I/L)X2GX(E/K/R)(N/R/Q) (9Watanabe G.

REM-1 appears specific for RhoA, although PRK2 has also been reported to bind Rac1 (8Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the REM-1 motif is reiterated three times at the N terminus of the PKN/PRK kinases, only a single copy is found in Rhophilin and Rhotekin. REM-1 motifs appear to differ in their ability to discriminate between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RhoA. 2Flynn, P., Mellor, H., Palmer, R., Panayotou, G., and Parker, P. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273,2698–2705. No sequence motifs common to other RhoA effectors have been identified, although the defined Rho-binding regions of Citron, Kinectin, and the ROCKs are all found in regions of extended α-helical coiled-coil structure. To identify potential RhoA effectors, we conducted a two-hybrid screen with RhoA.V14 as a bait. In addition to ROCK-I, we identified cDNAs encoding Kinectin, a p140 mDia-related protein, and the mouse homolog of the NET1 GEF. Comparison of the ROCK-I and Kinectin sequences revealed a short region of sequence homology that is both required for and sufficient for interaction with RhoA and Cdc42. A similar sequence is found in both heterotrimeric G protein β subunits and the yeast Skn7 protein and is also required for the interaction of these proteins with RhoA. In addition to defining a RhoA interaction domain, the ROCK-I/Kinectin homology region is required for the function of Skn7in vivo, consistent with the notion that Skn7 represents a novel Rho effector.

For the two-hybrid screen, yeast strain HF7c carrying pGBT9-RhoA.V14/S190 was used in conjunction with a mouse T-helper cell cDNA library in pSE1107 (39Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). 4 million tranformants were plated onto selective plates lacking histidine and grown for 3 days at 30 °C. Colonies were rescreened for expression of the lacZ marker after lifting onto nitrocellulose filters (38Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 to 50 ml, grown for 3 h, then lysed by sonication in 5 ml of RB (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2) with protease inhibitors, adsorbed to 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and washed extensively. RhoA.WT-9E10 and Cdc42.WT-9E10 proteins were released by overnight incubation with thrombin (5 units; Sigma) at 4 °C in RB; thrombin was removed by adsorption to p-aminobenzamidine-Sepharose 6B (0.5 ml; Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) or by comparison to known standards on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Equimolar amounts of each GST-fusion protein (∼100–300 ng) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 10 ng of GTPγS- or GDP-loaded RhoA.WT-9E10 or Cdc42.WT-9E10 at 4 °C for 2 h, with agitation, in RB containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were them washed in ice-cold RB, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and bound GTPase was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following fractionation by SDS-PAGE, GTPases were detected by immunoblotting with the 9E10 antibody. We performed a two-hybrid screen for proteins that can interact with the activated form of RhoA. A fusion gene, Gal4-RhoA.V14/S190, was constructed in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain is fused N-terminal to activated human RhoA (RhoA.V14), carrying an additional mutation at its C terminus to destroy the CAAXmotif. Yeast HF7c cells expressing Gal4-RhoA.V14/S190 were used to screen a library of Gal4 activation domain-tagged mouse T-cell cDNA. Seven transformants exhibited Gal4-RhoA.V14/S190-dependent activation of both theHIS3 and LacZ markers in HF7c cells. The cDNAs were characterized by partial DNA sequencing (TableI). Plasmids D1, D4, and D9 carry partial cDNAs encoding the RhoA effector kinase ROCK-I (p160ROCK; Ref. 7Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Plasmids D2 and D3 carried the same partial Kinectin cDNA (20Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); interestingly, although Kinectin was previously identified as a putative RhoA effector, the cDNA fragment isolated in our screen does not overlap that isolated in the previous screen (15; see “Discussion”). Plasmid D5 carried a complete open reading frame 83% identical to the putative Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor NET1 (40Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar); functional characterization of this protein will be published elsewhere. 4A. S. Alberts and R. Treisman, manuscript in preparation. Plasmid D7 contains a cDNA related to p140 mDia, as identified in a previous screen for RhoA effector proteins (17Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) which is related to theDrosophila gene Diaphanous (41Castrillon D.H. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments described below indicated that the RhoA-binding domain of this protein is located in its N-terminal sequences; we therefore sequenced this region, which spans codons 47–257, and compared it with p140 mDia and with Drosophila Diaphanous(Fig. 1). A full characterization of this protein, to which we refer as mDia2, is currently in progress. We used the two-hybrid assay to investigate the interactions between RhoA, its yeast homolog Rho1, and human Cdc42 and the proteins identified in the screen, in each case using Gal4-GTPase fusion proteins containing activating mutations and mutated CAAX motifs. Each of the three GTPases could interact with all the proteins in the assay (Fig. 2 A). To confirm the specificity of the interactions with Cdc42, we examined interaction of an MSE55-related protein isolated in a screen for Cdc42 effectors 5A. S. Alberts, unpublished data. ; this CRIB motif-containing protein interacted with Cdc42.V12, but not RhoA.V14, in the two-hybrid assay in agreement with previous results (Fig. 2 A; Ref. 34Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid data suggest that each of the cDNAs isolated in the screen encodes a protein that can interact with activated forms of both RhoA and Cdc42. To confirm that the wild type GTPases can also interact with these proteins and to investigate whether binding is GTP-dependent, we performed in vitro binding assays. GST fusion genes carrying each potential Rho effector were constructed as follows: Kinectin-(1053–1327), ROCK-I-(831–1010), mDia2-(47–257), and mNET1-(1–595). To assess the specificity of the assay, we also tested the fusion proteins PKN-(1–511) and PAK-(1–252) which specifically bind RhoA and Cdc42, respectively (9Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 42Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Recombinant 9E10 epitope-tagged RhoA and Cdc42 proteins were purified from bacteria, loaded with either GTPγS or GDP, and incubated with equimolar amounts of the various GST fusion proteins. Following washing, bound GTPases were detected by immunoblot with the 9E10 antibody (Fig. 2 B). Binding of PKN-(1–511) and PAK-(1–252) was specific for the GTP-bound forms of RhoA and Cdc42, respectively, demonstrating that our assay conditions allow discrimination between the two GTPases (Fig. 2 B, lanes 13–16). The RhoA-binding regions from Kinectin, ROCK-I, and mDia2 bound both wild type RhoA and wild type Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–10). In contrast, although binding of mNET1 to Cdc42 was GTP-dependent, it bound RhoA.GTP and RhoA.GDP equally well (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11 and 12). Taken together with the two-hybrid data, these results show that Kinectin, ROCK-I, and mDia2 all represent potential effectors for both RhoA and Cdc42; we show elsewhere that mNET1 is a RhoA GEF4 (see “Discussion”). The RhoA effectors Rhotekin, Rhophilin, and PKN share a region of homology within their Rho-binding domains (the REM-1 motif; 14). Previous studies of the ROCK proteins have defined a short region within its C-terminal coiled-coiled region that suffices for interaction with RhoA (4Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 5Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the sequence spanning this region with the sequences of Kinectin, mDia2, and mNET1 to identify potential Rho-binding sequence motifs. Although the maximum homology between the ROCK proteins corresponds to ROCK-I residues 995–1014 (5Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) a region of substantial similarity between ROCK-I and Kinectin is found N-terminal to this, corresponding to ROCK-I residues 950–972 (Fig. 3 A). This region lies within the “leucine zipper” region of ROCK-I and is also within a coiled-coil region in Kinectin. No substantial sequence homology was found with mDia2 (data not shown). We used the homology between ROCK-I and Kinectin to screen the sequence data bases for similar sequences using the Blastp program (NCBI). Among many coiled-coil proteins identified, this search detected a second Kinectin sequence element N-terminal to that in our cDNA clone (residues 832–854) and a region at the N terminus of heterotrimeric G protein β subunits. We also observed that the sequence of the S. cerevisiae SKN7 gene, which interacts genetically with theRHO1-PKC1 pathway (31Brown J.L. North S. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Brown J.L. Bussey H. Stewart R.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5186-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merrill G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), also contains a region of similarity to the ROCK-I/Kinectin homology, again within a region predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (Fig. 3 B; see “Discussion”). These sequences are compared in Fig. 3 B. To investigate the significance of the ROCK-I/Kinectin homology, we examined its role in the interactions with RhoA and Cdc42 using both two-hybrid assays (Fig. 4) and in vitro biochemical assays (Fig. 5). To facilitate mutagenesis of ROCK-I, we examined a shorter ROCK-I fragment containing codons 831–1010, which interacts strongly with RhoA.V14 and Cdc42.V12 in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4 A, rows 1 and 2) and with GTP-loaded RhoA and Cdc42 in the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5). Sequences encompassing the homology were deleted from both ROCK-I and Kinectin, and the interactions of the resulting proteins with RhoA and Cdc42 were examined. Deletion of the homology region (codons 950–972) from ROCK-I-(831–1010) generates a protein that does not interact with RhoA or Cdc42 in either assay (ROCK-I-(831–1010)-ΔHR: Fig. 4 A, row 3; Fig. 5 A, lanes 6). Similarly deletion of the homology region from Kinectin also abolished interaction with RhoA and Cdc42 in both assays (Kinectin-(1053–1327)-ΔHR: Fig. 4 A, row 7; Fig. 4 B, row 2; Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). The ROCK-I/Kinectin homology region is therefore required for interaction of both proteins with RhoA and Cdc42.Figure 5A, the ROCK-I/Kinectin homology is necessary for in vitro interactions with RhoA.V14 and Cdc42.V12. 9E10-tagged wild type RhoA (top panel) or Cdc42 (bottom panel) were preloaded with either GTPγS or GDP. Each GTPase (10 ng) was incubated with glutathione beads carrying equimolar amounts of the indicated GST-effector fusion proteins. Proteins lacking the ROCK-I/Kinectin homology region are denoted ΔHR. Following washing, bound GTPases were eluted and fractionated by SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W1968456917,"Expression of the L-selectin adhesion molecule is rapidly down-regulated upon cell activation through proteolysis at a membrane-proximal site. Here we demonstrate that calmodulin, an intracellular calcium regulatory protein, specifically coprecipitates with L-selectin through a direct association with the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. Furthermore, calmodulin inhibitors disrupt L-selectin-dependent adhesion by inducing proteolytic release of L-selectin from the cell surface. The effects of the calmodulin inhibitors on L-selectin expression and function can be prevented by cotreatment with a hydroxamic acid–based metalloprotease inhibitor. Our results suggest a novel role for calmodulin in regulating the expression and function of an integral membrane protein through a protease-dependent mechanism. These findings may have broader implications for other cell surface proteins that also undergo regulated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1940197145,"In this study we assessed whether widely accepted risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular diseases such as lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a cholesterol-rich lipoprotein under strict genetical control, and other lipid parameters change with age. The variations of blood levels and the pathophysiological role of Lp(a) in old people, and particularly in the oldest old, are unknown. Accordingly, we measured Lp(a) levels as well as total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol (CT), and triglycerides (TG) in sera from 75 healthy centenarians, 114 randomly selected subjects under 65 years, 73 randomly selected elderly people, and 30 healthy selected elderly people. The results showed that Lp(a) serum levels did not vary by age group, including centenarians. Remarkably, one-quarter of the centenarians had high Lp(a) serum levels even though they never suffered from atherosclerosis-related diseases. At variance with young and aged people, centenarians with high Lp(a) serum levels also had high plasma concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, suggesting that genetic control of the Lp(a) serum level may attenuate with age and that environmental factors such as chronic subclinical inflammatory processes may play a role. We also showed that most centenarians are paradoxically characterized by low HDL-CT and relatively high TG levels, which together are considered to be strong risk factors for coronary heart disease. On the whole, these data support the hypothesis that a continuous and complex reshaping of lipid metabolism occurs in physiological aging, likely contributing to successful aging.—Baggio, G., Donazzan, S., Monti, D., Mari, D., Martini, S., Gabelli, C., Dalla Vestra,M., Previato, L., Guido, M., Pigozzo, S., Cortella, I., Crepaldi, G., Franceschi, C.

https://openalex.org/W2047871075,"Adenovirus E1A proteins immortalize primary animal cells and cooperate with several other oncogenes in oncogenic transformation. These activities are primarily determined by the N-terminal half (exon 1) of E1A. Although the C-terminal half (exon 2) is also essential for some of these activities, it is dispensable for cooperative transformation with the activated T24 rasoncogene. Exon 2 negatively modulates in vitrocooperative transformation with T24 ras as well as the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of transformed cells. A short C-terminal sequence of E1A governs the oncogenesis-restraining activity of exon 2. This region of E1A binds with a cellular phosphoprotein, CtBP, through a 5-amino acid motif, PLDLS, conserved among the E1A proteins of human adenoviruses. To understand the mechanism by which interaction between E1A and CtBP results in tumorigenesis-restraining activity, we searched for cellular proteins that complex with CtBP. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a 125-kDa protein, CtIP, that binds with CtBP through the PLDLS motif. E1A exon 2 peptides that contain the PLDLS motif disrupt the CtBP-CtIP complex.

Our results suggest that the tumorigenesis-restraining activity of E1A exon 2 may be related to the disruption of the CtBP-CtIP complex through the PLDLS motif. Small DNA tumor viruses such as human adenoviruses and papilloma viruses encode powerful transforming genes. The products of these viral oncogenes subvert host cell cycle control by binding to specific cellular proteins. Among the transforming genes of various DNA tumor viruses, the E1a gene region of human adenoviruses has been studied most extensively and serves as a prototypical oncogene. TheE1a gene of human adenovirus types 2 and 5 encodes two major proteins of 289 and 243 amino acids (289R and 243R). Both proteins contain two exons and are identical except for the presence of an internal 46-amino acid region unique to the 289R protein. While the 289R protein is required for productive viral infection, the 243R protein encodes all the transforming functions. Exon 1 plays a dominant role in controlling the cell proliferation and transforming activities governed by the E1A proteins. Exon 1 controls these activities by modulating cellular gene expression through interaction with cellular growth-regulatory proteins such as the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and related proteins (p107 and p130) as well as p300, a CREB binding protein-related transcription factor (reviewed in Refs. 1Fattaey A. Helin K. Harlow E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Nevins J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

One of the functional domains of exon 1 encompasses two regions, conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2). These regions are responsible for interactions between E1A and the cellular proteins pRb, p107, and p130, which cause these cellular proteins to release the E2F transcription factor, thus activating gene expression. A second functional domain, encompassing CR1 and the N terminus of E1A, interacts with a transcriptional adapter p300 implicated in transcriptional repression of certain genes. One of the modes by which interaction of E1A with p300 modulates transcription appears to involve disruption of a complex of p300 with a cellular acetyl transferase, P/CAF, which regulates transcription by chromatin remodeling (4Yang X.-J. Ogrysko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Like exon 1, exon 2 is also required for immortalization of primary cells (5Subramanian T. LaRegina M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 415-520PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quinlan M.P. Douglas J.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2020-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cooperative transformation with E1B (7Subramanian T. Malstrom S.E. Chinnadurai G.

Although exon 2 is not essential for cooperative transformation with the activated T24 ras oncogene, it significantly influences the extent of oncogenic transformation. Deletions within the C-terminal 67 amino acids of the E1A 243R protein enhance E1A/T24 rascooperative transformation (5Subramanian T. LaRegina M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 415-520PubMed Google Scholar, 9Douglas J.L. Gopalakrishnan S. Quinlan M.P.

Oncogene. 1989; 4: 415-520PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, exon 2 also plays a role in tumor metastasis. Expression of wt E1A efficiently suppresses the metastatic potential of tumor cells (10Pozzatti R. Muschel R. Williams J. Padmanabhan R. Howard B. Liotta L. Khoury G. Science. 1986; 232: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Pozzatti R. McCormick M. Thompson M.A. Khoury G. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, cells expressing E1A proteins that lack the C-terminal 67 amino acids are highly metastatic (5Subramanian T. LaRegina M. Chinnadurai G.

Thus, exon 2 appears to negatively modulate in vitro transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. We have localized these activities of exon 2 within a 14-amino acid region (residues 225 to 238) near the C terminus of the 243R protein (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These transformation-restraining activities of the C-terminal region of E1A correlate with the interaction of a 48-kDa cellular phosphoprotein termed CtBP (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). CtBP binds to E1A via a 5-amino acid motif, PLDLS (residues 233–237 of Ad2/5 243R protein). Amino acid substitution mutants within this motif of E1A abolish complex formation with CtBP (15Schaeper U.

These results suggest that interaction of CtBP with E1A results in restraining of oncogenesis. To understand the mechanism by which the C terminus of E1A mediates the oncogenesis-restraining activity in concert with CtBP, we undertook a search for cellular proteins that complex with CtBP. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a 125-kDa protein, CtIP, that binds to CtBP via the PLDLS motif. The complex between CtBP and CtIP is disrupted by E1A C-terminal peptides that contain the PLDLS motif. This screening was carried out using the yeast strain Y153 essentially as described in Ref. 16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar. A commercially available GAL4 activation domain tagged HeLa cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used as the prey. 5′ Sequences of CtIP cDNA were isolated by RACE using a commercially available kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with the CtIP specific primer AS2 (5′-gtgtcagctagaat-3′) using poly(A) RNA extracted from Raji cells as the template. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with CtIP-specific primers Cip-RACE1 (5′-ctggaataacgtcttcctcaca-3′) or Cip-RACE2 (5′-ctgctgttccctcagctgttg-3′) and anchor primers provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. Both strands of various cDNA clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.) or thefmolTM sequencing system (Promega). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Promega) transformed with pGEX-5X3, pGST-CtBP, pGST-CtIP, GST-Cter (1Fattaey A. Helin K. Harlow E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or GST-Cter (dl1135) essentially as described (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10667-10671Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads and used for protein binding studies with35S-labeled proteins (prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation) as described (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10667-10671Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In vivocoimmunoprecipitation analyses using the vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase system (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar) were carried out as described (15Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10667-10671Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For competition binding studies, soluble E1A peptides containing the C-terminal 67 residues of E1A 243R or dl1135 were prepared from immobilized GST-Cter and GST-dl1135 by cleavage with factor Xa. Beads containing 1 mg of protein were resuspended in 400 μl of factor Xa buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) containing 8 units of factor Xa (New England Biolabs) and incubated for 6–12 h at room temperature. The supernatants (containing cleaved E1A peptides) were mixed with 35S-labeled CtBP and added to GST-Cter and GST-CtIP immobilized on glutathione beads. To identify and clone cDNAs for human cellular proteins that interact with human CtBP, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening. The yeast reporter strain Y153 (16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) was transformed with the bait plasmid, pGB-CtBP (expressing the entire coding sequence of CtBP fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain) together with a GAL4 activation domain tagged HeLa cell cDNA library. Yeast transformants that were positive for activation of two reporter genes, HIS3 and E. coli lacZ, were identified from 2 × 105independent transformants. From these screenings, six different cDNA clones that interacted with CtBP were isolated. Upon further testing of these clones for interaction with a battery of heterologous baits in yeast, three clones (8, 9, and 15) were found to specifically interact only with pGB-CtBP and not with a number of heterologous protein baits (not shown). DNA sequence analysis revealed that clone 8 encoded the C terminus of a known protein, the 70-kDa subunit of the KU autoantigen involved in DNA repair (18Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones 9 and 15 were found to contain overlapping sequences of a cDNA for a novel protein. This protein, designated the CtBP-interacting protein, CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein) is characterized here. To confirm that CtIP could directly bind with CtBP, we carried out in vitro binding experiments. The open reading frame encoded by clone 15 (827 amino acids) was expressed as the GST-fusion protein (GST-CtIP). Bacterially expressed and affinity purified GST-CtIP as well as GST control proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and tested for interaction with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled CtBP. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). CtBP interacted specifically with GST-CtIP but not with GST, confirming that it could directly associate with CtIP in vitro. The DNA sequences of clone 9 and clone 15, were identical except for the presence of 153 bp of additional 5′ sequences in clone 9. A Northern blot analysis of mRNA from several human cell lines using the cDNA in clone 15 as the probe revealed a single mRNA species of 3.7 kilobases (not shown). The observed size of the mRNA appeared to be about 800 bp larger than the cDNA sequences present in clone 9. The predicted open reading frame of clone 9 and clone 15, established in relation to the coding sequence of the GAL4 activation domain, contained several stop codons at the 3′ end, suggesting that both cDNA clones encoded the carboxyl terminus of CtIP. To isolate the additional 5′-coding sequences of CtIP, we carried out 5′RACE reactions that resulted in isolation of 480 bp of 5′ cDNA sequences beyond those present in clone 9. These 5′ sequences encoded an additional 31 amino acids in-frame with the open reading frame present in clone 9. The complete cDNA sequence consists of 3247 bp and is presented in Fig. 2. Since the sequences upstream of the ATG contain several stop codons, we believe that synthesis of CtIP is initiated from the ATG codon at position 300. Thus, the complete cDNA sequence of CtIP codes for a protein of 897 amino acids (Fig. 2). Data bank searches revealed that CtIP does not share significant homology with known proteins. However, upon close examination, we found that CtIP contains a 5-amino acid motif, PLDLS. This motif is highly conserved in the E1A proteins of all human adenoviruses (Fig. 3 A). We have previously shown that CtBP binds to Ad2/5 E1A via the PLDLS motif. To determine whether the PLDLS motif of CtIP is also essential for its interaction with CtBP, we constructed a 5-amino acid substitution mutant, CtIPΔ, (PLDLS → LASQC). GST-CtIP and GST-CtIPΔ fusion proteins were tested for interaction with in vitro synthesized CtBP (Fig. 3 B). Binding of CtBP to GST-CtIPΔ was significantly reduced compared with binding with GST-CtIP, suggesting that the PLDLS sequence constitutes the CtBP binding motif of CtIP. To further substantiate the requirement of the PLDLS motif of CtIP for heterodimerization with CtBP, we also carried out in vivocoimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 C). We coexpressed CtBP (tagged with the T7 epitope) and full-length CtIP or CtIPΔ in BSC40 cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 expression system. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either T7 mAb (Novagen) or polyclonal CtIP antiserum. Immunoprecipitation with the T7 antibody revealed that wt CtIP but not CtIPΔ, which lacks the CtBP binding motif, coprecipitated with CtBP. Immunoprecipitation with the CtIP antibody also revealed coprecipitation of CtBP with CtIP wt and not with CtIPΔ. These results indicate that full-length CtIP interacts with CtBP in vivo and that the PLDLS motif is required for this interaction. Since CtIP contains the same CtBP binding motif as E1A, we investigated whether E1A would compete with CtIP for CtBP interaction. We have shown earlier that a GST fusion containing the C-terminal 67 residues of E1A (GST-Cter) can readily bind with CtBP (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We prepared soluble E1A peptides (C-terminal 67 residues) by proteolytic cleavage of immobilized GST-Cter fusion protein and utilized them in competition binding experiments. CtBP was expressed by in vitrotranscription/translation and then analyzed for binding to immobilized GST-CtIP or GST-Cter in the presence or absence of E1A C-terminal peptide competitors. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, CtBP interacted well with GST-CtIP or the E1A fusion protein, GST-Cter. However, these interactions were significantly reduced in the presence of a 200-fold molar concentration of wt E1A Cter peptide, but not the peptide from E1A mutantdl1135, which lacks the CtBP binding region (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that CtIP and E1A, which carry identical CtBP binding motifs, can compete for CtBP interaction. The molecular mechanism by which the C-terminal region of E1A exerts the oncogenesis-restraining activity is not known. However, mutational analysis indicates that this activity of E1A correlates with its ability to complex with CtBP (14Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S.T. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10667-10671Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear how this interaction leads to negative modulation of oncogenesis, identification of CtIP points to a potential molecular pathway. By analogy with the regulatory activities of exon 1, which result in disruption of protein complexes that sequester transcription factors, E2F (1Fattaey A. Helin K. Harlow E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Nevins J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 13-134Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and P/CAF (4Yang X.-J. Ogrysko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), it appears that the C-terminal region of E1A may also disrupt the CtBP-CtIP complex resulting in the release of CtIP. Characterization of the biochemical activities of CtIP would be necessary to further elucidate the mechanism of the oncogenesis-restraining activity of E1A. Since the CtBP-binding motif of E1A has been implicated in certain transcriptional regulatory activity by exon 1 (19Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is possible that CtIP may possess a transcriptional regulatory activity. However, a data bank search based on sequence properties (PROPSEARCH, Ref. 20Hobohm U. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) has revealed that CtIP may share some similarities with certain mammalian proteins involved in DNA repair. It could be envisioned that potential transcriptional regulatory and/or DNA repair activities of CtIP may play a role in the tumorigenesis-restraining activity of E1A. Our studies also suggest a potential pharmacological use for peptides containing the PLDLS motif in suppression of certain neoplastic diseases. We thank B. Elangovan for his help in data bank searches."
https://openalex.org/W2134034337,"The spontaneous fracture of polymer gels was studied. Contrary to crystalline solids, where fracture usually happens instantaneously at a well-defined breaking strength, the fracture of a polymer gel can occur with a delay. When a constant force was applied, the cracks nucleated and started to propagate after a delay that can be as long as 15 minutes, depending on the force. This phenomenon can be understood by calculating the activation energy for crack nucleation in arbitrary dimension and accounting for the inhomogeneity of the gel network in terms of its fractal dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2110397192,"Dipterous insects (the true flies) have a sophisticated pair of equilibrium organs called halteres that evolved from hind wings. The halteres are sensitive to Coriolis forces that result from angular rotations of the body and mediate corrective reflexes during flight. Like the aerodynamically functional fore wings, the halteres beat during flight and are equipped with their own set of control muscles. It is shown that motoneurons innervating muscles of the haltere receive strong excitatory input from directionally sensitive visual interneurons. Visually guided flight maneuvers of flies may be mediated in part by efferent modulation of hard-wired equilibrium reflexes."

In the monolayer, condensed domains with long-range orientational order of the lipid molecules were present. The domains revealed unexpectedly strong friction anisotropies and non-negligible friction asymmetries. The angular dependency of these effects correlated well with the tilt direction of the alkyl chains of the monolayer, as determined by electron diffraction and Brewster angle microscopy. The molecular tilt causing these frictional effects was less than 15 degrees, demonstrating that even small molecular tilts can make a major contribution to friction."

In both kingdoms an endonuclease recognizes the splice sites and releases the intron, but the mechanism of splice site recognition is different in each kingdom. The crystal structure of the endonuclease from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii was determined to a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. The structure indicates that the cleavage reaction is similar to that of ribonuclease A and the arrangement of the active sites is conserved between the archaeal and eucaryal enzymes. These results suggest an evolutionary pathway for splice site recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1502903705,"Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induces apoptosis in human macrophages (MΦ), a significant feature in atherogenesis. We found that induction of apoptosis in MΦ by oxLDL, C2-ceramide, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was associated with enhanced expression of manganese superoxide dis-mutase (MnSOD) and p53. Treatment of cells with p53 or MnSOD antisense oligonucleotides prior to stimulation with oxLDL, C2-ceramide, TNF-α, or H2O2 caused an inhibition of the expression of the respective protein together with a marked reduction of apoptosis. Exposure to N-acetylcysteine before treatment with oxLDL, C2-ceramide, TNF-α, or H2O2 reversed a decrease in cellular glutathione concentrations as well as the enhanced production of p53 and MnSOD mRNA and protein. In apoptotic macrophages of human atherosclerotic plaques, colocalization of MnSOD and p53 immunoreactivity was found. These results indicate that in oxLDL-induced apoptosis, a concomitant induction of p53 and MnSOD is critical, and suggest that it is at least in part due to an enhancement of the sphingomyelin/ ceramide pathway.—Kinscherf, R., Claus, R., Wagner, M., Gehrke, C., Kamencic, H., Hou, D., Nauen, O., Schmiedt, W., Kovacs, G., Pill, J., Metz, J., Deigner, H.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2037418958,"Human oxyhemoglobin showed a biphasic autoxidation curve containing two rate constants, i.e. kf for the fast autoxidation due to the α chains, and ks for the slow autoxidation of the β chains, respectively. Consequently, the autoxidation of the HbO2tetramer produces two different curves from the pH dependence ofkf and ks. The analysis of these curves revealed that the β chain of the HbO2tetramer does not exhibit any proton-catalyzed autoxidation, unlike the α chain, where a proton-catalyzed process involving the distal histidine residue can play a dominant role in the autoxidation rate. When the α and β chains were separated from the HbO2tetramer, however, each chain was oxidized much more rapidly than in the tetrameric parent. Moreover, the separated β chain was recovered completely to strong acid catalysis in its autoxidation rate. These new findings lead us to conclude that the formation of the α1β1 contact produces in the β chain a conformational constraint whereby the distal histidine at position 63 is tilted away slightly from the bound dioxygen, preventing the proton-catalyzed displacement of O·2 by a solvent water molecule. The β chains have thus acquired a delayed autoxidation in the HbO2 tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1482299255,"Aging is associated with neurodegenerative processes. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is also expressed in neurons, is the key enzyme in the synthesis of leukotrienes, inflammatory eicosanoids that are capable of promoting neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that neuronal 5-LO expression can be up-regulated in aging and that this may increase the brain's vulnerability to neurodegeneration. We observed differences in the distribution of 5-LO-like immunoreactivity in various brain areas of adult young (2-month-old) vs. old (24-month-old) male rats. Greater 5-LO-like immunoreactivity was found in old vs. young rats, in particular in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in limbic structures, including the hippocampus, and in layer V pyramidal cells of the frontoparietal cortex and their apical dendrites. The aging-increased expression of neuronal 5-LO protein appears to be due to increased 5-LO gene expression. Using a quantitative reverse transcription/polymer-ase chain reaction assay and 5-LO-specific oligonucleotide primers and their mutated internal standards, we observed about a 2.5-fold greater hippocampal 5-LO mRNA content in old rats. 5-LO-like immunoreactivity was also observed in small, nonpyramidal cells, which were positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase or glial fibrillary acid protein. This type of 5-LO immunostaining did not increase in the old rats. Hippocampal excitotoxic injury induced by systemic injection of kainate was greater in old rats. Neuroprotection was observed with the 5-LO inhibitor, caffeic acid. Together, these results suggest that aging increases both neuronal 5-LO expression and neuronal vulnerability to 5-LO inhibitor-sensitive ex-citotoxicity, and indicate that the 5-LO system might play a significant role in the pathobiology of aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases.—Uz, T., Pesold, C., Longone, P., Manev, H.

https://openalex.org/W2069945282,"To obviate the destructive interaction of highly reactive metallocene catalysts with classical silica-based supports while retaining the advantage of supported catalysts, a noninteracting polystyrene support was developed. Supported catalysts for the polymerization of α-olefins are prepared by treating lightly cross-linked, chloromethylated polystyrene beads consecutively with a secondary amine, an ammonium salt of a weakly coordinating anion, and a neutral dialkylmetallocene. Catalytic sites are distributed homogeneously throughout the support particle, and the polymerization occurs within the bead, in contrast to traditional surface-supported metallocene catalysts. The copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene at 40°C affords discrete spherical polyolefin beads with a size (0.3 to 1.4 millimeters) that varies according to the polymerization time."
https://openalex.org/W2065410880,"This study shows differences at the level of cell cycle arrest between the response of yeast cells to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide stress. These include both cell cycle phases at which arrest occurs and the involvement of the RAD9 checkpoint gene. Wild-type and rad9 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide or the superoxide-generating agent menadione. rad9mutants were up to 100-fold more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but not affected in their resistance to menadione. Hydrogen peroxide caused G2-phase arrest, whereas menadione-treated cells arrested in G1. G2 arrest, induced by methyl 2-benzimidazil carbamate, increased cellular resistance to hydrogen peroxide but not to menadione. G1 arrest mediated by α-factor caused an increase in survival of wild-type cells treated with menadione but not with hydrogen peroxide. A cdc28mutant arrested in G1 was significantly more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than other cdc mutants arrested in later phases, including G2. rad9 cells have normal stationary phase resistance to hydrogen peroxide, the ability to adapt to it, glutathione content and induction of genes via the stress responsive element.

Oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide or the superoxide anion causes an adaptive response in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells pretreated with a low dose of these reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; STRE, stress responsive element; MBC, methyl 2-benzimidazil carbamate. subsequently adapt to become more resistant to higher doses (1Collinson L.P.

Study of the mechanisms that lie behind this response has focused mainly on the role of antioxidant enzymes and detoxifying molecules such as glutathione. Several genes whose products either directly eliminate ROS or form part of the glutathione synthesis pathway are transcriptionally regulated by oxidative stress, e.g. CTT1 encoding cytosolic catalase,SOD1 and SOD2 encoding Cu, Zn- and Mn-superoxide dismutase respectively, GSH1 encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, GLR1 encoding glutathione reductase,TRX2 encoding thioredoxin (a scavenger of ROS), and SSA1 encoding a stress-inducible heat shock protein (4Marchler G.

Transcription factors and their target DNA sequences have been identified in genes that respond to oxidative stress: Msn2p and Msn4p function via the stress responsive element (STRE) (10Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and the Yap1p binding site resembles the SV40 AP-1 binding sequence (8Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 11Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These factors clearly play an important role in the stress response of yeast cells since S. cerevisiae mutants deleted forMSN2/4 or YAP1 are hypersensitive to various types of stress including treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Despite the fact that oxidative stress can cause damage to many cellular components including proteins, lipids, and DNA, few studies have considered the potential importance of cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage caused by hydrogen peroxide or superoxide. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage (caused by UV, x-, or γ-irradiation) by delaying cell cycle progression to allow repair of damage as well as preventing segregation of affected chromosomes. In Escherichia coli, the SOS system controls cell cycle arrest and coordinates the activation of approximately 20 genes including those involved in nucleotide excision repair, recombination and mutagenesis (12Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). An analogous system is thought to exist in S. cerevisiae, although the precise mechanism is not well understood. Checkpoints can be defined as negative controls that cause cell cycle arrest in response to cellular damage. RAD9 is the best characterized of the S. cerevisiae checkpoint genes and has been shown to act at G1, S and G2 phases (14Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7985-7989Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Paulovich A.G. Margulies R.U. Garvik B.M. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1997; 145: 45-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The molecular function of RAD9 is unknown but cells that are defective in this gene exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Treatment with the microtubule inhibitor methyl 2-benzimidazil carbamate (MBC), which blocks cells in the G2 phase, reversed this sensitivity indicating thatRAD9 functions in cell cycle arrest and is not a DNA repair enzyme (16Weinert T.A.

Curiously, however, MBC treatment did not rescuerad9 cells exposed to UV radiation, and this pointed toward a further function for RAD9 other than cell cycle arrest. Aboussekhra et al. (17Aboussekhra A. Vialard J.E. Morrison D.E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cernáková L. Fabre F. Lowndes N.F.

Neither hydrogen peroxide nor the superoxide radical can directly attack DNA (18Halliwell B. Aruoma O. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar), but DNA strand breaks arise when cells are exposed to these reagents due to the production of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (19Hoffmann M.E. Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Morrison H. Jernstrom B. Nordenskjold M. Thor H. Orrenius S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 1763-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The relative importance of the repair of this damage in the general response of yeast cells to oxidative stress remains unclear. However, slow proliferation of a S. cerevisiaemutant strain lacking Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (sod1) was due to a 2-fold increase in time spent in G1 phase (21Lee J. Romeo A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24885-24893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under 100% O2 the mutant permanently arrested in G1 due to inhibition of transcription of the autoregulated G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2. Moreover, treatment with paraquat, a superoxide-generating compound, resulted in pronounced G1 arrest in G1-synchronized yeast cells (22Nunes E. Siede W. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1996; 35: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cell cycle arrest under these circumstances was found to be independent of the RAD9 gene. This study investigated the role of RAD9 cell cycle arrest in the response to hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide-generating agent, menadione. These compounds have been shown to elicit overlapping but different responses in S. cerevisiae (2Jamieson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6678-6681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W.S. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have shown that a rad9 mutation rendered cells 10–100-fold more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but, surprisingly, did not affect resistance to menadione. Since RAD9 is involved in G1, S, and G2 arrest in response to DNA damage, arrest induced by MBC and the mating pheromone, α-factor, as well as cell cycle arrest in temperature-sensitive cdc mutants was used to investigate which checkpoint might be involved. Overall capacity of the rad9 mutant to resist oxidative stress was also studied by assessing resistance in stationary phase, glutathione levels, ability to mount an adaptive response, and transcriptional activation through STRE elements. Our results show that theRAD9 function defines a fundamental difference between the response to peroxide and superoxide stress. In addition, the acute sensitivity of the rad9 mutant to hydrogen peroxide, which is not fully rescued by MBC, indicates that a furtherrad9-dependent function as well as G2 checkpoint arrest may be important for survival during hydrogen peroxide stress. Wild-type yeast strain 7830-2-4aMATa his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 and its isogenic mutant 7833-1a MATa his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 rad9::TRP1 were a gift from L. Hartwell; Y382MATα ura3 leu2 ade2 ade3 trp1 used for flow cytometry was obtained from A. Bender; and strains carrying mutations in CDC4, CDC13, CDC16 and CDC28 each backcrossed several times to wild-type MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3 leu2-112 his3-11 his3-15 ura3 GAL psi+ or its MATαcounterpart were obtained from the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna. Cultures were incubated in rich glucose medium (YEPD: 2%d-glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or defined SD medium (2% d-glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco), 0.5% ammonium sulfate and 50 mg/liter appropriate amino acids). Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C except temperature-sensitive mutants were cultured at 23 °C before being shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C. Cells were grown overnight to an A600 of 1 at 30 °C with shaking in the appropriate medium. Temperature-sensitive mutants were grown at 23 °C overnight and shifted to 37 °C for 4 h before treatment. Hydrogen peroxide or menadione was added directly to the medium when cells were treated in either YEPD or SD medium. When treatments were carried out in buffer, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 25 °C (4 × 103 × gfor 5 min), washed, and resuspended in an equal volume of 100 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.4. Samples (5 ml) were treated with hydrogen peroxide or menadione as indicated. In all cases, appropriate dilutions were made before plating cells on YEPD agar plates to obtain viable counts. Cultures were grown to stationary phase and diluted to an A600 of 3 and 0.3. Drops (4 μl) of each culture were placed onto YEPD agar containing appropriate concentrations of hydrogen peroxide,tert-butyl peroxide or menadione. Plates were dried, incubated at 30 °C for 2 days, and photographed. Cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol and stored overnight at 4 °C. Samples (10 ml) were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.5. RNase (25 μl of 10 mg/ml solution) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 50 °C before addition of 50 μl of proteinase K followed by further incubation for 1 h at 50 °C. Propidium iodide (50 μg) in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (1 ml) was added and samples were incubated in the dark at 4 °C overnight. Flow cytometry analysis of at least 100,000 cells was carried out for each sample in a MoFlo analyzer (Cytomation). Cells were grown overnight in the appropriate medium to an A600 of 0.5 at 30 °C with shaking, divided, and exposed to either α-factor or MBC. α-factor was purchased from Sigma and added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Stock MBC, purchased from Aldrich, was prepared in a 10 mg/ml solution in Me2SO and added to cells at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. An equal volume of Me2SO (without MBC) was added to the MBC treatment control culture. All cultures were incubated at 30 °C for one generation after which treatments were carried out as indicated above in the presence of either α-factor or MBC, and cell survival was monitored as described previously. Overnight cultures grown in YEPD to an A600 of 0.5 at 30 °C were exposed to hydrogen peroxide pretreatment doses at the concentrations indicated. Incubation at 30 °C was continued for a 1-h period after which cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in 100 mmphosphate buffer, and challenged with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 1 h. Cell survival was monitored as described previously. Cultures were grown overnight to anA600 of 1, centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold 8 mm HCl, 1.3% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Cells were broken with glass beads in a mini-bead beater set at high speed for 40 s, microcentrifuged 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected. To measure total glutathione content, i.e.reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, samples were diluted appropriately and added to buffer (143 mm sodium Pi, 6.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 0.73 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 0.24 mmNADPH, 0.09% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Reaction of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) with GSH present in the sample led to formation of GSSG. This GSSG as well as that already present in the sample was measured by addition of 1.2 IU/ml GSSG-reductase and monitoring formation of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate from 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) over a 2 min period at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Spectramax 340 microtiter reader. To measure only GSSG, in a separate reaction the GSH present in the sample was derivatized by adding 5 μl of 2-vinylpyridine to a 100-μl sample and shaking 1 h at room temperature prior to measuring GSSG content as above. Subtraction of the amount of GSSG from the total glutathione allowed an estimation of GSH levels present in the sample. Plasmid 7xSTRE::lacZ is described in Marchler et al. (4Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It includes seven copies of a synthetic STRE element 5′-GGTAAGGGGCCTTACC-3′ in →→→→←←← orientation cloned upstream of a LEU2-lacZ fusion gene in vector pLS9 (4Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The construct was linearized by NcoI cleavage within theURA3 gene prior to transformation into strains 7830-2-4a and 7833-1a using the lithium acetate method of Geitz et al.(24Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Single copy integration was checked by Southern blot analysis (data not shown) using the lacZ gene sequence as a probe. Assays for β-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose as substrate were performed as described by Rose and Botstein (25Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Specific activity is expressed as nanomoles ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose hydrolyzed × min−1 mg−1 protein. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay method as indicated by the manufacturer. Cells that are sensitive to DNA damage may also be more sensitive to peroxide or menadione stress even if other factors involved in the oxidative stress response are intact. Cells defective in the RAD9 checkpoint gene are sensitive to radiation due to their failure to induce cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. To determine whether this arrest malfunction would render cells more sensitive to oxidative stress, a wild-type strain and its isogenic rad9 derivative were grown to anA600 of 1 in YEPD medium and treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide over a 2-h period.rad9 cells were 10–100 times more sensitive than the wild-type at concentrations of hydrogen peroxide above 1 mm(Fig. 1). At concentrations of 2 mm or more, rad9 cell samples taken after 2 h of exposure showed less than 0.001% survival. The difference in sensitivity of wild-type and rad9 cells to peroxide was also observed when cells were exposed to either hydrogen peroxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide on solid YEPD medium (Fig. 2). Interestingly, no difference in the sensitivity of the strains to menadione was detected with both being viable at 1 mm concentration but unable to grow at 2 mm. However, when cells were treated in liquid YEPD medium they were insensitive to much higher concentrations of menadione and other means of making a quantitative assessment of survival were sought. Menadione treatment in potassium Pi buffer substantially reduces cell viability at relatively low concentrations (3Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the wild-type strain and its isogenic rad9 derivative were treated with various concentrations of either hydrogen peroxide or menadione for 1 h in 100 mm Pi buffer (Fig. 3). Compared with cell survival rates in rich medium (cf. Fig. 1), both strains were substantially more sensitive to these reagents when exposed in buffer. Nevertheless, a 10–100-fold difference was again observed between wild-type and rad9 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, however, rad9 cells were no more sensitive to menadione than wild-type cells (Fig. 3 B). Since rad9 cells fail to arrest either in G1, S, or G2 phase, it was important to assess at which stage of arrest cells acquired resistance to hydrogen peroxide. In addition, since paraquat (also a superoxide generator) induces G1 arrest (22Nunes E. Siede W. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1996; 35: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was of interest to know whether menadione could do so. Survival of menadione- or peroxide-treated cells in defined SD medium was intermediate between survival in YEPD and buffer (results not shown). This medium was therefore used for both hydrogen peroxide and menadione treatments to allow normal cell cycle progression upon exposure to low doses of the reagents and enable comparison between the treatments. Cells were grown to A600 of 1 and the culture split into three. Over a 3-h period, one aliquot was allowed to grow without treatment (control) and the second and third aliquots were treated with hydrogen peroxide or menadione, respectively. The proportion of cells in G1 or G2 phase was inferred from flow cytometry analysis in which DNA content of cells was measured (Fig. 4). Menadione, like paraquat, caused arrest in G1, and since rad9 cells are not particularly sensitive to menadione, this arrest is relatively independent of RAD9 function. Hydrogen peroxide treatment, however, caused cells to arrest in G2, which appears therefore to be a RAD9-dependent effect. Strain Y382 was used for the flow cytometry analysis discussed above but since the wild-type and isogenic rad9 strains have a “clumpy” phenotype, flow cytometry results were very variable when methods to separate clumps were employed (e.g. sonication). Therefore microscopic examination of cell morphologies was carried out to confirm the previous experiment and extend it to the rad9mutant. Cultures of the wild-type and rad9 isogenic strains grown in minimal medium were treated with a range of concentrations of menadione (from 0.5 to 10 mm) and hydrogen peroxide (0.01–2 mm), and viability was estimated. For those cultures in which the treatment led to about 90% survival (measured as cells capable of further growth), at least 400 cells were counted, and flow cytometry results were confirmed (TableI). Cells in G1 were identified by their large unbudded shape, whereas cells with buds more than two-thirds the size of the mother cell were considered to be in G2 (17Aboussekhra A. Vialard J.E. Morrison D.E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cernáková L. Fabre F. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3912-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The ratio of cells in G1:G2 for the wild-type decreased 3-fold when they were treated with hydrogen peroxide (0.25 mm) and increased 2-fold when treated with menadione (4 mm) for 2 h. The rad9 cells also arrested in G1 in response to menadione treatment with the G1:G2ratio increasing about 2-fold, however, only a small difference in the number of cells arrested in G2 phase was noted inrad9 cells treated with 0.05 mm hydrogen peroxide.Table IRatio of G1:G2 cells in cultures treated with hydrogen peroxide or menadioneTreatmentStrainG1:G2 ± S.D.ControlWild-type1:1.13 ± 0.20rad91:1.24 ± 0.21Hydrogen peroxide 0.25 mmWild-type1:1.31 ± 0.30 0.05 mmrad91:1.49 ± 0.32Menadione 4 mmWild-type1:0.47 ± 0.05 4 mmrad91:0.53 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Since hydrogen peroxide and menadione treatment cause cells to arrest in G2 and G1, respectively, it was hypothesized that agents causing cell cycle arrest in the appropriate phase prior to oxidative stress treatment would confer resistance to each particular reagent. Wild-type and rad9 cells in exponential phase (A600 of 0.5) were treated with either α-factor or MBC, which arrest cells in G1 and G2/M phase, respectively (26Sakurai A. Sakamoto M. Tanaka H. Esumi Y. Takahashi N. Fujimura H. Yanagishima N. Banno I. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 339-342Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Wood J.S. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for a further generation time (3 h) and arrest was confirmed by microscopic observation before treatment with various concentrations of either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. To take into account differences in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment of the wild-type and rad9 strains, the experiment was conducted such that comparison could be made between treatments, which resulted in similar survival levels (2 mm hydrogen peroxide for the wild-type and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for rad9 cells) and similar treatment concentrations (i.e. 2 mmtreatments for both cell types). Survival was calculated as a percentage of cells present before treatment with the ROS. When wild-type cells were arrested in G1 by α-factor, they became more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and more resistant to menadione (Fig. 5, A and B; note the difference in axes needed to show this effect). However, the opposite effect was noted when cells were arrested in G2 by MBC treatment. In an asynchronous culture, cells are distributed in the different stages G1, S, G2, and M, and so a number of cells will be at the appropriate stage to render them more resistant to the particular oxidant. Therefore, for hydrogen peroxide treatment, arresting cells in G1 led to increased sensitivity compared with the asynchronous culture in which a higher proportion of cells were in G2. On the basis of these comparisons, arresting cells in G1 led to resistance to menadione but not to H2O2, whereas arrest in G2 led to increased resistance to H2O2 and not to menadione. In rad9 cells, a 10–100-fold increase in resistance was noted for hydrogen peroxide-treated cells arrested by MBC in G2. These results are consistent with the involvement ofRAD9 in this resistance. At equivalent doses of peroxide (0.2 mm), arrest of rad9 cells in G2did not completely restore resistance of the cells to wild-type levels. This may indicate that there is an additional effect of therad9 mutation on cell survival; this is discussed later. Many temperature-sensitive mutants have been isolated that arrest at defined points in the cell cycle when shifted to the restrictive temperature. A range of mutants was examined to determine the effect of each mutation on resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Strains tested included cdc28 mutants, which cause arrest at START, the control point at which cells leave G1and enter the mitotic cycle (28Hartwell L.H. Culotti J. Pringle J. Reid B.J. Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 29Reed S.I. Genetics. 1980; 95: 561-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cdc4, which arrests after START but prior to separation of the spindle pole bodies (28Hartwell L.H. Culotti J. Pringle J. Reid B.J. Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar,30Byers B. Goetsch L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cdc13 and cdc16, which both cause arrest in G2/M phase (31Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1993; 134: 63-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant cells were grown overnight at 23 °C and shifted to the restrictive temperature 4 h prior to treatment in the YEPD growth medium. All strains were significantly less sensitive to hydrogen peroxide at the restrictive temperature than at 23 °C (results not shown), which may have been due to the heat shock experienced. Arrest in G1 (cdc28 mutant) caused cells to be particularly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, the least sensitive were the cdc13 and cdc16 mutants blocked in G2/M (Fig. 6), which would be expected if G2 arrest was needed to repair peroxide damage. Curiously, none of the arrested cdcmutants became more resistant than the wild-type. Mutational analysis has shown that stationary-phase cells are in a unique state and are not arrested at a point in the mitotic cell cycle (32Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stationary phase cells are more resistant to several types of stress including oxidative stress (2Jamieson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6678-6681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schenberg-Frascino A. Moustacchi E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). If therad9 sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide is due to its dysfunctional checkpoint arrest then in stationary phase when cells are not undergoing cell division, their resistance to hydrogen peroxide should increase. The rad9 and wild-type cells were grown to stationary phase in YEPD (a 3-day growth) and treated for 1 h with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 7). Comparison with data in Fig. 1(exponential phase cells) reveals that, as shown by others, survival of the wild-type was substantially higher in cells grown to stationary phase. Of more interest, however, is that rad9 cells not only increased their survival rate but became as resistant to hydrogen peroxide as wild-type cells (4 mm hydrogen peroxide treatment killed more than 99.9% of exponential phase rad9cells but less than 50% of stationary phase cells). TheRAD9 function, therefore, does not play a role in the increased resistance of stationary phase cells to oxidative stress. G2/M arrest by MBC significantly increased survival of rad9 cells but did not restore wild-type survival levels. RAD9 has recently been shown to control not only the cell cycle checkpoint delay but also DNA damage-dependent transcriptional induction of a “regulon” of genes whose products are involved in several DNA repair pathways. This secondary control appears to be independent of the cell cycle (17Aboussekhra A. Vialard J.E. Morrison D.E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cernáková L. Fabre F. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3912-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was important therefore to determine whetherRAD9 also played a role in induction of the overall response to oxidative stress and whether the increased sensitivity ofrad9 cells to hydrogen peroxide treatment reflected an inability to"

Attempts to understand the structural basis for DNA damage recognition by DNA glycosylases have been hampered by the short-lived association of these enzymes with their DNA substrates. To overcome this problem, we have employed an approach involving the design and synthesis of inhibitors that form stable complexes with DNA glycosylases, which can then be studied biochemically and structurally. We have previously reported that double-stranded DNA containing a pyrrolidine abasic site analog (PYR) forms an extremely stable complex with the DNA glycosylase AlkA and potently inhibits the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme (Schärer, O.

Here we investigate the interaction of this inhibitor with a variety of additional DNA glycosylases. With the exception of uracil DNA glycosylase all the glycosylases tested bind specifically to PYR-containing oligonucleotides. By comparing the interaction of DNA glycosylases with PYR and the structurally related tetrahydrofuran abasic site analog, we assess the importance of the positively charged ammonium group of the pyrrolidine in binding to the active site of these enzymes.

The preservation of genetic information encoded by DNA is of crucial importance for the survival of all organisms. Genomic DNA is continuously subjected to damage arising from a variety of sources, including spontaneous hydrolysis, oxidation, deamination, alkylation, and errors in replication (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4377) Google Scholar). To counter the toxic and mutagenic effects of the lesions thus produced, DNA repair pathways exist in all known organisms that identify damaged sites in the genome, remove the lesions, and reconstitute the original DNA sequence (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C1995Google Scholar). One such pathway is the base excision repair pathway, in which modified bases are excised through glycosidic bond hydrolysis, the resulting abasic sites are removed, and the correct nucleotide sequence is reinstalled by repair synthesis (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C1995Google Scholar, 3Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjørås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The pivotal enzymes in this pathway are DNA glycosylases, which recognize damaged bases in DNA and catalyze their removal through hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond linking the damaged base to its sugar (Fig. 1 A). Two classes of DNA glycosylases are known: monofunctional DNA glycosylases only catalyze glycosidic bond hydrolysis and generate abasic sites as products. Bifunctional DNA glycosylases have an associated AP 1The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic site; PYR, pyrrolidine residue in DNA; THF, tetrahydrofuran residue in DNA; Endo III, endonuclease III; oG, 8-oxoguanine; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ANPG, alkylN-purine glycosylase; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase. lyase activity, which enables them to catalyze the cleavage of the 3′ C–O bond through a β-elimination mechansim; some such enzymes are also able to cleave the 5′ C–O bond through β-elimination, thereby generating a one-nucleoside gap (3Seeberg E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining enzymes of the pathway remove the abasic sites (or the 3′-phosphate group in the case of glycosylase/lyases) and reinstall the original base through repair synthesis (3Seeberg E.

Known DNA glycosylases act on base adducts in DNA resulting from four types of chemical reactions: 1) alkylation, which takes place mainly at N7 guanine, N3 of adenine, and at O2 of thymine and cytidine (3Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjørås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); 2) oxidation, principally at the 8 position of purines, the 5,6 double bond of pyrimidines, and the exocyclic methyl group of thymine (7Demple B.

New York Academy of Sciences, New York1994: 181-197Google Scholar). The recognition problem faced by DNA glycosylases is a formidable one, requiring these enzymes to recognize subtle alterations in DNA bases in the context of their native counterparts, which are present in vast excess. Progress on this front requires high resolution structural information to reveal in detail the interactions between these enzymes and their substrates. However, because DNA glycosylases associate with their substrate only for the brief period of time during which the excision reaction takes place, it has been virtually impossible to gain direct structural insight into catalytically competent complexes. One approach to circumvent this problem has been to mutate essential catalytic groups in the enzyme so as to abrogate turnover, but preserve substrate recognition (9Vassylyev D.G. Morikawa K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, mutant versions of the bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V and the human uracil DNA glycosylase have been found to form tight complexes with a substrate thymidine dimer and a product abasic site and free uracil, respectively (10Vassylyev D.G.

We have developed a complementary substrate-modification approach for the study of damage recognition by DNA glycosylases, which relies on the design and synthesis of substrate-like molecules that are recognized but not cleaved by base excision repair enzymes (12Schärer O.D.

Our design of inhibitors of DNA glycosylases is based on a model for the transition state structure of the reaction they catalyze. Although the reaction mechanism employed by DNA glycosylases has not been studied in great detail, a mechanistic model can be proposed based on studies of enzymes that catalyze similar glycosyl transfer reactions such as glucosidases (16Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 17McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18259-18262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, the transition state is likely to resemble 1in Fig. 1 B, in which substantial positive charge is accumulated at O-1′ and C-1′. This model applies for both monofunctional glycosylases and bifunctional glycosylase/lyases; the only difference between the two classes of enzymes is the nature of the nucleophile (Nu in 1), an enzyme activated water in the case of monofunctional glycosylases or an amino group of the enzyme for glycosylase/lyases (4Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Labahn J. Schärer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used two strategies to design inhibitors based on this transition state structure. We introduced electron-withdrawing fluorine groups in the deoxyribose moiety, which electronically destabilize the positive charge and thereby lower the reaction rates. This approach yielded potent inhibitors of the mammalian 3-methyladenine glycosylase ANPG and the mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylase TDG (12Schärer O.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10781-10782Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Schärer O.D. Kawate T. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4878-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In a second approach, we used transition state mimicry to inhibit DNA glycosylases. Oligonucleotides containing a pyrrolidine abasic site analog (PYR, 2) have been synthesized to mimic the positive charge of the transition state and were shown to interact specifically with Escherichia coli3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase AlkA and T4 endonuclease V (14Schärer O.D.

Here, we extend our studies using transition state mimicry and show that duplex oligonucleotides containing a PYR residue (2) serve as inhibitors for a wide variety of DNA glycosylases. We found that the DNA glycosylases AlkA, ANPG, Tag, Fpg, MutY, endonuclease III, and TDG bind specifically to PYR-containing oligonucleotides. Uracil DNA glycosylase was the only enzyme tested that did not interact specifically with this transition state mimic. Such a general inhibitor of DNA glycosylases should provide a valuable tool to study the interaction of DNA glycosylases with their target DNA using biochemical and structural methods. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. AlkA (14Schärer O.D. Ortholand J.-Y. Ganesan A. Ezaz-Nikpay K.

The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and an aliquot analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) using 1/2 × TBE buffer (0.045m Tris borate, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) at 150 V constant voltage for 2 h at room temperature. After drying, the gels were exposed to film and to a Fuji image plate for quantification of the bands on a phosphorimager. The exact concentration of active enzyme molecules was determined by titrating the protein with the analog-containing DNA under stochiometric binding conditions ([DNA] = 10 nm≫ Kd). For competition assays 10 fmol of32P-labeled oligonucleotide were used together with 1000 fmol of unlabeled PYR-T, PYR-G, THF-T, THF-G, or A-T duplex (Table I). The protein (50 fmol) was added to the mixture last. Under conditions in which [DNA] <Kd, the concentration of the protein that affords 50% formation of a protein-DNA complex is approximately equal to Kd. The Kd = [protein][DNA]/[protein-DNA] was measured as the concentration of the protein at which half of the target DNA is bound. To keep the DNA concentration below Kd, 0.1 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide was used in a total reaction volume of 50 μl with varying amounts of protein (oligonucleotide concentration = 2 pm). The data from three to six titration gels were averaged to obtain the reported Kd values. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 5 μg of [3H]dimethyl sulfate-treated calf thymus DNA, 25 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and various amounts of protein and the PYR-T or A-T duplex. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by addition of 50 μl of a stop solution containing 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.2m NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol (200 μl) at −70 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min. 200 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and the amount of released alkylated bases measured by liquid scintillation counting. The interaction of DNA glycosylases with the PYR- and THF-containing duplexes was studied using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The specificity of the interaction of the PYR- and THF-containing duplexes and the DNA glycosylases was determined by competition with nonspecific and specific competitors; the dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by titrating under equilibrium conditions ([DNA] ≪ Kd). In some cases, we additionally used inhibition assays to determine the ability of PYR-containing duplexes to inhibit the reaction normally catalyzed by DNA glycosylases. The “Results” section is divided into three parts, according to types of damage specificities (repair of alkylated, oxidized, or deaminated bases) of the DNA glycosylases tested. The interaction between the inhibitors used in this study with a fourth class of DNA glycosylases acting on UV damage has been reported separately (15McCullough A.K. Schärer O.D. Verdine G.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32147-32152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction of three DNA glycosylases that act on alkylated DNA, Tag, and AlkA from E. coli and the human enzyme ANPG, with the pyrrolidine-containing oligonucleotides. All three of these enzymes are monofunctional DNA glycosylases, but differ in their substrate specificities and share no significant amino acid sequence similarity. Tag has a restricted substrate specificity, acting efficiently only on 3-methyladenine (28Bjelland S. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2787-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AlkA, by contrast, has a relatively broad substrate specificity for adducts containing aberrantly placed methyl groups in both the major groove (7-meG) and the minor groove (3-meA, 3-meG, O2-meT, O2-meC) of DNA (29Thomas L.

In contrast to AlkA, ANPG repairs uncharged lesions such as hypoxanthine and 1,N6-ethenoadenine with similar efficiency as positively charged alkylation adducts. The interaction of the pyrrolidine-containing DNA with AlkA, ANPG, and Tag was analyzed using the EMSA (37Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which detects the difference in mobility between protein-bound and unbound DNA. Titration of a 5′-32P-end-labeled duplex having PYR opposite T on the complementary strand (PYR-T) with increasing concentrations of AlkA and ANPG resulted in the appearance of a band with a reduced mobility characteristic of a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 6). This band was completely abolished in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled PYR-T duplex (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7), but was resistant to competition by a 100-fold excess of an unmodified duplex 25-mer (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 8). These results demonstrate that the two proteins specifically recognize the presence of the pyrrolidine moiety in DNA. Further EMSA experiments underKd conditions ([DNA] ≪ Kd) revealed that the dissociation constants for AlkA and ANPG with the PYR-T duplex were 16 pm (±3 pm) and 23 pm (±4 pm), respectively (TableII). In contrast to the specific interaction between the PYR-T duplex with AlkA and ANPG, the complex formed between Tag and the PYR-T duplex was not stable under EMSA conditions. We did observe a band indicative of a protein-DNA complex, but were not able to observe more than 30% of the probe bound to the protein (data not shown). Variation of salt concentrations, pH, and addition of bovine serum albumin did not stabilize this interaction.Table IISummary of dissociation constants (Kd) of DNA glycosylases bound to oligonucleotides containing pyrrolidine and tetrahydrofuran residuesProteinDuplexKdpmAlkA wild typePYR-T16 (±3)THF-T45,000 (±6000)AlkA D238N mutantPYR-T800 (±500)2-2001Ref. 19.THF-T1100 (±500)2-2001Ref. 19.ANPGPYR-T23 (±4)THF-T160 (±65)TagPYR-T2-bCould not be determined by EMSA.THF-T2-bCould not be determined by EMSA.FpgPYR-T350 (±130)THF-T2600 (±1300)MutYPYR-G90 (±31)THF-G320 (±36)PYR-oG65 (±11)THF-oG45 (±9)Endonuclease IIIPYR-G42 (±15)THF-G7800 (±800)UngPYR-G2-bCould not be determined by EMSA.THF-G2-bCould not be determined by EMSA.G/T glycosylasePYR-G16 (±7)THF-G23 (±11)Endonuclease VPYR-G17,000 (±2600)2-2003Ref. 15.THF-A140,000 (±36000)2-2003Ref. 15.2-2001 Ref. 19Labahn J.

Open table in a new tab As a test for our design strategy, we analyzed in parallel the binding of these DNA glycosylases to a singly modified 25-mer duplex containing a (uncharged) tetrahydrofuran analog (THF-T duplex) in the place of the pyrrolidine. In contrast to the exceedingly tight binding of AlkA to the charged pyrrolidine, the uncharged tetrahydrofuran exhibited little specific binding to AlkA (Fig. 3 A); the Kd was measured to be 45 nm (±6 nm) (Table II), showing roughly a 3000-fold decrease in Kd (equivalent to 4.7 kcal/mol). Thus, AlkA exhibits exquisite selectivity for the presence of a positively charged NH2 group in the inhibitor. ANPG, on the other hand, shows less than 10-fold greater affinity for PYR-T as compared with THF-T (Fig. 3 B, TableII). The ability of PYR-containing DNA to inhibit glycosidic bond cleavage of normal substrates by AlkA, ANPG, and Tag was tested by measuring the enzyme-catalyzed release of methylated bases from [3H]dimethyl sulfate-treated calf thymus DNA in the presence of PYR-T and A-T duplex. Addition of increasing amounts of the PYR-T duplex resulted in almost complete inhibition the release of3H-methylated bases from DNA by all three enzymes (Fig. 4). Addition of the same amount of the A-T duplex had little or no effect on the enzyme catalyzed reaction. Thus, duplex DNA containing a single pyrrolidine residue clearly functions as a specific inhibitor of AlkA, ANPG, and Tag. These results demonstrate PYR-containing DNA interacts specifically with Tag, despite the fact that the complex formed between these two molecules is unstable to gel electrophoresis conditions. We next studied the interaction of three DNA glycosylases from E. coli that act on oxidized bases (endonuclease III, Fpg, and MutY) with PYR- and THF-containing DNA. Endo III and Fpg are bifunctional DNA glycosylases/AP lyases, while MutY appears to function primarily as a monofunctional glycosylase (4Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lu A.-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol.

The alkylation-repair enzymes examined above are all monofunctional glycosylases, and it was of interest to see whether there exists any consistent difference in the interaction of mono- and bifuncitonal DNA glycosylases with the PYR- and THF-containing duplexes. Endo III excises a wide variety of oxidized pyrimidines (23Dizdaroglu M. Laval J. Boiteux S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12105-12111Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Fpg (also called MutM) and MutY from part of an intricate system in E. coli to prevent the mutagenic effect of 8-oxoguanine (oG) residues in DNA (39Grollman A.P. Moriya M.

Biochemical studies indicating that MutY favors oG·A over G·A pairs (42Lu A.-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol.

Taking into account the substrate specificities of the enzymes, we used the PYR-T and THF-T duplexes to study the interaction with Fpg and the PYR-G and THF-G duplexes to study the interaction with Endo III and MutY. All three enzymes bound readily to the PYR- and THF-containing duplexes. This interaction was resistant to competition by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled unmodified 25-mer duplex, but susceptible to competition of 100-fold excess of unlabeled PYR-T or PYR-G duplex (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate"
https://openalex.org/W2018185036,"Members of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins are essential for mitotic and meiotic spindle organization, chromosome segregation, organelle and vesicle transport, and many other processes that require microtubule-based transport. A compound, adociasulfate-2, was isolated from a marine sponge, Haliclona (also known as Adocia ) species, that inhibited kinesin activity by targeting its motor domain and mimicking the activity of the microtubule. Thus, the kinesin-microtubule interaction site could be a useful target for small molecule modulators, and adociasulfate-2 should serve as an archetype for specific inhibitors of kinesin functions."
https://openalex.org/W1486595828,"This laboratory reported previously that overexpressed heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP-70) inhibited the activation of its transcriptional factor, HSF1. We had conducted experiments to understand the mechanisms whereby HSP-70 down-regulated the activation of HSF1. Genetically overexpressed HSP-70 had no effects on the HSF1 level in cytosol, but significantly inhibited phosphorylation of HSF1 in the nucleus. Transfection of cells with HSF1 cDNA resulted in increases in the unphosphorylated, but not phosphorylated, HSF1 levels in both the cytosol and nucleus. Because serine phosphorylation of various proteins was reduced in HSP-70 cDNA-transfected cells, we measured the activity of enzymes involved in serine phosphorylation. Overexpressed HSP-70 significantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of protein kinase A (PKA by 73 and 62% in the cytosol and membrane-bound fraction, respectively) and protein kinase C (PKC by 61% in membrane-bound fraction), whereas it activated that of protein phosphatase (PP by 33 and 86% in the cytosol and the membrane-bound fraction, respectively). Forskolin (a PKA stimulator), PMA (a PKC stimulator), and okadaic acid (an inhibitor of PP) were used to investigate whether HSP-70-induced changes in PKA, PKC, and PP were responsible for the HSF1 dephosphorylation. Forskolin did not change nuclear HSF1 phosphorylation, suggesting that decreases in PKA activity in HSP-70 overexpressing cells is not associated with HSF1 phosphorylation. PMA and okadaic acid induced an increase in HSF1 phosphorylation in both vector- and HSP-70 cDNA-transfected cells, although levels of phosphorylated HSF1 in HSP-70 cDNA-transfected cells were lower than those in vector-transfected cells. The PMA-induced increase in HSF1 phosphorylation in HSP-70 cDNA-transfected cells was blocked by pretreatment with staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor. These results suggest that overexpression of HSP-70 inhibits phosphorylation of HSF1 at serine residues by activating PP and inhibiting PKC activity."
https://openalex.org/W1558560534,"Lipoxins are biologically active products of arachidonic acid that are formed via cell-cell interactions, particularly those involving leukocytes. Lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 (LXB4), within similar concentration ranges, each inhibit human neutrophil, activate monocyte adherence and motility, and are rapidly converted by initial dehydrogenation to other inactive metabolites by human monocytes. Here, we exposed LXB4 to isolated recombinant 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and found that it was a good substrate for the enzyme (Km=6.9 microM); we identified the major product as 5-oxo-LXB4 via physical methods including liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. This is the first evidence of 15-PGDH converting a substrate hydroxyl group at a position other than the omega-6 carbon. Based on these observations, several LXB4 analogs were designed and prepared by total organic synthesis to test as stable mimetics: 5(S)-methyl-LXB4-me, 5(R)-methyl-LXB4-me, and 15-epi-LXB4-me (the aspirin-triggered form of LXB4). Both 5(S)-methyl-LXB4-me and 5(R)-methyl-LXB4-me were resistant to rapid conversion. In addition, actions of the stable analogs were evaluated separately with human mono-cytic cells and neutrophils, and 5(S)-methyl-LXB4-me was more potent (nM range) than LXB4 for both cell types. In contrast, 5(R)-methyl-LXB4-me was potent in inhibiting neutrophil transmigration across endothelial monolayers, but did not stimulate monocyte adherence. These results indicate that LXB4 analogs can be designed to resist rapid transformation and retain bioactivity with both monocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, they suggest that LXB4 stable analogs are useful tools to selectively evaluate the modes of actions of LXB4 with different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2053524548,"In the ribosome, the aminoacyl–transfer RNA (tRNA) analog 4-thio-dT-p-C-p-puromycin crosslinks photochemically with G2553 of 23 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This covalently linked substrate reacts with a peptidyl-tRNA analog to form a peptide bond in a peptidyl transferase–catalyzed reaction. This result places the conserved 2555 loop of 23 S rRNA at the peptidyl transferase A site and suggests that peptide bond formation can occur uncoupled from movement of the A-site tRNA. Crosslink formation depends on occupancy of the P site by a tRNA carrying an intact CCA acceptor end, indicating that peptidyl-tRNA, directly or indirectly, helps to create the peptidyl transferase A site."

The data suggest an anomalous transfer of spectral weight from one momentum to another, involving a sizable momentum transfer Q ∼ (0.45π, 0). The observed Q is intriguingly near the charge-order periodicity required if fluctuating charge stripes are present."
https://openalex.org/W1997529651,"Accuracy in transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing is essential for the formation of functional tRNAs, and hence for gene expression, in both Eukaryotes and Archaea. The specificity for recognition of the tRNA precursor (pre-tRNA) resides in the endonuclease, which removes the intron by making two independent endonucleolytic cleavages. Although the eukaryal and archaeal enzymes appear to use different features of pre-tRNAs to determine the sites of cleavage, analysis of hybrid pre-tRNA substrates containing eukaryal and archaeal sequences, described here, reveals that the eukaryal enzyme retains the ability to use the archaeal recognition signals. This result indicates that there may be a common ancestral mechanism for recognition of pre-tRNA by proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2150683798,"The transport of genetic material across biomembranes is a process of great relevance for several fields of study. However, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms underlying transport, one of which implies the involvement of proteic DNA-conducting pores. Entry of genetic material into mitochondria has been observed under both physiological and pathological conditions. We report here that double-stranded DNA can move through a planar bilayer membrane containing isolated mitochondrial porin (voltage-dependent anion channel). The transport is driven by the applied electrical field, and the presence of DNA is associated with a decrease of current conduction by the pores. The passage of DNA does not take place if the bilayer has not been doped with any protein or in the presence of both reconstituted porin and anti-porin antibody. Translocation does not occur if the bilayer contains Shigella sonnei maltoporin, gramicidin A channels, or a 30 pS anion-selective channel plus other proteins. These results show that mitochondrial porin is capable of mediating the transport of genetic material, revealing a new property of this molecule and futher confirming the idea that DNA can move through proteic pores.—Szabò, I., Bàthori, G., Tombola, F., Coppola, A., Schmehl, I., Brini, M., Ghazi, A., De Pinto, V., Zoratti, M.

https://openalex.org/W2016648335,"The cleavage of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from its precursor proparathyroid hormone (pro-PTH) is accomplished efficiently by the proprotein convertase furin (Hendy, G.

We also showed that a synthetic peptide comprising the −6 to +7 sequence of human pro-PTH is appropriately cleaved by purified furin in vitro. The human pro-PTH processing site Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg differs from the consensus furin site Arg-Xaa-(Lys/Arg)-Arg that is represented by Arg-Arg-Leu-Lys-Arg in the cleavage site of pro-PTH-related peptide (pro-PTHrP). An earlier study demonstrated that an internally quenched fluorogenic substrate bearing an O-aminobenzoyl fluorescent donor at the NH2terminus and an acceptor 3-nitrotyrosine near the COOH terminus was appropriately cleaved by the convertases furin and PC1 (Jean, F., Basak, A., DiMaio, J., Seidah, N. G., and Lazure, C. (1995)Biochem. J. 307, 689–695). Here, we have synthesized a series of internally quenched fluorogenic substrates based upon the pro-PTH and pro-PTHrP sequences to determine which residues are important for furin cleavage. Purified recombinant furin and PC1 cleaved the human pro-PTH internally quenched substrate at the appropriate site in an identical manner to that observed with the nonfluorescent peptide. Several substitutions in the P6–P3 sequence were well tolerated; however, replacement of the Lys at the P6 position with Gly and replacement of the P3 Lys by an acidic residue led to markedly compromised cleavage by furin. Furin activity was very sensitive to substitution in P′ positions. Replacement of Ser at P1′ with Gly and Val at P2′ with Ala generated substrates that were less well cleaved. Substitution at the P1′ position of Val for Ser in conjunction with Ala for Val at P2′, as well as a single substitution of Lys for Val at P2′, generated specific inhibitors of furin cleavage. The findings of this study open the way to the rational design of inhibitors of furin with therapeutic potential.

The related PTH gene family member, PTHrP, was originally recognized as the major pathogenic agent in the hypercalcemia of malignancy syndrome (2Halloran B.P. Nissenson R.A.

Among the proprotein precursors, pro-PTH is unusual in that the excised pro-segment consists of only a hexapeptide (4Hamilton J.W. Niall H.D. Jacobs J.W. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Cohn D.V. Proc.

In contrast to pro-PTH which is expressed almost exclusively in the parathyroid gland, pro-PTHrP is widely expressed in both nonendocrine and neuroendocrine cells. Several mammalian subtilisin-like serine endoproteases having distinct or overlapping cleavage specificities have been identified that process proteins by cleaving carboxyl-terminally to pairs of basic residues and sometimes single basic residues (for review see Refs. 7Seidah N.G.

The most well characterized members of this enzyme family are furin, which is expressed in all cells, has a neutral pH optimum, contains a transmembrane region, and functions in the trans-Golgi network, and PC1 and PC2, which are localized exclusively to neuroendocrine cells, have more acidic pH optima, and act predominantly within secretory granules. In the parathyroid chief cell, pro-PTH is cleaved to PTH in the trans-Golgi network (12Habener J.F. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) rather than in secretory granules. This is consistent with processing of pro-PTH by furin or a furin-like enzyme rather than PC1 or PC2. Our previous studies demonstrated that when human (h) prepro-PTH (13Hendy G.N. Kronenberg H.M.

The human pro-PTH processing site Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg (P6–P1) corresponds to one of the less commonly found sites, whereas the pro-PTHrP processing site Arg-Arg-Leu-Lys-Arg (P5–P1) conforms to the typical furin site, and its processing to PTHrP is thought to be mediated by this proprotein convertase (22Liu B.

In the present study we synthesized an internally quenched fluorogenic substrate based upon the pro-PTH (−6 to +7) sequence bearing an O-aminobenzoyl fluorescent donor at the amino terminus and quenching 3-nitrotyrosine acceptor toward the carboxyl terminus. Having established this was appropriately cleaved by furin, we synthesized a series of similar substrates based upon the furin processing sites of both pro-PTH and pro-PTHrP to determine which residues are important for furin activity.

The crude material from each synthesis was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), first using a semi-preparative CSC-Exsil C18 column (25 × 0.94 cm, Chromatography Sciences Co., St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and then an identical type of analytical column (25 × 0.46 cm). The buffer system comprised an aqueous 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH solution and an organic phase of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH. Columns were eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 60% organic phase in 60 min following a 5-min isocratic step at 5% organic phase; the flow rate was either 2.0 ml/min (semi-preparative) or 1.0 ml/min (analytical). The elution was monitored on-line by measurement of UV absorbance at 225 nm and the fluorescence at 420 nm after excitation at 320 nm in 1.0-ml fractions or on-line using a Varian Fluorichrom fluorescence detector. In the latter case, a combination of band filters (300–380 nm) was used for excitation of the fluorophor, whereas a sharp cut-off filter (>400 nm) was used in the emission window. Each purified peptide analogue was characterized by ion spray mass spectrometry using an AP1 111 triple stage mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) as reported (14Hendy G.N. Bennett H.P.J. Gibbs B.F. Lazure C. Day R. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9517-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by amino acid analysis. Amino acid analyses were performed following 18–24 h hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl at 110 °Cin vacuo using a modified Beckman 120C autoanalyzer equipped with a Varian DS604 integrator/plotter. Aqueous stock solutions (0.5–1.5 mm) of quenched fluorescence peptidyl substrates were stored at −20 °C. For enzymatic assay each substrate was incubated with the same amount of partially purified hfurin (4.9 μm/h AMC released, determined using the fluorogenic substrate <Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 100 μl. For murine PC1 the buffer used was 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 6.0, 10 mm CaC12, whereas for murine PC2, it was 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Brij-30. Initial rate determinations were made in the presence of a range of peptidyl substrate concentrations (0.5–80 μm) at 25 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. Following addition of enzyme, the change in fluorescence was recorded with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer with a plate reader accessory using 320 and 420 nm as excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. The initial rate of cleavage (V0) was determined with the built-in least square regression analysis system of the spectrofluorometer using the data recorded from 0 to 60 s after addition of the enzyme. The use of an extended sequence between the acceptor/donor pair can lead to significant background fluorescence as well as a decrease in the intramolecular quenching effect (23Jean F. Basak A. DiMaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Meldal M. Breddam K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although this can be problematic in stopped-time assays, it can be circumvented by coupling RP-HPLC analysis to each time point to measure directly the amount of product released. When multiple samples are to be analyzed, this method is tedious, and the use of initial velocity measurement with increasing concentrations of substrate is preferred. However, our initial results with this procedure showed that, in addition to a decrease in intramolecular quenching, there is a significant contribution from intermolecular quenching both between two substrate molecules with increasing concentration but also between a substrate molecule and the released fluorescent product. Whereas the former is not significant for substrate concentrations less than 40 μm, and the measured fluorescence is linear with respect to concentration of substrate (data not shown), the latter cannot be overlooked as the quenching appears rapidly. To correct for this, increasing amounts of the fluorescent NH2-terminal cleavage product, FS-2, were incubated in the presence and absence of a single representative substrate (both QFS-2 and QFS-4 were used with similar results) at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0. The decrease in fluorescence concomitant upon the increase in substrate concentration up to 40 μm was thereby measured and used to correct the enzyme assay data. The change in fluorescence intensity per unit time was converted into μm/h values using a calibration curve based upon the fluorescence of FS-2 and correction of the quenching effect of increasing amounts of substrate on the fluorescence of the released product. For example, the equation slope = −0.064 [QFS-4] + 8.950 (correlation coefficient = 0.9555) was used to correct for quenching; the slope values were derived from the plot of the measured fluorescence of FS-2 versus [FS-2] in the presence of increasing amounts of QFS-4. Examples of the results are presented in the Appendix. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were calculated with Enzfitter software version 1.03 (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Data obtained over the 0.05–20 μm substrate range were fitted to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten rate equation. To determine the site of cleavage, at the end of the incubation period, reactions were stopped by the addition of excess EDTA, cleavage products separated by RP-HPLC, and their identities established by amino acid analysis. The inhibitory characteristics of compounds QFS-10 and QFS-12 were investigated using stopped-time assays as well as initial rate assays as described above. Increasing amounts of peptide were mixed with a constant amount of hfurin in the presence of differing amounts of the fluorogenic substrate <Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Since these compounds could also quench the fluorescence produced by the released AMC, correction of the observed rate of cleavage was again required. Fluorescence quenching of AMC was linear up to 80 μm of QFS-12 and was corrected for by use of the equation slope = −0.004 [QFS-12] + 0.717 (correlation coefficient = 0.9703); the slope values were derived from the plot of the measured fluorescence of free AMCversus [AMC] in the presence of differing amounts of QFS-12. The two inhibitor constants (Ki and Ki′) were determined by curve fitting of the data using Enzfitter software to Equation 1, Vi/Vmax=[S]/Km1+[S]/Km+[I]/Ki+[I]/Ki′+[I]2/KiKi′+2[S][I]/KmKiEquation 1 according to the inhibitor mechanism outlined in the Appendix. [S] and [I] denote the substrate and inhibitor concentration in μm, respectively, Vi and Vmax the rate of cleavage in μm/h AMC released in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively, and Km, Ki, and Ki′ denote the rate constants. The ability of peptide S-10 to inhibit cleavage of QFS-14 by hfurin was assessed. The Ki value was determined either by using Dixon's representation at three substrate concentrations (7.5, 10, and 15 μm) or by curve fitting of the data using the Enzfitter software to Equation 2. Vi/Vmax=[S]/Km1+[1]/Ki+[S]/KmEquation 2 In all cases, the velocity measurements were corrected for the quenching effect of increasing concentrations of QFS-14 on the release of the fluorescent product as described above. The observed amino acid compositions of all purified quenched fluorescent peptidyl substrates as well as the S-10 peptide were consistent with expected values (data not shown). For all substrates, with one exception, the observed molecular weights obtained by mass spectrometry were within 2 mass units of that expected (data not shown). In the case of QFS-5, although the amino acid composition was consistent with expected values, the molecular weight was some 96 mass units higher than expected. Given that a methionine residue is at position P3, a likely explanation for the erroneous mass is that a side reaction yielding a trifluoroacetyl sulfonium salt occurred during final deprotection of the peptide. All substrates were appropriately cleaved carboxyl-terminal to the (P2)Lys-(P1)Arg site. Fig. 2 shows a representative RP-HPLC chromatogram of the separation of digestion products of the substrate QFS-14 by hfurin. The substrate was cleaved at the expected site with production of the fluorescent NH2-terminal fragment Abz-Gly-Arg-Arg-Leu-Lys-Arg and the nonfluorescent but UV-absorbing COOH-terminal fragment Ala-Val-Ser-Glu-(3-nitro)-Tyr-Ser. The P′-elongated substrates are very efficiently cleaved, and this favors the use of initial velocity measurements for analysis of kinetic data. As shown in Fig. 3, more than 50% of the substrate (in this case 20 μm QFS-7) was cleaved by hfurin within 4 min. Upon much longer incubation times (90–1200 min) the presence of a guanidinoethyl mercaptosuccinic acid-inhibitable carboxypeptidase activity which removes the COOH-terminal basic residue from the NH2-terminal fragment becomes apparent (Fig. 3, inset). The presence of a similar minor carboxypeptidase activity, as yet uncharacterized, was observed previously in recombinant vaccinia virus PC1 preparations (23Jean F. Basak A. DiMaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Our results demonstrate how cryo-crystallography and mutagenesis can provide insight into enzyme mechanism. Various biochemical and physical methods, including site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic analysis, and x-ray crystallography, have revealed many mechanistic aspects of the bifunctional bacterial tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex (EC 4.2.1.20) (for reviews see Refs. 1Miles E.W.

Recent x-ray crystallographic studies, however, demonstrated that whereas the side chain of αAsp60 interacts with the bound inhibitor IPP, the side chain of αGlu49 is too distant (∼6 Å) from IPP to play its proposed role (7Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, IPP lacks the hydroxyl groups of the true substrate IGP, and this could affect the orientation of αGlu49. To investigate interactions between active site residues of the α-subunit and IGP, we have formed the enzyme-IGP complex using the mutant (αD60N) α2β2 complex, in which the other catalytic residue αAsp60 is replaced with Asn. This enzyme has no measurable activity in the reaction catalyzed by the α-subunit but retains substantial β-subunit activity (5Nagata S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present crystal structures obtained by cryo-crystallography of the mutant (αD60N) tryptophan synthase in the presence and absence of the bound true substrate IGP. The expression and purification of the mutant (αD60N) tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex fromSalmonella typhimurium has been described (5Nagata S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although four different substitutions were made at position 60, only the αD60N α2β2 complex yielded crystals suitable for further study. Crystals of the αD60N α2β2complex were grown under the conditions used previously for crystallization of the wild-type enzyme (50 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, 1 mmNa-EDTA, 0.8–1.5 mm spermine, and 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 adjusted to pH 7.8 with NaOH) (8Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3716-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and belong to the space group C2. αD60N crystals grown in the presence of Na+ were soaked for 1–2 days in a standard K+ soaking solution containing 100 mm N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (pH 7.8 titrated with KOH), 1 mm EDTA, and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (9Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and these K+-soaked crystals were used for further soaking experiments with ligands (see below). Preliminary x-ray diffraction data collected at room temperature from IGP-soaked αD60N crystals indicated that there was no electron density for IGP bound to the α-active sites of the enzyme and suggested that the crystalline enzyme still catalyzes the slow cleavage of IGP. Therefore, to eliminate low enzymatic activity of crystalline tryptophan synthase, we have flash frozen substrate-bound αD60N crystals and then collected diffraction data at 95 K. Substrate IGP was prepared enzymatically with tryptophan synthase from indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (10Kawasaki H. Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). IGP was introduced into αD60N crystals by soaking the crystals in a IGP soaking solution (0.4 mm IGP with the standard solution) for 1 day. The crystals were then transferred to a IGP soaking solution for 30 min into each of a series of solutions having 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant and then were flash frozen for data collection. To evaluate the effects of the αD60N mutation on the structure, the unliganded αD60N crystals prepared as above were also flash frozen and subjected to data collection. Diffraction data were collected at 95 K on a Raxis IIC imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. All diffraction data were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (11Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Table I summarizes data statistics and refinement statistics. In refining these structures with X-PLOR (12Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1, a system for X-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), the 2.0 Å wild-type structure determined in the presence of K+ at room temperature (Protein Data Bank entry 1TTQ) (9Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) served as a starting model. The starting model was divided into three substructures (corresponding to the α-subunit, and N- and C-terminal domains of the β-subunits) and subject to a rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing refinement. Subsequent manual rebuilding was carried out using the program O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Cryst. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). At this stage,Fo − Fc maps of αD60N-IGP revealed the bound IGP in the α-subunit. An idealized model of IGP was modeled using QUANTA and fitted to the density then refined again by simulated annealing refinement followed by positional and temperature factor refinements.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsαD60NαD60N-IGPData statistics Resolution (Å)1.92.0 No. of unique reflections4952045501 Average redundancy3.74.3 Rmerge(%)1-2001Rmerge = ∑∣I − <I >∣/∑I.

Open table in a new tab Structural comparisons indicate that αD60N and the starting model (the wild-type structure) are almost identical within root mean square deviation of 0.52 Å for the main chain atoms of all residues, suggesting that the mutation does not produce any significant structural perturbations. Subsequent comparisons between αD60N and αD60N-IGP also indicated that there are no noticeable conformational changes induced by the binding of IGP. The αD60N-IGP structure is similar to that of the wild type-IPP complex (14Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that loop 6 (residues 179–191) is invisible and loop 2 (residues 53–62 including residue 60) is highly disordered. Fig. 1 A shows the electron density map for IGP and nearby residues in the αD60N-IGP structure. The overall binding site is almost identical to that of other structures complexed with IPP that have been determined previously (7Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,14Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the αD60N-IGP structure reveals that the side chain of αGlu49 adopts an extended conformation and is within 2.8 Å from the hydroxyl group of C3′ of IGP (Fig. 1 B). This interaction has been proposed in the mechanism of α-reaction (SchemeFS1) but has not been seen in other structures with the bound substrate analog IPP (7Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of Asn60 in the αD60N-IGP structure is almost identical to that of the IPP-complexed structure, but Asn60 is very mobile (refined temperature factors for the all atoms in Asn60 are about 80 Å2). Despite the similarity in the overall binding site, there are differences in positions (0.9–1.4 Å) of the corresponding atoms including phosphate, C1′, C2′, and C3′ but not in positions of indole ring (Fig. 1 B). The torsion angle around the C2′-C3′ bond is 169 ° for IGP but 28 ° for IPP. Because there is relatively weak electron density for the C1′ atom of IGP, we initially modeled IGP according to the torsion angles of IPP. This fitting keeps the hydroxyl group at C2′ away from its corresponding density, suggesting that the current C1′ atom represents the reliable position in IGP. Interaction between αGlu49 and the C3′ hydroxyl group is unambiguous based on clear density. The C2′ hydroxyl group is in d-enantiomeric configuration but does not form any hydrogen bonds with active site residues. Fig. 1 also shows that the phenolic hydroxyl of αTyr175 interacts with the C3′ hydroxyl group of IGP. However, the finding that the mutant enzyme in which αTyr175 is replaced by Phe (Y175F) has substantial activity indicates that αTyr175 is not essential for catalysis or substrate binding (5Nagata S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies showed that whereas the Y175C mutant was inactive, a second site revertant (Y175C/G211E) exhibited partial activity in the α-reaction (15Helinski D.R. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1043-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later biochemical investigations of this mutant enzyme combined with computer graphics modeling of the substrate binding site of the α-subunit (5Nagata S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that the partial restoration of the α-subunit activity in the doubly altered second site revertant results from restoration of the proper geometry of the substrate binding site. This conclusion supports the view that Tyrα175 serves a structural role but is not an essential catalytic residue. The structure of the inactive mutant (αD60N) with bound IGP reveals two new structural features that were not observed in structures in the presence of substrate analog IPP. These features are the interaction between αGlu49 and the hydroxyl group at C3′ and the location of the hydroxyl groups at C2′ and C3′. There is substantial evidence from site-directed mutagenesis studies that αGlu49 (4Miles E.W. McPhie P. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8611-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsujita T. Kanemoto K. Matsumoto M. Tanaka S. Miyashita A. Matsushiro A. Sugino Y. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are catalytic bases in the reaction catalyzed by the α-subunit. The mechanism of this reaction (Scheme FS1), based on previous proposals (3Kirschner K. Lane A.N. Strasser A.W.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Miles E.W. McPhie P. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8611-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nagata S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6288-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that αAsp60 facilitates tautomerization of the indole ring of IGP (I) to form II and that αGlu49 abstracts a proton from the C3′ hydroxyl group of the glycerolphosphate moiety to form III. Although previous x-ray crystallographic structures of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex demonstrated interaction between the carboxylate of αAsp60 and the indole nitrogen of the bound inhibitor (IPP), the side chain of αGlu49 was too distant to play its proposed role (7Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The carboxylate of αGlu49 was folded away from the IPP and was located approximately 6.1 Å from the modeled C3′ hydroxyl group (Fig. 1 B). In the new structure, the side chain of αGlu49 interacts with the C3′ hydroxyl group of IGP as proposed. This interaction is made possible by the movement of the side chain of αGlu49 into an extended form in the presence of IGP. These results provide an example of an induced fit mechanism in which an active site residue adopts a catalytically correct orientation when a substrate is bound to the active site. This type of induced fit is much smaller and more localized than the larger changes observed in some other structures which involve domain movement, loop closure, or conversion from an open to a closed conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1867691114,"The phenomenon of L-amino acid homochirality was analyzed on the basis that protein synthesis evolved in an environment in which ribose nucleic acids preceded proteins, so that selection of L-amino acids may have arisen as a consequence of the properties of the RNA molecule. Aminoacylation of RNA is the primary mechanism for selection of amino acids for protein synthesis, and models of this reaction with both D-and L-amino acids have been constructed. It was confirmed, as observed by others, that the aminoacylation of RNA by amino acids in free solution is not predictably stereoselective. However, when the RNA molecule is constrained on a surface (mimicking prebiotic surface monolayers), it becomes automatically selective for the L-enantiomers. Conversely, L-ribose RNA would have been selective for the D-isomers. Only the 2′ aminoacylation of surface-bound RNA would have been stereoselective. This finding may explain the origin of the redundant 2′ aminoacylation still undergone by a majority of today's amino acids before conversion to the 3′ species required for protein synthesis. It is concluded that L-amino acid homochirality was predetermined by the prior evolution of D-ribose RNA and probably was chirally directed by the orientation of early RNA molecules in surface monolayers.—Bailey, J.

Here we show that the failure of mating factor-induced transcription is largely the indirect result of arrest at a specific cell cycle position and/or the accumulation of high levels of the Cln1/2-Cdc28 kinase, a known repressor of mating factor signal transduction. Cdc42-defective cells with restored transcriptional induction have a partially restored mating ability but are still defective in the morphological response to mating factor. These results show that Cdc42 is not required for transduction of the mating factor signal per se but that it is essential for proper mating factor-induced morphogenesis.

Cdc42 is a member of the Rho family of small G-proteins, which is essential for many signal transduction and morphogenic processes in eukaryotic cells (1Ridley A.J. Curr.

Some of its biological effects result from the binding to and the activation of members of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) 1The abbreviation used is: PAK, p21-activated kinase. family of protein kinases (3Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Like other G-proteins, Cdc42 can exist in an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transition from inactive to the active state is catalyzed by the guanylate exchange factor Cdc24 (5Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several GTP-ase activating proteins are thought to promote the formation of the inactive GDP-Cdc42 state (5Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stevenson B.J. Ferguson B. De Virgilio C. Bi E. Pringle J.R. Ammerer G. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form of Cdc42 can interact with the yeast PAK family members Ste20 and Cla4 (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5067-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ste20 by itself is essential for mating factor signal transduction, haploid invasive growth, and pseudohyphal differentiation, and it shares an essential function at cytokinesis with Cla4 (for reviews see Refs. 3Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar and 10Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The in vitro kinase activity of Ste20 is stimulated by GTP-bound Cdc42 (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and cells with inactive Cdc42 have strongly reduced mating factor signal transduction activity (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that an interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 is required for full Ste20 kinase activity, a likely prerequisite for the various functions of Ste20. Recently, however, biologically active Ste20 mutants were constructed that are specifically defective in their interaction with Cdc42 by deletion of the so called CRIB domain (Cdc42 regulatory and interactionbox) (12Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 13Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. Van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such Ste20 mutants are defective in the cytokinesis, haploid-invasive, and pseudohyphal growth functions of Ste20, but they have normal in vitro kinase activity and are proficient in mating functions (13Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. Van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Leberer E. Wu C.L. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Apparently, the interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 is required for some but not for all Ste20 functions. Because the Cdc42-Ste20 interaction is not required for mating factor signal transduction, it is unclear why cells with temperature-sensitivecdc42 and cdc24 alleles are defective in mating factor-induced transcription and other mating functions (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Reid B.J. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One possibility is that Cdc42 interacts with a factor other than Ste20 that is essential for mating factor signal transduction. This idea is supported by the recent finding in mammalian cells that Cdc42 does not only interact with PAKs but also with the MEKK1 and MEKK4 protein kinases (16Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-7972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which have homologs in yeast. Another potential explanation for the signal transduction defect of cdc42 and cdc24 cells at restrictive temperature is based on the following observations: (a) the signaling defect ofcdc42 and cdc24 cells is observed most strongly in cells that are fully arrested at thecdc24/cdc42 block (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), (b) it has been shown that high levels of Cln1/2-Cdc28 kinase accumulate at such blocks (17Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and (c) we have previously shown that high levels of Cln1/2-Cdc28 can repress the mating factor signal transduction pathway (18Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We tested whether the signaling defect ofcdc24 and cdc42 cells was due to repression of mating factor signaling by the high levels of Cln1/2-Cdc28 kinase at the cdc24/cdc42 block. The genotypes of yeast strains used in this study are given in TableI. All strains were isogenic to BF264–15D (trp1-1a leu2-3, 112 ura3 ade1 his2) or, in the case of cdc24-1 and cdc42-1 strains, backcrossed to the BF264–15D strain background at least five times. Strains were constructed by standard methods, and cells were grown in YEP (yeast extract peptone) media with 2% dextrose or 3% galactose as described (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with mating factor was at concentrations of 0.1 μm or higher. Quantitative mating assays were carried out essentially as described previously (18Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Table IStrainsStrainGenotypeBOY391MATa bar1BOY1248MATa bar1 cdc24–1BOY1235MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cdc24–1BOY1251MATa bar1 cdc42–1BOY1240MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cdc42–1BOY836MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cln3 YCpTRP1-GAL1::CLN1BOY1074MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cln3::URA3 cdc24–1 leu2::LEU2::GAL1::CLN1BOY1076MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cln3::URA3 cdc42–1 leu2::LEU2::GAL1::CLN1BOY921MATa bar1BOY1001MATa bar1 cdc24–1BOY1005MATa bar1 cln1 cdc24–1BOY1004MATa bar1 cln2 cdc24–1BOY1007MATa bar1 cln1 cln2 cdc24–1 Open table in a new tab Northern analysis was as described (18Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell morphology was examined by phase contrast optics, and negatives of pictures were scanned into a digital format. Contrast and brightness were further adjusted using the Adobe Photoshop computer program. To test whether the defect in signal transduction activity observed at acdc42 or cdc24 block could be due to repression of the mating factor signaling pathway by the G1-cyclinsCLN1 and CLN2, we compared the signal transduction activity under restrictive conditions of cdc42 and cdc24 strains with and without CLN1/2. As shown before (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), cells with temperature-sensitive alleles ofcdc42 and cdc24 at restrictive temperature showed little transcriptional induction by mating factor of the reporter geneFUS1 (Fig. 1 A). Deletion of CLN1 and CLN2 in the cdc42 and cdc24 strains resulted in a significant increase in signaling activity at restrictive temperature; cdc24 orcdc42 cells without CLN1/2 had about a 3-fold increase in signal transduction activity when compared with cells withCLN1/2 (Fig. 1 A). Some defect in signal transduction activity, however, was still observed. At permissive temperature none of these strains showed a major defect in signaling activity (Fig. 1 A). These observations suggest that part of the signaling defect at the cdc42 and cdc24arrest points is due to the presence of CLN1 and CLN2. Mutant cdc42 and cdc24 cells arrest at a specific cell cycle position as large unbudded cells (20Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Strathern J. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 97-142Google Scholar). It is at this position that the signaling defect of these cells was observed (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We wanted to eliminate potential cell cycle effects that might contribute to the defect in signal transduction activity. The possibility of such cell cycle effects is suggested by observations in cdc34-1 mutant cells, which like cdc24 and cdc42 arrest at a post-START cell cycle position (20Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Strathern J. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 97-142Google Scholar). Just like cdc24 and cdc42 cells, cdc34-1 blocked at restrictive temperature are defective in pheromone signal transduction activity (data not shown). Unlike cdc42 and cdc24, however, the defect in signal transduction activity of thesecdc34 cells could not be alleviated by deletion ofCLN1 and CLN2 (data not shown), indicating that besides CLN1/2-mediated repression of signal transduction, another effect, possibly related to the post-START cell cycle position, strongly contributes to the signaling defect of cdc34-1cells. To test for potential cell cycle position effects that might contribute to the signaling defect of cdc24 and cdc42 cells, we used cln− cdc24-1 GAL1::CLN1 and cln− cdc42-1 GAL1::CLN1cells. These cells were grown on galactose medium and then arrested at START by addition of glucose, which results in CLNdeprivation by repression of the GAL1 promoter (21Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6482-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cdc24 or Cdc42 were then inactivated by elevation of the temperature, and mating factor signal transduction activity was determined by monitoringFUS1 transcriptional induction. At this different cell cycle position, signal transduction activity of the cdc42 and cdc24 mutant cells was similar to that of wild type cells at both permissive (data not shown) and restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 B). The same cells kept in galactose and arrested at thecdc arrest points (with high CLN1 expression levels) were strongly defective in signal transduction activity (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of STE5 (a gene required for mating factor signal transduction (22Sprague G.F. Thorner J.W. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 657-744Google Scholar)) in cln− cdc24-1 GAL1::CLN1 cells eliminated all mating factor-induced signal transduction activity of CLN-blocked cells at restrictive temperature (data not shown). This indicates that transcriptional induction of the FUS1 reporter gene by mating factor is not due to some artifactual activation but occurs through bona fide activation of the mating factor signal transduction pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the previously observed signaling defect of cdc24 and cdc42cells can be explained largely by cell cycle position effects in combination with high level CLN1/2-associated kinase activity. Our observations on the signaling defects ofcdc24 and cdc42 cells allowed us to test thein vivo contribution of CLN1 and CLN2expressed from their own promoters in signaling repression. For this purpose, cdc24 cells with different CLN genotypes were tested for their signaling activity. Cdc24 cells at restrictive temperature, which were deleted for CLN1 had a more severe signaling defect than cells deleted for CLN2, which in turn signaled worse than cells deleted for both (Fig. 1 C). Although these observations are made in a somewhat artificial situation, this indicates that both CLN1 and CLN2can, when expressed from their own promoter, by themselves reduce mating factor signal transduction activity. The observation that CLN2 seems more effective in repression (Fig. 1 C) might help explain why expression ofCLN2 from the GAL1 promoter is particularly effective in repression of signal transduction (18Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been observed that cdc42 and cdc24 cells at restrictive temperature are defective in mating factor-induced morphogenesis and have a strong mating defect (15Reid B.J. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Hartwell L.H. Mortimer R.K. Culotti J. Culotti M. Genetics. 1973; 74: 267-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sloat B.F. Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Adams A.E.M. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether this reflects a genuine requirement for Cdc42 function in morphogenesis and mating or whether these observations are an indirect result of the strong signal transduction defect at the cdc24/cdc42 blocks. Because inactivation of Cdc42 function in START-arrested cells did not result in a major signal transduction defect, we could separate direct from indirect effects and directly examine the requirement of Cdc42 for mating factor-induced morphogenesis and mating. We used thermosensitivecdc24 mutants because the cdc24-1 allele has been observed to be “tighter” than the cdc42-1 allele (Ref.17Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar and data not shown); it is therefore expected to be better suited for these experiments that require extended incubations at restrictive temperature. To test the involvement of Cdc24 in mating factor-induced morphogenesis, cln− cdc24 GAL1::CLN1 cells were arrested at START byCLN deprivation, and a portion of the cells was then shifted to the restrictive temperature of 36 °C. Fig. 2 shows the morphology of START-arrested cells with and without mating factor treatment. In response to mating factor, both wild type and cdc24 cells at permissive temperature formed the typical mating projections called “shmoos.” At the elevated temperature, however, only the wild type cells formed mating projections, whereas the cdc24 cells in the presence of mating factor displayed a round, nonpolarized morphology. Because START-arrested cdc24 cells at 36 °C are proficient in signal transduction activity, this shows that Cdc24 and by inference Cdc42 are required for proper mating factor-induced morphogenesis. We then tested the mating ability of cdc24 cells in which mating factor signal transduction activity was restored byCLN deprivation. As shown in Fig. 3, cdc24 cells blocked at restrictive temperature displayed a marked mating defect, although in our strain background and under these experimental conditions, the defect did not appear as large as reported previously by others (15Reid B.J. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In cdc24 cells in which signal transduction activity was restored by prior CLN deprivation, there was a partial restoration of the mating defect at restrictive temperature. Thecdc24 cells at a CLN block still appeared to have a somewhat reduced mating efficiency when compared with wild type cells. We demonstrate that repression of the mating factor signal transduction pathway by the Cln1/2-cdc28 kinase in combination with cell cycle position effects can largely explain the previously observed signaling defect of cdc42 and cdc24 cells blocked at restrictive temperature (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). There clearly is no absolute requirement for Cdc42 or Cdc24 in mating factor signal transduction. This is consistent with the observations that there is no requirement for an interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 for mating factor signal transduction (11Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. Van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, these data show that there is not some other step in the mating factor signal transduction route that requires Cdc42 function. Even though cdc24 cells that were arrested at START byCLN deprivation had normal mating factor signal transduction activity, they failed to form projections for conjugation. This requirement of Cdc42 and Cdc24 in morphogenesis during the sexual cycle of budding yeast is in keeping with the crucial importance of these proteins in morphogenesis during the vegetative cell cycle (23Hartwell L.H. Mortimer R.K. Culotti J. Culotti M. Genetics. 1973; 74: 267-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sloat B.F. Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and with their morphogenic role in other eukaryotes (1Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). An involvement of Cdc24/Cdc42 specifically in mating factor-induced morphogenesis is also supported by a recent study describing the generation ofCDC24 alleles that are only defective in mating factor-induced morphogenesis, whereas other vegetative and sexual functions of Cdc24 are unaffected (26Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When compared with activation of PAK family members from other organisms (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), Cdc42 binding to the budding yeast Ste20 or Cla4 kinases results only in, at best, a moderate stimulation of kinase activity (7Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Benton B.K. Tinkelenberg A.H. Gonzalez I. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5067-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Wu C. Lee S.F. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31787-31790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas for Ste20 it appears to be critical for in vivo localization of the kinase (13Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. Van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Leberer E. Wu C.L. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The primary mode of activation of Cla4 or Ste20 by Cdc42 may be localization of the kinases to the proper site for function rather than stimulation of in vivo kinase activity. Such a localization mechanism accounts for a large part of the activation of Raf kinase by Ras (29Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 30Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The mating defect of cdc24 cells at restrictive temperature could be partially overcome by blocking cells at a different cell cycle position with low CLN kinase activity. Because cells have normal mating factor signal transduction activity at that position, this suggests that part of the previously observed mating defect ofcdc24 cells (15Reid B.J. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) can be attributed to a signal transduction defect. That mating in these cells was not as efficient as that of wild type cells, might be due to the fact that they failed to form projections for conjugation. This indicates that the poor mating phenotype of cdc24 cells that was observed previously can be attributed to a combination of signal transduction and morphogenic defects. We thank D.

https://openalex.org/W2043443567,"We have isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding a transcription activating factor for the mouse selenocysteine tRNA (tRNAsec) gene from mouse mammary gland. The full-length cDNA, designated m-Staf, has a 1878-base pair open reading frame encoding 626 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of m-Staf is highly homologous to that of Staf, another selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor ofXenopus laevis. Like Staf, m-Staf contains seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers and four repeated motifs. Gel shift assays indicated that the recombinant m-Staf specifically bound to the activator element region in the mouse tRNAsec gene. Transient co-transfection experiments in DrosophilaSchneider cells, which lack endogenous Staf-like binding activity, showed that m-Staf increased the mouse tRNAsec gene transcription about 15-fold, whereas it stimulated Pol II-dependent thymidine kinase promoter only 2-fold. Northern blot analysis detected the presence of a 3.4-kilobase pair m-Staf transcript, which was widely but differentially expressed in various murine tissues. The binding activity of m-Staf in mouse mammary gland was undetectable during virgin and postlactating periods but increased markedly in parallel with the increase of tRNAsectranscript during the periods of pregnancy and lactation, when the gland undergoes growth and development. These results indicate that m-Staf is a transcriptional activator of the mouse tRNAsecgene and that its binding activity in the mammary gland undergoes developmental alterations.

Gel shift assays indicated that the recombinant m-Staf specifically bound to the activator element region in the mouse tRNAsec gene. Transient co-transfection experiments in DrosophilaSchneider cells, which lack endogenous Staf-like binding activity, showed that m-Staf increased the mouse tRNAsec gene transcription about 15-fold, whereas it stimulated Pol II-dependent thymidine kinase promoter only 2-fold. Northern blot analysis detected the presence of a 3.4-kilobase pair m-Staf transcript, which was widely but differentially expressed in various murine tissues. The binding activity of m-Staf in mouse mammary gland was undetectable during virgin and postlactating periods but increased markedly in parallel with the increase of tRNAsectranscript during the periods of pregnancy and lactation, when the gland undergoes growth and development. These results indicate that m-Staf is a transcriptional activator of the mouse tRNAsecgene and that its binding activity in the mammary gland undergoes developmental alterations. Selenium has been established as a nutritional requirement for the essential trace elements and shown to be indispensable for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins (1Larsen P.R. Berry M.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 323-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These selenoproteins include type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase in thyroid hormone metabolism (2Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R.

Both type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase and glutathione peroxidase play an important function in metabolic activities of mammary cells during lactation (9Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Annu, Rev.

Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins in the form of selenocysteine, and its incorporation is directed by a specific UGA codon, which normally functions as a stop codon in both procaryotes and eucaryotes (13Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar).

This reaction also requires a selenocysteine insertion sequence, a cis-acting mRNA element, and a specialized elongation factor, the SELB protein (15Ringquist S. Schneider D. Gibson T. Baron C.

It has been shown that transfection of plasmids expressing tRNAsec into human 293 cells, an embryonic kidney cell line, increases the level of 5′-deiodinase activity (17Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amount of tRNAsec is critical for the regulation of selenoprotein biosynthesis. Extensive analysis of the tRNAsec gene promoter has been reported for Xenopus laevis (18Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Myslinski E. Krol A.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9696-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Usually, transcription of tRNA genes requires two promoter elements, named A box and B box, situated inside the coding region. However, the tRNAsec gene is atypical in that its transcription is not dependent on the A box, which is naturally debilitated in this gene, but requires the B box and three other upstream elements, such as an activator element (AE) located in a distal sequence element, a proximal sequence element, and a TATA motif (18Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P.

Nishimura S. Taketo M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The factors binding to the proximal sequence element, the TATA motif, and the B box have been well characterized, but the ones to the AE have not (14Baron C. Bock A. Soll D. RajBhandary V.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 529-606Google Scholar, 15Ringquist S. Schneider D. Gibson T. Baron C. Bock A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, a cDNA encoding a DNA-binding protein to the AE has been cloned from X. laevis and named Staf (selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor) (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The structure of Staf is characterized by the presence of seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers that facilitate its DNA binding activity (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Staf has been shown to transactivate tRNAsecgene transcription in a X. laevis oocyte system (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have been studying the regulatory mechanisms involved in developmental and tissue-specific gene expression in the mouse mammary gland (25Saito H. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During the course of our study to clone and characterize cDNA for mammary transcription factors, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a protein containing zinc finger motifs and named itm-Staf. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and functional characterization of m-Staf and present evidence indicating that it is a mouse counterpart of Staf, which activates transcription of the mammalian tRNAsec gene. We also present data suggesting that it is involved in regulating mouse tRNAsec gene expression during the development of mouse mammary gland. A mouse mammary gland cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the DNA binding domain of mouse YY1 cDNA (26Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 38-44Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Among several clones obtained, one clone, named 1BA, was sequenced and analyzed further. The 5′ and 3′ regions of the gene were obtained from a mouse spleen marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) by the method of 5′- and 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) (27Chenchik A. Diachenko L. Moqadam F. Tarabykin V. Lukyanov S. Siebert P. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Using a set of primers corresponding to the 5′ or 3′ non-coding regions, a full-length cDNA was amplified from mouse mammary gland poly(A)+ RNA and ligated to a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid was named pCRStaf. The sequence was verified by sequencing three independent clones. Plasmids pCRfull, pCRΔ5, pCRΔ3, and pCRΔ53 were prepared in the following way. A part of m-Staf cDNA (position 54–440) was amplified using primers 5′-GCGGCCGCAAGCTTCTCAGGGAATGACAGAATTTCC-3′ and 5′-TCTAACTGAACGGCCTGAAGTGAGCTC-3′ and then digested withHindIII and SacI. The resultant fragment was ligated into a HindIII-SacI-digested pCRStaf to form pCRfull. The 5′-linker element having the initial methionine codon was made by hybridization of oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCTCAGGGAATGACAGAATTTCCTGGAGGAGGAATGGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CATTCCTCCTCCAGGAAATTCTGTCATTCCCTGAGA-3′. The resultant fragment was ligated into the HindIII-SacI-digested pCRStaf to form pCRΔ5. For construction of pCRΔ3 and pCRΔ53, pCRfull and pCRΔ5 were digested with SacII and EcoRI to remove a portion of the cDNA (positions 1696–1941) and ligated with the 3′-linker element having the termination codon. The 3′-linker element was made by hybridization of oligonucleotides 5′-GTAGTAAGGCCGGTAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTACCGGCCTTACTACGC-3′. For transfection experiments using Drosophila Schneider cells, ADH-pEXPfull, ADH-pEXPΔ53, and ADH-pEXPΔ3 were prepared as follows. A Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (−381/+36) (Promega) was ligated into theXhoI-SalI site of PBsII (Stratagene) to form ADH-0. ADH-pEXPfull was formed from pCRfull by using theSalI-EcoRI-digested ADH-0. Two plasmids expressing truncated forms of m-Staf, ADH-pEXPΔ53 and ADH-pEXPΔ3, were prepared by treating pCRΔ53 and pCRΔ3, respectively. ADH-βgal was prepared as follows: theHindIII-BamHI fragment of PSV-βgal (Promega) was ligated into the HindIII-BamHI-digested PBsII. This construct was treated with SalI-BamHI and inserted into the SalI-BamHI-digested ADH-0. Other expression plasmids pEXPfull, pEXPΔ53, and pEXPΔ3 were formed by using a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA I, Invitrogen) from the plasmids pCRfull, pCRΔ53, and pCRΔ3, respectively. The wild type or mutated promoter of −235/+7 region of mouse tRNAsec (23Bosl M.R. Seldin M.F. Nishimura S. Taketo M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids. Mutations corresponding to MM0, MM1, and MM3 (see Table I) were introduced to the element by PCR-based mutagenesis method (28Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The promoter elements were ligated into the PstI-XbaI site of pCAT Basic vector (Promega) to obtain reporter plasmids termed pTRwt, pTRmm0, pTRmm1, and pTRmm3.Table IWild type and mutated sequences used in this studyGel shift competitorCAT construct1-2001Each tRNAsec promoter-CAT construct bears the same sequence as indicated.Sequence1-bA hyphen represents the same residue as that of mouse wild type.

Open table in a new tab The −237/−193 region of mouse tRNAsec gene, with and without a mutation, was ligated into the upstream region of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter-CAT fusion plasmid and named wAE-tkCAT and mAE-tkCAT, respectively. Recombinant m-Staf proteins were expressed by using the His-patch ThioFusion System (Invitrogen). The expression constructs pThio-full and pThio-Δ53 were made by using the pThioHis vector. Transformed bacteria were grown as described previously (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was then subjected to three cycles of sonication-freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation. The supernatants from pThio-full and pThio-Δ53 were named rStaf-full and rStaf-Δ53, respectively. Total RNA from various tissues was prepared by the CsCl precipitation method (29Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 130-135Crossref Google Scholar) or by the acid phenol extraction method (Ambion). For detection of m-Staf mRNA, total RNAs were electrophoresed on formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted onto a Hybond-N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe bearing the +1/+252 region of m-Staf cDNA. For detection of tRNAsec, total RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide-8 murea gel (Novex), transferred to a Nylon+ membrane (Novex) by electroblotting, and hybridized with a 5′-end32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GCACCCCAGACCACTGAGGATCATCCGGGC-3′) specific for the mouse tRNAsec. Aged-matched virgin (3 months old) and pregnant (9–11 days of gestation) C3H/HeN female mice were obtained from the Animal Center of the National Institutes of Health. Animal care and study protocol were in full compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Nuclear extracts were prepared from thoracic mammary glands according to the method described previously (25Saito H. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts or recombinant proteins were mixed with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 17 μl of reaction buffer containing 14 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 15 min on ice. Gel shift assays were performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the −233/−198 region of the mouse tRNAsec gene. Following the addition of the32P-labeled probe (3 × 104 cpm), the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE. Drosophila SL2 cells were grown at 22 °C in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For transfection, 3.5 × 106 cells were plated on each of 3.5-cm-diameter dishes. Five μg of CAT construct, 5 μg of expression plasmid, and 2 μg of ADH-βgal were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method (30Yoshimura M. Oka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3670-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were lysed by freezing and thawing for CAT assays (30Yoshimura M. Oka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3670-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. Ed. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Ten μg of CAT construct and 7 μg of expression plasmids were transfected with 3 μg of pSVβ-gal by the calcium phosphate method. After 40 h, cells were harvested for subsequent assays. The DNA binding domain of mouse YY1-cDNA encoding transcription factor bearing four C2-H2 type zinc fingers (26Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 38-44Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was used for screening a mouse mammary gland cDNA library at low stringency. One positive clone, 1BA, was further analyzed. The complete nucleotide sequence of this clone (Fig. 1) indicated that it contained a 1878-nucleotide open reading frame (positions 64–1941), which potentially encoded a 67.5-kDa polypeptide consisting of 626 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed that this protein contained four repeated motifs between residues 39 and 135 and a zinc finger domain of the C2-H2 type tandemly repeated seven times between residues 220 and 428. A computer search of the GenBank data base indicated that the sequence of the protein is highly homologous to both human protein ZNF 143, of unknown function (32Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and X. laevis Staf protein (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among its 626 amino acid residues, 608 and 530 residues are identical to those of ZNF 143 (97.1%) and Staf (84.7%), respectively (Fig. 2). It is noted that the zinc finger domain and the element of repeated motifs are especially well conserved among these three proteins (197 residues out of 209 and 59 residues out of 60, respectively). Therefore, we named this protein m-Staf. Despite the overall homology and high conservation of the putative functional domains, further comparison of the amino acid sequences of these three proteins revealed notable differences. First, Staf contains an additional 47 amino acid residues at the amino terminus; these residues are absent in the other two proteins. Second, both m-Staf and ZNF143 sequences have an insertion of 54 amino acid residues in the region downstream of the zinc finger domain. Total RNA prepared from various tissues of female mice was subjected to Northern blot analysis using m-Staf cDNA as a probe (Fig. 3). A single band of transcript (3.4 kb) was detected in all tissues examined. The level of the transcript relative to that of GAPDH mRNA was highest in the lung and lowest in the liver. These results indicate that the m-Staf gene is widely but differentially expressed in mouse tissues. We produced two recombinant m-Staf proteins, rStaf-full, corresponding to amino acid residues 1–626, and rStaf-Δ53, corresponding to residues 118–542 (Fig. 4 A). Their binding activities to the AE region of the tRNAsec gene were examined by gel shift assays using a double-stranded DNA probe corresponding to the −233/−198 region of the mouse tRNAsec gene promoter, which includes the AE region (−222/−208). Table I shows the sequences of mouse (MW) and X. laevis wild type competitors and four mouse mutant competitors (MM0, MM1, MM2, and MM3). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the rStaf-full protein formed a single retarded band with the labeled DNA probe (lane 1). The intensity of band was decreased when the excess amounts of unlabeled MW were added (lanes 2 and 3). Mutant competitors MM0, MM1, and MM2 showed almost no competition (lanes 4–9), whereas MM3 and XW showed some competition (lanes 10–13). These data indicate that m-Staf binds to the AE region in a sequence-specific manner and that the two sequences, CCA (−222/−220) and TGC (−216/−214), are important binding elements (Table I). The recombinant protein rStaf-Δ53, in which the three of four repeated motifs and the 84 amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus were deleted, also could bind to the probe (lane 14). The sequence specificity of rStaf-Δ53 binding was the same as that of rStaf-full as judged by competition experiments (data not shown). These results indicate that residues 118–542, which contain the zinc fingers, are sufficient for the DNA binding activity of m-Staf. We next examined whether m-Staf functions as a transcriptional activator of the mouse Pol III-dependent tRNAsec gene. For transient co-transfection experiments, Drosophila SL2 cells, which do not have endogenous Staf-like binding activity (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were used. The expression vectors ADH-pEXPfull, ADH-pEXPΔ53, and ADH-pEXPΔ3 contained either a wild type m-Staf gene or its truncated forms under the control of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. ADH-0, which lacks the m-Staf insert, served as a control. These plasmids were co-transfected with a CAT reporter plasmid linked to either a wild type or a mutated element bearing the −235/+7 region of the mouse tRNAsec gene promoter (Table I and Fig. 5 A). Co-transfection of ADH-pEXPfull (mS) resulted in approximately a 15-fold increase of CAT activity of pTRwt compared with that of ADH-0 (none) (Fig. 5 A, columns 2 and 1, respectively). In contrast, when the mutant reporter plasmid pTRmm0 or pTRmm1 was used, co-transfection of mS produced only marginal effects (Fig. 5 A, columns 5–8). These results were consistent with the results of gel shift assays (Fig. 4 B), in which mutant MM0 and MM1 showed no competition. Another mutant reporter plasmid, pTRmm3, also showed little increase of CAT activity in the presence of mS (Fig. 5 A, columns 9 and 10), although MM3 showed some competition in gel shift assays (Fig. 4 B, lanes 10 and 11). These results show that m-Staf functions as a transcriptional activator of tRNAsec gene promoter by binding to the AE region in a sequence-specific manner in vivo. We also investigated the effect of another effector plasmid, ADH-pEXPΔ53 (mS53) expressing amino acid residues 118–542 (Fig. 4 A) on transcriptional activity of pTRwt. Co-transfection of mS53 did not increase the CAT expression of pTRwt (Fig. 5 A, columns 1 and 3), suggesting that some region(s) other than the zinc finger domain is important for the transcriptional activation. On the other hand, co-transfection of ADH-pEXPΔ3 (mS3) expressing amino acid residues 1–542 produced approximately a 13-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 5 A, columns 1 and 4). These data suggest that amino acid residues 1–117, which contain three of the four repeated motifs, are important for the transcriptional activation, whereas amino acid residues 543–626 are dispensable. To assess the possible action of m-Staf on transcription mediated by Pol II-dependent promoter, we examined its effect on reporter plasmids, AE-linked thymidine kinase promoter-CAT (wAE-tkCAT) or its mutated form, mAE-tkCAT. As shown in Fig. 5 B, cotransfection of mS increased the activity of wAE-tkCAT only 2-fold (columns 1 and 2), whereas the activities of mAE-tkCAT showed no increase (columns 3 and 4). These data, together with those presented in Fig. 5 A, suggest that m-Staf preferentially stimulates Pol III-dependent tRNAsec promoter. Another expression vector, pEXPfull, was co-transfected with pTRwt into two mammalian cell lines, HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary. The CAT activity increased about 8-fold even in the absence of pEXPfull, whereas its addition did not enhance the CAT activity. This was probably due to the high levels of endogenous Staf-like activity in HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Cloning of the m-Staf cDNA and detection of its transcript in mouse mammary gland prompted us to examine the activity of m-Staf in the gland. Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from mammary glands of pregnant mice revealed the presence of two retarded bands (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). Competition experiments indicated that the DNA binding activity of the upper band had the same sequence specificity as that of the recombinant m-Staf (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2–13, and Fig. 4 B) whereas the lower band showed no sequence-specific DNA binding activity and thus was considered to be nonspecific. In addition, the migration rate of the upper band was found to be similar to that formed by the recombinant m-Staf (data not shown). These data indicate the presence of endogenous m-Staf in the mammary glands. The binding activities of m-Staf in mouse mammary gland at various reproductive stages are shown in Fig. 6 B. No specific retarded band was detectable with nuclear extracts from virgin and postlactating mice (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1 and 7), whereas a single specific retarded band (Band A) corresponding to that of m-Staf was detected with extracts from pregnant animals at three different gestational stages (Fig. 6,A and B, lanes 2–4). Nuclear extracts from lactating mice at two different stages formed the same m-Staf-specific band (Band A) with greater intensity and also produced an additional band having a slower migration rate (Band B) (lanes 5 and 6). The binding protein associated with the slowly migrating band also was found to have the same sequence specificity as m-Staf by competition experiments (data not shown). Although its relationship to m-Staf remains unknown at the present time, it is possible that this protein is a subtype of m-Staf. In addition, mixing experiments using mammary nuclear extracts from mice at different reproductive stages revealed no apparent diffusible inhibitors or activators of the m-Staf binding activity (data not shown). These results indicate that the m-Staf binding activity in mammary glands increases during the periods of pregnancy and lactation. Because m-Staf was shown to be a positive transcriptional regulator of the mouse tRNAsec gene, it was of interest to compare the levels of tRNAsec transcript and m-Staf binding activities in mouse mammary gland at various reproductive stages. As shown in Fig. 7, a mouse tRNAsec transcript having 87 bp was detected as a single band. Its level in the mammary gland increased substantially during pregnancy and lactation (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3), whereas it remained at relatively low levels during virgin (lane 1) and postlactating (lane 4) periods. In this study, we cloned a cDNA encoding a zinc finger protein from mouse mammary gland. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone indicates that it contains the seven tandemly repeated C2-H2-type zinc fingers and the four repeated motifs, which are highly homologous with Staf from X. laevis. Accordingly, we have designated this cDNA m-Staf. However, we found several structural differences between m-Staf and Staf. First, Staf has additional amino acid residues at the amino terminus and contains the third methionine residue at the position corresponding to the translation start site of m-Staf. Second, m-Staf contains an additional 54 amino acid residues downstream of the zinc finger domain. The nucleotide sequence of the inserted portion is 5′-GTCAACA- - - -CAG-3′, which is identical to the consensus sequence of the intron donor and acceptor site (33Lewin B. Genes V. IRL/Oxford University Press, New York1994: 887-891Google Scholar), suggesting that this portion might originally have been an intron, which has evolved into an exon. The sequence is no longer spliced out because RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that mouse mammary gland does not contain any Staf gene products that lack the 54 amino acid residues (data not shown). In addition, these amino acid residues are also present in the same downstream region of human zinc finger protein ZNF143, suggesting that they are well conserved in mammalian species. We obtained several lines of evidence indicating that m-Staf is a transcriptional activator of the mouse tRNAsec gene. Like Staf, the recombinant m-Staf, rStaf-full, was shown to bind to the 15-base pair AE region of the mouse tRNAsec gene in a sequence-specific manner. Competition assays using various mutated sequences indicate that the two sequences CCA (−222/−220) and TGC (−216/−214) in the AE region are important for the binding. The truncated form, rStaf-Δ53, which has only amino acid residues 118–542, was also found to bind to the AE region, indicating that this portion of m-Staf is sufficient to facilitate the DNA binding activity. Because it contains an entire zinc finger domain (Fig. 4 A), our results are consistent with the previous findings that the zinc finger domain of Staf is important for its DNA binding activity (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, we do not know whether all of the seven zinc fingers are necessary for DNA binding activity. It was reported that three of the six C2-H2 zinc fingers in the Gfi-1 transcription factor were sufficient for DNA binding (34Zweidler-Mckay P.A. Grimes H.L. Flubacher M.M. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments showed that expression vectors for both m-Staf (ADH-pEXPfull) and one truncated form of m-Staf (ADH-pEXPΔ3) could induce the mouse tRNAsec promoter CAT activity, whereas the other truncated form, ADH-pEXPΔ53, was ineffective. These results suggested that amino acid residues 1–117 of m-Staf contain some region necessary for transcriptional activation. This portion includes three of the four repeated motifs, which are well conserved between Staf and m-Staf and thus may have functional importance. Based on these findings, m-Staf is considered to have two major functional regions, one for transcriptional activation and the other for DNA binding, which are characterized by the presence of the repeated motifs and the zinc finger domain, respectively. These features of m-Staf are common to many transcription factors (35Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J. Pearl-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that m-Staf stimulated transcription of tRNAsecPol III-dependent promoter but had only minimal effect on AE-linked thymidine kinase Pol II-dependent promoter in transfection experiments using Drosophila cells. These cells were used because they do not contain any detectable level of Staf-like binding activities. In contrast to our present findings, it was reported that transfection of Staf in Drosophila cells was not effective in stimulating transcription of the X. laevistRNAsec Pol III, although Staf markedly activated the AE-containing Pol II promoter (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Staf could only be demonstrated by using a X. laevis oocyte system into which Staf mRNA was microinjected prior to introduction of the tRNAsec-CAT reporter gene. The observed difference in the transcriptional activity of the two Stafs transfected inDrosophila cells could be explained by the aforementioned structural difference of the two proteins or by the source of tRNAsec Pol III promoter used in reporter plasmids,i.e. mouse versus X. laevis. These differences could influence the functional properties of Stafs in forming the active transcriptional complex. Our studies of m-Staf in mouse mammary gland indicated that m-Staf binding activities changes as a function of reproductive stage. The binding activity of m-Staf in the mammary gland was undetectable at virgin and postlactating stages, when the gland is developmentally dormant. However, the binding activity increased markedly during the periods of pregnancy and lactation, when the mammary gland undergoes extensive growth and differentiation (36Borellini F. Oka T. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1989; 80: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the change in the m-Staf binding activity in the gland appears to be correlated to the developmental status of the mammary tissue. Because the development of the mammary gland is stimulated by various steroid and polypeptide hormones (36Borellini F. Oka T. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1989; 80: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the binding activity of m-Staf in the gland also may be hormonally regulated. In addition, we found that the level of tRNAsec in the mammary gland increased during pregnancy and lactation largely in parallel with that of m-Staf binding activity. These findings are consistent with the view that m-Staf is involved in the regulation of tRNAsec gene transcription. It is noted, however, that both virgin and postlactating mammary glands had no detectable m-Staf binding activity but showed low levels of tRNAsec transcript. It is possible that the basal level of tRNAsec gene transcription in developmentally dormant glands is maintained by other transcription factors acting on the basal promoter elements (18Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Meißner W. Wanandi I. Carbon P. Krol A. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The parallel increase in tRNAsec and m-Staf binding activity in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation is noteworthy because the production of at least two selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidase (9Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Annu, Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase (10Aceves C. Valverde R.C. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2818-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Jack L.J.W. Kahl S. St Germain D.L. Capuco A.V. J. Endocrinology. 1994; 142: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Tucker H.A. J. Dairy Sci. 1981; 64: 1403-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is found to increase in the gland during these periods. Type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase is the best characterized selenoprotein in the mammary gland; it catalyzes monodeiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to form a more active hormone, 3,5,3′-tri-iodothyronine (T3). Its activity in the mammary gland increases during lactation (10Aceves C. Valverde R.C. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2818-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and correlates well with lactational intensity, as judged by litter size (11Jack L.J.W. Kahl S. St Germain D.L. Capuco A.V. J. Endocrinology. 1994; 142: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the view that the deiodinase plays a key role in maintaining lactogenesis by catalyzing the production of T3 (12Tucker H.A. J. Dairy Sci. 1981; 64: 1403-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of induction of type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase during lactation have not been elucidated, our present findings raise the possibility that m-Staf plays a role in the biosynthesis of type I thyroxine 5′-deiodinase, as well as other selenoproteins, by regulating expression of the tRNAsecgene in lactating mammary glands. Recently, it was reported that Staf could activate not only theX. laevis tRNAsec gene but many small nuclear RNA and small nuclear RNA-type genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II or Pol III in a X. laevis oocyte system (37Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, some of these genes, such as the U2 gene, were found to contain binding sites for both Staf and Oct factor in their distal sequence element regions (37Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Ares Jr., M. Chung J.S. Giglio L. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in which the two transcription factors interact to activate transcription. Because the distal sequence element region of the mouse tRNAsec gene also contains a consensus octamer binding site (23Bosl M.R. Seldin M.F. Nishimura S. Taketo M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it is of interest to examine whether such an interaction is important for the regulation of murine tRNAsec gene promoter transcription. In addition, the question of whether m-Staf can also activate transcription of small nuclear RNA genes in mammalian tissues, including the mammary gland, remains to be investigated. Previously, it was reported that human ZNF76 (39Ragoussis J. Senger G. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was a human homologue of Staf (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although its biological function was not identified. The sequence of ZNF76 showed 85.1% identity (172 of 202 residues) with Staf in the zinc finger region, but its entire sequence had only 58.0% homology with Staf (298 of 514 residues). We found that m-Staf and human ZNF143, another human zinc finger protein (32Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), share 97.1% homology in their amino acid sequences. In view of our findings that m-Staf functions as a transcription activator of the mouse tRNAsec gene, ZNF143 may be the human homologue of m-Staf and have similar functions for the regulation of tRNAsecgene transcription in mammalian systems. Moreover, because the ZNF143 gene was mapped to chromosomal regions implicated in developmental and malignant disorders (32Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it is of interest to examine the possible involvement of m-Staf in these disease states in the mouse model. We thank Drs. Deborah M. Hinton, Karen Usdin, and Michael D. Davis for their discussion and critical reading of our manuscript."
