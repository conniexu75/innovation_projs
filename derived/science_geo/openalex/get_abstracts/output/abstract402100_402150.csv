https://openalex.org/W1992724001,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic and may thereby promote cancer. Normally, ROS levels are tightly controlled by an inducible antioxidant program that responds to cellular stressors and is predominantly regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as Nfe2l2) and its repressor protein Keap1 (refs 2-5). In contrast to the acute physiological regulation of Nrf2, in neoplasia there is evidence for increased basal activation of Nrf2. Indeed, somatic mutations that disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction to stabilize Nrf2 and increase the constitutive transcription of Nrf2 target genes were recently identified, indicating that enhanced ROS detoxification and additional Nrf2 functions may in fact be pro-tumorigenic. Here, we investigated ROS metabolism in primary murine cells following the expression of endogenous oncogenic alleles of Kras, Braf and Myc, and found that ROS are actively suppressed by these oncogenes. K-Ras(G12D), B-Raf(V619E) and Myc(ERT2) each increased the transcription of Nrf2 to stably elevate the basal Nrf2 antioxidant program and thereby lower intracellular ROS and confer a more reduced intracellular environment. Oncogene-directed increased expression of Nrf2 is a new mechanism for the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant program, and is evident in primary cells and tissues of mice expressing K-Ras(G12D) and B-Raf(V619E), and in human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, genetic targeting of the Nrf2 pathway impairs K-Ras(G12D)-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, the Nrf2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program represents a previously unappreciated mediator of oncogenesis."

Analogous cooling techniques can provide a general and flexible method of preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state. Cavity optomechanical or electromechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong interaction between light and motion. However, entering the quantum regime--in which a system has less than a single quantum of motion--has been difficult because sideband cooling has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of low-frequency mechanical systems to their hot environments. Here we demonstrate sideband cooling of an approximately 10-MHz micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. This achievement required a large electromechanical interaction, which was obtained by embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant circuit. To verify the cooling of the membrane motion to a phonon occupation of 0.34 ± 0.05 phonons, we perform a near-Heisenberg-limited position measurement within (5.1 ± 0.4)h/2π, where h is Planck's constant. Furthermore, our device exhibits strong coupling, allowing coherent exchange of microwave photons and mechanical phonons. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling, ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion, possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger size and mass. Because mechanical oscillators can couple to light of any frequency, they could also serve as a unique intermediary for transferring quantum information between microwave and optical domains."

The identification of V(H)1-69 antibodies that broadly neutralize almost all influenza A group 1 viruses constituted a breakthrough in the influenza field. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody CR8020 with broad neutralizing activity against most group 2 viruses, including H3N2 and H7N7, which cause severe human infection. The crystal structure of Fab CR8020 with the 1968 pandemic H3 hemagglutinin (HA) reveals a highly conserved epitope in the HA stalk distinct from the epitope recognized by the V(H)1-69 group 1 antibodies. Thus, a cocktail of two antibodies may be sufficient to neutralize most influenza A subtypes and, hence, enable development of a universal flu vaccine and broad-spectrum antibody therapies."

Thus, an ideal approach to identify the cell of origin is to analyze proliferative abnormalities in distinct lineages prior to malignancy. Here, we use mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) in mice to model gliomagenesis by initiating concurrent p53/Nf1 mutations sporadically in neural stem cells (NSCs). Surprisingly, MADM-based lineage tracing revealed significant aberrant growth prior to malignancy only in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but not in any other NSC-derived lineages or NSCs themselves. Upon tumor formation, phenotypic and transcriptome analyses of tumor cells revealed salient OPC features. Finally, introducing the same p53/Nf1 mutations directly into OPCs consistently led to gliomagenesis. Our findings suggest OPCs as the cell of origin in this model, even when initial mutations occur in NSCs, and highlight the importance of analyzing premalignant stages to identify the cancer cell of origin.

Modeling human glioma using mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) Tracking lineage-specific aberrant growth at pretransformation stages Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a cell of origin for glioma Cancer cell of mutation and cell of origin are distinct Cancer is a disease of genetic mosaicism because cancerous cells harbor genetic mutations that are absent in normal cells within the same individual. In familial cancer patients, even though initial mutations exist in every cell, in most cases, only specific cell types can progress into malignancy. Those cell types are called cancer cell of origin. Such a cell type-specific susceptibility implies the existence of a permissive or even synergizing signaling context in the cell of origin for particular genetic mutations to cause cancer formation. Therefore, identification of the cancer cell of origin would provide critical insights for understanding tumorigenic mechanisms and for designing rational therapeutic strategies. Despite such importance, identification of the cell of origin for most cancers has been a daunting task (Visvader, 2011Visvader J.E. Cells of origin in cancer.Nature. 2011; 469: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The reliability of revealing cell identity solely based on molecular and cellular analyses of late stage tumors is often confounded not only by infiltrated bystander cells, but also by the acquired plasticity often found in terminal cancerous cells. To circumvent these issues, genetically engineered mouse models have been widely used to determine the tumorigenic potential of a specific cell type by initiating mutations with a cell type-specific Cre transgene. However, it is critical to note that cells initially acquiring mutations (cell of mutation) may not be the cell of origin. When mutations are introduced in stem/progenitor cells, it is extremely difficult to distinguish whether initial mutant cells directly transform or whether they merely pass on mutations to more restricted progeny that then transform. In the latter scenario, the mutated stem/progenitor cell is simply the cell of mutation, and the transforming progeny is the actual cell of origin (Visvader, 2011Visvader J.E. Cells of origin in cancer.Nature. 2011; 469: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The cell of origin for malignant glioma, a type of deadly brain cancer, remains controversial. Successful isolation of tumor cells with stem cell features (known as cancer stem cells) from human gliomas (Singh et al., 2004Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J. Hide T. Henkelman R.M. Cusimano M.D. Dirks P.B. Identification of human brain tumour initiating cells.Nature. 2004; 432: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (6082) Google Scholar) implies neural stem cells (NSCs) as the cell of origin. However, such NSC-like features of malignant glioma cells could be acquired during transformation rather than reflect the nature of the original cell type (Visvader, 2011Visvader J.E. Cells of origin in cancer.Nature. 2011; 469: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting the NSC origin of glioma was obtained from mouse genetic studies. For example, the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) or the expression of a mutant form of p53 in NSCs consistently led to glioma formation in mouse models, and the physical locations of tumors appeared to associate with the subventricular zone (SVZ), where adult NSCs reside (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009Alcantara Llaguno S.

However, other studies suggest that NSC-derived progeny such as astrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) might directly transform (Bachoo et al., 2002Bachoo R.M. Maher E.A. Ligon K.L.

This unresolved controversy partially stems from the distinct oncogenic mutations used in these models that make the direct comparison difficult and, more importantly, from the lack of high-resolution analyses of cellular aberrations during the transforming process. Mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM), a mouse genetic mosaic system (Zong et al., 2005Zong H. Espinosa J.S. Su H.H. Muzumdar M.D. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice.Cell. 2005; 121: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), could, in principle, be used to analyze aberrations in individual cell lineages prior to the final transformation and should thus be suitable for identifying cancer cell of origin. Via Cre/loxP-mediated mitotic interchromosomal recombination, MADM generates a small number of homozygous mutant cells, thus mimicking the sporadic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of TSGs in human cancers (Knudson, 1971Knudson Jr., A.G. Mutation and cancer: statistical study of retinoblastoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5565) Google Scholar). MADM also permanently labels these mutant cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and their sibling wild-type (WT) cells with red fluorescent protein (RFP) within an otherwise unlabeled heterozygous mouse (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online). The single-cell resolution benefited from the sparse labeling (0.1%–1% or much lower) (Zong et al., 2005Zong H. Espinosa J.S. Su H.H. Muzumdar M.D. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice.Cell. 2005; 121: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) enables one to track mutant cells throughout the entire process of tumorigenesis. The sibling red WT cells serve as internal controls for green mutant cells, thereby greatly facilitating detailed analyses of cellular aberrations of all lineages in their native environment. In summary, MADM can provide features that are indispensable for a robust analytical paradigm to identify a cell of origin.Figure S1Schematic Illustrations of MADM Working Mechanism, Chromosomal Location of MADM Cassettes, and Breeding Scheme to Generate MADM Glioma Model, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Two reciprocal chimeric cassettes (TG and GT) were each targeted to Hipp11 locus (Hippenmeyer et al.). TG cassette harbors the DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal of TdTomato (hereto referred to as RFP) and the C-terminal of GFP, while GT cassette harbors the other halves of the two proteins. RFP-N and GFP-C (same as GFP-N and RFP-C) are separated by an intron within which a LoxP site is inserted. These cassettes are under the control of a CMV-actin promoter (pCA) to ensure strong and ubiquitous expression of fluorescent proteins upon Cre-mediated recombination. Notably, because N- and C-terminal fragments are designed in different reading frames, there is no functional fluorescent protein translated prior to the recombination, rendering all cells unlabeled. When a Cre recombinase expresses along with MADM-targeted chromosomes in the same cell, the inter-chromosomal recombination between two LoxP sites within TG and GT cassettes will restore the full-length GFP and RFP.If the inter-chromosomal recombination occurs during the G2 phase, recombinant chromosomes will be sorted in two different ways after mitosis. (I) If chromosome segregation occurs as shown in the left branch (X-segregation), a pair of green and red sibling cells will be generated. When a mutation of interest resides on the site distal to one cassette (TG in the current study), the green cell will become homozygous null while the red cell becomes homozygous wild-type. (II) If segregation happens as shown in the right branch (Z-segregation), a pair of yellow and colorless cells will be generated, in which the genotype remains unchanged as heterozygous.(B) Chromosomal locations of Hipp11 where MADM cassettes (TG and GT) are targeted to, and p53 and NF1.

After initiating p53/NF1 mutations sporadically in neural stem cells (NSCs), we analyzed mutant NSCs and all of their progeny at premalignant stages. We found dramatic overexpansion and aberrant growth specifically in OPCs, but not in NSCs or other lineages. Upon tumor formation, marker staining and transcriptome analysis confirmed the OPC nature of tumor cells. Finally, introducing the same mutations into OPCs consistently led to gliomagenesis. Our findings reveal OPCs as the cell of origin for glioma even when initial p53/NF1 mutations occur in NSCs, thus resolving the current controversy by distinguishing cancer cell of mutation from cell of origin. Importantly, although our studies focused on glioma, the analytical paradigm with MADM that is developed here could be applied to identify cellular origins for many other cancers. MADM-based cancer modeling needs three prerequisites: cancer-causing gene mutation(s), MADM cassettes that reside centromerically to the prospective mutated genes, and a Cre transgene that expresses in a certain tissue or organ. To establish an MADM-based glioma model, we decided to inactivate p53 and NF1, both of which are among the most frequently mutated genes in human glioma patients (McLendon et al., 2008McLendon R.

We also engineered MADM cassettes into the Hipp11 genomic locus (Figure 1A and Figures S1A and S1B) proximal to the p53 and NF1chromosomal locations on mouse Chr. 11 (Hippenmeyer et al., 2010Hippenmeyer S.

Genetic mosaic dissection of Lis1 and Ndel1 in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2010; 68: 695-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To induce MADM-based recombination, we chose hGFAP- or Nestin-Cre transgenes (termed NSC-Cre hereafter) that are expressed in both embryonic and adult NSCs (Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H. Zou K. Hwang J.K. Jan Y.N. Zhong W.

Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. hGFAP-cre transgenic mice for manipulation of glial and neuronal function in vivo.Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), thereby generating MADM-labeled cells in all NSCs-derived lineages: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs (Figure 1B). With the ability to identify MADM-labeled cell types, we can readily analyze the aberrant growth of GFP+ mutant cells by directly comparing to their RFP+ WT counterparts within each lineage in the same mouse brain. After recombining mutant alleles of p53 and NF1 with MADM alleles to generate a mutant-MADM mouse model (Figure S1C), we analyzed overall expansion of green mutant cells at different ages. In contrast to the comparable distribution of green and red cells in WT-MADM brains in which all labeled cells are wild-type (Figure 2A , left), we observed a progressive overrepresentation of green mutant cells in mutant-MADM brains from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P60 (Figure 2A, top three of the right column) and eventually the formation of GFP+ full-blown tumors at ∼5 months of age (Figure 2A, bottom-right). Because mutant (green) and wild-type (red) sibling cells originate from the same mother cell in equal numbers initially (Figure 1A), the ratio of green to red cell numbers (referred to as the G/R ratio hereafter) allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent of mutant cell expansion. A G/R ratio equal or close to 1 indicates no growth advantage of the mutant population, whereas a G/R ratio > 1 indicates a growth advantage of mutant over WT cells (referred to as “overexpansion” hereafter). From P5 to P60, the average G/R ratio in mutant-MADM brains increased from ∼4 to ∼30 (Figure 2B), indicating a continuous overexpansion of mutant cells. However, the increase of G/R ratio appeared to reach a plateau between P30 and P60, suggesting that overexpansion of mutant cells had largely stopped between those ages. In addition to quantifying cell numbers, we also compared the proliferative status between mutant and WT cells with a brief BrdU pulse to label cells undergoing DNA replication. At all time points analyzed, the percentage of BrdU+ cells in the mutant population was significantly higher than that in the WT population (Figure 2C). Furthermore, whereas WT cells largely ceased to proliferate at early postnatal age (P10), some mutant cells (∼0.3% among all mutant cells population) continued to divide and contributed to the entire population of BrdU+ cells in the brain parenchyma at P60 (Figure 2D). Thus, mutant cells showed not only elevated, but also prolonged proliferative capacity compared to WT cells at a stage before tumor formation (termed the “pretransforming” stage hereafter). At later ages (4–5 months), all mutant-MADM mice developed brain tumors with strong Ki67 staining (Figure 2A, bottom-right). Tumors were invariably GFP+ (n = 28), indicating that they originated from MADM-induced mutant cells. Although transcriptome profiles of these tumors were very similar (see below), pathological analysis revealed great heterogeneity in their appearance: some showed typical astrocytic features; some showed malignant glioma features such as necrosis, multinuclear giant cells, and perivascular and perineuronal satellitosis; and most were highly anaplastic (Figure S2, Figures 4B–4D, and Figure 5D). Taken together, MADM allows us to trace mutant cells at all gliomagenic stages and provides the analytical accessibility between initial mutations and the final transformation. We next sought to determine the identity of glioma cell of origin by separately determining the G/R ratio of NSCs and of each NSC-derived cell type at P60, when mutant cell expansion had largely ceased but tumors were yet to arise. We predicted that, at this ostensibly dormant stage in tumorigenesis, the mutant cell type capable of transformation should manifest significant overexpansion and maintain sustained proliferative activity. We first quantified the G/R ratios of all four NSC-derived cell types (Figure 3A ). The average G/R ratio from different brain regions showed slight reduction of mutant neurons and only minor expansion of mutant astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In stark contrast, the G/R ratio of OPCs was > 130, significantly higher than those of the other three cell types (Figure 3A and Figure S3). Notably, mutant OPCs appeared to have impaired differentiation potentials to give rise to mature oligodendrocytes, as the G/R ratio of oligodendrocytes was ∼10 times less than that of OPCs (Figure 3A). Moreover, brief BrdU pulses at P60 exclusively labeled mutant OPCs in brain parenchyma, although the total number was low, suggesting that mutant OPCs were progressing but were still relatively dormant at this age (Figure 3B, left). Remarkably, despite such a dramatic overrepresentation of mutant OPCs, we did not observe any pathological features in these brains by conventional pathological analysis (Table S2 and data not shown), demonstrating the capability of MADM to probe into a previously inaccessible stage during tumor development.Figure S3Quantification Schemes in the Brain Parenchyma and the SVZ of the Mutant-MDAM Mouse Model for Calculating Average G/R Ratio, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Systematic sampling of brain regions for G/R ratio calculation in Figures 2C-2D, 3A, 3B, 6G and 6H.

Shown here are the images from a P60 brain of MADM mutant mouse model induced by hGFAP-Cre. Aldolase C was used as a pan-astrocyte marker to quantify both gray and white matter astrocytes (Staugaitis et al., 2001Staugaitis, S.M., Zerlin, M., Hawkes, R., Levine, J.M., and Goldman, J.E. (2001). Aldolase C/zebrin II expression in the neonatal rat forebrain reveals cellular heterogeneity within the subventricular zone and early astrocyte differentiation. J. Neurosci. 21, 6195–6205.Google Scholar). Based on the distinct characteristics of each cell type, marker-positive cells of different genotypes were counted within different regions (shown in the right column of B to E) and the average G/R ratio was calculated. (F) Brain regions defined for counting G/R ratio of BrdU+ cells within the adult SVZ. The SVZ of coronal brain sections was subdivided into five regions, one from dorsolateral SVZ (S1) and four from lateral SVZ (S2-S5). We systematically sampled four non-adjacent sections in each brain with N = 3 brains. See Extended Experimental Methods for details. (G) Representative confocal image of BrdU staining of the SVZ region from a coronally sectioned P60 MADM mutant mouse brain (BrdU given for 7 days by drinking water). Dashed lines: lateral ventrical wall. Arrows point to BrdU+, MADM labeled cells. LV: lateral ventricle. Scale bars: 20 μm. It seems paradoxical that we found nearly full penetrance of tumor formation in our model at 4–5 months of age (Table S2), yet dividing cells at P60 were so rare (Figure 2C and Figure 3B, left). Considering that pretransforming cells could undergo a prolonged cell cycle, we evaluated the slow-dividing cell population by extending the duration of BrdU administration and observed that 30% of all mutant OPCs were able to incorporate BrdU (Figure 3B, right, and data not shown), suggesting that many mutant OPCs were dividing slowly. We noticed that a small fraction of BrdU-positive mutant cells in the brain parenchyma did not express the OPC marker PDGFRα (Figures 3B, right, and 3C). To determine whether these were cells from other lineages or oligodendrocytes differentiated from recently divided OPCs, we costained brain sections adjacent to those shown in Figure 3C with antibodies against BrdU, PDGFRα, and Olig2, a “pan-oligo” marker that expresses in both OPCs and oligodendrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2104296508,"Attosecond science is based on steering of electrons with the electric field of well-controlled femtosecond laser pulses. It has led to, for example, the generation of XUV light pulses with a duration in the sub-100-attosecond regime, to the measurement of intra-molecular dynamics by diffraction of an electron taken from the molecule under scrutiny, and to novel ultrafast electron holography. All these effects have been observed with atoms or molecules in the gas phase. Although predicted to occur, a strong light-phase sensitivity of electrons liberated by few-cycle laser pulses from solids has hitherto been elusive. Here we show a carrier-envelope (C-E) phase-dependent current modulation of up to 100% recorded in spectra of electrons laser-emitted from a nanometric tungsten tip. Controlled by the C-E phase, electrons originate from either one or two sub-500as long instances within the 6-fs laser pulse, leading to the presence or absence of spectral interference. We also show that coherent elastic re-scattering of liberated electrons takes place at the metal surface. Due to field enhancement at the tip, a simple laser oscillator suffices to reach the required peak electric field strengths, allowing attosecond science experiments to be performed at the 100-Megahertz repetition rate level and rendering complex amplified laser systems dispensable. Practically, this work represents a simple, exquisitely sensitive C-E phase sensor device, which can be shrunk in volume down to ~ 1cm3. The results indicate that the above-mentioned novel attosecond science techniques developed with and for atoms and molecules can also be employed with solids. In particular, we foresee sub-femtosecond (sub-) nanometre probing of (collective) electron dynamics, such as plasmon polaritons, in solid-state systems ranging in size from mesoscopic solids via clusters to single protruding atoms."

The observations reveal the presence of a population of cold dust grains radiating with a temperature of ~17-23 K at a rate of about 220 solar luminosity. The intensity and spectral energy distribution of the emission suggests a dust mass of ~0.4-0.7 solar mass. The radiation must originate from the SN ejecta and requires the efficient precipitation of all refractory material into dust. Our observations imply that supernovae can produce the large dust masses detected in young galaxies at very high redshifts."
https://openalex.org/W2047405192,"The ribosome translates the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA into protein. Folded structures in the coding region of an mRNA represent a kinetic barrier that lowers the peptide elongation rate, as the ribosome must disrupt structures it encounters in the mRNA at its entry site to allow translocation to the next codon. Such structures are exploited by the cell to create diverse strategies for translation regulation, such as programmed frameshifting, the modulation of protein expression levels, ribosome localization and co-translational protein folding. Although strand separation activity is inherent to the ribosome, requiring no exogenous helicases, its mechanism is still unknown. Here, using a single-molecule optical tweezers assay on mRNA hairpins, we find that the translation rate of identical codons at the decoding centre is greatly influenced by the GC content of folded structures at the mRNA entry site. Furthermore, force applied to the ends of the hairpin to favour its unfolding significantly speeds translation. Quantitative analysis of the force dependence of its helicase activity reveals that the ribosome, unlike previously studied helicases, uses two distinct active mechanisms to unwind mRNA structure: it destabilizes the helical junction at the mRNA entry site by biasing its thermal fluctuations towards the open state, increasing the probability of the ribosome translocating unhindered; and it mechanically pulls apart the mRNA single strands of the closed junction during the conformational changes that accompany ribosome translocation. The second of these mechanisms ensures a minimal basal rate of translation in the cell; specialized, mechanically stable structures are required to stall the ribosome temporarily. Our results establish a quantitative mechanical basis for understanding the mechanism of regulation of the elongation rate of translation by structured mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2080380126,Legionella pneumophila actively modulates host vesicle trafficking pathways to facilitate its intracellular replication with effectors translocated by the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). The SidM/DrrA protein functions by locking the small GTPase Rab1 into an active form by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and AMPylation activity. Here we demonstrate that the L. pneumophila protein SidD preferably deAMPylates Rab1. We found that the deAMPylation activity of SidD could suppress the toxicity of SidM to yeast and is required to release Rab1 from bacterial phagosomes efficiently. A molecular mechanism for the temporal control of Rab1 activity in different phases of L. pneumophila infection is thus established. These observations indicate that AMPylation-mediated signal transduction is a reversible process regulated by specific enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W2046021929,"Endoglin (CD105), a transmembrane protein of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. Mutations in endoglin result in the vascular defect known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). The soluble form of endoglin was suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. To obtain further insight into its function, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the extracellular domain (ECD) of mouse and human endoglin fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain. We found that mouse and human endoglin ECD-Fc bound directly, specifically, and with high affinity to bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 (BMP9 and BMP10) in surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and cell-based assays. We performed a function mapping analysis of the different domains of endoglin by examining their contributions to the selectivity and biological activity of the protein. The BMP9/BMP10 binding site was localized to the orphan domain of human endoglin composed of the amino acid sequence 26-359. We established that endoglin and type II receptors bind to overlapping sites on BMP9. In the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, the mouse and the truncated human endoglin ECD-Fc both significantly reduced VEGF-induced vessel formation. Finally, murine endoglin ECD-Fc acted as an anti-angiogenic factor that decreased blood vessel sprouting in VEGF/FGF-induced angiogenesis in in vivo angioreactors and reduced the tumor burden in the colon-26 mouse tumor model. Together our findings indicate an important role of soluble endoglin ECD in the regulation of angiogenesis and highlight efficacy of endoglin-Fc as a potential anti-angiogenesis therapeutic agent."

The activity of NKCC2 is determined by vasopressin (AVP) or intracellular chloride concentration and includes its amino-terminal phosphorylation. Co-expressed Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) has been proposed to interact with NKCC2. We hypothesized that THP modulates NKCC2 activity in TAL. THP-deficient mice (THP−/−) showed an increased abundance of intracellular NKCC2 located in subapical vesicles (+47% compared with wild type (WT) mice), whereas base-line phosphorylation of NKCC2 was significantly decreased (−49% compared with WT mice), suggesting reduced activity of the transporter in the absence of THP. Cultured TAL cells with low endogenous THP levels and low base-line phosphorylation of NKCC2 displayed sharp increases in NKCC2 phosphorylation (+38%) along with a significant change of intracellular chloride concentration upon transfection with THP. In NKCC2-expressing frog oocytes, co-injection with THP cRNA significantly enhanced the activation of NKCC2 under low chloride hypotonic stress (+112% versus +235%). Short term (30 min) stimulation of the vasopressin V2 receptor pathway by V2 receptor agonist (deamino-cis-d-Arg vasopressin) resulted in enhanced NKCC2 phosphorylation in WT mice and cultured TAL cells transfected with THP, whereas in the absence of THP, NKCC2 phosphorylation upon deamino-cis-d-Arg vasopressin was blunted in both systems. Attenuated effects of furosemide along with functional and structural adaptation of the distal convoluted tubule in THP−/− mice supported the notion that NaCl reabsorption was impaired in TAL lacking THP.

Thirteen- to fourteen-week-old WT and THP−/− mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (0.9% saline) or furosemide (40 mg/kg body weight in saline; Sigma). Urine was then collected in metabolic cages for 4 h. Urinary sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine concentrations were determined. Thirteen- to fourteen-week-old WT and THP−/− mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight). After placing the animals on a thermostat table (37 °C), surgical implantation of a tracheal catheter (for sufficient respiratory function), an arterial catheter (into the right carotid artery for blood pressure control), and a urinary catheter (into the bladder for urine collection) was performed. To obtain sufficient volumes in the urine fractions, osmotic diuresis was induced by intraarterial infusion of 3.2% mannitol plus 3.2% glucose in water (2 ml/h). Urine fractions were collected every 15 min. After induction of osmotic diuresis, four consecutive urine fractions were collected (fractions 1–4). Vehicle or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 50 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) were then administered intraperitoneally, and the following six consecutive urine fractions were collected (fractions 5–10).

Gold particles were attributed to the apical cell membrane when located near (within 20 nm of distance) or within the bilayer; particles found below 20 nm of distance to the membrane up to a depth of 2 μm or until the nuclear envelope were assigned to cytoplasmic localization. The fractional volume of DCT segments among strains was measured by light microscopy according to previously characterized methods (36Ellison D.H. Velázquez H. Wright F.S. J. Clin.

Briefly, 5-μm-thick paraffin sections were stained for NCC whose localization is restricted to the DCT. Cortical areas extending between the renal capsule and the outer medullary boundary were evaluated. Sections were photographed, and a transparent grid with rectangular crossed lines was electronically superimposed on the micrographs; the distances between lines corresponded to 50 μm. The proportion of grid intersections over DCT segments was expressed as the fractional volume of DCT. Methods used were as described previously (29Mutig K. Saritas T. Uchida S. Kahl T. Borowski T.

Briefly, kidneys were homogenized in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1; Sigma), pH 7.5. The homogenates were subjected to sequential centrifugation steps to obtain post-nuclear fractions (1,000 × g, 15 min), low speed fractions containing large membrane fragments (17,000 × g for 1 h), and high speed fractions enriched in cytoplasmic vesicles (200,000 × g for 1 h). Thirty μg of protein/lane were run on 10% polyacrylamide minigels. After electrophoretic transfer, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies against NKCC2, pNKCC2, Ser(P)-71-NCC, THP, flotillin-1 (BD Biosciences), or β-actin (Sigma) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako Cytomation; 1:3000), induction of chemiluminescence, exposure of x-ray films, and densitometric evaluation. Experimental data were evaluated by Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Values are given as the means ± S.D. or ± S.E. where appropriate. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (Version 12.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Protein A gold immunocytochemistry was applied to compare the intracellular distribution of NKCC2 in medullary TAL between WT and THP−/− mice. Double-staining with gold particles of different size was performed to analyze topographical relations between NKCC2 and THP. NKCC2 was frequently co-localized with THP in the apical membrane and subapical vesicles at a resolution of less than 10 nm (Fig. 1a). Quantification of NKCC2 immunoreactivity in the apical membrane revealed no differences between WT and THP−/− mice, whereas in the subapical vesicle compartment, NKCC2 signal density was significantly higher in THP−/− compared with WT mice (+47%; p < 0.05). Accordingly, overall immunogold NKCC2 signal was significantly higher in THP−/− than in WT mice (+27%; p < 0.05; Fig. 1, b–d). Cellular distribution of NKCC2 was further evaluated by Western blot analysis from cell fractions obtained by either high speed or low speed differential fractionation of kidney homogenates. Densitometric quantification revealed an increase of NKCC2 signal in the vesicle-enriched high speed fractions of THP−/− compared with WT mice (+75%; p < 0.05; Fig. 2, a and c), whereas the low speed fractions were not different. Along with our previous data (15Bachmann S. Mutig K. Bates J. Welker P. Geist B. Gross V. Luft F.C. Alenina N. Bader M. Thiele B.J. Prasadan K. Raffi H.S. Kumar S. Am. J. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2029463176,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous and highly aggressive malignancy, for which there are no effective cures. Identification of a malignant stemlike subtype of HCC may offer patients with a dismal prognosis a potential targeted therapy using c-MET and Wnt pathway inhibitors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as diagnostic and prognostic tools for cancer detection and stratification. Using a TRE-c-Met-driven transgenic HCC mouse model, we identified a cluster of 23 miRNAs that is encoded within the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted region on chromosome 12qF1 overexpressed in all of the isolated liver tumors. Interestingly, this region is conserved among mammalian species and maps to the human DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32.2. We thus examined the expression of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster in a cohort of 97 hepatitis B virus-associated HCC patients and identified a subgroup (n = 18) of patients showing strong coordinate overexpression of miRNAs in this cluster but not in other cancer types (breast, lung, kidney, stomach, and colon) that were tested. Expression levels of imprinted gene transcripts from neighboring loci in this 14q32.2 region and from a subset of other imprinted sites were concomitantly elevated in human HCC. Interestingly, overexpression of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster was positively correlated with HCC stem cell markers (CD133, CD90, EpCAM, Nestin) and associated with a high level of serum α-fetoprotein, a conventional biomarker for liver cancer, and poor survival rate in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that coordinate up-regulation of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster at 14q32.2 may define a novel molecular (stem cell-like) subtype of HCC associated with poor prognosis."

To develop a therapeutic agent against Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, we screened chemical compounds and successfully found that digoxin inhibited IL-17 production. Further studies revealed that digoxin bound to the ligand binding domain of RORγt and suppressed Th17 differentiation without affecting Th1 differentiation. To better understand the structural basis for the inhibitory activity of digoxin, we determined the crystal structure of the RORγt ligand-binding domain in complex with digoxin at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals that digoxin binds to the ligand-binding pocket protruding between helices H3 and H11 from the pocket. In addition, digoxin disrupts the key interaction important for the agonistic activity, resulting in preventing the positioning of helix H12 in the active conformation, thus antagonizing coactivator interaction. Functional studies demonstrated that digoxin inhibited RORγt activity and decreased IL-17 production but not RORα activity. Digoxin inhibited IL-17 production in CD4(+) T cells from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice. Our data indicates that RORγt is a promising therapeutic target for Th17-derived autoimmune diseases and our structural data will help to design novel RORγt antagonists."

Furthermore, we show that PA competes with the mTORC1 inhibitor, FK506 binding protein 38 (FKBP38), for mTOR binding at a site encompassing the rapamycin-FKBP12 binding domain.

As a protein Ser/Thr kinase, mTOR exists in two biochemically and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that mediate rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive signaling, respectively. The two complexes are defined by the presence of raptor in mTORC1 and rictor in mTORC2, although they also contain other components (2Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin.

The best characterized substrates of mTORC1 kinase are ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, phosphorylation at Thr-389) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, phosphorylation at Thr-37/46), both regulators of protein synthesis and both critically involved in mTOR regulation of cell growth and proliferation (4Fingar D.C.

The target of the GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC is the small G protein Rheb, which activates mTORC1 signaling (10Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for Rheb activation of mTORC1. 1) Direct binding of Rheb to mTOR stimulates the kinase activity of mTORC1 (11Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). 2) As an effector for Rheb, phospholipase D (PLD) mediates Rheb activation of mTORC1 (12Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 3) Rheb displaces FKBP38, an inhibitor of mTORC1 kinase, and consequently activates mTORC1 (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory, and subsequently many others, has established the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) as a key mediator of mitogenic activation of mTORC1 (14Fang Y.

PA interacts with the FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) of mTOR with remarkable specificity, and this interaction is disrupted by FKBP12-rapamycin (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Recently, a solution structure of the FRB·PA complex (19Veverka V. Crabbe T. Bird I. Lennie G. Muskett F.W. Taylor R.J. Carr M.D. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has validated the biochemically derived knowledge of FRB-PA interaction. As a signaling lipid, PA has been found to have many effectors (20Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Membrane translocation of the protein upon binding to PA is a major mechanism by which PA regulates its effectors, but PA is also believed to allosterically regulate the enzymatic activities of some of its effectors (20Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism or a common mode for the allosteric effect of PA has not emerged, partly because of the lack of any well defined PA-binding module in PA effectors. Although it is well established that PA activates mTORC1 signaling in cells, the mechanism behind this activation has remained a long-standing puzzle. There is no evidence for PA induction of mTOR membrane translocation, and our earlier experimental evidence also argued against the possibility of PA activating mTOR catalytic activity (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Fang Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, recent advances in the understanding of the biochemistry and signaling of mTOR have prompted us to reconsider the role of PA in the context of mTOR kinase activity. Here we report that PA directly activates mTORC1 kinase through a dual mechanism: displacement of the endogenous inhibitor FKBP38 from mTOR and allosteric activation of the kinase.

The following plasmids were described previously: Myc-S6K1 (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J.

Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed with PolyFect (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' recommendations. All shRNAs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich in the pLKO.1-puro vector (MISSION® shRNA). Lentivirus packaging and testing were performed as described previously (25Yoon M.S. Chen J. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were infected with the lentiviruses in growth medium containing 6 μg/ml polybrene, followed by selection in 1.5 μg/ml puromycin for 3–4 days. The scramble and PLD1 TRC shRNA clones were described previously (12Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Human FKBP38 shRNA was TRCN0000010595. PA, PC, and C8-PA vesicles were made by water bath sonication. Lipids in chloroform were dried under nitrogen in a 1.5-ml tube, resuspended in 250 μl of vesicle buffer (150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH8.0)) by vortexing briefly to yield a final lipid concentration of 6 mm. The lipid suspension was then sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies, Hicksville, NY, model G112SPIT, 600 volt, 80 kc, and 0.5 A) for 5 min. This procedure is expected to yield small unilamellar vesicles with diameters in the range of 15–50 nm. Lipid vesicles were made freshly before each experiment and were either added directly to cell medium or used in binding assays (see below) at the final concentrations indicated in the figures. GST fusion proteins (GST-mTOR(1967–2191), GST-56K1 (332–421), GST-FKBP38, and GST-FKBP12) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using glutathione beads, and cleaved of the GST tag as described previously (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Purified GST-FKBP38 and mTOR(1967–2191) proteins were mixed at 5 μg each and incubated on ice in 500 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) for 15 min. Where applicable, PA vesicles (50% PA + 50% PC) or PC vesicles (100% PC) at the final concentrations indicated in the figures were preincubated with mTOR(1967–2191) for 15 min prior to addition of GST-FKBP38. Glutathione beads were used to pull down GST fusion proteins, and the beads were washed with binding buffer followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer and Western blot analysis. Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1× Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.3% CHAPS). The supernatant after microcentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min was collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with various antibodies in the lysis buffer. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) followed by incubation with various antibodies according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was performed with Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification of Western band intensities was performed by densitometry of x-ray film images using Image J software. mTORC1 and mTORC2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-raptor and anti-rictor antibodies, respectively, followed by incubation with protein G agarose beads. The kinase assays were performed following procedures described by Ikenoue et al. (26Ikenoue T. Hong S. Inoki K. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). mTORC1 kinase assays were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 250 μm ATP, with 100 ng GST-S6K1 as the substrate. mTORC2 kinase assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm ATP, with 250 ng His-Akt as the substrate. Where applicable, PA or PC vesicles and/or FKBP38 were added to the immunocomplexes 15 min before initiation of the kinase assay by the addition of ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling. To evaluate a potential effect of PA on the kinase activity of mTOR in cells, we examined the phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser-2481, an autophosphorylation site that has recently been reported to monitor mTORC-specific catalytic activities (27Soliman G.A. Acosta-Jaquez H.A. Dunlop E.A. Ekim B. Maj N.E. Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7866-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To avoid potential complications from exogenous PA-derived lysophosphatidic acid (28Billon-Denis E. Tanfin Z. Robin P. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 295-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which would initiate signaling through the membrane-bound lysophosphatidic acid receptors, we used a short-chain PA (C8-PA) for delivery into cells, which would not be converted into active lysophosphatidic acid (29van Corven E.J. van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. van der Bend R.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Fischer D.J. Nusser N. Virag T. Yokoyama K. Wang D. Baker D.L. Bautista D. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 776-784PubMed Google Scholar). mTORC1 and mTORC2 were isolated from HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitation of raptor and rictor, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, C8-PA treatment of the cells in the absence of any mitogen induced Ser-2481 phosphorylation of raptor-associated mTOR. Rictor-associated mTOR, on the other hand, displayed a higher basal level of phospho-Ser-2481 that was not affected by PA stimulation. PA activation of mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-389, whereas phospho-Ser-473-Akt, an indicator of mTORC2 signaling, was not detectable upon PA treatment (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that PA activates mTORC1 but not mTORC2 kinase activity in cells. Next, we asked whether PA could directly activate mTORC1 kinase in vitro. We had previously found the FRB domain of mTOR to bind specifically to the PA-containing vesicles in vitro, and not vesicles of other lipid compositions including PC, phosphatidylethanol, phosphatidylserine, and various phosphatidylinositides (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed with immunoprecipitated endogenous mTORC1 and bacterially purified GST-S6K1 as a substrate. Vesicles containing 50% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PA and 50% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC were added to the kinase reaction, with 100% PC vesicles as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, PA stimulated the in vitro kinase activity of mTORC1, whereas PC had no effect. Most likely because of a narrow dynamic range of the in vitro assay, the effects of PA vesicles were similar at 100 μm and 200 μm (Fig. 2A) and mild at 20–50 μm (data not shown). The kinase activity of mTORC2, assayed with Akt as a substrate, was unaffected by PA vesicles at the same concentrations (Fig. 2B). The degrees of S6K1 and Akt phosphorylation were measured by densitometry to quantify the kinase activities (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). These data demonstrate that PA selectively activates mTORC1 kinase in vitro. To probe into the mechanism by which PA activates mTORC1 kinase, we considered the role of FKBP38 as an endogenous inhibitor of mTORC1 (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Because FKBP38 binds mTOR through a region that overlaps with the PA-binding FRB domain (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), it appeared plausible that PA could compete with FKBP38 for mTOR binding as a mechanism of activating mTORC1. However, although several groups independently demonstrated a role of FKBP38 as a negative regulator of mTORC1 (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Dunlop E.A. Dodd K.M. Seymour L.A. Tee A.R. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Peng L. Liang D. Tong W. Li J. Yuan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20870-20881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), others challenged this conclusion (33Maehama T. Tanaka M. Nishina H. Murakami M. Kanaho Y. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35053-35059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Fonseca B.D. Tang H. Liu R. Elia A. Clemens M.J. Bommer U.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30482-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, we deemed it necessary to reexamine the role of FKBP38 in mTORC1 signaling in the Chen laboratory. We found that overexpression of FKBP38 in HEK293 cells inhibited serum-stimulated phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4EBP1 (supplemental Fig. S1A), whereas knockdown of endogenous FKBP38 enhanced the phosphorylation of those mTORC1 targets (supplemental Fig. S1B). To test the hypothesis that PA competes with FKBP38 for mTOR binding, we first performed in vitro binding assays with bacterially expressed and purified mTOR fragment (amino acids 1967–2191) and GST-FKBP38. The specific interaction between mTOR(1967–2191) and FKBP38 (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) was confirmed by GST pull-down assays (Fig. 3A). Importantly, preincubation with PA vesicles but not PC vesicles disrupted the interaction between GST-FKBP38 and mTOR(1967–2191) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Thus, a competition between PA and FKBP38 for binding to the mTOR fragment is evident in vitro. It is not feasible to mimic physiological concentrations in the in vitro vesicle binding assays, as local concentrations of PA in a cell are not known (but could conceivably be very high). We also confirmed the interaction between FKBP38 and full-length mTOR by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged FKBP38 and mTOR (Fig. 3C), the latter expressed at a level comparable with endogenous mTOR (data not shown). Moreover, the FKBP38-mTOR interaction was disrupted when cells were exposed to C8-PA (Fig. 3C). PLD1 is responsible for the production of PA upstream of mTORC1 (16Sun Y. Chen J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Fang Y. Park I.H. Wu A.L. Du G. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Chen J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2037-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When PLD1 was knocked down, accompanied by diminished S6K1 phosphorylation as expected, an increased amount of mTOR was associated with FKBP38 (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the FKBP38-mTOR interaction is disrupted by PLD1 signaling and PA. Next, we asked whether the PA/FKBP38 competition for mTOR binding would manifest into an antagonistic relationship on the regulation of mTORC1 kinase activity. Purified FKBP38 inhibited the in vitro kinase activity of mTORC1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous reports (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Dunlop E.A. Dodd K.M. Seymour L.A. Tee A.R. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FKBP12 added at the same concentrations did not have any effect (Fig. 4A), confirming the specificity of FKBP38 inhibition of mTORC1. Significantly, the presence of PA vesicles but not PC vesicles in the reaction rescued kinase activity from FKBP38 inhibition (Fig. 4B), suggesting that PA directly antagonizes the inhibitory effect of FKBP38 in vitro. We also examined the relationship between PA and FKBP38 in the context of mTORC1 signaling in cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, C8-PA stimulation of S6K1 phosphorylation in the absence of any mitogen was inhibited by FKBP38 overexpression. On the other hand, inhibition of serum-activation of S6K1 by overexpressed FKBP38 was reversed by exogenous PA (Fig. 5B). We did not observe a reversal of FKBP38 inhibition of mTORC1 signaling with increasing C8-PA concentrations in the absence of any other mitogen (data not shown), possibly because of limited delivery efficiency of exogenous PA. It is also not feasible to estimate or mimic physiological concentrations of PA, as endogenous PA may be highly localized. Nevertheless, our data, taken together, are fully consistent with the model that PA activates mTORC1 by antagonizing FKBP38 both in vitro and in cells. If removing FKBP38 were the sole mechanism for PA activation of mTORC1, one would expect that in the absence of FKBP38 PA would not further stimulate mTORC1. To probe into this issue, we knocked down FKBP38. As shown in Fig. 6A, the level of endogenous FKBP38 was drastically reduced by lentivirus-delivered shRNA, which was accompanied by modestly increased S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in serum-starved cells. Interestingly, exogenous C8-PA further stimulated mTORC1 signaling despite the FKBP38 knockdown (Fig. 6A). The dramatic degree of stimulation is unlikely to be explained by any residual FKBP38 protein after knockdown. Rather, these data strongly suggest that displacement of FKBP38 alone is insufficient for PA activation of mTORC1 signaling. Nevertheless, this does not contradict the necessity of FKBP38 displacement by PA for the activation. To assess the role of endogenous PA, we knocked down PLD1. If the predominant role of PA were to remove FKBP38, we would expect that in the absence of FKBP38 PLD1 would no longer be essential for mTORC1 signaling. However, we found that PLD1 knockdown abolished the ability of FKBP38 knockdown to induce mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 2 and 4). This is consistent with the observation in Fig. 6A suggesting that PA is required for mTORC1 activation in addition to removing FKBP38. PLD1 knockdown alone did not have an obvious effect on the basal activity of mTORC1 (Fig. 6B), as expected (18Fang Y. Park I.H. Wu A.L. Du G. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Chen J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2037-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It was noted that FKBP38 knockdown was less efficient, and the effect on mTORC1 signaling less pronounced, when the cells were infected by both FKBP38 and PLD1 shRNA lentiviruses (compare Fig. 6, A and B), likely because selection of cells infected by two types of viruses relied on the same drug (puromycin). Nevertheless, this FKBP38 reduction led to reproducible mTORC1 activation that was eliminated by PLD1 knockdown, as clearly shown by the quantitative measurements of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). To further validate the observations above, we carried out in vitro kinase assays with mTORC1 isolated from FKBP38 knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, PA vesicles stimulated the kinase activity of FKBP38-deficient mTORC1, supporting the notion that PA has a positive role in the absence of FKBP38. Of note, the immunoprecipitated mTORC1 activity was indistinguishable between FKBP38 knockdown and control cells both in the presence and absence of added PA vesicles (Fig. 6D), suggesting that even without knockdown the amount of FKBP38 associated with the mTORC1 complex under our experimental conditions was most likely negligible. Therefore, in addition to displacing FKBP38, PA also activates mTORC1 through another mechanism. The other known inhibitors of mTORC1 are PRAS40 and DEPTOR, both of which would be absent in the mTORC1 immunoprecipitate here as it was subjected to a high salt (500 mm NaCl) wash that removed these two proteins (Refs. 35Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R. Lindquist R.A. Kang S.A. Spooner E. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 36Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar and data not shown). The in vitro assay system also made it virtually impossible for PA to recruit an activator. Hence, collectively, the current observations point to the simplest model: that the physical interaction between PA and mTOR exerts an allosteric effect that is required for the kinase activity of mTORC1 after displacement of FKBP38, although the involvement of a third factor (an unknown inhibitor) cannot be formally excluded. Our studies have revealed direct activation of the mTORC1 kinase by phosphatidic acid and identified a dual mechanism by which PA activates mTORC1: displacing FKBP38 and exerting an allosteric effect on the catalytic activity. These findings provide answers to the long-standing question of how PA activates mTOR signaling. The new mechanistic insights may facilitate the exploration of the tremendous therapeutic potential of this signaling network. It is noteworthy that we had previously failed to observe an effect of PA on mTOR catalytic activity (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Fang Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One plausible explanation for the discrepancy may come from the conditions of isolating mTOR for in vitro kinase assays. In previous studies we had used Triton X-100 as the detergent in cell lysis prior to mTOR immunoprecipitation, whereas in this study, CHAPS was used and mTORC1 was isolated by raptor pull-down. As reported by Kim et al. (22Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar), the raptor-mTOR interaction would be disrupted by Triton. The loss of raptor might have prevented PA activation of mTORC1. We had previously reported a mutation in mTOR (R2109A) that had dampened FRB binding to PA in vitro and mTOR signaling in cells by ∼50% (14Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This mTOR mutant, however, did not display differential sensitivity to PA compared with WT mTOR in FKBP38 binding (data not shown). It is possible that limitations in the vesicle binding assay and cellular delivery of C8-PA render insufficient dynamic ranges to discern the partial defect of the R2109A mutant. With the solution structure of the FRB-PA complex (19Veverka V. Crabbe T. Bird I. Lennie G. Muskett F.W. Taylor R.J. Carr M.D. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as a guide, identification of additional mutations in FRB that drastically disrupt the PA-FRB interaction may be possible. Such mutants would be desirable for future investigations of PA in the regulation of mTORC1. Although our present data suggest that PA selectively activates mTORC1 and not mTORC2 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2), it has been proposed by Foster and colleagues (37Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that PA is required for the assembly of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. These two conclusions need not be mutually exclusive. In this study, we examined PA for its acute effect in stimulating cells and in directly activating mTOR kinase. On the other hand, the effects that Toschi et al. (37Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have observed may stem from a basal level of PA in maintaining the integrity of mTOR complexes prior to activation of the kinases. It will be interesting in future investigations to determine whether the activation of mTORC1 and assembly of mTOR complexes share the same mode of PA-mTOR interaction or represent two molecularly distinct mechanisms of PA action. The recent controversy surrounding the role of FKBP38 in regulating mTORC1 prompted us to reexamine this reported endogenous inhibitor, and our results described here clearly support the model that FKBP38 binds and inhibits mTORC1. We and others (31Dunlop E.A. Dodd K.M. Seymour L.A. Tee A.R. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) observed that recombinant FKBP38 inhibited mTORC1 signaling in cells only when it was highly overexpressed, which may explain the absence of the effect of FKBP38 in similar experiments performed by some groups (33Maehama T. Tanaka M. Nishina H. Murakami M. Kanaho Y. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35053-35059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Fonseca B.D. Tang H. Liu R. Elia A. Clemens M.J. Bommer U.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30482-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The requirement of high levels of recombinant FKBP38 to exert an inhibitory effect on mTORC1 does not necessarily mean the FKBP38 mechanism is an inefficient one. One could envision that endogenous FKBP38 might be highly localized for its mTORC1-regulating function and/or that high concentrations of FKBP38 might be necessary to set a threshold to ensure signaling fidelity. In vitro, the inhibitory effect of recombinant FKBP38 on mTORC1 kinase activity was easily detected (Fig. 4A), most likely because of the condition of mTORC1 isolation that led to the dissociation of endogenous FKBP38. The reported ability of Rheb to bind FKBP38 and displace it from mTOR (13Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) has also been disputed (34Wang X. Fonseca B.D. Tang H. Liu R. Elia A. Clemens M.J. Bommer U.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30482-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Uhlenbrock K. Weiwad M. Wetzker R. Fischer G. Wittinghofer A. Rubio I. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have not examined the role of Rheb in our studies, as our proposed mode of PA action is independent of Rheb-FKBP38 interaction, although it does not exclude the involvement of Rheb. Displacement of FKBP38 appears to be a simple and effective way for PA to activate the mTOR kinase, and yet, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of PA regulating an effector through removing an inhibitor. mTOR also joins a small roster of PA effectors, the enzymatic activities of which are allosterically regulated by PA binding (20Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The only other protein kinase that has been reported to be activated by PA through a possible allosteric effect is Fer, a tyrosine kinase that regulates actin polymerization in cell migration (39Itoh T. Hasegawa J. Tsujita K. Kanaho Y. Takenawa T. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other than the fact that PA binds at a site N-terminal to the kinase domain, mTOR and Fer do not share any common feature in their PA binding domains. Because PA stimulates mTORC1 activity on an autophosphorylation site but not mTORC2 activity on the same site (Fig. 1), the allosteric effect of PA is unlikely to simply confer catalytic activation or substrate specificity of the kinase domain. Other components in mTORC1, raptor in particular, most likely play an integral role. Future structural studies will be needed to shed light on the exact mode of allosteric regulation by PA of mTOR, or of any other kinase. Download .pdf (.52 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2067891918,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into permissive cells is a complex process that involves interactions with at least four co-factors followed by endocytosis and low pH-dependent fusion with endosomes. The precise sequence of receptor engagement and their roles in promoting HCV E1E2 glycoprotein-mediated fusion are poorly characterized. Because cell-free HCV tolerates an acidic environment, we hypothesized that binding to one or more receptors on the cell surface renders E1E2 competent to undergo low pH-induced conformational changes and promote fusion with endosomes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of low pH and of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CD81, one of the four entry factors, on HCV infectivity. Pretreatment with an acidic buffer or with ECL2 enhanced infection through changing the E1E2 conformation, as evidenced by the altered reactivity of these proteins with conformation-specific antibodies and stable association with liposomes. However, neither of the two treatments alone permitted direct fusion with the cell plasma membrane. Sequential HCV preincubation with ECL2 and acidic buffer in the absence of target cells resulted in a marked loss of infectivity, implying that the receptor-bound HCV is primed for low pH-dependent conformational changes. Indeed, soluble receptor-pretreated HCV fused with the cell plasma membrane at low pH under conditions blocking an endocytic entry pathway. These findings suggest that CD81 primes HCV for low pH-dependent fusion early in the entry process. The simple triggering paradigm and intermediate conformations of E1E2 identified in this study could help guide future vaccine and therapeutic efforts to block HCV infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into permissive cells is a complex process that involves interactions with at least four co-factors followed by endocytosis and low pH-dependent fusion with endosomes. The precise sequence of receptor engagement and their roles in promoting HCV E1E2 glycoprotein-mediated fusion are poorly characterized. Because cell-free HCV tolerates an acidic environment, we hypothesized that binding to one or more receptors on the cell surface renders E1E2 competent to undergo low pH-induced conformational changes and promote fusion with endosomes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of low pH and of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CD81, one of the four entry factors, on HCV infectivity. Pretreatment with an acidic buffer or with ECL2 enhanced infection through changing the E1E2 conformation, as evidenced by the altered reactivity of these proteins with conformation-specific antibodies and stable association with liposomes. However, neither of the two treatments alone permitted direct fusion with the cell plasma membrane. Sequential HCV preincubation with ECL2 and acidic buffer in the absence of target cells resulted in a marked loss of infectivity, implying that the receptor-bound HCV is primed for low pH-dependent conformational changes. Indeed, soluble receptor-pretreated HCV fused with the cell plasma membrane at low pH under conditions blocking an endocytic entry pathway. These findings suggest that CD81 primes HCV for low pH-dependent fusion early in the entry process. The simple triggering paradigm and intermediate conformations of E1E2 identified in this study could help guide future vaccine and therapeutic efforts to block HCV infection.

CD81 belongs to the tetraspanin family and thus contains two extracellular loops, of which the second larger loop (ECL2) specifically binds to the HCV E2 glycoprotein (7Bertaux C. Dragic T. J.

Claudin-1 and occludin also consist of four transmembrane domains but are functionally distinct from tetraspanins. The HCV entry determinants of claudin-1 and occludin have been mapped to the first and the second extracellular loops of these proteins, respectively (4Evans M.J. von Hahn T. Tscherne D.M. Syder A.J.

Considering that all four HCV entry co-factors are expressed in non-liver tissues (1Perrault M. Pécheur E.I. Biochem. J. 2009; 423: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Ploss A.

It is thus likely that the relative expression levels of entry co-factors, their spatial organization, and/or interactions with each other render a cell permissive to infection (15Lupberger J.

The above considerations demonstrate the importance of understanding the sequence of HCV-receptor interactions and elucidating the mechanism by which the viral glycoproteins are triggered to mediate membrane fusion. Despite extensive efforts, the early steps of HCV entry and fusion are poorly characterized. The initial virus attachment to cells occurs through binding to glycosaminoglycans and the LDL receptor (17Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A very slow constitutive endocytosis of CD81 (23Petracca R. Falugi F. Galli G. Norais N. Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Burgio V. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Grandi G. J.

Indeed, actin-dependent relocation of CD81 to the cell junction area in the presence of the soluble E2 ectodomain (28Brazzoli M. Bianchi A. Filippini S. Weiner A. Zhu Q. Pizza M. Crotta S. J.

After interacting with the requisite co-factors, HCV enters permissive cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and low pH-dependent fusion with endosomes (24Blanchard E. Belouzard S. Goueslain L.

On one hand, the reactivity of conformation-specific antibodies with E2 is altered after HCV exposure to low pH in the absence of cellular receptors (32Op De Beeck A. Voisset C. Bartosch B.

Furthermore, exposure to low pH reportedly failed to induce virus fusion with the plasma membrane, suggesting the requirement for endosomal entry and the existence of additional virus trafficking-dependent steps that trigger HCV fusion (25Meertens L. Bertaux C. Dragic T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11571-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To elucidate the complex mechanism of HCV entry, it is essential to determine the functional roles of E1 and E2 in this process and identify the factors that trigger their refolding. Knowledge of the mechanism by which E1E2 is activated to mediate fusion is essential for designing urgently needed antiviral strategies, which have been successfully implemented for other viruses (see for example Refs. 35Tilton J.C. Doms R.W. Antiviral Res. 2010; 85: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Hrobowski Y.M. Garry R.F. Michael S.F. Virol.

Enveloped viruses have evolved diverse strategies to respond to cellular cues and initiate fusion at desired sites. Viral fusion proteins are usually activated by two principal mechanisms, binding to cognate receptors on the cell surface (either directly or through an accessory protein) or low pH encountered in endosomes (38Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285: 25-66PubMed Google Scholar, 39Melikyan G.B. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Entry of the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) is a well characterized example of the “hybrid” two-step triggering mechanism that involves receptor priming and low pH-induced fusion with endosomes (40Melikyan G.B.

Cell. 2000; 103: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The lack of HCV inactivation at low pH (25Meertens L. Bertaux C. Dragic T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11571-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31Tscherne D.M. Jones C.T. Evans M.J. Lindenbach B.D. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that, by analogy to ASLV, native E1E2 glycoproteins do not refold under acidic conditions but acquire the sensitivity to low pH following their interactions with one or several HCV entry factors. Here, we develop a tractable experimental system for studies of HCV activation and low pH-dependent fusion. We show that HCV pretreatment with an acidic buffer or with the soluble CD81 fragment increased infectivity, whereas sequential incubation with the receptor and low pH in the absence of a target membrane irreversibly diminished the ability of the virus to enter permissive cells. The soluble receptor and low pH applied separately or in combination promoted conformational changes in E1E2, as evidenced by the altered binding of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies and greatly enhanced association of the E2 ectodomain with liposomes. Importantly, irreversible refolding of the soluble receptor-primed E1E2 upon exposure to an acidic buffer appeared to reflect conformational changes that drive virus fusion. This notion was supported by the significant level of low pH-induced fusion between the receptor-primed HCV and the cell plasma membrane under conditions blocking endosomal entry. Our findings suggest that, although other requisite receptors are essential for HCV entry, CD81 may be both necessary and sufficient to render E1E2 competent for fusion with acidic intracellular compartments.

The HCVcc luciferase reporter virus was generated by introducing the Renilla luciferase gene (amplified from the plasmid pCMV-Renilla (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA)) fused to a sequence encoding the foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide (44Donnelly M.L.

Wakita T. Bukh J. Grakoui A. Virology. 2008; 376: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by PCR. Purified plasmid DNA was linearized, and the remaining overhanging nucleotides were eliminated by mung bean nuclease digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). After extraction with phenol/chloroform, purified plasmid was precipitated and transcribed using a MEGAscript® High Yield T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of in vitro transcribed RNA was electroporated in 8 × 106 Huh-7.5 cells, previously trypsinized, and washed once in cold PBS, using an ECM 830 apparatus (BTX Genetronics) with five pulses of 99 μs at 820 V over 1.1 s. Cells were resuspended in 16 ml of complete growth medium and cultivated for 4 days. Supernatants were harvested, filtered, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. To assess levels of infectivity, Huh-7.5 cells were infected with supernatants for 48 h and lysed to test for Renilla expression. Huh-7.5 cells (2·104) grown on 96-well plates were infected with HCVpp, HCVcc, or control pseudoparticles using a spinoculation protocol (46Miyauchi K. Kim Y. Latinovic O. Morozov V. Melikyan G.B. Cell. 2009; 137: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were centrifuged with viruses at 2900 × g for 50 min at 4 °C (Sorvall Legend RT, Kendro). The extent of infection was evaluated based on the luciferase activity 48 h postinfection. The approximate multiplicity of infection estimated using the enhanced GFP-expressing HCVpp was 0.1–0.2 (supplemental Fig. 1A). To infect cells with substrate-immobilized viruses, HCVpp or HCVcc were first adhered to 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) coated with poly-l-lysine. One hundred μl of viral suspension was added to each well, and microplates were centrifuged, as above. Immobilized particles were washed and overlaid with Huh-7.5 cells that were detached from Petri dishes, using a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution Cell StripperTM (Cellgro, Manassas, VA), and resuspended in a complete growth medium. To accelerate cell attachment, the plates were centrifuged at 180 × g for 1 min at room temperature and maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 48 h. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase expression was measured with the Bright-Glo luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) for HCVpp and SFVpp or the Renilla luciferase-based kit for infectious HCVcc, as per the manufacturer's instructions, using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Unless stated otherwise, viruses were allowed to adhere to a polylysine-coated 96-well plate and then blocked with 5% FBS in PBS for 1 h on ice. Immobilized viruses were pretreated with citrate buffer (20 mm citric acid, 150 mm NaCl) adjusted to either pH 5.2 or 7.3. Treatment was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. Cell-free and cell-attached viruses were exposed to DMEM at pH 7.3 or adjusted to pH 5.2 with a predetermined amount of HCl. The choice of an acidic buffer did not affect the results. Receptor priming was carried out by preincubating the viruses with human or mouse ECL2 (hECL2 and mECL2, respectively) for 30 min on ice followed by an additional incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Viruses were washed to remove unbound ECL2, exposed to pH 5.2 or 7.3 for 10 min at 37 °C, and overlaid with Huh-7.5 cells in growth medium. The luciferase activity was determined at 48 h post-infection. Virus suspension (100 μl) was preincubated with 2.5 μg of hECL2 (final concentration 25 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice and 30 min at 37 °C or left untreated. Huh-7.5 cells were incubated in the absence or in the presence of BafA1 (50 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and viruses (with or without ECL2) were spinoculated onto cells in the cold. Cells were washed with cold PBS to remove unbound viruses and overlaid with prewarmed pH 7.3 or 5.2 solution (DMEM adjusted to a desired pH with HCl) either immediately or after 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, DMEM was supplemented with 50 nm BafA1. The treatment with pH 7.3 or pH 5.2 buffers was carried out for 10 mi"
https://openalex.org/W2076872383,"Six Great White Spot (GWS) events have been observed in the atmosphere of Saturn since 1876. These giant convective storms occur roughly once every Saturnian year (equal to 29.5 Earth years). The sixth GWS erupted in December 2010 and has been the subject of intense observation. Two papers in this issue present the details of some of these observations. Sánchez-Lavega et al. report that the storm developed at northern latitudes in the peak of a weak westward jet during early northern springtime. The storm head moved faster than the jet and triggered a disturbance that circled the planet. Numerical simulations show that Saturn's winds extend without decay deep down into the weather layer. Fischer et al. report that the storm reached a width of 10,000 kilometres within three weeks. Its lightning flash rates are an order of magnitude greater than those seen in previous storms, peaking at more than 10 flashes per second. Convective storms occur regularly in Saturn’s atmosphere1,2,3,4. Huge storms known as Great White Spots, which are ten times larger than the regular storms, are rarer and occur about once per Saturnian year (29.5 Earth years). Current models propose that the outbreak of a Great White Spot is due to moist convection induced by water5,6. However, the generation of the global disturbance and its effect on Saturn’s permanent winds1,7 have hitherto been unconstrained8 by data, because there was insufficient spatial resolution and temporal sampling9,10,11 to infer the dynamics of Saturn’s weather layer (the layer in the troposphere where the cloud forms). Theoretically, it has been suggested that this phenomenon is seasonally controlled5,9,10. Here we report observations of a storm at northern latitudes in the peak of a weak westward jet during the beginning of northern springtime, in accord with the seasonal cycle but earlier than expected. The storm head moved faster than the jet, was active during the two-month observation period, and triggered a planetary-scale disturbance that circled Saturn but did not significantly alter the ambient zonal winds. Numerical simulations of the phenomenon show that, as on Jupiter12, Saturn’s winds extend without decay deep down into the weather layer, at least to the water-cloud base at pressures of 10–12 bar, which is much deeper than solar radiation penetrates."
https://openalex.org/W1995383659,"Glucocorticoid hormones, including dexamethasone, induce apoptosis in lymphocytes and consequently are used clinically as chemotherapeutic agents in many hematologic malignancies. Dexamethasone also induces autophagy in lymphocytes, although the mechanism is not fully elucidated. Through gene expression analysis, we found that dexamethasone induces the expression of a gene encoding a stress response protein variously referred to as Dig2, RTP801, or REDD1. This protein is reported to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Because autophagy is one outcome of mTOR inhibition, we investigated the hypothesis that Dig2/RTP801/REDD1 elevation contributes to autophagy induction in dexamethasone-treated lymphocytes. In support of this hypothesis, RNAi-mediated suppression of Dig2/RTP801/REDD1 reduces mTOR inhibition and autophagy in glucocorticoid-treated lymphocytes. We observed similar results in Dig2/Rtp801/Redd1 knock-out murine thymocytes treated with dexamethasone. Dig2/RTP801/REDD1 knockdown also leads to increased levels of dexamethasone-induced cell death, suggesting that Dig2/RTP801/REDD1-mediated autophagy promotes cell survival. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time that elevation of Dig2/RTP801/REDD1 contributes to the induction of autophagy."

These CCCs are oppositely regulated by serine-threonine phosphorylation, which activates NKCC1 but inhibits KCC2. The kinase(s) that performs this function in the nervous system are not known with certainty. WNK1 and WNK4, members of the WNK (with no lysine [K]) kinase family, either directly or via the downstream SPAK/OSR1 Ste20-type kinases, regulate the furosemide-sensitive NKCC2 and the thiazide-sensitive NCC, kidney-specific CCCs. What role the novel WNK2 kinase plays in this regulatory cascade, if any, is unknown. Here, we show that WNK2, unlike other WNKs, is not expressed in kidney; rather, it is a neuron-enriched kinase primarily expressed in neocortical pyramidal cells, thalamic relay cells, and cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells in both the developing and adult brain. Bumetanide-sensitive and Cl−-dependent 86Rb+ uptake assays in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that WNK2 promotes Cl− accumulation by reciprocally activating NKCC1 and inhibiting KCC2 in a kinase-dependent manner, effectively bypassing normal tonicity requirements for cotransporter regulation. TiO2 enrichment and tandem mass spectrometry studies demonstrate WNK2 forms a protein complex in the mammalian brain with SPAK, a known phosphoregulator of NKCC1. In this complex, SPAK is phosphorylated at Ser-383, a consensus WNK recognition site.

https://openalex.org/W2024700365,"Compound exocytosis is found in many cell types and is the major form of regulated secretion in acinar and mast cells. Its key characteristic is the homotypic fusion of secretory granules. These then secrete their combined output through a single fusion pore to the outside. The control of compound exocytosis remains poorly understood. Although soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) such as syntaxin 2, SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa), and SNAP25 have been suggested to play a role, none has been proven. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) is a SNARE first associated with endocytic processes but more recently has been suggested as an R-SNARE in regulated exocytosis. Secretion in acinar cells is reduced when VAMP8 function is inhibited and is less in VAMP8 knock-out mice. Based on electron microscopy experiments, it was suggested that VAMP8 may be involved in compound exocytosis. Here we have tested the hypothesis that VAMP8 controls homotypic granule-to-granule fusion during sequential compound exocytosis. We use a new assay to distinguish primary fusion events (fusion with the cell membrane) from secondary fusion events (granule-granule fusion). Our data show the pancreatic acinar cells from VAMP8 knock-out animals have a specific reduction in secondary granule fusion but that primary granule fusion is unaffected. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments show syntaxin 2 association with VAMP2, whereas syntaxin 3 associates with VAMP8. Taken together our data indicate that granule-to-granule fusion is regulated by VAMP8 containing SNARE complexes distinct from those that regulate primary granule fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2062412372,"The Swi2/Snf2 family of proteins uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt protein-DNA interactions, a process known as remodelling. In this study, Karl-Peter Hopfner and colleagues have solved the structure of the Mot1 ATPase in complex with the transcription factor TBP, which Mot1 displaces from promoters. The structure reveals how the ATPase specifically interacts with TBP and DNA, acting both to displace TBP and to prevent it from rebinding DNA. Swi2/Snf2-type ATPases regulate genome-associated processes such as transcription, replication and repair by catalysing the disruption, assembly or remodelling of nucleosomes or other protein–DNA complexes1,2. It has been suggested that ATP-driven motor activity along DNA disrupts target protein–DNA interactions in the remodelling reaction3,4,5. However, the complex and highly specific remodelling reactions are poorly understood, mostly because of a lack of high-resolution structural information about how remodellers bind to their substrate proteins. Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, denoted BTAF1 in humans) is a Swi2/Snf2 enzyme that specifically displaces the TATA box binding protein (TBP) from the promoter DNA and regulates transcription globally by generating a highly dynamic TBP pool in the cell6,7. As a Swi2/Snf2 enzyme that functions as a single polypeptide and interacts with a relatively simple substrate, Mot1 offers an ideal system from which to gain a better understanding of this important enzyme family. To reveal how Mot1 specifically disrupts TBP–DNA complexes, we combined crystal and electron microscopy structures of Mot1–TBP from Encephalitozoon cuniculi with biochemical studies. Here we show that Mot1 wraps around TBP and seems to act like a bottle opener: a spring-like array of 16 HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A and lipid kinase TOR) repeats grips the DNA-distal side of TBP via loop insertions, and the Swi2/Snf2 domain binds to upstream DNA, positioned to weaken the TBP–DNA interaction by DNA translocation. A ‘latch’ subsequently blocks the DNA-binding groove of TBP, acting as a chaperone to prevent DNA re-association and ensure efficient promoter clearance. This work shows how a remodelling enzyme can combine both motor and chaperone activities to achieve functional specificity using a conserved Swi2/Snf2 translocase."
https://openalex.org/W2012170303,"Agents to counteract acquired resistance to hormonal therapy for breast cancer would substantially enhance the long-term benefits of hormonal therapy. In the present study, we demonstrate how resveratrol (Res) inhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation, including MCF-7 tamoxifen-resistant cells (IC(50) values for viability were in the 30-45 μM range). We show that Res, through p38(MAPK) phosphorylation, causes induction of p53, which recruits at the estrogen receptor α (ERα) proximal promoter, leading to an inhibition of ERα expression in terms of mRNA and protein content. These events appear specifically p53 dependent, since they are drastically abrogated with p53-targeting siRNA. Coimmunoprecipitation assay showed specific interaction between p53, the Sin3A corepressor, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which was phosphorylated. The enhancement of the tripartite complex p53/Sin3A/HDAC1, together with NF-Y on Res treatment, was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, with a concomitant release of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II, thereby inhibiting the cell transcriptional machinery. The persistence of such effects in MCF-7 tamoxifen-resistant cells at a higher extent than parental MCF-7 cells addresses how Res may be considered a useful pharmacological tool to be exploited in the adjuvant settings for treatment of breast cancer developing hormonal resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1966460916,"We recently identified the liver X receptor-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase inducible degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL) as a modulator of lipoprotein metabolism. Acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, IDOL triggers ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). We demonstrate here that this outcome requires the conserved FERM and RING domains present in IDOL. The RING domain promotes ubiquitination in vitro and Lys-63-specific ubiquitination of the LDLR in vivo in response to IDOL or liver X receptor activation. We further identify RING residues that differentially influence ubiquitination of the LDLR or stability of IDOL. The FERM domain interacts with the LDLR and in living cells co-localizes with the receptor at the plasma membrane. Homology modeling revealed a phosphotyrosine-binding element embedded in the FERM domain. Mutating residues within this region or residues in the LDLR preceding the NPVY endocytosis motif abrogate LDLR degradation by IDOL. Collectively, our results indicate that both the FERM and RING domains are required for promoting lysosomal degradation of the LDLR by IDOL. Our findings may facilitate development of structure-based IDOL inhibitors aimed at increasing LDLR abundance in therapeutic strategies to treat cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2025653248,"We investigated the role of a Ca(2+) channel and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in osmotic stress-induced JNK activation and tight junction disruption in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Osmotic stress-induced tight junction disruption was attenuated by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) depletion. Depletion of extracellular Ca(2+) at the apical surface, but not basolateral surface, also prevented tight junction disruption. Similarly, thapsigargin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) depletion attenuated tight junction disruption. Thapsigargin or extracellular Ca(2+) depletion partially reduced osmotic stress-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i), whereas thapsigargin and extracellular Ca(2+) depletion together resulted in almost complete loss of rise in [Ca(2+)](i). L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers (isradipine and diltiazem) or knockdown of the Ca(V)1.3 channel abrogated [Ca(2+)](i) rise and disruption of tight junction. Osmotic stress-induced JNK2 activation was abolished by BAPTA and isradipine, and partially reduced by extracellular Ca(2+) depletion, thapsigargin, or Ca(V)1.3 knockdown. Osmotic stress rapidly induced c-Src activation, which was significantly attenuated by BAPTA, isradipine, or extracellular Ca(2+) depletion. Tight junction disruption by osmotic stress was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and PP2) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Src. Osmotic stress induced a robust increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, which was attenuated by BAPTA, SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), or PP2. These results demonstrate that Ca(V)1.3 and rise in [Ca(2+)](i) play a role in the mechanism of osmotic stress-induced tight junction disruption in an intestinal epithelial monolayer. [Ca(2+)](i) mediate osmotic stress-induced JNK activation and subsequent c-Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of tight junction proteins. Additionally, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated release of ER Ca(2+) also contributes to osmotic stress-induced tight junction disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2009829509,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cytidine deaminase that catalyzes deamination of deoxycytidine (dC) on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The oligomeric state of A3G required to support deaminase activity remains unknown. We show under defined in vitro conditions that full-length and native A3G formed complexes with ssDNA in an A3G concentration-dependent but temperature-independent manner. Complexes assembled and maintained at 4 °C did not have significant deaminase activity, but their enzymatic function could be restored by subsequent incubation at 37 °C. This approach enabled complexes of a defined size range to be isolated and subsequently evaluated for their contribution to enzymatic activity. The composition of A3G bound to ssDNA was determined by protein-protein chemical cross-linking. A3G-ssDNA complexes of 16 S were necessary for deaminase activity and consisted of cross-linked A3G homotetramers and homodimers. At lower concentrations, A3G only formed 5.8 S homodimers on ssDNA with low deaminase activity. Monomeric A3G was not identified in 5.8 S or 16 S complexes. We propose that deaminase-dependent antiviral activity of A3G in vivo may require a critical concentration of A3G in viral particles that will promote oligomerization on ssDNA during reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2009900803,"The multisubunit membrane protein complex Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes one of the key reactions in photosynthesis: the light-driven oxidation of water. Here, we focus on the role of the Psb27 assembly factor, which is involved in biogenesis and repair after light-induced damage of the complex. We show that Psb27 is essential for the survival of cyanobacterial cells grown under stress conditions. The combination of cold stress (30 °C) and high light stress (1000 μmol of photons × m(-2) × s(-1)) led to complete inhibition of growth in a Δpsb27 mutant strain of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, whereas wild-type cells continued to grow. Moreover, Psb27-containing PSII complexes became the predominant PSII species in preparations from wild-type cells grown under cold stress. Two different PSII-Psb27 complexes were isolated and characterized in this study. The first complex represents the known monomeric PSII-Psb27 species, which is involved in the assembly of PSII. Additionally, a novel dimeric PSII-Psb27 complex could be allocated in the repair cycle, i.e. in processes after inactivation of PSII, by (15)N pulse-label experiments followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Comparison with the corresponding PSII species from Δpsb27 mutant cells showed that Psb27 prevented the release of manganese from the previously inactivated complex. These results indicate a more complex role of the Psb27 protein within the life cycle of PSII, especially under stress conditions."

As such it accommodates the ability to function under diverse conditions that the cell may encounter. This function is supported by various adaptors that modulate various aspects in protein degradation, these include regulation of substrate delivery, deubiquitination, unfolding, and 20 S gate dilation. Here we show a new functional complex between the P97 and the proteasome that is assembled in response to proteasomal impairment. This entails P97 binding to the 26 S proteasome via the 19 S particle thereby forming an additional hexameric ATPase ring to relieve repression. P97-bound proteasomes showed selective binding toward the Npl4-ufd1 P97 co-factors, indicating a unique cellular role for P97 binding to proteasomes. P97-bound proteasomes display enhanced activity, showing a relief in proteolysis impairment. Our findings place P97 directly in non-ERAD proteasomal functions and establish a new checkpoint in UPS impairment. The ability to modulate proteasome activity and properly respond to protein misfolding, is of great importance in cellular regulation."

Co-immunoprecipitation indicated diminished binding of eIF3 to eIF4G, signifying a reduction in recruitment of the mRNA-unwinding machinery to the 43 S preinitiation complex. Cell growth and overall protein synthesis were decreased. Translation driven by the eIF4G-independent hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry sequence (HCV IRES) in a bicistronic mRNA was increased relative to cap-dependent translation. Endogenous mRNAs encoding XIAP, c-Myc, CYR61, and Pim-1, which are translated in a cap-independent manner, were shifted to heavier polysomes whereas mRNAs encoding GAPDH, actin, L32, and L34, which are translated in a cap-dependent manner, were shifted to lighter polysomes. We propose that expression of 3e5 diminishes eIF4G interaction with eIF3 and causes abnormal gene expression at the translational level. The correlation between up-regulation of cap-independent translation and MMTV-induced tumorigenesis contrasts with the well established model for malignant transformation involving up-regulation of highly cap-dependent translation."
https://openalex.org/W2127941877,"Deinococcus radiodurans is among the very few bacterial species extremely resistant to ionizing radiation, UV light, oxidizing agents, and cycles of prolonged desiccation. The proteome of D. radiodurans reflects the evolutionary pressure exerted by chronic exposure to (nonradioactive) forms of DNA and protein damage. A clear example of this adaptation is the overrepresentation of protein families involved in the removal of non-canonical nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) whose incorporation into nascent DNA would promote mutagenesis and DNA damage. The three-dimensional structure of the DR2231 protein has been solved at 1.80 Å resolution. This protein had been classified as an all-α-helical MazG-like protein. The present study confirms that it holds the basic structural module characteristic of the MazG superfamily; two helices form a rigid domain, and two helices form a mobile domain and connecting loops. Contrary to what is known of MazG proteins, DR2231 protein shows a functional affinity with dUTPases. Enzymatic and isothermal calorimetry assays have demonstrated high specificity toward dUTP but an inability to hydrolyze dTTP, a typical feature of dUTPases. Co-crystallization with the product of hydrolysis, dUMP, in the presence of magnesium or manganese cations, suggests similarities with the dUTP/dUDP hydrolysis mechanism reported for dimeric dUTPases. The genome of D. radiodurans encodes for all enzymes required for dTTP synthesis from dCMP, thus bypassing the need of a dUTPase. We postulate that DR2231 protein is not essential to D. radiodurans and rather performs “house-cleaning” functions within the framework of oxidative stress response. We further propose DR2231 protein as an evolutionary precursor of dimeric dUTPases.

We further propose DR2231 protein as an evolutionary precursor of dimeric dUTPases. Bacteria possess a wide variety of enzymes with the common physiological function of sanitizing the cell of wasteful or even toxic endogenous metabolites. Such enzymes also modulate the accumulation of certain intermediates in biochemical pathways. These enzymes have been coined “house-cleaning” enzymes, because they protect the cell from the harmful effects resulting from the unbalanced presence of potentially toxic compounds. Pyrophosophohydrolysis, the enzymatic cleavage of the α-β phosphodiester bond of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) generates the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate and inorganic phosphate (PPi), subsequently hydrolyzed into free phosphate by other enzymes present in the cytosol. These exergonic reactions allow the recycling of nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) back into metabolic pathways as well as intracellular scavenging for inorganic phosphate. Pyrophosphohydrolysis, however, has yet another role in cellular metabolism and is used in the removal of non-canonical nucleotide triphosphates arising from oxidation, deamination, or other modifications of canonical nucleotides (1Kamiya H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA or RNA. Proteins hydrolyzing NTPs with such cleansing functions can be found in structurally different superfamilies, such as the MutT-related hydrolases (Nudix) (α + β), dUTPase (all-β), dITPase (Maf/HAM1) (α/β), all-α-NTP pyrophosphatases (MazG), and phospho-ribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase (HisE). Analysis of the complete genome of Deinococcus radiodurans revealed the specific expansion of certain protein families believed to be connected to the organism's response to stress and damage resistance, repair mechanisms, and signal transduction (2Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Orthologs of almost all known genes involved in stress response in other bacteria are present in Deinococcus (3Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 417-444Google Scholar). In the case of some missing gene families, function is maintained by nonorthologous proteins with similar functions (4Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Among the highly represented protein families are hydrolases, such as the house-cleaning Nudix pyrophosphatases and other pyrophosphohydrolases, the calcineurin-like phosphoesterases, phosphatases, lipase/epoxidase-like (α/β) hydrolases, subtilisin-like proteases, and sugar deacetylases (5Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Daly M.J. Koonin E.V. Genetica. 2000; 108: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A considerable number of these stress response-related genes are clustered in unusual gene arrays. Some appear to have evolved by tandem duplication (see DR2254/DR2255 or DR0783/DR0784, for example) or gene translocation (DR0675 to DR0677), within the Deinococcus lineage. However, the majority of unusual gene clusters suggest that acquisition took place through horizontal gene transfer from various archael, bacterial, and even eukaryotic sources (4Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Like other bacteria, D. radiodurans seems to lack entirely monomeric, trimeric, and archeal dUTPases, as has been pointed out by Moroz et al. (6Moroz O.V. Harkiolaki M. Galperin M.Y. Vagin A.A. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1583-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of dUTPases from Campylobacter jejuni and Trypanosoma cruzi revealed a new all-α-helix fold with a homodimeric arrangement in contrast to the classical trimeric dUTPase reported until then. No homologues of this dimeric dUTPase could be identified in D. radiodurans. Through sequence analysis restricted to the active site motif, Moroz et al. (6Moroz O.V. Harkiolaki M. Galperin M.Y. Vagin A.A. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1583-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) identified a “basic module” of the dUTPase/dCTPase family in the genomes of several Gram-positive bacteria and respective phages. This basic module, consisting of only five active site-forming helices, is conserved in two other families: the nonspecific NTP-PPase MazG and phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase HisE. These three enzyme families, which share similar function, were unified into a single superfamily, the all-α-NTP-PPase superfamily. Following the same criteria, DR2231 was identified by sequence analysis as a putative member of this superfamily, as were two other genes encoding MazG family proteins, DR1022 and DR1183 (7Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We performed a broader sequence search using as a query the sequence of Escherichia coli MazG protein, (8Lee S. Kim M.H. Kang B.S. Kim J.S. Kim G.H. Kim Y.G. Kim K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15232-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) against the D. radiodurans genome and identified only DR1022 and DR1183 as MazG-like proteins. Furthermore, there are no annotated phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase HisE entries in the D. radiodurans genome. Determining the three-dimensional structure of DR2231 protein and clarifying its function acquire a particular significance regarding the genetic versatility of D. radiodurans in stress response and DNA damage. Here, we report the crystal structure of DR2231 from D. radiodurans at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme has been identified as the prototype of a subfamily of the NTP pyrophosphohydrolase superfamily (7Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has significant structural resemblance to MazG but is functionally related to the dimeric dUTPases, exhibiting activity exclusively on deoxy-NTPs with a very high specificity toward dUTP and none toward dTTP. The crystal structures of the native protein in the apo form and with Mn2+ coordinated to the active site and DR2231 in complex with its product from dUTP hydrolysis with either Mn2+ or Mg2+ are presented. We propose that the DR2231 protein is a dUTPase with marked specificity in hydrolyzing dUTP into dUMP and thus reduces the dUTP/dTTP ratio, which, otherwise, would compromise DNA integrity. The open reading frame annotated as DR2231 was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of D. radiodurans. The PCR product comprising the 5′-CACC overhang was inserted into the expression pET151/D-TOPO directional vector (Invitrogen) with His6 at the N terminus and a recombinant tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The resulting expression vector was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells carrying pET151-DR2231 were grown in Luria-Bertani enriched growth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin; the medium was inoculated with a sample of an overnight culture and grown at 310 K until an optical density of ∼0.65 at 600 nm was reached, at which point isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, thus inducing overexpression. Cultures were allowed to grow for a further 4 h, after which the cells were harvested at 7000 × g for 20 min at 277 K and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were frozen at 193 K, thawed, and lysed by two passes through a French press. DNase I was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml together with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). The lysed culture was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 277 K, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto a 5-ml His-Trap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol). The first wash consisted of a step elution to 12% buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole) followed by a gradient elution from 12–100% buffer B. DR2231 was eluted and pooled near 250 mm imidazole, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The pooled fractions were exchanged into a suitable buffer for His tag cleavage by enzymatic digestion with tobacco etch virus protease. The tag-free protein was again loaded onto a 5-ml His-Trap column, and the flow-through was collected. Further purification was performed, and oligomerization states were confirmed using a Superdex S200 HRHiPrep 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The oligomerization state and monodispersity of DR2231 in solution were estimated by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Instruments, Zetasizer, Nano series). The purified protein was concentrated to 7.5 mg/ml and cryo-cooled to −70 °C when necessary. DR2231 was successfully crystallized in three different crystallization conditions, each producing a different crystal form. All conditions were obtained through an initial screening (with or without preincubation of substrates or analogues) using the high throughput crystallization robot, Cartesian PixSys, and automated imaging system, both available at the High Throughput Crystallization Laboratory at EMBL (Grenoble, France) (9Dimasi N. Flot D. Dupeux F. Márquez J.A. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2007; 63: 204-208Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The first crystals (crystal type A) appeared in 0.01 m magnesium chloride, 0.05 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 1 m lithium sulfate (Natrix screen formulation, Hampton Research). Crystals were reproduced without further optimization and achieved dimensions of ∼0.4 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm within 4–5 days. For data collection, 16% (v/v) glycerol was included in the mother liquor as cryoprotectant, and crystals were immediately flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen (100 K) after soaking for a few seconds. The second crystal form (crystal type B) refers to crystals obtained from 0.18 m lithium acetate and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 (optimized from the PEG/Ion Formulation Screen, Hampton Research). Prior to setting up of the crystallization drops, protein was incubated with 10 mm dUTP and 10 mm manganese chloride (DR2231_dUMP_Mn) or 10 mm magnesium chloride (DR2231_dUMP_Mg). Single crystals grew in 7–8 days as thick plates. These were cryoprotected by soaking in crystallization solutions progressively increased in glycerol content up to 16% (w/v). The third successful crystallization condition (crystal type C) refers to crystals with a diamond-like shape that grew in 1 m LiCl, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 5, 10% (w/v) PEG 6000 (obtained from Grid Screen PEG6000 KIT, Hampton Research). DR2231 protein was co-crystallized in the presence of 10 mm dUpCpp or dUpNHpp and 10 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2). These crystals were collected directly from the robot screen and subjected to cryogenic cooling after immersion in paraffin oil. Type A crystals belong to the space group P212121 with six molecules in the asymmetric unit and were used in three different data collection experiments: DR2231_Apo_1, DR2231_Mn, and DR2231_Gd. For de novo phasing (DR2231_Gd), a heavy atom derivative crystal was prepared by soaking crystal of type A in 20 mm GdCl3 added to the mother liquor for ∼18 h. DR2231_Mn corresponds to a data set collected on a type A crystal that was soaked overnight in a modified precipitant: 250 mm lithium sulfate, 750 mm manganese sulfate. For the crystal type B form, the space group was P21212 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit, arranged in two dimers. This crystal type has been pursued in order to obtain a protein complexed with the substrate or the product in the active site and with the metal atoms. Crystal type C was produced in order to obtain DR2231 with a bound non-hydrolyzable analog and followed the unsuccessful trials with type B. Unfortunately, neither crystal form when examined revealed the substrate analog in the postulated active site. Crystals obtained correspond to another apo form (similar to crystal type A) and belong to space group P6122 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, the dimer being generated by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. All data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Diffraction data from crystal type A were processed with MOSFLM (10Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (11Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). Data from crystal forms B and C were integrated and scaled with XDS (12Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11544) Google Scholar). In both cases, further data analysis was carried out using the CCP4 suite 6.0.2 (13Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr.

After analyzing the structure factors using SHELXC and SHELXD with HKL2MAP version 0.2 (15Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81072) Google Scholar, 16Pape T.

Initial phases were calculated with SHELXE (17Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), which also applied density modification. Structure factors and density modified phases were input in ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), which produced, with the automatic model building feature, a partial starting model. The initial model was then completed by rounds of manual building with Coot (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr.

TLS groups were chosen after analysis of the structure with TLSMD (22Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar).

For ELISA plates (200-μl total volume/well) DR2231 (2 μg or 2 ng, as indicated) in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2) was incubated with varying concentrations of NTPs or dNTPs, ranging from 1.0 to 20 μm at room temperature (delivered from 100-fold stocks) for 10 min. Each reaction contained inorganic pyrophosphatase enzyme (0.05 unit) (Sigma) in order to convert released PPi into Pi and allow full binding to malachite green dye. Reactions were terminated upon the addition of 40 μl of dye reagent, whereupon the dye color changes from orange to green after 10 min. Control reactions lacking DR2231 were performed for each substrate (10 μm) in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, in order to guarantee the absence of β-γ phosphate cleavage. Another set of control reactions lacking inorganic pyrophosphatase produced no color development, further proving that DR2231 releases PPi and not phosphate in free form. Initial velocities were followed by incubating a 1.8 ml of reaction buffer at 37 °C, with agitation, in the presence of inorganic phosphatase (0.05 unit) and substrate. DR2231 at 0.634 nm (2 ng/μl) was added, and 160-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min and added to 40 μl of malachite green dye each. After a 10-min incubation, absorbance was measured at 630 nm; phosphate quantification was calculated against a previously determined calibration curve for inorganic phosphate in the buffer conditions used. For metal preference tests, magnesium was replaced by 20 mm MnCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, or EDTA. Isothermal calorimetry was carried out using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). Reaction cells were filled with solutions and equilibrated at the experimental temperature. After equilibration, an additional delay period was allowed to generate the base line used in subsequent data acquisition. All solutions were degassed prior to an experiment. The stirring speed was set at 326 rpm, thermal power was recorded every 2 s, and heat flow (reference power of 15 μcal/s) was recorded as a function of time. Ligand solutions were prepared in the buffer from the last dialysis change. ITC measurements were routinely performed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2). Controls were performed by injecting ligand into buffer under identical experimental conditions. Raw data were collected and corrected for the ligand heat of dilution. Kinetic data analysis was determined by the single injection method, where the change in thermal power as substrate is depleted can be continuously monitored (28Todd M.J. Gomez J. Anal.

DR2231 is a single chain protein composed of 148 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 16,056 Da. The recombinant protein reported here corresponds to the full-length sequence and includes six extra N-terminal residues from the cloning vector (Gly, Ile, Asp, Pro, Phe, Thr). Three different crystal forms belonging to three different space groups, P212121, P21212, and P6122, were obtained, depending on whether a substrate (or substrate analog) was used for co-crystallization or not. All crystal forms show the same basic fold. The three-dimensional crystal structure of DR2231 shows that it is mostly composed of α-helices (Fig. 1A) forming a hairpin-like fold. The monomer comprises five helices (H1, residues Thr9–Gly22; H2, residues Pro34–Ala64; H3, residues Ser69–Asp92; H4, residues Asp97–Ser114; H5, residues Asp133–His143) and four connecting loops. H2 packs against H3 in an antiparallel sense, whereas H5 is stacked against H4. Both pairs of stacked helices compose the hairpin topology with the vertices formed by loops 1 and 3 and distant from each other by ∼40°. The dimer (Fig. 1B) is composed of two monomers with essentially the same structure, interacting in a head to tail orientation with overall approximate dimensions of 45 × 49 × 97 Å. Upon dimer formation, helices 2 and 3 from one monomer stack antiparallel to helices 2′ and 3′ of the other monomer, respectively. A stable four-helix bundle is formed in the center. On either side, flanking the central bundle, are the “winged” regions composed of H1 from one monomer and H4′ and H5′ from the other. Helix 1 is anchoring H4′ into its position relative to H3 and gives further stability to the “fork.” The intertwining of the two hairpin structures produces an extensive subunit-subunit interface, burying a total surface of 2832 Å2, where, among the 73 residues participating in the interface, 58% are non-polar and 42% are polar (analyzed using the protein-protein interaction server (30Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar)). This value increases to ∼2922 Å2 for the dimer in complex with dUMP. Interestingly, the long loop (residues 23–33) connecting H1 and H2 that seems to stabilize the residues in the kink (residues 93–96) between H3 and H4, confers further sturdiness to the rigid helix bundle. A considerable array of interactions secures this stabilization through hydrogen bonds: Ala23 (N) with His18 (C=O); Ala24 (C=O) with Gln93 (Nϵ2); Thr25 (C=O) with His15 (Nδ) and Asp92 (Oδ2); Arg28 (C=O) with Thr30 (Oγ1) and Gly95 (C=O); Pro29 (N) with Gly95 (C=O); Thr30 (N) with Leu94 (C=O); Pro33 (C=O) with Leu36 (N) and Glu35 (N). There is yet another hydrogen bond between Pro32 (C=O) and Gln62 (Nϵ2) in helix 2 of the partner monomer. Structures belonging to the P212121 space group (6 molecules/asymmetric unit) (DR2231_Gd, DR2231_Apo_1, and DR2231_Mn) show very good electron d"
https://openalex.org/W2001750124,"NPM-ALK is a chimeric tyrosine kinase detected in most anaplastic large cell lymphomas that results from the reciprocal translocation t(2,5)(p23;q35) that fuses the N-terminal domain of nucleophosmin (NPM) to the catalytic domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor. The constitutive activity of the kinase is responsible for its oncogenicity through the stimulation of several downstream signaling pathways, leading to cell proliferation, migration, and survival. We demonstrated previously that the high level of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate measured in NPM-ALK-expressing cells is controlled by the phosphoinositide kinase PIKfyve, a lipid kinase known for its role in vesicular trafficking. Here, we show that PIKfyve associates with NPM-ALK and that the interaction involves the 181-300 region of the oncogene. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase activity of the oncogene controls PIKfyve lipid kinase activity but is dispensable for the formation of the complex. Silencing or inhibition of PIKfyve using siRNA or the PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 have no effect on NPM-ALK-mediated proliferation and migration but strongly reduce invasive capacities of NPM-ALK-expressing cells and their capacity to degrade the extracellular matrix. Accordingly, immunofluorescence studies confirm a perturbation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 localization at the cell surface and defect in maturation. Altogether, these results suggest a role for PIKfyve in NPM-ALK-mediated invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2039824265,"By providing contacts between hematopoietic cells and the bone marrow microenvironment, integrins are implicated in cell adhesion and thereby in control of cell fate of normal and leukemia cells. The ASB2 gene, initially identified as a retinoic acid responsive gene and a target of the promyelocytic leukemia retinoic acid receptor α oncoprotein in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, encodes two isoforms, a hematopoietic-type (ASB2α) and a muscle-type (ASB2β) that are involved in hematopoietic and myogenic differentiation, respectively. ASB2α is the specificity subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets filamins to proteasomal degradation. To examine the relationship of the ASB2α structure to E3 ubiquitin ligase function, functional assays and molecular modeling were performed. We show that ASB2α, through filamin A degradation, enhances adhesion of hematopoietic cells to fibronectin, the main ligand of β1 integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a short N-terminal region specific to ASB2α, together with ankyrin repeats 1 to 10, is necessary for association of ASB2α with filamin A. Importantly, the ASB2α N-terminal region comprises a 9-residue segment with predicted structural homology to the filamin-binding motifs of migfilin and β integrins. Together, these data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ASB2α binding to filamin."
https://openalex.org/W1964369265,"Tobacco smoke (TS) interacts with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to modulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of cyclooxygenase-2. We explored molecular mechanisms by which TS/IL-1β alters expression and activity of microsomal-prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and of prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) in mouse cardiac endothelial cells. TS (EC(50) ∼5 puffs/L) interacting with IL-1β (2 μg/L) up-regulates PGE(2) production and mPGES-1 expression, reaching a plateau at 4-6 h, but down-regulates prostacyclin (PGI(2)) release by increasing IL-1β-mediated PGIS tyrosine nitration. Inhibition of NADPH-oxidase, achieved pharmacologically and/or by silencing its catalytic subunit p47phox, or exogenous PGI(2) (carbaprostacyclin; IC(50) ∼5 μM) prevents production of both ROS and PGE(2), and negatively modulates mPGES-1 expression induced by TS/IL-1β. Moreover, inhibiting PGI(2), either using PGIS siRNA and/or CAY10441 (EC(50) ∼20 nM), a PGI(2) receptor antagonist, increases NADPH-oxidase activation, mPGES-1 synthesis, and PGE(2) production. Finally, lower PGI(2) levels associated with higher PGIS tyrosine nitration, p47phox translocation to the membrane (an index of activation of NADPH-oxidase), and mPGES-1 expression and activity were detected in cardiovascular tissues of ApoE(-/-) mice exposed to cigarette smoke compared to control mice. In conclusion, cigarette smoke in association with cytokines alters the balance between PGI(2)/PGE(2), reducing PGI(2) production and increasing synthesis and activity of mPGES-1 via NADPH-oxidase activation, predisposing to development of pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2082354365,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) expression is frequently suppressed in liver cancers and can be reactivated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. This study examined the role of IGFBP-3 in mediating the effects of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 in liver cancer cells and identified IGFBP-3-dependent proteins that regulate proliferation and migration. In HepG2 cells, MS-275 inhibited DNA synthesis, cell cycle activity, and cell viability concomitantly with increased binding of acetylated histone H3 to IGFBP-3 promoter sequences and induction of IGFBP-3 expression. IGFBP-3 down-regulation by siRNA significantly reversed the inhibition of cell viability and DNA synthesis by MS-275, indicating an intermediary role for IGFBP-3. Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by MS-275 was attenuated by IGFBP-3 down-regulation, providing an explanation for IGFBP-3-dependent effects of MS-275 on cell cycle activity. In contrast, MS-275 stimulated HepG2 cell migration, an effect also inhibited by IGFBP-3 down-regulation. Among genes whose induction by MS-275 was attenuated by IGFBP-3 down-regulation, LYVE1 and THBS2 (thrombospondin-2) were identified as mediators of IGFBP-3-dependent effects of MS-275. Silencing of either protein had no effect on the inhibition of HepG2 viability by MS-275 but reversed its stimulatory effect on cell migration. We conclude that among genes up-regulated by MS-275, IGFBP-3 is a key mediator of effects on hepatoma cell growth and migration, involving IGFBP-3-dependent proteins p21 (proliferation) and LYVE1 and THBS2 (migration). The enhanced cell motility that accompanies reactivation of IGFBP-3 expression in liver cancer by HDAC inhibition suggests the possibility of increased metastatic spread despite inhibited cell proliferation."

Metallonucleases are often assigned a “two-metal ion mechanism” where both metals contact the scissile phosphate diester. The spacing of the two metal ions observed in T5FEN structures appears to preclude this mechanism. However, the overall reaction catalyzed by wild type (WT) T5FEN requires three Mg2+ ions, implying that a third ion is needed during catalysis, and so a two-metal ion mechanism remains possible. To investigate the positions of the ions required for chemistry, a mutant T5FEN was studied where metal 2 (M2) ligands are altered to eliminate this binding site. In contrast to WT T5FEN, the overall reaction catalyzed by D201I/D204S required two ions, but over the concentration range of Mg2+ tested, maximal rate data were fitted to a single binding isotherm.

FENs act upon 5′- bifurcated structures known as flaps formed during lagging strand DNA replication and long patch base excision repair. Hydrolysis predominantly occurs one nucleotide into the 5′-duplex adjoining the site of bifurcation. An unusual feature of these enzymes is their high density of active site carboxylates that coordinate essential divalent metal ion cofactors. Bacterial and bacteriophage FENs possess eight active site acidic residues, seven of which are conserved in FENs from higher organisms and also in other members of the 5′-nuclease superfamily (1Tomlinson C.G.

Metal ion 1 (M1) occupies a similar position in all structures. However, there is some variation in the position of the site coordinating a second metal ion (M2), often observed in FEN crystal structures. The distance between the M1 and M2 sites varies, and the separations observed are generally much greater than the 4 Å required for both metals to contact the same phosphate diester. For example, in bacteriophage T5FEN, 5In early literature, T5FEN was referred to as T5 5′-3′-exonuclease and T5 5′-nuclease. In early literature, T4FEN was referred to as referred to also as T4 RNase H. the M1-M2 separation of two Mn2+ ions is 8 Å (Fig. 1A) (17Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, in a substrate-free structure of hFEN1, two magnesium ions are bound with a separation of 3.4 Å in one of three proteins bound to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig. 1B) (18Sakurai S. Kitano K. Yamaguchi H. Hamada K. Okada K. Fukuda K. Uchida M. Ohtsuka E. Morioka H. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A very recent structure of hFEN1 bound to product DNA has two Sm3+ ions bound in equivalent positions, and these contact the cleaved phosphate monoester (4Tsutakawa S.E. Classen S. Chapados B.R. Arvai A.S. Finger L.D. Guenther G. Tomlinson C.G. Thompson P. Sarker A.H. Shen B. Cooper P.K. Grasby J.A. Tainer J.A.

Despite the 8 Å distance between M1 and M2 in substrate-free T5FEN structures, magnesium ion stimulation data are consistent with a mechanism where the major rate acceleration is brought about by two metal ions but where overall (kcat/Km) has a three-divalent ion requirement (3Syson K.

Thus an additional ion (M3) is bound with higher affinity to the enzyme-substrate complex. If two metal ions that participate in chemical catalysis are coordinated to the central carboxylate of the T5FEN active site (Asp-130), positioned as those observed in hFEN1 structures (Fig. 1) (2Orans J. McSweeney E.A. Iyer R.R. Hast M.A. Hellinga H.W. Modrich P. Beese L.S. Cell. 2011; 145: 212-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Tsutakawa S.E. Classen S.

Cell. 2011; 145: 198-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), two-metal ion catalysis mechanisms where both metals coordinate the scissile phosphate diester could take place. As only M1 is observed in this position in substrate-free structures of bacteriophage FENs, in this scenario, the third ion implicated by functional studies would have to bind in this location, and the catalytic ions would therefore be M1 and M3 (Fig. 1A). However, alternative explanations of a two-ion requirement for the major rate acceleration are possible. For example, M2, as positioned in T5FEN substrate-free structures, would not be able to directly interact with the scissile phosphate diester but instead could catalyze chemical catalysis by more remote interactions. On the other hand, if catalytic M1 and M3 provide the main rate acceleration, M2 could play a role in enzyme-substrate complex stability. Here we test earlier proposals for the roles of metal ions in reactions catalyzed by T5FEN. To investigate whether divalent metal ions alter the stability of enzyme-substrate complexes, dissociation constants were determined in the absence of catalysis at varying concentration of Ca2+ ions and pH. Previous studies of the T5FEN-catalyzed reactions demonstrated that catalytically inert Ca2+ ions inhibited reaction with a 1/[Ca2+]2 dependence, which is consistent with an absolute requirement for two viable metal cofactor ions that the Ca2+ ions displace. Potentially, this could be used to test for a requirement for two metal ions in mutated FENs and other metallonucleases. However, it is possible that decreases in the rate of reaction may involve Ca2+ binding non-competitively to the enzyme, substrate, or enzyme-substrate complex. To establish the competitive inhibition of FEN-catalyzed reactions by Ca2+ ions, the inhibitory characteristics were studied with different supporting metal cofactor ions at varying concentration. To probe the role of T5FEN M2, both the stimulation by viable metal cofactor ions and the inhibition by Ca2+ ions were evaluated for a mutated T5FEN where two of the carboxylates that bind M2 are altered. The combined analyses support a mechanism for T5FEN where the main rate acceleration is afforded by two ions, but not by M2, and imply a role for M2 in stabilization of enzyme-substrate interactions.

Sayers J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Steady state catalytic parameters were determined at each Mg2+ concentration by curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Plots of v/[E] versus [S], where [S] < Km, were used to determine kcat/Km. For magnesium-supported T5FEN reactions, reaction mixtures containing 0.5 or 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μm HP5F, 25 mm potassium glycinate, pH 9.3, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, varying [CaCl2] with the appropriate amount of KCl to keep ionic strength constant as above, were initiated by the appropriate amounts of T5FEN (0.3–30 nm). For manganese-supported T5FEN reactions, reaction mixtures containing 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mm MnCl2, 0.2 μm HP5F, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, CaCl2 with the appropriate amount of KCl were initiated by the addition of an appropriate amount of T5FEN (0.05–0.4 nm). For D201I/D204S-T5FEN reactions, reaction mixtures containing 0.5 or 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm HP5F, 25 mm CHES, pH 9.3, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, CaCl2 with the appropriate amount of KCl were initiated by the addition of the appropriate amount of D201I/D204S T5FEN (final concentration 5–40 nm). All reactions were sampled and quenched as above and used to determine kobs (v/[E]) as a function of calcium ion concentration. T5FEN DNA interactions were evaluated by fluorescence anisotropy using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-3® fluorometer with automatic polarizers. The excitation wavelength was 490 nm (excitation slit width 8 nm) with emission detected at 509–511 nm through an 8-nm-wide slit. Experiments contained 2 mm EDTA or varying concentrations of CaCl2 (0.5–10 mm), with the appropriate amount of KCl as for kinetic analyses, 100 nm HP5F (for WT T5FEN) or 10 nm HP5F (for D201I/D204S), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, or 25 mm potassium glycinate, pH 9.3, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm DTT. All experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Anisotropy (r) was determined as described (27Reid S.L. Parry D. Liu H.H. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) initially prior to the addition of protein and then on the cumulative addition of enzyme. Data were fitted, using KaleidaGraph, to the following equation with corrections made for dilution, where r is the measured anisotropy, [E] is the total protein concentration and [S] is the total HP5F concentration, rmin is the anisotropy of free DNA, rmax is the anisotropy of the DNA-protein complex, and KD is the dissociation constant (27Reid S.L. Parry D. Liu H.H. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Curve fitting of Mg2+-dependent behavior and Ca2+-dependent inhibitions were carried out by non-linear regression fitting using KaleidaGraph software weighted according to individual error values when required, using Equations 2–7 (see “Results”). Studies on the magnesium ion dependence of the WT T5FEN-catalyzed reaction were carried out previously using the 5′-fluorescent overhanging hairpin substrate HP5F under pH-independent maximal rate conditions (pH = 9.3) (3Syson K. Tomlinson C. Chapados B.R. Sayers J.R. Tainer J.A. Williams N.H. Grasby J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28741-28746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These earlier kinetic studies revealed a requirement for two Mg2+ ions to maximize 1/Km. However, the interpretation of this behavior was complicated by the nature of this parameter, which in FEN-catalyzed reactions that are partially rate-limited by the release of products reflects the stability of all forms of the enzyme-bound substrate and product. To examine binding of HP5F to T5FEN under similar conditions to catalytic experiments but in the absence of catalysis, fluorescence anisotropy was employed. In the presence of EDTA at pH 9.3, anisotropy (r) increased with the addition of protein up to 10 μm, but no maximal value was reached, implying KD > 5 μm (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in the presence of non-catalytically competent Ca2+ ions (1 mm), r reached a maximum value and could be fitted to a single binding isotherm (Equation 1) to yield a KD = 202 ± 27 nm (Fig. 2A). Thus divalent metal ions substantially stabilize the T5FEN-HP5F complex at pH 9.3. However, at pH 7.5 in the absence of divalent metal ions, KD = 231 ± 13 nm (Fig. 2B). At this pH, the presence of Ca2+ ions (1 mm) has a modest effect, with KD = 120 ± 13 nm. Thus either lowering the pH or adding divalent metal ions has a large effect on T5FEN-substrate interactions, but these effects are not additive. Similar stimulation of binding of DNA substrates at lowered pH or by Ca2+ ions has been observed with other metallonucleases and been assigned to protonation or binding of Ca2+ ions at the active site carboxylates (28Lagunavicius A. Grazulis S. Balciunaite E. Vainius D. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11093-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here the protonation state of DNA-binding residues could also be a factor (29Dervan J.J. Feng M. Patel D. Grasby J.A. Artymiuk P.J. Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8542-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Pickering T.J. Garforth S. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The variation in KD as a function of [Ca2+] was determined at both pH 9.3 and pH 7.5. Calcium ion concentration was varied from 0.5 to 10 mm, maintaining the ionic strength by adjusting the concentration of KCl. Under these conditions, the slopes of log KD versus log [Ca2+] were 0.15 ± 0.10 (pH 9.3) and −0.06 ± 0.06 (pH 7.5), indicating that the changes in enzyme-substrate affinity were negligible (Fig. 2D). The relative insensitivity of KD to concentrations of divalent ions <20 mm has been noted in other systems where divalent ions are cofactors (31Datta K. LiCata V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5694-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, at both pH values, the changes in enzyme-substrate affinity on altering Ca2+ ion concentration are relatively small and so do not account for the inhibition characteristics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction by calcium ions described below. Earlier studies have revealed that Ca2+ ions inhibit the T5FEN-catalyzed reaction, and under some conditions, this is dependent on 1/[Ca2+]2 (3Syson K. Tomlinson C. Chapados B.R. Sayers J.R. Tainer J.A. Williams N.H. Grasby J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28741-28746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Assuming competitive inhibition with viable metal cofactor ions, a two-Ca2+ ion inhibitory response could be a diagnostic test for a requirement for two viable metal ion cofactors. Previously, it was demonstrated that the concentration of Ca2+ ions required to reduce the rate of reaction by 50%, KI in Equation 2, was a function of both the concentration and the identity of the viable metal cofactor (3Syson K. Tomlinson C. Chapados B.R. Sayers J.R. Tainer J.A. Williams N.H. Grasby J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28741-28746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This analysis assumes that replacement of a single viable cofactor ion with Ca2+ ion prevents reaction, where kobs is the observed normalized initial rate of reaction (v/[E]) and k0 is v/[E] in the absence of inhibitory ion. Thus at least one Ca2+ ion displaces one viable cofactor ion to inhibit reaction. However, the origins of the most informative feature of the inhibition, a two-Ca2+ ion inhibitory form, required further investigation. Assuming two inhibitory binding sites and competitive inhibition, where calcium ions compete for the same sites as viable metal cofactors (M2+), potentially eight enzyme mono or -dimetal species can exist when Ca2+ and/or M2+ are present, and so speciation could be very complex. This is particularly so when the inhibitory ions are bound with higher affinity by the protein than M2+ and especially in the context of reactions where M2+ is not supplied at saturating concentrations. The simplest responses are predicted to arise when M2+ is bound with higher affinity than the inhibitory ion, a criteria fulfilled by the Mn2+/Ca2+ pair. Hence to reveal whether Mn2+-supported FEN-catalyzed reactions are inhibited by displacement of two viable metal cofactor ions by calcium ions, reactions were studied at three concentrations of viable cofactor ions (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mm) with saturating HP5F substrate and varying concentrations of Ca2+. The reactions were studied at pH 7.5, where the Mn2+-supported FEN reaction is optimal but where formation of manganese hydroxides is avoided. These three concentrations of Mn2+ span subsaturating (0.1 mm) and maximal rate concentrations (0.2 and 0.4 mm) of viable metal cofactor ion. As the concentrations of Mn2+ and Ca2+ were varied, the ionic strength of reaction mixtures was kept constant by adjusting the amount of potassium chloride present. To avoid the concentration of ions being perturbed by binding to DNA, the substrate was supplied so that the total concentration of phosphate diesters in HP5F was equal to or less than 5% of the concentration of Mn2+. As observed previously (3Syson K. Tomlinson C. Chapados B.R. Sayers J.R. Tainer J.A. Williams N.H. Grasby J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28741-28746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but shown here with a more extensive data set, at lower concentrations of Ca2+ (up to 80% inhibition, kobs/k0 = 0.2), the data were fitted acceptably to the simple competitive inhibition scheme (Equation 2). As the concentration of Mn2+ was increased, KI was also increased, indicating that inhibition is competitive so that KI = 1.1 ± 0.1 mm at 0.1 mm Mn2+, KI = 2.2 ± 0.3 mm at 0.2 mm Mn2+, and KI = 3.8 ± 0.4 mm at 0.4 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 3A). The magnitude of KI confirms that in analogy to dissociation constants determined for the substrate-free enzyme, Mn2+ ions must bind to the protein with higher affinity than Ca2+ ions. In the case of the highest concentration of Mn2+, most of the data range fits acceptably to the simple inhibition model, although deviation is evident at the very highest concentrations of Ca2+. At lower concentrations of Mn2+, the data deviate from this simple inhibition scheme when inhibition is greater than 80% (kobs/k0 < 0.2). The slopes of log-log plots of normalized rates versus calcium ion concentration where kobs/k0 < 0.2 are −2.0 ± 0.1 (0.1 mm Mn2+) and −1.9 ± 0.1 (0.2 mm Mn2+) rather than the slope of −1 predicted by the simple inhibition scheme. This indicates that a two-Ca2+ form of the enzyme is also catalytically inactive. Although a complete data fit to the complex overall inhibition scenario requires a knowledge of all eight interrelated dissociation constants, it is possible to generate a relatively simple description that assumes two Ca2+ ions bind competitively and independently and that all forms of the enzyme that contain Ca2+ are inactive. Equation 3 models the expected variation of rate kobs/k0 with [Ca2+], defining two apparent KI values for Ca2+ ions, where KI1 is an apparent dissociation of dicalcium forms of the enzyme and KI2 is an apparent dissociation constant of monocalcium forms. Although good non-linear regression curve fits can be obtained using Equation 3, the similar magnitudes of the apparent inhibition constants result in the same value for each with large errors. Similar non-linear regression curve fitting problems have been noted previously (32Bastock J.A. Webb M. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When KI2 is fixed according to the single-site inhibition model, resulting values of KI1 = 5.3 mm (0.1 mm Mn2+) and KI1 = 8.4 mm (0.2 mm Mn2+) are observed. At higher Mn2+, the data fit to a simple one-site inhibition model, implying that the value of KI1 is outside the data range (Fig. 3B). Hence the magnitude of this parameter is dependent on the concentration of viable metal cofactor ions present, implying that two Ca2+ ions compete for the same sites as the two Mn2+ ions. Further evidence for a requirement for two catalytic metals can be derived by an alternative analysis of the data. Assuming that the only catalytically competent species has two viable metal ion cofactors bound, it follows that when the dominant species contains two inhibitory ions, the dependence of the normalized rate of reaction on viable cofactor metal ions will approach the square of its concentration. This will occur in situations where the viable metal cofactor ion has higher affinity than the inhibitory ion. Analyzing the data in the region kobs/k0 < 0.2, a plot of log kobs/k0 versus log [Mn2+] at fixed Ca2+ concentration does indeed display the expected slope close to 2 (Fig. 3C). Similar analyses have also been conducted for Mg2+-supported T5FEN reactions, which also display a biphasic response to Ca2+ inhibition. These studies were carried out at pH 9.3, which is optimal for the Mg2+-supported reaction, and at saturating substrate. Two subsaturating concentrations of Mg2+ were studied (0.5 and 2 mm), a criteria imposed to keep total divalent ion concentration below a value that could potentially alter enzyme-substrate affinity. Analysis according to the one-site inhibition model (Equation 2) reveals KI = 0.11 ± 0.01 mm at 0.5 mm Mg2+ and KI = 0.22 ± 0.01 mm at 2 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3D). The apparent KI values are smaller than the concentration of Mg2+, indicating that Mg2+ ions are bound more weakly than Ca2+. Applying the two-inhibitory ion model (Equation 3) yields apparent inhibition constants that are similar, KI1 = 8.7 ± 0.1 mm (0.5 mm Mg2+) and KI1 = 9.0 ± 1.3 mm (2 mm Mg2+), presumably reflecting the relative affinity of Ca2+ versus Mg2+ and the subsaturating conditions with respect to viable metal cofactor (Fig. 3E). Previous analyses, including the observation that D201I/D204S mutations do not drastically impair reaction, suggest that the T5FEN M2 may not play a direct role in catalysis (12Feng M. Patel D.

In the designed D201I/D204S mutant, two of the carboxylates that bind M2 are altered (Fig. 1A) to abolish the binding site for this ion as observed in E. coli ExoIX. With HP5F as substrate, the D201I/D204S mutation slowed the maximal single turnover rate of the reaction by a factor of 40 at saturating Mg2+, a modest factor in the context of the entire T5FEN rate acceleration of 1016-1017 (33Pickering T.J.

The activation of human lung VAP-1 by human plasma is greater if the plasma originates from diabetic patients or following heart myocardial infarction (10Dalfó E. Hernandez M. Lizcano J.M. Tipton K.F. Unzeta M. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The physiological substrates for SSAOs are not clearly defined, but the soluble amines methylamine and/or aminoacetone could be among the naturally occurring substrates for SSAOs (11Precious E. Gunn C.E. Lyles G.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The majority of studies with copper-dependent amine oxidases have been conducted with the nonphysiological substrate benzylamine, as enzymatic activity with this substrate can be monitored spectroscopically with ease. Efforts to find new substrates for VAP-1 have led to interesting candidates for further study. For example, 1,12-diaminododecane, an aliphatic diamine, is a VAP-1 substrate, and kinetic studies indicate high selectivity compared with other aliphatic (poly)amines (12Bonaiuto E. Lunelli M. Scarpa M. Vettor R. Milan G. Di Paolo M.L. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For example, the Km with 1,12-diaminododecane is ∼50-fold lower than with the model substrate benzylamine (12Bonaiuto E. Lunelli M. Scarpa M. Vettor R. Milan G. Di Paolo M.L. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bovine VAP has been shown to bind, but not oxidize, lysine and soluble elastin in vitro in the presence of H2O2 and thereby inhibit the catalytic turnover of benzylamine (13Olivieri A. O'Sullivan J. Fortuny L.R. Vives I.L. Tipton K.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recently, a binding partner for VAP-1 on the surface of lymphocytes has been identified from phage libraries displaying decapeptides (14Kivi E. Elima K. Aalto K. Nymalm Y. Auvinen K. Koivunen E. Otto D.M. Crocker P.R. Salminen T.A. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Blood. 2009; 114: 5385-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Siglec-10 (sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-10), shown to bind specifically to recombinant VAP-1, is the first leukocyte ligand identified for the enzyme (14Kivi E. Elima K. Aalto K. Nymalm Y. Auvinen K. Koivunen E. Otto D.M. Crocker P.R. Salminen T.A. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Blood. 2009; 114: 5385-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding results in H2O2 production, suggesting that Siglec-10 acts as a substrate. It was proposed that binding of Siglec-10 occurs via covalent linkage of a free NH2 group of an arginine side chain to the 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (topaquinone (TPQ)) center leading to subsequent oxidation. However, this would be highly unusual in relation to the accepted mechanisms for copper-dependent amine oxidases. Thus far, the majority of studies have focused on in vivo properties and biomedical investigations of the role of VAP-1 under several pathological conditions (15Boomsma F. Hut H. Bagghoe U. van der Houwen A. van den Meiracker A. Med. Sci. Monit. 2005; 11: RA122-RA126PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike flavin-dependent oxidases, this enzyme uses the unusual active site quinone cofactor TPQ, which is formed autocatalytically. This post-translational modification requires the type-2 copper cofactor and molecular oxygen. The TPQ cofactor facilitates substrate oxidation through the formation of a covalent substrate-cofactor Schiff base intermediate (Scheme 1) in a mechanism that is common to all CAOs. Potentially, VAP-1 is an important target in age-related inflammatory diseases, and it may serve as a marker for chronic liver disease (16Kemik O. Sümer A. Kemik A.S. Itik V. Dulger A.C. Purisa S. Tuzun S. World J. Surg. Oncol. 2010; 8: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising that detailed kinetic, mechanistic, and structural studies of VAP-1 are not advanced, as these would provide crucial information to guide rational design of small molecule inhibitors. Here, we explore the mechanism of VAP-1 with respect to amine oxidase activity using model substrates that have been used with other members of the CAO family of enzymes. We report kinetic studies that incorporate analysis of the effects of altering solution pH, isotope effects, and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) using benzylamine and p-substituted phenylethylamines as substrates. Our study establishes kinetic complexity in the reductive half-reaction of VAP-1 with benzylamine as substrate, consistent with the proposed chemical mechanism. We rationalize the observed isotope effects with benzylamine using a sequential kinetic mechanism, showing that a sequential kinetic mechanism can account for the observed isotope effects on kcat,app, Km.app, and (kcat/Km)app. Structural models of VAP-1 with the model substrates benzylamine and phenylethylamine bound provide an explanation for the poor correlations we observed in QSAR experiments with p-substituted phenylethylamines. We show the importance of combining kinetic isotope effects (KIE), QSAR, and structural studies when using steady-state kinetic analysis to gain insight into enzyme mechanism. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 4-aminoantipyrine, 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, bis-Tris, β-phenylethylamine, p-hydroxyphenylethylamine, p-nitrophenylethylamine, and benzylamine were obtained from Sigma. p-Amino-, p-methyl-, p-fluoro-, and p-chlorophenylethylamine were from Acros Organics. p-Bromophenylethylamine was from Fluorochem and p-methoxyphenylethylamine from Apollo Scientific Ltd. Perdeuterated phenylethylamine (C6D5CD2CD2NH2 HCl, 99.6%) and horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma. Di-deuterated p-substituted phenylethylamines and d2-benzylamine were synthesized previously as described by Hothi et al. (17Hothi P. Hay S. Roujeinikova A. Sutcliffe M.J. Lee M. Leys D. Cullis P.M.

The intronless gene that encodes the soluble truncated, form of VAP-1 (sVAP-1; residues 29–763) was codon-optimized for expression in human cells and synthesized by Qiagen. The gene was synthesized so that it is flanked at the 5′-end by a NheI restriction site and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′-end, thereby enabling directional subcloning into a modified pCep-Pu vector with an alternative multiple cloning site in which the hygromycin marker was replaced with a puromycin marker (19Macdonald P.R.

This vector contains an N-terminal signal sequence that is derived from a human extracellular glycoprotein (osteonectin), residues 1–19 followed by the sequence Leu-Ala-Ser, which allows extracellular expression of sVAP-1 (20Swaroop A.

HEK293 EBNA1 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCep-Pu-sVAP using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The established HEK293 cells were transferred from the original 6-well plate to a fresh 25 ml culture flask after ∼2.5 weeks of selection. After reaching cell confluence, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium. Cells were cultured for 7 days followed by harvesting of conditioned medium and replacement with fresh medium. The collected medium, typically 600 ml, was centrifuged and sterilized by passage through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). CuSO4 was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the medium was incubated at 4 °C for at least 6 h (or on ice overnight). The medium containing sVAP-1 was concentrated to 50 ml using an Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell fitted with a 30-kDa cut-off filter and subsequently concentrated further to 5 ml using a Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator (Sartorius-Stedim). sVAP-1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 preparative grade column, pre-equilibrated with 20 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The same buffer was used throughout the purification procedure, and sVAP-1-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Purified sVAP-1 was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blotting. For Western blot analysis, SDS-PAGE was followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The anti-mouse WesternBreeze kit from Invitrogen was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Monoclonal mouse anti-VAP-1 antibody was used to probe sVAP-1. The amount of TPQ cofactor in sVAP-1 was analyzed by titrating the enzyme with phenylhydrazine, which reacts stoichiometrically with the cofactor (22DuBois J.L. Klinman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 378: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A 25 μm phenylhydrazine solution was freshly prepared, and 4 μl of this solution was added to 0.5 ml of 0.65 mg/ml sVAP-1 (determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as reference) in 20 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl. Optical spectra were recorded frequently to monitor the increase in absorbance at 435 nm until there were no more changes in absorbance (5–15 min). The stepwise addition of phenylhydrazine was repeated until no more spectral changes were observed. A typical qualitative activity assay used before and during the purification process involved monitoring the oxidation of benzylamine to benzaldehyde. This reaction can be monitored conveniently at 250 nm. The activity assay was performed in a 1-ml reaction volume containing 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm benzylamine at 37 °C for 5 min. pH-dependent steady-state kinetic studies with benzylamine and d2-benzylamine as substrate were performed by following the formation of benzaldehyde at 250 nm (ϵ250 = 13,800 m−1cm−1). Reactions were performed in 180 mm bis-Tris, pH 5.9–9.2, or in 180 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2–10.1, with varying concentrations of substrate plus 7.4 nm sVAP-1 (based on TPQ content) at 37 °C for 5 min. The kinetic data obtained at pH values of 6.7 and below were fitted with the unmodified hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten equation due the relatively high values for substrate inhibition at lower pH and the difficulty of obtaining reliable data at high benzylamine concentrations. For human and bovine VAP-1 it has been shown that ionic strength influences catalytic turnover, and consequently alternative equations to fit the steady-state data have been proposed (23Holt A. Degenhardt O.S. Berry P.D. Kapty J.S. Mithani S. Smith D.J. Di Paolo M.L. J. Neural Transm. 2007; 114: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, we fitted data displaying substrate inhibition with Equation 1 or Equation 2 (at pH > 7.7). In these equations υi is the initial rate of reaction, Vmax represents the maximum rate of reaction, S represents substrate concentration, Km represents the Michaelis-Menten constant, Ki represents the constant for substrate inhibition, and b is a factor that determines the extent of inhibition. Each data point was obtained from an average of 2–4 measurements.vi=VmaxSS(1+SKi)+Km(Eq. 1) vi=Vmax(1+bSK1)1+KmKi+SKi+KmS(Eq. 2) The pH dependence data were fitted using Equations 3 and 4. For a single kinetically influential ionization, data were fitted using Equation 3, where EH and E are the limiting catalytic efficiencies for the protonated and deprotonated forms of the ionizable groups.(kcatKm)app=EH×10−pH+E×10−pKa10−PH+10−pKa(Eq. 3) In those cases where two kinetically influential ionizations were observed, the data were fitted using Equation 4, where vm is the pH-independent theoretical maximum rate, and α and β are factors that determine residual activity of the fully protonated and deprotonated enzyme-substrate complex, respectively.kcat,app=Vm(1+α×10(pKa,1−pH)+β×10(pH−pKa,2))1+10(pKa,1−pH)+10(pH−pKa,2)(Eq. 4) The effect of para-substitution and deuteration of phenylethylamine on the apparent kinetic parameters of sVAP-1 was investigated by coupling the production of hydrogen peroxide to a chromogenic horseradish peroxidase (HRP) assay. Amine oxidase activity and steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by coupling the production of H2O2 by sVAP-1 to a horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of 4-aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. This results in the formation of a pink-to-purple-colored product, which can be measured at 515 nm (ϵ515 = 26,000 m−1cm−1) (24Federico R. Angelini R. Ercolini L. Venturini G. Mattevi A. Ascenzi P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C and in 180 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture contained 180 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 1 mm 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 3.75 units of horseradish peroxidase, and 11–23 nm sVAP-1 (based on TPQ content). Continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded at X-band (∼9.4 GHz) using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500/E580 EPR spectrometer (Bruker GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). Temperature was controlled using an Oxford Instruments ESR900 helium flow cryostat coupled to an ITC503 controller from the same manufacturer. The temperature was maintained at 20 ± 0.1 K. The microwave power was 0.5 milliwatt, the modulation frequency 100 KHz, and the modulation amplitude 5 G. The g values given were calculated using the software package supplied with the instrument. EPR sample tubes were 4 mm outside diameter in Suprasil quartz supplied by Wilmad. The sample volume was typically 250 μl. Samples containing purified oxidized sVAP-1 were frozen in tubes in liquid nitrogen prior to EPR analysis. Structures of the enzyme-substrate imine (Schiff base) complexes for the two substrates, phenylethylamine and benzylamine, were modeled by superimposing the TPQ aromatic ring of the modeled substrate-TPQ imine complex onto the 2-hydrazinopyridine-bound TPQ (Protein Data Bank code: 2C11) complex. The atom types and the corresponding force constants to describe the substrate-bound cofactor were assigned by analogy with similar chemical moieties. The equilibrium values for the bonds, angles, and dihedral angles were obtained by optimizing the substrate-bound TPQ using the B3LYP/6–31G level of theory. The partial atomic charges were computed by RED (25Dupradeau F.Y. Cézard C. Lelong R. Stanislawiak E. Pêcher J. Delepine J.C. Cieplak P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D360-D367Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in conjunction with RESP implemented in AMBER9 (26Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6581) Google Scholar). The monomeric structure of VAP-1 was then fully solvated in a rectangular water box using the TIP3P model with 8 Å between the edge of the box and the protein. Four Na+ ions were added to neutralize the net charge of the system. Minimizations were carried out using the AMBER ff03 force field in AMBER9. The substrate-bound TPQ and protein were first minimized for 200 steps by steepest descent algorithm followed by 1000 steps by conjugate gradient algorithm. For the expression of sVAP-1, part of the gene encoding residues 29–763 was codon-optimized and synthesized for expression in human cells. The gene was subcloned into a pCep-Pu vector containing the sequence for extracellular expression from human osteonectin (20Swaroop A. Hogan B.L. Francke U. Genomics. 1988; 2: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Soluble VAP-1 is highly expressed in HEK293 EBNA1 cells and typically represents 50–90% of the total amount of protein in the medium (Fig. 1). The calculated mass of sVAP-1 is 81,571.9 g/mol, which does not correspond to the apparent mass derived from SDS-PAGE analysis. However, it has been proposed that glycosylation of sVAP is likely responsible for this discrepancy (27Ohman J. Jakobsson E. Källström U. Elmblad A. Ansari A. Kalderén C. Robertson E. Danielsson E. Gustavsson A.L. Varadi A. Ekblom J. Holmgren E. Doverskog M. Abrahmsén L. Nilsson J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The expressed sVAP-1 was found to be virtually inactive (0.3 unit/ml) because of the low concentration of copper in the medium. The addition of 0.1 mm CuII resulted in a ∼23-fold increase in activity (6.7 units/ml) following overnight incubation. The yield of sVAP-1 after purification using size exclusion chromatography ranged from 10 to 59 mg/liter of culture medium (n = 6 purifications). The expression of sVAP-1 was markedly higher than what had been reported by others (27Ohman J. Jakobsson E. Källström U. Elmblad A. Ansari A. Kalderén C. Robertson E. Danielsson E. Gustavsson A.L. Varadi A. Ekblom J. Holmgren E. Doverskog M. Abrahmsén L. Nilsson J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To calculate the amount of active sVAP-1, the concentration of TPQ cofactor was determined by titrating the enzyme against phenylhydrazine, which forms a stable covalent adduct with the cofactor. The formation of this adduct can be monitored spectroscopically (Fig. 2A). Upon the addition of phenylhydrazine, a linear increase in absorbance at 435 nm was observed, which reached a maximum value at 14.72 μm phenylhydrazine (Fig. 2A, inset). Longer incubation times resulted in a further slow increase in absorbance, attributed to the known instability of phenylhydrazine in neutral to alkaline buffered solutions (28Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The concentration of total protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (79.3 μm). This indicated that ∼19% of the purified sVAP-1 had assembled the TPQ cofactor, suggesting that a significant proportion (∼81%) of the sVAP-1 lacked CuII or that the concentration of oxygen in solution was limiting during the autocatalytic formation of TPQ. However, the addition of copper to the growth media, prolonged incubation with copper after purification, or purging with molecular oxygen did not increase the apparent TPQ content. We inferred therefore that either CuII was replaced by another metal in a large fraction of the purified VAP-1 proteins or that the TPQ cofactor was not able to react with phenylhydrazine, perhaps because of the altered structure of the active site.FIGURE 2Quantification and spectral analysis of the TPQ cofactor of sVAP-1. A, the TPQ content of sVAP-1 was determined by titrating purified sVAP-1 with phenylhydrazine and monitoring the spectral changes caused by the formation of a brightly colored yellow adduct. The experiment was performed in 20 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl. The increase in absorbance is indicated by the arrow. The inset shows the increase in absorbance at 435 nm set out against the concentration of phenylhydrazine. The intercept of the dotted lines reveals the point at which the concentration of phenylhydrazine equals the TPQ concentration. B, a solution containing 14.7 μm oxidized sVAP-1 (based on TPQ content) was fully reduced by adding ∼1.4 mm benzylamine. The displayed difference spectrum of oxidized minus reduced sVAP-1 shows a maximal absorbance at 476 nm with an extinction coefficient of 2.9 mm−1cm−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed EPR analysis with 85 μm purified sVAP-1 to confirm the presence of type-2 copper and investigated whether other metals might occupy the copper binding site. The EPR spectrum (Fig. 3) is axial and clearly shows the typical type-2 copper peaks attributed to the coordination of a CuII ion by three histidine residues and a water molecule, with g‖ = 2.27, g⊥ = 2.06, and A‖ = 163 G. The slight tailing of the peaks suggests that a second CuII environment may be present in a small percentage (less than 10%) of the molecules. This second environment may result from the presence of a hydroxide ion instead of the water molecule close to the CuII, arising from the ionization of water at pH 7.6, or it might be the result of alternate conformations of the TPQ cofactor which can swing between “on-copper” and “off-copper” states. Crystal structures of VAP-1 show that the TPQ cofactor can shuttle between a conformation in which it interacts directly with CuII (on-copper), rendering the cofactor unavailable for catalysis, and a catalytically active conformation in which the TPQ O5 is positioned near the active site catalytic base Asp-386 (off-copper) (29Ernberg K.

https://openalex.org/W2027224364,"The rapid emergence and the prevalence of resistance mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) underscore the need to identify RT inhibitors with novel binding modes and mechanisms of inhibition. Recently, two structurally distinct inhibitors, phosphonoformic acid (foscarnet) and INDOPY-1 were shown to disrupt the translocational equilibrium of RT during polymerization through trapping of the enzyme in the pre- and the post-translocation states, respectively. Here, we show that foscarnet and INDOPY-1 additionally display a shared novel inhibitory preference with respect to substrate primer identity. In RT-catalyzed reactions using RNA-primed substrates, translocation inhibitors were markedly less potent at blocking DNA polymerization than in equivalent DNA-primed assays; i.e. the inverse pattern observed with marketed non-nucleoside inhibitors that bind the allosteric pocket of RT. This potency profile was shown to correspond with reduced binding on RNA·DNA primer/template substrates versus DNA·DNA substrates. Furthermore, using site-specific footprinting with chimeric RNA·DNA primers, we demonstrate that the negative impact of the RNA primer on translocation inhibitor potency is overcome after 18 deoxyribonucleotide incorporations, where RT transitions primarily into polymerization-competent binding mode. In addition to providing a simple means to identify similarly acting translocation inhibitors, these findings suggest a broader role for the primer-influenced binding mode on RT translocation equilibrium and inhibitor sensitivity."
