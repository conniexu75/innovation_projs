(p. 738 , published online 5 July; see the Perspective by Lavik and Ustin ) developed a nanoparticle-based therapeutic that uses a similar targeting mechanism to deliver a drug to vessels obstructed by blood clots. Aggregates of nanoparticles coated with the clot-dissolving drug tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) were designed to fall apart and release the drug only when encountering high fluid shear stress. In preclinical models, the bio-inspired therapeutic dissolved clots and restored normal blood flow at lower doses than free tPA, suggesting that this localized delivery system may help reduce the risk of side effects such as excessive bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2031190648,"Early Bloom Trigger Springtime phytoplankton blooms occur when high nutrient concentrations are combined with abundant sunlight and a stratified upper ocean layer. It has been thought that stratification occurs because in the spring, seasonal warming causes the water to expand, making it less dense, which creates a layer resistant to mixing from below. Now, Mahadevan et al. (p. 54 ; see the Perspective by Martin ) have combined observations of the upper water column from the subpolar North Atlantic with ocean model simulations, which demonstrate that the initial stratification can be triggered by the dynamic effects of passing ocean eddies. These eddies can advance the time of the bloom by 20 to 30 days."

For practical applications such as long-distance quantum communications, cryptography, and quantum networks, entanglement must be heralded. That is, a signal flags the existence of the entangled state so that it can be manipulated and transferred. Hofmann et al. (p. 72 ; see the Perspective by Volz and Rauschenbeutel ) excited trapped single atoms in different laboratory rooms 20 meters apart and were able to show that manipulation, interference, and detection of the photons from the excited atoms could signal when the atoms are entangled. The extent of the observed entanglement may be sufficient to start to probe fundamental questions relating to the entanglement process and thus address the foundations of quantum mechanics."

The T6SS apparatus is composed, in part, of an exterior sheath wrapped around an interior tube. Here, we report that in living cells the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphatase called ClpV specifically recognizes the contracted T6SS sheath structure, causing its disassembly within seconds. ClpV imaging allowed spatial and temporal documentation of cell-cell interactions (termed T6SS dueling) that likely mark the location of repeated T6SS-mediated protein translocation events between bacterial cells."

Stratospheric sulfate aerosols can form from sulfur dioxide that has been transported from the underlying troposphere. Large volcanic eruptions can inject sulfur dioxide and other material into the stratosphere, but smaller volcanoes have been thought not to be energetic enough to do so. Bourassa et al. (p. 78 ) used satellite data to show that sulfur dioxide from the 2011 eruption of the Nabro stratovolcano in Eritrea was lofted into the stratosphere by deep convection associated with the Asian summer monsoon."

Carter et al. (p. 109 ) invited subjects to play a simplified virtual poker game against either a human or a computer and examined brain scans collected during the game. The brains scans when the cards shown were used to predict the participant's decision 6 seconds later. Activity in one region, the temporal-parietal junction, was one of the best predictors of future decisions against a human opponent, but the single worst predictor against a computer opponent."

(p. 749 , published online 5 July) studied a special type of glial cell in the cerebellum. Conditional mutant mice were produced in which the two glutamate receptor subunits normally present in Bergmann glial cells were efficiently ablated in a temporally controlled manner. Glutamate signaling of the glial cells contributed to the structural and functional integrity of the cerebellar network. Bergmann glial cells also played a role in the “fine-tuning” of neuronal processing, which is crucial for the fast and precise control of complex motor behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1986837147,"The Inner Workings of a Clock Eukaryotic circadian clocks are built at least in part on transcriptional feedback loops, but the mechanisms underlying circadian feedback are poorly understood. Padmanabhan et al. (p. 599 , published online 5 July) explored the transcriptional feedback mechanism at the heart of the mammalian circadian clock. The proteins PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME suppress transcription of their own genes. PER complexes do so in part by recruiting a histone deacetylase to promoters of clock genes. But PER is also present on DNA in a complex with Senataxin, a helicase that functions in transcriptional termination. Senataxin appears to be inhibited in the PER complex, thus inhibiting termination and further reducing the rate of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2140711477,"A Long Collapse Coral reefs are threatened by global warming and ocean acidification, and so it is important to understand better how and why environmental changes have affected them in the past. Toth et al. (p. 81 ) present a 6000-year-long record of coral reefs off the coast of Panama, Central America. The reefs effectively stopped growing for approximately 2600 years, beginning around 4000 years ago. This collapse of the coral reef system was probably caused by increased variability of ENSO, the El Nino–Southern Oscillation. If the strength or frequency of ENSO were to increase, the viability of these and other reef systems in the Pacific could be put further at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2161416851,"Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles released from cells and found in vivo in most biological fluids. Functions reported for exosomes include cell–cell communication, roles in modulating immune responses, and roles in the transfer of pathogens such as prions. Here we investigated the molecular characteristics of the structure of exosomes that harbor prion infectivity to determine the native structure of exosomes and whether infected exosomes have a distinct structure. Cryo-electron tomography revealed the previously unidentified ultrastructural detail of exosomes with high resolution. Exosomes were found to be naturally spherical in shape and to have a diverse population that varies in size and internal structure, such as differences in the number of membrane structures. Exosomes isolated from prion-infected cells contained a significantly different population of exosomes with distinct structural features compared to control vesicles from mock-infected cells. Exosomes are highly structured vesicles that can modify their structure on altering their protein cargo. This finding provides further insight into the role that the exosomal protein cargo plays on influencing the structure of the vesicles as well as highlighting the diversity of exosomes and their relationship to biological processes.—Coleman, B.

https://openalex.org/W1983426458,"Big Black Holes Black holes come in two sizes: stellar-mass black holes, with masses just above that of the Sun, and supermassive black holes, with masses up to a billion times that of the Sun. The hyperluminous x-ray source HLX-1 in the spiral galaxy ESO 243-49 is the best candidate to host a black hole of intermediate mass. Webb et al. (p. 554 , published online 5 July) now report the detection of transient radio emission from this source, which may represent a jet ejection event. The radio flares indicate a mass that is consistent with that of an intermediate mass black hole. Jets have been seen to emanate from both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes. Intermediate mass black holes thus seem to behave like other black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2024303950,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system provides adaptive and heritable immunity against foreign genetic elements in most archaea and many bacteria. Although this system is widespread and diverse with many subtypes, only a few species have been investigated to elucidate the precise mechanisms for the defense of viruses or plasmids. Approximately 90% of all sequenced archaea encode CRISPR/Cas systems, but their molecular details have so far only been examined in three archaeal species: Sulfolobus solfataricus, Sulfolobus islandicus, and Pyrococcus furiosus. Here, we analyzed the CRISPR/Cas system of Haloferax volcanii using a plasmid-based invader assay. Haloferax encodes a type I-B CRISPR/Cas system with eight Cas proteins and three CRISPR loci for which the identity of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) was unknown until now. We identified six different PAM sequences that are required upstream of the protospacer to permit target DNA recognition. This is only the second archaeon for which PAM sequences have been determined, and the first CRISPR group with such a high number of PAM sequences. Cells could survive the plasmid challenge if their CRISPR/Cas system was altered or defective, e.g. by deletion of the cas gene cassette. Experimental PAM data were supplemented with bioinformatics data on Haloferax and Haloquadratum."

This process is essential to maintain the proper activity of CRLs in cells. Here, we report a detailed kinetic characterization of CSN-mediated deconjugation of Nedd8 from SCF. CSN is an efficient enzyme, with a kcat of ∼1 s−1 and Kmfor neddylated Cul1-Rbx1 of ∼200 nm, yielding a kcat/Km near the anticipated diffusion-controlled limit. Assembly with an F-box-Skp1 complex markedly inhibited deneddylation, although the magnitude varied considerably, with Fbw7-Skp1 inhibiting by ∼5-fold but Skp2-Cks1-Skp1 by only ∼15%. Deneddylation of both SCFFbw7 and SCFSkp2-Cks1 was further inhibited ∼2.5-fold by the addition of substrate. Combined, the inhibition by Fbw7-Skp1 plus its substrate cyclin E was greater than 10-fold. Unexpectedly, our results also uncover significant product inhibition by deconjugated Cul1, which results from the ability of Cul1 to bind tightly to CSN. Reciprocally, CSN inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of deneddylated Cul1. We propose a model in which assembled CRL complexes engaged with substrate are normally refractory to deneddylation. Upon consumption of substrate and subsequent deneddylation, CSN can remain stably bound to the CRL and hold it in low state of reduced activity.

Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) 4The abbreviations used are: CRLcullin-RING ubiquitin ligaseCSNCOP9 signalosomeSCFSkp1-Cul1-F-Box. are heteromeric enzymes comprising cullin, RING domain, and substrate receptor subunits (1Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). The cullin subunit serves as the backbone of the enzyme, displaying on one end a substrate receptor complex that recruits substrates for ubiquitylation and on the other end a RING domain subunit (Rbx1/Roc1/Hrt1) that recruits a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that transfers ubiquitin to substrate. cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase COP9 signalosome Skp1-Cul1-F-Box. CRLs comprise a family of up to 240 enzymes that exert a profound effect on eukaryotic cells and organisms. CRLs, in aggregate, appear to account for ∼20% of total protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (3Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E.

Pagano M. The SCF ubiquitin ligase. Insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). CRLs and the pathways they control are also prominent targets of mutation in human diseases. For example, the most common genetic defect observed in colon cancer is of the APC pathway, which mediates degradation of β-catenin via the CRL known as SCFβ-TrCP (5Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP. Tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Likewise, the CRL subunit Fbw7/Cdc4 is a prominent human tumor suppressor gene (6Crusio K.M. King B. Reavie L.B. Aifantis I. The ubiquitous nature of cancer: the role of the SCF(Fbw7) complex in development and transformation.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4865-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Given their central roles in controlling numerous cellular processes, there is considerable impetus to understand how CRLs work and how they are regulated. Although much of the regulation in CRL pathways is focused on the substrates, the CRLs themselves are well documented to be regulated by conjugation of the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein, Nedd8 (7Bosu D.R. Kipreos E.T. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Global regulation and activation cycles.Cell Div. 2008; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Deshaies R.J. Emberley E.D. Saha A. Control of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase activity by Nedd8.in: Groettrup M. Conjugation and Deconjugation of Ubiquitin Family Modifiers. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2010: 41-56Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome is an 8-subunit complex that was originally discovered based on its role in controlling light-regulated development in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. The COP9 signalosome. More than a protease.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Insight into the molecular basis of CSN action began to emerge with the finding that in human cells, CSN forms a stable complex with a particular subfamily of CRLs known as SCF ubiquitin ligases (10Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J. Promotion of NEDD-CUL1 conjugate cleavage by COP9 signalosome.Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). A similar interaction was also detected in Arabidopsis (11Schwechheimer C. Serino G. Callis J. Crosby W.L. Lyapina S. Deshaies R.J. Gray W.M. Estelle M. Deng X.W. Interactions of the COP9 signalosome with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFTIRI in mediating auxin response.Science. 2001; 292: 1379-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Importantly, CSN was shown to control Nedd8 modification of the Cul1 subunit of SCF (10Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J. Promotion of NEDD-CUL1 conjugate cleavage by COP9 signalosome.Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Whereas ∼10–20% of Cul1 is typically modified with Nedd8 in wild type Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in CSN-deficient cells the entire population of Cul1 is neddylated. The reason for this is that CSN-deficient cells lack an enzymatic activity that deconjugates Nedd8 from Cul1 (i.e., deneddylates). Subsequently, it was shown that this enzymatic activity resides within the Csn5 subunit of CSN and is specified by a novel metalloenzyme motif referred to as the JAMM domain (12Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of predicted metalloprotease motif of Jab1/Csn5 in cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1.Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). It is now widely appreciated that CSN mediates deneddylation of all cullins and appears to be the only enzyme capable of doing so with good efficiency (7Bosu D.R. Kipreos E.T. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Global regulation and activation cycles.Cell Div. 2008; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Deshaies R.J. Emberley E.D. Saha A. Control of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase activity by Nedd8.in: Groettrup M. Conjugation and Deconjugation of Ubiquitin Family Modifiers. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2010: 41-56Google Scholar). In vitro, CSN inhibits CRL activity (13Yang X. Menon S. Lykke-Andersen K. Tsuge T. Di X. Wang X. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Zhang H. Wei N.

Biol. 2002; 12: 667-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This can be readily understood, because conjugation of Nedd8 to Cul1 stimulates the activity of SCF (14Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M.

NEDD8 recruits E2-ubiquitin to SCF E3 ligase.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, multiple lines of genetic evidence indicate that CSN is required to sustain CRL activity in cells (7Bosu D.R. Kipreos E.T. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Global regulation and activation cycles.Cell Div. 2008; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This apparent paradox is resolved by the observation that CSN-mediated inactivation of CRLs counteracts autocatalytic breakdown of substrate receptor subunits (18Wee S. Geyer R.K. Toda T. Wolf D.A. CSN facilitates Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase function by counteracting autocatalytic adapter instability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Cope G.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32188-32196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the principal physiological function of CSN appears to be to sustain optimal levels of CRL activity. Several lines of evidence point toward CSN playing an important role in human cancer and potentially being a novel molecular target for cancer therapy. The catalytic subunit of CSN, Csn5, is overproduced in many human cancers, and its overproduction often correlates with poor survival (21Shackleford T.J. Claret F.X. JAB1/CSN5. A new player in cell cycle control and cancer.Cell Div. 2010; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the coding region for Csn5 is co-amplified along with that for c-Myc in some aggressive human breast cancers (22Adler A.S. Lin M. Horlings H. Nuyten D.S. van de Vijver M.J. Chang H.Y. Genetic regulators of large-scale transcriptional signatures in cancer.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Simultaneous overexpression of the two proteins synergistically activates c-Myc target genes, implicating Csn5 as a positive regulator of c-Myc. Moreover, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of Csn5 greatly attenuates growth of a c-Myc-driven tumor in mice (23Adler A.S. Littlepage L.E. Lin M. Kawahara T.L. Wong D.J. Werb Z. Chang H.Y. CSN5 isopeptidase activity links COP9 signalosome activation to breast cancer progression.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, knockdown of Csn5 suppresses growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice (24Lee Y.H. Judge A.D. Seo D. Kitade M. Gómez-Quiroz L.E. Ishikawa T. Andersen J.B. Kim B.K. Marquardt J.U. Raggi C. Avital I. Conner E.A. MacLachlan I. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Molecular targeting of CSN5 in human hepatocellular carcinoma. A mechanism of therapeutic response.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 4175-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, four subunits of CSN were shown to be required for the growth of human colon cancer cells that express GTPase mutant K-Ras, but not of isogenic cells in which the oncogenic KRAS allele was deleted (25Luo J. Emanuele M.J. Li D. Creighton C.J. Schlabach M.R. Westbrook T.F. Wong K.K. Elledge S.J. A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies multiple synthetic lethal interactions with the Ras oncogene.Cell. 2009; 137: 835-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that CSN promotes cancer and nominate Csn5 as a target for cancer therapy. To successfully target CSN in cancer will require a better understanding of how CSN works in cells, which in turn will require a better quantitative understanding of the biochemical properties of CSN. Although it has been known for 10 years that CSN catalyzes the removal of Nedd8 from Cul1, the quantitative parameters for this reaction have yet to be described, because of the complexity of both the enzyme and its substrate. Here, we establish enzyme and substrate preparations and quantitative biochemical assays that allowed us to measure the steady-state kinetic parameters for substrate deneddylation by CSN. Our most important finding is that different F-box proteins can directly inhibit deneddylation of their Cul1 partner to variable extents, and this inhibition is potentiated upon binding of substrate. We also find that CSN has unusually high affinity for its reaction product, unmodified Cul1-Rbx1. Finally, we document that CSN can also inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity of purified, unmodified SCF, pointing to a new and unexpected role of CSN as a stoichiometric inhibitor of the activity of deneddylated CRLs. 293F23V5 cells (gift from Z. Q. Pan, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) stably expressing FLAG-Csn2 and Csn3-V5 were adapted to grow under suspension conditions in FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen). When an approximate cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml was reached in a culture volume of 500 ml, the cells were pelleted, washed once in cold PBS, pelleted again, and flash frozen in liquid N2. CSN was affinity-purified using anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma) as previously described (26Yamoah K. Wu K. Pan Z.Q. In vitro cleavage of Nedd8 from cullin 1 by COP9 signalosome and deneddylase 1.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except binding occurred over a 2-h period, 1 mm EDTA was used, EGTA was omitted, and Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) was used instead of individually adding different inhibitors. Following affinity purification, CSN was concentrated and immediately loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (storage buffer). Fractions containing CSN were pooled, concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-4 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore), and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C. The artificial gene His8-PKA-Nedd8 was designed to aid in the purification of in vitro neddylated Cul1 and to be radiolabeled with 32P for quantitative enzymatic analysis. The gene encoding the amino acid sequence MHHHHHHHHRRGSLMLIKVKTLTGKEIEIDIEPTDKVERIKERVEEKEGIPPQQQRLIYSGKQMNDEKTAADYKILGGSVLHLVLALRGG was purchased from DNA2.0 and put into their expression plasmid pJexpress414. Expression was in BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells under ampicillin selection. 1-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of ∼1.0 was reached. The temperature was dropped to 16 °C before the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Induction was carried out at 16 °C overnight. Bacterial pellets were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 1.5 ml of nickel beads (Qiagen) per pellet from a 1-liter culture. Binding to resin was allowed to occur for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed two times with 50 column volumes of lysis buffer, followed by elution with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. This mixture was then loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column equilibrated in storage buffer composed of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Fractions with His8-PKA-Nedd8 were concentrated, and the purified protein was frozen at −80 °C.

Phosphorylated Cyclin E-Cdk2 was a gift from B. Larimore (Clurman laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Cul1-Rbx1 was neddylated with His8-PKA-Nedd8 (HPN8) using conditions previously described (14Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M.

Cul1-Rbx1 conjugated with HPN8 was purified by standard column chromatography techniques, using first S-Sepharose, followed by binding to nickel affinity matrix and then Superdex 200 gel filtration. For the experiments shown in supplemental Fig. S1 (C and D), neddylation reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μm MLN4924 and then diluted directly into a deneddylation reaction. Deneddylation reactions in Figs. 2E and 3 were carried out with 0.8 nm CSN in a 1× deneddylation buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 ng/μl ovalbumin. Deneddylation reactions in Fig. 2A and supplemental Figs. S1, C and D, and S3) were carried out with 1 nm CSN in deneddylation buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, 1 ng/μl ovalbumin. Deneddylation reactions in Fig. 2 (B–D) were carried out with 1 nm CSN in deneddylation buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, 15 ng/μl ovalbumin 25 mm trehalose. See figure legends for the time of reaction and the concentrations of the reaction components. All of the reactions were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C). Deneddylation reactions were quenched with reducing SDS-PAGE buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 16% gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for analysis. Quantification was performed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) and plotted using GraphPad Prism. All of the values reported are the averages of at least two independent experiments. Rates of deneddylation were calculated by dividing the signal for free 32P-labeled HPN8 by the summed signals for 32P-labeled HPN8-Cul1 and free HPN8 to obtain the percentage of deneddylation. The amount of free Nedd8 formed was then calculated as: (% deneddylation) * (concentration of input HPN8-Cul1-Rbx1)/100. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2 (A–D), initial rates were calculated excluding the first 10 s, because of the apparent biphasic nature of some of the reactions, which we ascribe to a small fraction of Cul1 that did not assemble with F-box-Skp1 or substrate and was therefore deneddylated more rapidly.FIGURE 3Proteins that bind the C-terminal domain of Cul1 inhibit deneddylation. A, 32P-labeled HPN8-Cul1-Rbx1 (25 nm) was incubated for 10 min with 1 μm of the indicated factor prior to addition of 0.8 nm CSN.

All of the reactions were performed at room temperature (23 °C). See figure legends for the time of reaction and the concentrations of the reaction components. Ubiquitylation reactions were quenched with reducing SDS-PAGE buffer and separated on 16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for analysis. Quantification was performed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) and plotted using GraphPad Prism. All of the values reported are the averages of at least two independent experiments, except supplemental Fig. S4. HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and grown under standard cell culture conditions in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For transfection, Lipofectamine2000 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A description of the plasmids used in this study for transfection and immunoprecipitation is provided in supplemental Table S4. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μm cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with either anti-HA (Covance), anti-M2 FLAG (Sigma), or anti-Myc (Covance) and 30 μl of Tris-Acryl protein A (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Resins were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The proteins bound to resin were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7, 10 or 12.5% gel. Immunodetection was performed with antisera to Cul1 and Skp1 (Invitrogen), Cand1 (Calbiochem), Cks1 (Invitrogen), Csn5 (Santa Cruz), Myc (Covance), and Rbx1/Roc1 (BIOSOURCE). We set out to characterize in depth the deneddylating activity of CSN by developing an in vitro assay in which the conversion of neddylated Cul1 to Cul1 could be quantitatively measured. CSN was purified from HEK293 cells that stably express the Csn2 subunit modified with an N-terminal FLAG tag (27Wu K. Yamoah K. Dolios G. Gan-Erdene T. Tan P. Chen A. Lee C.G. Wei N. Wilkinson K.D. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. DEN1 is a dual function protease capable of processing the C terminus of Nedd8 and deconjugating hyper-neddylated CUL1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28882-28891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CSN recovered from an anti-FLAG affinity column was further enriched by gel filtration prior to being used for the experiments described here. All eight subunits were found to be present in the purified material, in apparently stoichiometric amounts (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis of purified CSN identified two co-fractionating proteins (Ddb1 and Hsp70) that could not be totally removed by conventional methods such as high salt or treatment with ATP and Mg2+ (data not shown). To develop a quantitative, multiturnover assay for deneddylation, we first sought to generate a labeled form of Nedd8. To this end, we fused a sequence encoding eight histidines followed by a protein kinase A phosphorylation site to the N terminus of Nedd8 to generate His-PKA-Nedd8 (HPN8). When Cul1 was neddylated with HPN8 (HPN8-Cul1) and subsequently purified by gel filtration and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, the resulting CSN substrate was 98% neddylated as determined by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). After radioisotope labeling with [32P]ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, >97% of the total signal from Nedd8 was attached to Cul1 as determined by phosphorimaging (Fig. 1B; time = 0). When CSN (1 nm) was added to HPN8-Cul1 (50 nm) and the reaction progress analyzed, deneddylation proceeded at a linear rate (Fig. 1, B and C). Prior to performing kinetic analyses, we carried out a series of control experiments. First we confirmed that the phosphorylated His-PKA tag had little to no effect on the rate of deneddylation of Cul1 (supplemental Fig. S1C). Second, we compared rates of deneddylation by our FLAG-tagged CSN prepared from 293 cells with untagged CSN expressed in insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses (supplemental Fig. S1D) and untagged CSN expressed in E. coli (28Sharon M. Mao H. Boeri Erba E. Stephens E. Zheng N. Robinson C.V. Symmetrical modularity of the COP9 signalosome complex suggests its multifunctionality.Structure. 2009; 17: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1E). The FLAG tag had no discernable effect on the activity of CSN isolated from eukaryotic cells. Meanwhile, the enzyme purified from E. coli was ∼2-fold less active, possibly because of removal of terminal sequences from some subunits to facilitate expression. To obtain enzymological metrics for CSN-mediated deneddylation, we evaluated reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration. CSN was held constant at 0.8 nm, and the initial rates of deneddylation at varying concentrations of HPN8-Cul1-Rbx1 were determined (supplemental Fig. S1F). The rates for each concentration of substrate were plotted and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, which yielded a Km of 212 nm and a kcat of 1.1 s−1 (Fig. 1D) supplemental Table S1. Within cells, the fraction of Cul1 that is modified by Nedd8 is higher for Cul1 bound to F-box proteins (16Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17032-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this might arise from differential rates of deneddylation of Cul1, depending upon its assembly status. To test this possibility, we compared rates of deneddylation for HPN8-Cul1-Rbx1 versus three different HPN8-conjugated SCF holoenzyme complexes. Deneddylation of HPN8-SCFFbw7 and HPN8-SCFb-TrCP was assayed at 500 nm. Strikingly, Fbw7-Skp1 had a major effect, reducing the rate of deneddylation by 5.8-fold (Fig. 2A). β-TrCP-Skp1 had a weaker effect, reducing the rate by 2.2-fold. However, the recombinant β-TrCP used for this experiment lacks the N-terminal 138 amino acids, which were removed to facilitate efficient expression (30Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D.

Addition of Skp2-Cks1-Skp1 reduced the rate of deneddylation by <20% (Fig. 2B). We do not understand the basis for this difference in behavior but note that endogenous Cul1 co-precipitated with transiently expressed F-box proteins was ≥50% neddylated in β-TrCP and Fbw7 immunoprecipitates but considerably less mod"

Little is known about the cell entry pathway of these different HCV particle subpopulations, which likely occurs by regulated spatiotemporal processes involving several cell surface molecules. One of these molecules is the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a receptor for high density lipoprotein that can bind to the HCV glycoprotein E2. By studying the entry properties of infectious virus subpopulations differing in their buoyant densities, we show that these HCV particles utilize SR-BI in a manifold manner. First, SR-BI mediates primary attachment of HCV particles of intermediate density to cells. These initial interactions involve apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein E, present on the surface of HCV particles, but not the E2 glycoprotein, suggesting that lipoprotein components in the virion act as host-derived ligands for important entry factors such as SR-BI. Second, we found that in contrast to this initial attachment, SR-BI mediates entry of HCV particles independent of their buoyant density. This function of SR-BI does not depend on E2/SR-BI interaction but relies on the lipid transfer activity of SR-BI, probably by facilitating entry steps along with other HCV entry co-factors. Finally, our results underscore a third function of SR-BI governed by specific residues in hypervariable region 1 of E2 leading to enhanced cell entry and depending on SR-BI ability to bind to E2.

HCV infection is characterized by its high propensity to persist with up to 80% of individuals failing to eliminate the virus. Infected patients have a high risk to develop severe liver damage such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with liver transplantation as the final treatment option. No vaccine against HCV is yet available, and despite the ongoing development of HCV-specific DAAs (direct-acting antivirals) such as protease inhibitors, it remains of utmost importance to pursue the development of novel DAAs that can target alternative steps of HCV life cycle to more efficiently cure HCV-infected individuals. HCV entry into the cell offers numerous targets for development of such antiviral treatments (for review, see Ref. 1Zeisel M.B. Fofana I. Fafi-Kremer S. Baumert T.F.

Furthermore, host cell kinases have been shown to regulate HCV entry by promoting cell entry factor associations (44Lupberger J. Zeisel M.B. Xiao F. Thumann C. Fofana I. Zona L. Davis C. Mee C.J.

Subsequent release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm is thought to occur after low pH-induced fusion of the viral and the endosomal membranes, a process that is likely triggered by the viral envelope glycoproteins and upon their interaction with CD81 (36Koutsoudakis G.

Yet, the exact roles of the HCV entry factors for cell attachment, internalization, and subsequent membrane fusion are still elusive. The HCV entry factor SR-BI is a “multi-ligand” receptor that binds different classes of lipoproteins and thereby regulates the supply of cholesterol to the cell by its bidirectional lipid transfer function (51Krieger M.

A scavenger receptor with a mission to transport high density lipoprotein lipids.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SR-BI was initially proposed as a HCV receptor based on its capacity to mediate binding of soluble HCV E2 glycoprotein (sE2) to human hepatic cells (38Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. The human scavenger receptor class B type I is a novel candidate receptor for the hepatitis C virus.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Using cell entry models, i.e. HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and HCVcc, we and others demonstrated that SR-BI is essential for viral entry (for review, see Ref. 26Dao Thi V.L. Dreux M. Cosset F.L.

Similar switches may operate in bacteria that flip between harmless commensals and lethal pathogens. The bio-control agent Bacillus thuringiensis also kills insects by means of a crystal toxin, which allows the bacteria to penetrate the host gut and access nutrients. Release of nutrients also allows bacterial cheats that do not make toxin, to grow and outcompete the toxin-producing colonizers. In field experiments, Raymond et al.

Because these type of virulence factors are secreted from the cell and are widespread in pathogens, such social interactions may affect the fitness and constrain the virulence of many toxin-producing bacteria."

Taken together, these reports suggest that αS interacts widely with multiple organelles, but in all cases, these interactions involve membranes. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand the mechanism(s) of αS-membrane interactions. A number of in vitro studies have found the conformation of αS to be highly adaptable. It has long been known that αS is an intrinsically disordered protein in solution (28Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. NACP, a protein implicated in Alzheimer disease and learning, is natively unfolded.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar).

Upon long incubation, it passes through toxic oligomeric states to reach an amyloid conformation (32Der-Sarkissian A. Jao C.C. Chen J. Langen R.

However, in the presence of negatively charged membranes (35Rhoades E. Ramlall T.F. Webb W.W. Eliezer D.

Moreover, these two conformations are reported to co-exist (48Lokappa S.B. Ulmer T.S. α-Synuclein populates both elongated and broken helix states on small unilamellar vesicles.J. Biol.

Dobson C.M. Bax A. Multiple tight phospholipid-binding modes of α-synuclein revealed by solution NMR spectroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 775-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that the different membrane-bound forms of αS are energetically similar. Nevertheless, the state of the membrane has been found to correlate with particular structures. EPR spectroscopy revealed that the extended conformation predominates when αS binds to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). In this extended conformation, the molecule is further twisted into a right-handed super-coil akin to a coiled-coil structure (39Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and the interacted vesicle remain intact. In contrast, horseshoe-like structures are formed when αS binds to vesicles as they are converted into smaller nonvesicular structures (39Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Structure of membrane-bound α-synuclein from site-directed spin labeling and computational refinement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the presence of large negatively charged vesicles, αS has been observed to remodel vesicles into tubes (51Varkey J. Isas J.M. Mizuno N. Jensen M.B. Bhatia V.K. Jao C.C. Petrlova J. Voss J.C. Stamou D.G. Steven A.C. Langen R. Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins.J. Biol.

Hovis J.S. α-Synuclein-induced tubule formation in lipid bilayers.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115: 5886-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) data have shown that this remodeling event is accompanied by a conformational change in αS from random coil to α-helix (51Varkey J. Isas J.M. Mizuno N. Jensen M.B. Bhatia V.K. Jao C.C. Petrlova J. Voss J.C. Stamou D.G. Steven A.C. Langen R. Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32486-32493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the underlying structural change of αS and the tubulation mechanism has not been established. In this study, we used cryo-EM, CD, and EPR spectroscopy in combination with more closely investigated αS-induced tubulation of vesicles. αS was prepared as described (51Varkey J. Isas J.M. Mizuno N. Jensen M.B. Bhatia V.K. Jao C.C. Petrlova J. Voss J.C. Stamou D.G. Steven A.C. Langen R. Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32486-32493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In brief, wild-type and mutant human αS were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, which were lysed by boiling, followed by acid precipitation. The supernatant was passed through anion exchange columns and eluted with a 0–1.0 m NaCl gradient. Lipids purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL) as a solution in chloroform were transferred to a glass tube, and the chloroform was removed by blowing N2 gas. After the lipids were further dried under vacuum in a desiccator for at least 6 h, buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) was added, and the mixture was immediately used in experiments. Preparation and incubation of lipids with αS were performed above 32 °C to avoid any effects from phase transitions. Nevertheless, consistent results were obtained in all cases with experiments performed at room temperature. Light scattering was measured as a function of time using a Jasco V-550 UV-visible spectrophotometer to monitor the interaction of αS with large lipid vesicles. A monitoring wavelength of 500 nm was used with a slit width of 2 nm and medium response time. Briefly, lipid vesicles were suspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) with 100 mm NaCl at a final volume of 500 μl in a quartz cuvette. Control vesicles (no protein added) did not show any change in light scattering. All spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm quartz cell. A scan rate of 50 nm/min, bandwidth of 1 nm, 0.1 nm time response, and step resolution of 0.5 nm were set for all experiments. For time course experiments, the parameters were set at a 1-s data pitch, 4-s response time, and 1 nm bandwidth. Protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm based on the number of Trp and Tyr residues in the protein. Appropriate blanks were collected under similar conditions and subtracted to obtain the final spectra. 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used in all CD experiments. 5-μl drops were applied to holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) and vitrified in a Vitrobot cryo-station (FEI). The humidity was carefully controlled to avoid drying-related deformation of membranes, and the temperature was set to be above the phase transition temperature (Tm) of individual lipids. Specimens were observed with a CM200-FEG electron microscope at nominal magnifications of 38,000 and 66,000, with defocus settings in the range of −1 to −4 μm. Film (SO163, Eastman Kodak Co.) was used for recording images, and digitization was done with a SCAI scanner (Carl Zeiss) at rates of 1.84 or 0.966 Å/pixel. The contrast transfer function was partially corrected by phase-flipping. For averaging experiments, relatively straight tubes were selected, computationally straightened, and cut into segments using a box size of 270 Å. Image segments were binned 2-fold to increase the speed of the computation. For the analysis of αS-POPG at different protein-to-lipid ratios, stacks of 1787 (1:40 data), 1290 (1:20 data), and 1216 (1:10 data) segments were compiled for classification and averaging. For the analysis of αS bound to various lipids, stacks of 4932 (DMPG), 3325 (POPG), 530 (DOPG), 944 (DLPG), and 111 (DAPG) segments were compiled for analysis of cylindrical micelles and 932 (DOPG), 552 (DLPG), and 359 (DAPG) segments for bilayer tubes. Reference-free classification (k means) and averaging were performed using SPIDER (53Shaikh T.R. Gao H. Baxter W.T. Asturias F.J. Boisset N. Leith A. Frank J. SPIDER image processing for single-particle reconstruction of biological macromolecules from electron micrographs.Nat.

For the cylindrical micelles, we did not see evident morphological distinctions among averaged images, post-classification, and therefore we chose to display the average of the majority class from each experimental condition.

Despite the limitations of the classical methods (14Knowles T.P. Shu W. Devlin G.L. Meehan S. Auer S. Dobson C.M. Welland M.E.

Typically, the progress of fibrillization is expressed as the normalized fraction of amyloid protein converted into fibrils (α); on a mass basis, α corresponds to the quotient of the fibril mass increase Δm at a given instant divided by the total mass of fibrils formed at the end of the assay ΔmT. α=ΔmΔmT(Eq. 1) The time-course results represented in Fig. 1 exemplify well two types of kinetics usually observed during amyloid fibril formation.

Nevertheless, as shown by this example, the absence of a lag phase is also reported for unseeded reactions (18Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W.

Between the classical sigmoidal kinetics, showing an inflection point at αi = 0.5, and the hyperbolic/seeded polymerization kinetics, showing no evident inflection point, there are a number of intermediate possibilities that have been comprehensively reviewed by Finke and co-workers (4Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Protein aggregation kinetics, mechanism, and curve-fitting: a review of the literature.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 20Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Agar J.N. Finke R.G.

As discussed in those reviews, the meaning of the different shapes has been interpreted over the last 50 years according to several thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Given the complexity and variability of the protein aggregation models, a modular approach was recently proposed to systematically identify the mechanism that best describes nucleation (or prepolymerization), growth (or polymerization), and fragmentation steps (15Xue W.F. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Systematic analysis of nucleation-dependent polymerization reveals new insights into the mechanism of amyloid self-assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The available fundamental models are in general highly specific for the amyloid polypeptide under study. Models containing a high number of parameters cannot fit to experimental data in a unique way, whereas some of the theoretical elementary steps refer to time frames that are experimentally inaccessible. Overparameterization makes it hard to validate different parts of mechanistically elaborated models (21Schmidt H. Madsen M.F. Danø S. Cedersund G. Complexity reduction of biochemical rate expressions.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is recognized as a problem in protein aggregation modeling (22Bernacki J.P. Murphy R.M. Model discrimination and mechanistic interpretation of kinetic data in protein aggregation studies.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 2871-2887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the pursuit of a consensual, two-parameter model for describing protein aggregation kinetics, the 1997 Finke-Watzky mechanism for transition-metal nanocluster formation (23Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Transition metal nanocluster formation kinetic and mechanistic studies: a new mechanism when hydrogen is the reductant: slow, continuous nucleation and fast autocatalytic surface growth.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10382-10400Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar) was successfully applied to a wide range of kinetic data (4Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Protein aggregation kinetics, mechanism, and curve-fitting: a review of the literature.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 20Morris A.M.

In the formulation of the Finke-Watzky model, slow continuous nucleation is followed by autocatalytic surface growth so that the overall rate of protein concentration decrease is given by -dCdt=k1C+k2C(C0-C)(Eq. 2) with k1 and k2 being, respectively, the nucleation and growth average rate constants. For an initial protein concentration C0, the solution of the ordinary differential equation can be expressed as C0-CC0=1-1+k1k2C1+k1k2C0exp{(1+k1k2C0)k2C0t}(Eq. 3) Note that the difference (C0 − C) corresponds, by mass balance, to the instantaneous concentration of protein aggregates (20Morris A.M.

The Finke-Watzky equation is interconvertible by algebraic manipulation into the Saitô and co-workers equation (24Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka A.Y. Saitô H. Conformational transitions and fibrillation mechanism of human calcitonin as studied by high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and into the equation of Fernández et al. (25Fernández C.O. Hoyer W. Zweckstetter M. Jares-Erijman E.A. Subramaniam V. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. NMR of α-synuclein-polyamine complexes elucidates the mechanism and kinetics of induced aggregation.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which, however, depart from different mechanistic assumptions (see supplemental Table S1). When the nucleation rates are very low (k1 → 0), Equation 2 reduces to the differential form of the logistic function, which is commonly used to fit sigmoidal aggregation data (4Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Protein aggregation kinetics, mechanism, and curve-fitting: a review of the literature.Biochim. Biophys.

Apolipoprotein E and antioxidants have different mechanisms of inhibiting Alzheimer β-amyloid fibril formation in vitro.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17882-17889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ferrone's equation (26Ferrone F. Analysis of protein aggregation kinetics.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) is another example of a two-parameter protein aggregation model available in literature that predicts the monomer concentration to decrease with the square of time. Although avoiding overparameterization, these models are very useful from a practical point of view, although some simplifying hypothesis adopted during their derivation may lack solid biophysical basis. For example, Saitô and co-workers (24Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka A.Y. Saitô H. Conformational transitions and fibrillation mechanism of human calcitonin as studied by high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Fernández et al. (25Fernández C.O. Hoyer W. Zweckstetter M. Jares-Erijman E.A. Subramaniam V. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. NMR of α-synuclein-polyamine complexes elucidates the mechanism and kinetics of induced aggregation.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) describe elementary kinetic steps by reaction-like rate equations that are first-order in relation to the fractional conversion of monomers into fibrils expressed as α and/or (1 − α). In an alternative formalism, Finke and co-workers consider (4Morris A.M. Watzky M.A. Finke R.G. Protein aggregation kinetics, mechanism, and curve-fitting: a review of the literature.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 27Watzky M.A. Morris A.M. Ross E.D. Finke R.G.

Although theoretically more appropriate, the Finke-Watzky formalism results in the paradox that according to Equation 2, all the dissolved protein is expected to convert into fibrils, i.e. the expected steady-state concentration is C∞ = 0. This is not possible in the light of the general phase equilibrium condition and is not supported by measurements of dissolved protein concentration after long incubation times (18Hurshman A.R.

Finally, the applicability of Ferrone's quadratic equation is inherently limited to the early data points corresponding to ∼10–20% of total monomer loss (22Bernacki J.P. Murphy R.M.

J. 2009; 96: 2871-2887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). β2-microglobulin crystallization-like model monomeric transthyretin. Kinetic modeling of amyloid fibrillization reactions has also been performed using empirical equations such as linear and exponential decay functions (30Hasegawa K. Ono K. Yamada M. Naiki H. Kinetic modeling and determination of reaction constants of Alzheimer β-amyloid fibril extension and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13489-13498Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As recently pointed out by Auer and Kashchiev (31Auer S. Kashchiev D. Insight into the correlation between lag time and aggregation rate in the kinetics of protein aggregation.Proteins. 2010; 78: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) while discussing the applicability of the Avrami equation, it does not seem coincidental that such mathematically simple models are able to describe the α(t) dependence for a wide range of polypeptides and amyloidogenic conditions. With the present contribution, we seek the general principle that seems to govern the kinetics of protein aggregation. We intend to do it in a theoretically consistent way that does not compromise the final simplicity of the model nor its quantitative usefulness. An infinite number of parameter combinations producing equally good agreement with the data should be avoided; that is to say, all the dynamic state variables shall be condensed in a two-parameter model that can be uniquely fit to protein aggregation kinetics. Then, the deepest meaning of each constant should be possible to be determined by using different types of experimental data. For this mechanistic refinement to be possible, oversimplified hypothesis such as those identified in our literature survey should also be avoided during the derivation of the model. Resemblances between amyloid fibril formation and protein crystallization have long been recognized (17Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Seeding “one-dimensional crystallization” of amyloid: a pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer disease and scrapie?.Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Both processes involve the thermodynamic equilibrium between phases, an initial assembly of macromolecules into stable nuclei (nucleation step), and the subsequent formation of supramolecular structures by the successive addition of growth units (growth or elongation step). We propose now to quantitatively describe the aggregation kinetics of amyloid proteins using fundamental principles that are familiar to crystal growth scientists. We will start by defining the thermodynamic driving force for amyloid fibril formation as the variation in chemical potential Δμ occurring when protein molecules in a supersaturated amyloid solution at temperature T are transferred to a fibrillar state Δμ=kTlnaa*(Eq. 4) where k is the Boltzmann constant and a and a* are the activities of supersaturated and saturated amyloid solutions. This is analogous to the definition of supersaturation adopted in crystallization from solution (32Markov I.V. Crystal Growth for Begginers. 2nd Ed. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore2003Crossref Google Scholar). Accurate activity coefficients are difficult to obtain for highly nonideal concentrated solutions. For this reason, and for mathematical simplicity, we will define an approximate amyloid supersaturation σ as a function of protein concentration C and protein solubility C* σ=C-C*C*(Eq. 5) The protein solubility corresponds to the concentration of dissolved protein that equilibrates the chemical potential of the insoluble fibrillar phase. In principle, C* is independent of the initial protein concentration and can be obtained from the remaining concentration of the polypeptide in solution after long reaction times (18Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Transthyretin aggregation under partially denaturing conditions is a downhill polymerization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, when measuring protein aggregation in the presence of high macromolecular content (“macromolecular crowding”), volume-excluding effects may lead to different protein concentrations in equilibrium (33Minton A.P. Implications of macromolecular crowding for protein assembly.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We will return to this issue while discussing possible deviations from the CLM. The total amount of aggregates produced per unit of volume of solution ΔmT/V is given by the difference between the mass concentrations C0 and C*. Equation 5 can thus be rewritten to express amyloid supersaturation as a function of the fraction of protein converted into amyloid aggregates (α) and of the initial supersaturation (σ0). σ=(C0-C*)-(C0-C)C*=ΔmTVC*(1-α)=σ0(1-α)(Eq. 6) The mechanism leading to the formation of amyloid nuclei generally includes conformational changes of the native state (34Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Amyloid formation by globular proteins under native conditions.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and different intermediate structures such as polymorphous and oligomeric aggregates (35Stöhr J. Weinmann N. Wille H. Kaimann T.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although all of the transitions involve energy barriers of different magnitudes, we will consider that the rate-limiting step is the formation of a critical-sized amyloid nucleus. This postulation finds support in the well known fact that the addition of preformed fibrils to amyloidogenic solutions (seeding) completely eliminates the lag phase and induces immediate fibril formation. Classical nucleation theory (37Kashchiev D. Nucleation: Basic Theory with Applications. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford2000Google Scholar, 38Kashchiev D. Auer S. Nucleation of amyloid fibrils.J. Chem. Phys. 2010; 132: 215101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), based on which numerous phase transition phenomena occurring in nature and technology have been explained (39Zhang T.H. Liu X.Y. Nucleation: what happens at the initial stage?.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 1308-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), will be used to estimate the frequency at which new fibrils are created. It is admitted that fluctuations in phase density give rise to the appearance of embryonic formations or nuclei that reduce the bulk free energy (due to the variation in chemical potential Δμ) and increase the surface free energy (due to the creation of a fibril/solution interface). Above a critical nucleus size, the process spontaneously evolves in the direction of amyloid fibril formation. Recently (38Kashchiev D. Auer S. Nucleation of amyloid fibrils.J. Chem. Phys. 2010; 132: 215101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the following expression was proposed for the critical number of monomeric peptides constituting the amyloid nucleus n*=vΔμ2+1(Eq. 7) where ν is a constant accounting for the dimensions and interfacial energies of the nanosized fibril. In the same work, the nucleation rate J was expressed as a complex function of the thermodynamic driving force for amyloid fibril formation (38Kashchiev D. Auer S. Nucleation of amyloid fibrils.J. Chem. Phys. 2010; 132: 215101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We will adopt a simplified version of this relationship that takes into account the very high supersaturation levels associated with amyloidogenic conditions (18Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Transthyretin aggregation under partially denaturing conditions is a downhill polymerization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Sluzky V.

Thermodynamics of Aβ(1–40) amyloid fibril elongation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12709-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For C/C* ratios much higher than 10, the equilibrium concentration of fibril nuclei is expected to increase linearly with C, greatly simplifying the expression of J to a second-order rate equation J≅Aσ2(Eq. 8) with A being a σ-independent kinetic factor expressed in units of frequency per solution volume. During this step, preformed fibrils grow by the successive addition of new structural units. Due to the existence of a preliminary fibril template, the growth (or elongation) step is thermodynamically favored over nucleation; although both processes co-exist during the early phases of incubation (16Naiki H. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Nakamura H. Gejyo F. Nakakuki K.

https://openalex.org/W2147958126,"Glycolysis is the initial step of glucose catabolism and is up-regulated in cancer cells (the Warburg Effect). Such shifts toward a glycolytic phenotype have not been explored widely in other biological systems, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the shifts remain unknown. With proteomics, we observed increased glycolysis in disused human diaphragm muscle. In disused muscle, lung cancer, and H2O2-treated myotubes, we show up-regulation of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme muscle-type phosphofructokinase (PFKm, >2 fold, P<0.05) and accumulation of lactate (>150%, P< 0.05). Using microRNA profiling, we identify miR-320a as a regulator of PFKm expression. Reduced miR-320a levels (to ~50% of control, P<0.05) are associated with the increased PFKm in each of these diverse systems. Manipulation of miR-320a levels both in vitro and in vivo alters PFKm and lactate levels in the expected directions. Further, miR-320a appears to regulate oxidative stress-induced PFKm expression, and reduced miR-320a allows greater induction of glycolysis in response to H2O2 treatment. We show that this microRNA-mediated regulation occurs through PFKm's 3′ untranslated region and that Ets proteins are involved in the regulation of PFKm via miR-320a. These findings suggest that oxidative stress-responsive microRNA-320a may regulate glycolysis broadly within nature.—Tang, H., Lee, M., Sharpe, O., Salamone, L., Noonan, E. J., Hoang, C.

https://openalex.org/W1978275790,"Tau exon 10, which encodes the second microtubule-binding repeat, is regulated by alternative splicing. Its alternative splicing generates Tau isoforms with three- or four-microtubule-binding repeats, named 3R-tau and 4R-tau. Adult human brain expresses equal levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau. Imbalance of 3R-tau and 4R-tau causes Tau aggregation and neurofibrillary degeneration. In the present study, we found that splicing factor SRp55 (serine/arginine-rich protein 55) promoted Tau exon 10 inclusion. Knockdown of SRp55 significantly promoted Tau exon 10 exclusion. The promotion of Tau exon 10 inclusion by SRp55 required the arginine/serine-rich region, which was responsible for the subnucleic speckle localization. Dyrk1A (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A) interacted with SRp55 and mainly phosphorylated its proline-rich domain. Phosphorylation of SRp55 by Dyrk1A suppressed its ability to promote Tau exon 10 inclusion. Up-regulation of Dyrk1A as in Down syndrome could lead to neurofibrillary degeneration by shifting the alternative splicing of Tau exon 10 to an increase in the ratio of 3R-tau/4R-tau. Tau exon 10, which encodes the second microtubule-binding repeat, is regulated by alternative splicing. Its alternative splicing generates Tau isoforms with three- or four-microtubule-binding repeats, named 3R-tau and 4R-tau. Adult human brain expresses equal levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau. Imbalance of 3R-tau and 4R-tau causes Tau aggregation and neurofibrillary degeneration. In the present study, we found that splicing factor SRp55 (serine/arginine-rich protein 55) promoted Tau exon 10 inclusion. Knockdown of SRp55 significantly promoted Tau exon 10 exclusion. The promotion of Tau exon 10 inclusion by SRp55 required the arginine/serine-rich region, which was responsible for the subnucleic speckle localization. Dyrk1A (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A) interacted with SRp55 and mainly phosphorylated its proline-rich domain. Phosphorylation of SRp55 by Dyrk1A suppressed its ability to promote Tau exon 10 inclusion. Up-regulation of Dyrk1A as in Down syndrome could lead to neurofibrillary degeneration by shifting the alternative splicing of Tau exon 10 to an increase in the ratio of 3R-tau/4R-tau."

Their functions have been generally attributed to NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. However, human SIRT5 (sirtuin 5), which has been reported to exhibit little deacetylase activity, was recently identified as an NAD-dependent demalonylase and desuccinylase. Biochemical studies suggested that the mechanism of SIRT5-catalyzed demalonylation and desuccinylation is similar to that of deacetylation catalyzed by other sirtuins. Previously, we solved the crystal structure of a SIRT5-succinyl-lysine peptide-NAD complex. Here, we present two more structures: a binary complex of SIRT5 with an H3K9 succinyl peptide and a binary complex of SIRT5 with a bicyclic intermediate obtained by incubating SIRT5-H3K9 thiosuccinyl peptide co-crystals with NAD. To our knowledge, this represents the first bicyclic intermediate for a sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reaction that has been captured in a crystal structure, thus providing unique insights into the reaction mechanism. The structural information should benefit the design of specific inhibitors for SIRT5 and help in exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting sirtuins for treating human diseases.

Vemurafenib, which targets the BRAFV600E mutation, is one of the drugs that improves patient outcome, but the patients next develop secondary resistance and a return to cancer. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed to treat melanomas and to increase the duration of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) inhibitor response. The ERK pathway controls cell proliferation, and Aurora B plays a pivotal role in cell division. Here, we confirm that Aurora B is highly expressed in metastatic melanoma cells and that Aurora B inhibition triggers both senescence-like phenotypes and cell death in melanoma cells. Furthermore, we show that the BRAF/ERK axis controls Aurora B expression at the transcriptional level, likely through the transcription factor FOXM1. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of Aurora B regulation and the first molecular basis of Aurora B regulation in melanoma cells. The inhibition of Aurora B expression that we observed in vemurafenib-sensitive melanoma cells was rescued in cells resistant to this drug. Consistently, these latter cells remain sensitive to the effect of the Aurora B inhibitor. Noteworthy, wild-type BRAF melanoma cells are also sensitive to Aurora B inhibition.

L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the primary enzyme responsible for histamine synthesis and produces histamine from histidine in a one-step reaction. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of human HDC (hHDC) complexed with the inhibitor histidine methyl ester. This structure shows the detailed features of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate inhibitor adduct (external aldimine) at the active site of HDC. Moreover, a comparison of the structures of hHDC and aromatic L-amino acid (L-DOPA) decarboxylase showed that Ser-354 was a key residue for substrate specificity. The S354G mutation at the active site enlarged the size of the hHDC substrate-binding pocket and resulted in a decreased affinity for histidine, but an acquired ability to bind and act on L-DOPA as a substrate. These data provide insight into the molecular basis of substrate recognition among the group II pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent decarboxylases."
https://openalex.org/W2042258372,"Elucidating molecular mechanisms by which lipids regulate protein function within biological membranes is critical for understanding the many cellular processes. Recently, we have found that dimeric αβ-tubulin, a subunit of microtubules, regulates mitochondrial respiration by blocking the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of mitochondrial outer membrane. Here, we show that the mechanism of VDAC blockage by tubulin involves tubulin interaction with the membrane as a critical step. The on-rate of the blockage varies up to 100-fold depending on the particular lipid composition used for bilayer formation in reconstitution experiments and increases with the increasing content of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. At physiologically low salt concentrations, the on-rate is decreased by the charged lipid. The off-rate of VDAC blockage by tubulin does not depend on the lipid composition. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we compared tubulin binding to the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) made from DOPC and DOPC/DOPE mixtures. We found that detectable binding of the fluorescently labeled dimeric tubulin to GUV membranes requires the presence of DOPE. We propose that prior to the characteristic blockage of VDAC, tubulin first binds to the membrane in a lipid-dependent manner. We thus reveal a new potent regulatory role of the mitochondrial lipids in control of the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and hence mitochondrial respiration through tuning VDAC sensitivity to blockage by tubulin. More generally, our findings give an example of the lipid-controlled protein-protein interaction where the choice of lipid species is able to change the equilibrium binding constant by orders of magnitude."

In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological implication of visfatin/PBEF in the molecular patterns of RA synovial tissue, focusing on RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), key players in RA synovium. Expression of visfatin/PBEF in synovial fluid and tissue of RA patients was detected by immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. RASFs were stimulated with different concentrations of visfatin/PBEF over varying time intervals, and changes in gene expression were evaluated at the RNA and protein levels using Affymetrix array, real-time PCR, and immunoassays. The signaling pathways involved were identified. The influence of visfatin/PBEF on fibroblast motility and migration was analyzed. In RA synovium, visfatin/PBEF was predominantly expressed in the lining layer, lymphoid aggregates, and interstitial vessels. In RASFs, visfatin/PBEF induced high amounts of chemokines such as IL-8 and MCP-1, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP-3. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed after visfatin/PBEF stimulation, and inhibition of p38 MAPK showed strong reduction of visfatin-induced effects. Directed as well as general fibroblast motility was increased by visfatin/PBEF-induced factors.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a major tumor-promoting factor in EOC ascites, is an enzymatic product of autotaxin (ATX) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)enzymes. The contribution of PLA2 activities to ovarian tumorigenesis was investigated. The quantitative measurement of PLA2 activities in ascites and tissues, as well as assay conditions selective for PLA2 subtypes, were optimized and validated. PLA2 activities correlated with tumor-promoting activates in cell-based and in vivo assays. High activities consistent with both cytosolic and calcium-independent PLA2 were found in human EOC ascites for the first time. Elevated PLA2 and ATX activities were also observed in EOC compared to benign tumors and normal tissues. Cell-free and vesicle-free (S4) human EOC ascites potently promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of human EOC cells in a PLA2-dependent manner. LPA mediated a significant part of the cell-stimulating effects of ascites. S4 ascites stimulated tumorigenesis/metastasis in vivo, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate was highly effective in inhibiting EOC metastasis in mouse xenograft models. PLA2 activity was found in conditioned media from both EOC cells and macrophages.

The physiological function of the individual genes, however, remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the role of the two Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of the cysteine protease Atg4 in the pathway responsible for degradation of protein aggregates. Loss of atg-4.1 activity causes defective degradation of a variety of protein aggregates, whereas atg-4.2 mutants remove these substrates normally. LGG-1 precursors accumulate in atg-4.1 mutants, but not atg-4.2 mutants. LGG-1 puncta, formation of which depends on lipidation of LGG-1, are present in atg-4.1 and atg-4.2 single mutants, but are completely absent in atg-4.1; atg-4.2 double mutants. In vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that ATG-4.1 processes LGG-1 precursors about 100-fold more efficiently than ATG-4.2. Expression of a mutant form LGG-1, which mimics the processed precursor, rescues the defective autophagic degradation of protein aggregates in atg-4.1 mutants and, to a lesser extent, in atg-4.1; atg-4.2 double mutants. Our study reveals that ATG-4.1 and ATG-4.2 are functionally redundant yet display differential LGG-1 processing and deconjugating activity in the aggrephagy pathway in C. elegans."

AMPK-sensitive functions further include activities of epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and voltage-gated K+ channel KCNE1/KCNQ1. AMPK is activated by an increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The present study explored whether AMPK regulates the Ca2+-sensitive large conductance and voltage-gated potassium (BK) channel. cRNA encoding BK channel was injected into Xenopus oocytes with and without additional injection of wild-type AMPK (AMPKα1+AMPKβ1+AMPKγ1), constitutively active AMPKγR70Q, or inactive AMPKαK45R. BK-channel activity was determined utilizing the 2-electrode voltage-clamp. Moreover, BK-channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined by confocal immunomicroscopy. As BK channels are expressed in outer hair cells (OHC) of the inner ear and lack of BK channels increases noise vulnerability, OHC BK-channel expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and hearing function analyzed by auditory brain stem response measurements in AMPKα1-deficient mice (ampk–/–) and in wild-type mice (ampk+/+). As a result, coexpression of AMPK or AMPKγR70Q but not of AMPKαK45R significantly enhanced BK-channel-mediated currents and BK-channel protein abundance in the oocyte cell membrane. BK-channel expression in the inner ear was lower in ampk–/– mice than in ampk+/+ mice. The hearing thresholds prior to and immediately after an acoustic overexposure were similar in ampk–/– and ampk+/+ mice. However, the recovery from the acoustic trauma was significantly impaired in ampk–/–mice compared to ampk+/+ mice. In summary, AMPK is a potent regulator of BK channels. It may thus participate in the signaling cascades that protect the inner ear from damage following acoustic overstimulation.—Föller, M., Jaumann, M., Dettling, J., Saxena, A., Pakladok, T., Munoz, C., Ruth, P., Sopjani, M., Seebohm, G., Rüttiger, L., Knipper, M., Lang, F.

Here, we demonstrated that expression of Tgfb1 was increased, followed by phosphorylation of Smad2, during BMP-2-induced hypertrophic maturation of ATDC5 chondrocytes. Application of a TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor compound, SB431542, increased the expression of Id1, without affecting the phosphorylation status of Smad1/5/8, indicating that the activated endogenous TGF-β pathway inhibited BMP signaling downstream of the Smad activation step. We searched for TGF-β-inducible effectors that are able to inhibit BMP signaling in ATDC5 cells and identified SnoN. Overexpression of SnoN suppressed the activity of a BMP-responsive luciferase reporter in COS-7 cells as well as expression of Id1 in ATDC5 cells and, subsequently, the expression of Col10a1, a hallmark of hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation. siRNA-mediated loss of SnoN showed opposite effects in BMP-treated ATDC5 cells.

The decrease in neprilysin leads to a metabolic Aβ imbalance, which can induce the amyloidosis underlying Alzheimer disease. Pharmacological activation of neprilysin during aging therefore represents a potential strategy to prevent the development of Alzheimer disease. However, the regulatory mechanisms mediating neprilysin activity in the brain remain unclear. To address this issue, we screened for pharmacological regulators of neprilysin activity and found that the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophins 3 and 4 reduce cell surface neprilysin activity. This decrease was mediated by MEK/ERK signaling, which enhanced phosphorylation at serine 6 in the neprilysin intracellular domain (S6-NEP-ICD). Increased phosphorylation of S6-NEP-ICD in primary neurons reduced the levels of cell surface neprilysin and led to a subsequent increase in extracellular Aβ levels. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1a, tautomycetin, induced extensive phosphorylation of the S6-NEP-ICD, resulting in reduced cell surface neprilysin activity. In contrast, activation of protein phosphatase-1a increased cell surface neprilysin activity and lowered Aβ levels. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation status of S6-NEP-ICD influences the localization of neprilysin and affects extracellular Aβ levels. Therefore, maintaining S6-NEP-ICD in a dephosphorylated state, either by inhibition of protein kinases involved in its phosphorylation or by activation of phosphatases catalyzing its dephosphorylation, may represent a new approach to prevent reduction of cell surface neprilysin activity during aging and to maintain physiological levels of Aβ in the brain.

We found that application of the selective adenosine A2AR antagonist ZM241385 decreased scar size and enhanced the tensile strength of the scar. Within the scar itself, collagen alignment and composition (marked reduction in collagen 3), but not periostin, biglycan, or fibronectin accumulation, was improved by application of ZM241385. Moreover, A2AR blockade reduced the number of myofibroblasts and angiogenesis but not macrophage infiltration in the scar.

Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63%. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (<65 nmol/L) was 5% and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (<300 nmol/L) was 4%. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R(2) = 0.36 and 0.10, p<0.001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine ≥63% was associated with a 7.5 and 4-fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively. Routine provision of daily 100 mg of thiamine mononitrate post-partum compared to the previous weekly 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in significantly higher total thiamine in breast-milk.Thiamine supplementation for lactating women in Maela refugee camp is effective and should be continued.

https://openalex.org/W2093572951,"Technology for comprehensive identification of biothreats in environmental and clinical specimens is needed to protect citizens in the case of a biological attack. This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the near-neighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2109032360,"α-Actinin2 (Actn2) is a predominant protein in the sarcomere Z disc whose mutation can lead to cardiomyopathy. However, the function of Actn2 in Z-disc assembly and cardiomyopathy in vertebrates remains elusive. We leveraged genetic tools in zebrafish embryos to elucidate the function of Actn2. We identified a single Actn2 homologue expressed in the zebrafish heart and conducted loss-of-function studies by antisense morpholino technology. Although zebrafish Actn2 assembles early into the Z disc, depletion of actn2 did not affect the early steps of sarcomere assembly. Instead, Actn2 is required for Z bodies to register laterally, forming well-aligned Z discs. Presumably as a consequence to this structural defect in the sarcomere, the depletion of Actn2 resulted in reduced cardiac function, primarily characterized as a reduced end-diastolic diameter. The depletion of actn2 also significantly reduced the ventricle chamber size, due to both reduced cardiomyocyte (CM) size and CM number. Interestingly, reduced CM size can be rescued by the cessation of heart contractions. The genetic studies of zebrafish uncovered a function for actn2 in lateral registration of Z body. In actn2 morphant fish, the Z-disc defect sequentially affects cardiac function, which leads to morphological changes in the ventricle through a mechanical force-dependent mechanism.—Yang, J., Xu, X. α-Actinin2 is required for the lateral alignment of Z discs and ventricular chamber enlargement during zebrafish cardiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2102200930,"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often associated with fitness loss, which is compensated by secondary mutations. Fusidic acid (FA), an antibiotic used against pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, locks elongation factor-G (EF-G) to the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. To clarify the mechanism of fitness loss and compensation in relation to FA resistance, we have characterized three S. aureus EF-G mutants with fast kinetics and crystal structures. Our results show that a significantly slower tRNA translocation and ribosome recycling, plus increased peptidyl-tRNA drop-off, are the causes for fitness defects of the primary FA-resistant mutant F88L. The double mutant F88L/M16I is three to four times faster than F88L in both reactions and showed no tRNA drop-off, explaining its fitness compensatory phenotype. The M16I mutation alone showed hypersensitivity to FA, higher activity, and somewhat increased affinity to GTP. The crystal structures demonstrate that Phe-88 in switch II is a key residue for FA locking and also for triggering interdomain movements in EF-G essential for its function, explaining functional deficiencies in F88L. The mutation M16I loosens the hydrophobic core in the G domain and affects domain I to domain II contact, resulting in improved activity both in the wild-type and F88L background. Thus, FA-resistant EF-G mutations causing fitness loss and compensation operate by affecting the conformational dynamics of EF-G on the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1995222763,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is dedicated to the transport of fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membranes of many bacteria and the chloroplast thylakoidal membrane. Accordingly, Tat-dependently translocated proteins are known to be delivered to the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, the growth medium of Gram-positive bacteria, and the thylakoid lumen. Here, we present the first example of a protein, YkuE of Bacillus subtilis, that is specifically targeted by the Tat pathway to the cell wall of a Gram-positive bacterium. The cell wall binding of YkuE is facilitated by electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, under particular conditions, YkuE can also be targeted to the cell wall in a Tat-independent manner. The biological function of YkuE was so far unknown. Our present studies show that YkuE is a metal-dependent phosphoesterase that preferentially binds manganese and zinc.

If the substrate protein does not fold efficiently or correctly, it is potentially exported in an unfolded state by another transport pathway, such as the general secretion pathway (Sec) (3Robinson C Bolhuis A.

A second important feature of substrates that are accepted by the Tat translocase is the presence of a specific twin-arginine (RR) signal peptide at the N terminus of the protein. The RR signal peptides are composed of three parts, namely an N-terminal region rich in positively charged residues, a central hydrophobic H-region, and a C-terminal region containing the cleavage site recognized by signal peptidases (11Cristóbal S. de Gier J.W.

Importantly, these signal peptides possess a twin-arginine (RR) or a lysine-arginine (KR) recognition motif in the N-region with the consensus sequence (K/R)RX##, where # marks hydrophobic residues and X can be any residue (11Cristóbal S. de Gier J.W.

RR signal peptides are generally less effective in protein targeting to the Sec machinery due to the low hydrophobicity of their H-region and the presence of a positively charged residue in the C-region that facilitates “Sec avoidance” (16Chaddock A.M.

Several studies conducted with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have shown that RR signal peptides are often interchangeable among different proteins and that in some instances proteins can be redirected from the Sec pathway into the Tat pathway by replacing the original Sec-type signal peptide with an RR signal peptide (10Kolkman M.A. van der Ploeg R.

In particular, the limited use of Tat in B. subtilis is remarkable in view of this organism's very high capacity for protein export (12Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

Bifunctional TatA subunits in minimal Tat protein translocases.Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that some Tat substrates of B. subtilis may have been overlooked in studies aimed at their identification. Several bioinformatic approaches have been designed with the aim to identify new Tat substrates (20Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. Widdick D. Palmer T. Brunak S. Prediction of twin-arginine signal peptides.BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 30Dilks K. Rose R.W. Hartmann E. Pohlschröder M.

Attwood T.K. Flower D.R. TATPred. A Bayesian method for the identification of twin arginine translocation pathway signal sequences.Bioinformation. 2006; 1: 184-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed such bioinformatics tools predict additional Tat substrates for B. subtilis, the numbers depending on the stringency of the algorithms. To demonstrate the Tat specificity of predicted RR signal peptides, a reporter system was developed based on the agarase of Streptomyces coelicolor, which is secreted via the Tat pathway of this organism (22Widdick D.A. Dilks K. Chandra G. Bottrill A. Naldrett M. Pohlschröder M. Palmer T. The twin-arginine translocation pathway is a major route of protein export in Streptomyces coelicolor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17927-17932Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the agarase is secreted into the growth medium of Streptomyces, its activity can be tested in a simple semi-quantitative way with a colorimetric assay. Using this assay, several potential RR signal peptides have been tested, including the B. subtilis protein YkuE (19Widdick D.A. Eijlander R.T. van Dijl J.M. Kuipers O.P. Palmer T. A facile reporter system for the experimental identification of twin-arginine translocation (Tat) signal peptides from all kingdoms of life.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies confirmed that the YkuE signal peptide was capable of directing Tat-dependent protein transport, but the actual Tat-dependent secretion of YkuE and other predicted Tat substrates of B. subtilis remained enigmatic. This study aimed to assess the expression, export, and function of YkuE in B. subtilis. Our results show that YkuE is a Tat-dependently exported metallophosphoesterase. Most noticeably, YkuE is specifically targeted to the cell wall of B. subtilis, making it the first known protein that is targeted via Tat to this particular subcellular compartment. We show that cell wall binding of YkuE is facilitated by electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, we have identified different modes of YkuE export to the cell wall that are specific for particular conditions, such as phosphate starvation or YkuE overexpression. The plasmids and bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown with agitation at 37 °C in either Luria Bertani-Miller (LB) medium or Paris minimal (PM) medium. LB medium consisted of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl, pH 7.4. PM consisted of 10.7 mg ml−1 K2HPO4, 6 mg ml−1 KHPO, 1 mg ml−1 trisodium citrate, 0.02 mg ml−1 MgSO4, 1% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids (Difco), 20 mg ml−1 l-tryptophan, 2.2 mg ml−1 ferric ammonium citrate, and 20 mm potassium glutamate. To trigger a phosphate starvation response, the strains were grown overnight in high phosphate depletion medium, which is rich in phosphate. The next morning, cells were transferred to low phosphate depletion media. Both media were prepared according to Müller et al. (32Müller J.P. An Z. Merad T. Hancock I.C. Harwood C.R.

Lactococcus lactis was grown at 30 °C in M17 broth supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 2 μg ml−1 erythromycin. When required, media for Escherichia coli were supplemented with erythromycin (100 μg ml−1), kanamycin (20 μg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 μg ml−1), or spectinomycin (100 μg ml−1); media for B. subtilis were supplemented with erythromycin (2 μg ml−1), kanamycin (20 μg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 μg ml−1), or spectinomycin (100 μg ml−1).TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyRelevant propertiesRef.PlasmidspHB201B. subtilis-E.coli expression vector; ori-pBR322; ori-pTA1060; cat86::lacZa; CmR; EmR43Bron S.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). B. subtilis was transformed as described by Kunst and Rapoport (34Kunst F. Rapoport G. Salt stress is an environmental signal affecting degradative enzyme synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with the Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). Primers are listed in the supplemental Table 1. PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit from Roche Applied Science. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Plasmid DNA from E. coli was isolated using the alkaline lysis method or by using the Invisorb® plasmid isolation kit (Invitek). All constructs were checked by sequencing. The plasmids pHB-ykuE-myc and pHB-ykuE were constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified ykuE gene into the pHB201 plasmid. The forward primer used to construct pHB-ykuE-myc contained a SalI restriction site and the reverse primer an EcoRI restriction site and a Myc tag. The PCR product was digested with SalI-EcoRI and cloned in the digested SalI-EcoRI pHB201 vector. The forward primer used to construct pHB-ykuE contained an SpeI restriction site, and the reverse primer contained a BamHI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with SpeI-BamHI and cloned into the digested SpeI-BamHI pHB201 vector. To construct pNZ8910-ykuE-StrepII, a synonymous point mutation was introduced into the ykuE gene to delete an internal BspHI restriction site. The mutagenesis was carried out using the F_Mut_ykuE and R_Mut_ykuE primers and the pHB-ykuE plasmid as a template. The resulting plasmid pHB-ykuEmut was verified by sequencing and used as a template for a further PCR with a forward primer containing a BspHI restriction site and a reverse primer with an SpeI restriction site. The fragment was digested with BspHI-SpeI and cloned into NcoI-HindIII digested pNZ8910 plasmid. The ligation mixture was introduced into L. lactis by transformation, resulting in the plasmid pNZ8910-YkuE-StrepII. This plasmid was then introduced into B. subtilis 168 or the tatAyCy, tatAdCd, or total tat3 mutant strains by transformation. Cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation. Next, the cells were fractionated as described by Zweers et al. (35Zweers J.C. Wiegert T. van Dijl J.M. Stress-responsive systems set specific limits to the overproduction of membrane proteins in Bacillus subtilis.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with lysozyme in protoplast buffer to liberate cell wall-associated proteins. The resulting protoplasts were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by bead beating. Debris of the disrupted protoplasts was removed through centrifugation. Membranes were then separated from the cytoplasm through ultracentrifugation. Finally, the collected membranes were resuspended in solubilization buffer with 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. To extract cell wall-bound proteins, cells were incubated for 10 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with 1.5 m LiCl, or a solution containing 2 m KSCN as described previously (36Antelmann H.

IGF-I activates IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) tyrosine kinase, followed by phosphorylation of substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) leading to binding of signaling molecules containing SH2 domains, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to IRS and activation of the downstream signaling pathways. In this study, we found prolonged (>9 h) association of PI3K with IGF-IR induced by IGF-I stimulation. PI3K activity was present in this complex in thyrocytes and fibroblasts, although tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS was not yet evident after 9 h of IGF-I stimulation. IGF-I withdrawal in mid-G1 phase impaired the association of PI3K with IGF-IR and suppressed DNA synthesis the same as when PI3K inhibitor was added. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Tyr1316-X-X-Met of IGF-IR functioned as a PI3K binding sequence when this tyrosine is phosphorylated. We then analyzed IGF signaling and proliferation of IGF-IR−/− fibroblasts expressing exogenous mutant IGF-IR in which Tyr1316 was substituted with Phe (Y1316F). In these cells, IGF-I stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR and IRS-1/2, but mutated IGF-IR failed to bind PI3K and to induce maximal phosphorylation of GSK3β and cell proliferation in response to IGF-I. Based on these results, we concluded that PI3K activity bound to IGF-IR, which is continuously sustained by IGF-I stimulation, is required for IGF-I-induced cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2152100864,"Phagocytic melanosome uptake by epidermal keratinocytes is a central protective mechanism against damage induced by ultraviolet radiation. Phagocytosis requires formation of pseudopodia via actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an important modulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. We have examined the role of ILK in regulation of phagocytosis, using epidermal keratinocytes isolated from mice with epidermis-restricted Ilk gene inactivation. ILK-deficient cells exhibited severely impaired capacity to engulf fluorescent microspheres in response to stimulation of the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) receptor or the protease-activated receptor-2. KGF induced ERK phosphorylation in ILK-expressing and ILK-deficient cells, suggesting that ILK is not essential for KGF receptor signaling. In contrast, KGF promoted activation of Rac1 and formation of pseudopodia in ILK-expressing, but not in ILK-deficient cells. Rac1-deficient keratinocytes also showed substantially impaired phagocytic ability, underlining the importance of ILK-dependent Rac1 function for particle engulfment. Finally, cross-modulation of KGF receptors by integrins may be another important element, as integrin β1-deficient keratinocytes also fail to show significant phagocytosis in response to KGF. Thus, we have identified a novel signaling pathway essential for phagocytosis in keratinocytes, which involves ILK-dependent activation of Rac1 in response to KGF, resulting in the formation of pseudopodia and particle uptake.—Sayedyahossein, S., Nini, L., Irvine, T.

In vitro, Cmc1 can be oxidized by the import receptor Mia40 alone when in excess or at a lower rate by only the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1. However, physiological and efficient Cmc1 oxidation requires Erv1 and Mia40. Cmc1 forms a stable intermediate with Mia40 and is released from this interaction in the presence of Erv1. The three proteins are shown to form a ternary complex in mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2077953064,"Background Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been associated with the development of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. However, the prospective associations between functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL1B and incident acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have not been thoroughly investigated. The aims of this study were to examine the associations between individual SNPs in and SNP haplotypes of the promoter region of IL1B and incident ACS in a prospective study. Furthermore, we wanted to explore potential interactions with other risk factors for ACS on an additive scale. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study was based on the Danish prospective study Diet, Cancer and Health comprising more than 57 000 participants aged 50–64 at baseline. During a median follow-up of 7.2 years we identified 989 cases of incident ACS (755 men and 234 women). All cases were validated by review of medical records, and information on covariates was collected by study technicians. The study was conducted according to a case-cohort study design including ACS cases and a sex-stratified sub cohort of 1663 participants drawn randomly from the entire cohort. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models with age as time axis were used in the statistical analyses. Individual IL1B SNPs, SNP haplotypes, or haplotype combinations were not significantly associated with incident ACS, and, likewise, we found no evidence of interaction on an additive scale between IL1B haplotypes and risk factors, respectively. Conclusions/Significance Genetic variation in the promoter region of IL1B may not be associated with incident ACS in men or women above the age of 50 years."

https://openalex.org/W1998580495,"Surveys of wildlife host-pathogen systems often document clear seasonal variation in transmission; conclusions concerning the relationship between host population density and transmission vary. In the field, effects of seasonality and population density on natural disease cycles are challenging to measure independently, but laboratory experiments may poorly reflect what happens in nature. Outdoor manipulative experiments are an alternative that controls for some variables in a relatively natural environment. Using outdoor enclosures, we tested effects of North American deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) population density and season on transmission dynamics of Sin Nombre hantavirus. In early summer, mid-summer, late summer, and fall 2007–2008, predetermined numbers of infected and uninfected adult wild deermice were released into enclosures and trapped weekly or bi-weekly. We documented 18 transmission events and observed significant seasonal effects on transmission, wounding frequency, and host breeding condition. Apparent differences in transmission incidence or wounding frequency between high- and low-density treatments were not statistically significant. However, high host density was associated with a lower proportion of males with scrotal testes. Seasonality may have a stronger influence on disease transmission dynamics than host population density, and density effects cannot be considered independent of seasonality."

In the present study, we performed a large replication analysis of rs2180341 using data from 31,428 invasive breast cancer cases and 34,700 controls collected from 25 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). In addition, we evaluated whether rs2180341 modifies breast cancer risk in 3,361 BRCA1 and 2,020 BRCA2 carriers from 11 centers in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). Based on the BCAC data from women of European ancestry, we found evidence for a weak association with breast cancer risk for rs2180341 (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.06, p = 0.023). There was evidence for heterogeneity in the ORs among studies (I2 = 49.3%; p = <0.004). In CIMBA, we observed an inverse association with the minor allele of rs2180341 and breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (per-allele OR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.80–1.00, p = 0.048), indicating a potential protective effect of this allele. These data suggest that that 6q22.33 confers a weak effect on breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2053439045,"F-spondin, an extracellular matrix protein, is an important player in embryonic morphogenesis and CNS development, but its presence and role later in life remains largely unknown. We generated a transgenic zebrafish in which GFP is expressed under the control of the F-spondin (spon1b) promoter, and used it in combination with complementary techniques to undertake a detailed characterization of the expression patterns of F-spondin in developing and adult brain and periphery. We found that F-spondin is often associated with structures forming long neuronal tracts, including retinal ganglion cells, the olfactory bulb, the habenula, and the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF). F-spondin expression coincides with zones of adult neurogenesis and is abundant in CSF-contacting secretory neurons, especially those in the hypothalamus. Use of this new transgenic model also revealed F-spondin expression patterns in the peripheral CNS, notably in enteric neurons, and in peripheral tissues involved in active patterning or proliferation in adults, including the endoskeleton of zebrafish fins and the continuously regenerating pharyngeal teeth. Moreover, patterning of the regenerating caudal fin following fin amputation in adult zebrafish was associated with F-spondin expression in the blastema, a proliferative region critical for tissue reconstitution. Together, these findings suggest major roles for F-spondin in the CNS and periphery of the developing and adult vertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W2033534026,"The calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of isoform 4b of the plasma membrane Ca2+ -ATPase (PMCA) pump is represented by peptide C28. CaM binds to either PMCA or C28 by a mechanism in which the primary anchor residue Trp-1093 binds to the C-terminal lobe of the extended CaM molecule, followed by collapse of CaM with the N-terminal lobe binding to the secondary anchor Phe-1110 (Juranic, N., Atanasova, E., Filoteo, A. G., Macura, S., Prendergast, F. G., Penniston, J. T., and Strehler, E. E. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 4015–4024). This is a relatively rapid reaction, with an apparent half-time of ∼1 s. The dissociation of CaM from PMCA4b or C28 is much slower, with an overall half-time of ∼10 min. Using targeted molecular dynamics, we now show that dissociation of Ca2+-CaM from C28 may occur by a pathway in which Trp-1093, although deeply embedded in a pocket in the C-terminal lobe of CaM, leaves first. The dissociation begins by relatively rapid release of Trp-1093, followed by very slow release of Phe-1110, removal of C28, and return of CaM to its conformation in the free state. Fluorescence measurements and molecular dynamics calculations concur in showing that this alternative path of release of the PMCA4b CaM-binding domain is quite different from that of binding.

Mammalian cells express four different isoforms (PMCA1–4), each with multiple splice variants. Emerging evidence suggests that the PMCAs are responsible for setting the basal level of intracellular [Ca2+] and for the spatiotemporal control of local Ca2+ signals (2Strehler E.E. Filoteo A.G.

To fulfill their various roles in cellular Ca2+ handling, different PMCAs are tightly regulated. Arguably the most important regulator of PMCA activity is calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+ sensor protein involved in many Ca2+-dependent processes in the cell (3Carafoli E.

The mechanism of CaM regulation of the PMCA involves the release of an autoinhibitory domain upon binding of CaM to the C-terminal tail of the pump. The CaM-binding region in the C-terminal tail of PMCA4b is contained within a 28-residue peptide named C28 (5Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T.

The binding of C28 to CaM is very tight, so we would expect a rapid association and a slow dissociation. Kinetic measurements have confirmed that this is the case, but the mechanism by which this is accomplished is unclear. Using a combination of fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic measurements and molecular dynamics calculations based on the recently solved structure of the CaM-C28 complex (12Juranic N. Atanasova E. Filoteo A.G. Macura S. Prendergast F.G. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. Calmodulin wraps around its binding domain in the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump anchored by a novel 18-1 motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4015-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we now show that the preferred pathway of dissociation may not be a simple reversal of association but instead involves rapid release of the N-terminal anchor Trp-1093 from the C-terminal lobe of CaM, followed by the much slower dissociation of the C-terminal anchor Phe-1110. This biphasic dissociation mechanism allows for the existence of a stable intermediate complex in which CaM is bound only via its N-terminal lobe to the PMCA. The long half-life of this complex may keep PMCA4b “primed” for activation under conditions in which the free Ca2+-CaM concentration is low. CaM was from Calbiochem. TA-CaM was prepared as described (10Penheiter A.R. Bajzer Z. Filoteo A.G. Thorogate R. Török K. Caride A.J.

Peptides C28 and C28W/F were synthesized in the Mayo Clinic Peptide Core Facility and purified by HPLC to at least 95% purity. All chemicals were of the highest purity available. Stopped-flow measurements of changes in the fluorescence of TA-CaM were performed in an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV reaction analyzer. When measuring changes in the fluorescence of TA-CaM, the excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and the emitted light was detected using a 390-nm cutoff filter. In all cases, the syringes contained 30 mm TES/triethanolamine (pH 7.2), 120 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and enough CaCl2 to obtain 100 μm free Ca2+. To measure association following changes in Trp fluorescence, final concentrations were 2 μm C28 and either 2 or 4 μm CaM. In this case, excitation was set at 290 nm, and the emitted light was detected using a 345-nm cutoff long-pass filter. Because binding of C28 to CaM results in a shift in the Trp fluorescence to lower wavelength (blue shift), binding resulted in decreased light detected under these conditions (see Fig. 1). To assess the binding of C28 to TA-CaM, fluorescence changes were followed upon addition of C28 (at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 7) to TA-CaM (final concentration of 17 nm).FIGURE 7Time course of the association of CaM and C28 as measured by TA-CaM fluorescence and fitting to the branched model.

Final concentrations were 17 nm TA-CaM, 100 nm C28, and 2000 nm CaM. Because of the slow rate of this reaction, the best results were obtained when the change in fluorescence was followed in a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer in kinetics mode rather than by stopped flow. Excitation was set at 365 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 420 nm, with a 10-nm bandwidth. To measure the dissociation of C28 from CaM by Trp fluorescence, preincubated C28 and CaM were mixed with C28W/F, a peptide with the same sequence as C28 except for the replacement of the Trp residue at position 8 with Phe. Final concentrations were 2 μm C28, 4 μm CaM, and 40 μm C28W/F. Because of the fast nature of this reaction, it was followed by stopped flow using the conditions described above for measuring Trp fluorescence during association. Individual progress curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 4 software. When global nonlinear regression was applied to fit a proposed model to progress curves obtained at different concentrations, DynaFit software (BioKin, Inc.) (15Kuzmic P.

MD calculations were performed using CHARMM c35b1 (16Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L. Petrella R.J. Roux B. Won Y. Archontis G. Bartels C. Boresch S. Caflisch A. Caves L.

The coordinates for the CaM-C28 complex were those of the first structure from the set deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2KNE). CHARMM was run using the CHARMM22 all-hydrogen parameter and topology files for proteins, including φ and ψ cross-term map corrections. All minimization and dynamics were performed using the “generalized Born using molecular volume” method (17Chocholousová J. Feig M.

This method replaces water molecules with correction parameters that simulate the presence of water molecules. The parameters used were as follows: Beta −20, Epsilon 80, Dn 1.0, Watr 1.4, Geom Tol 1e−8, Bufr 0.5, Mem 10, Cuta 20, Hsx1 −0.125, Hsx2 0.25, Alfrq 1, Emp 1.5, P4 0.0, P6 8.0, P3 0.70, Onx 1.9, Offx 2.1, Wtyp 2, Nphi 38, shift −0.102, slope 0.9085, Corr 1, Ctonnb 12, Ctofnb 14, Cutnb 16, Vswitch, Switch. Minimization was done with constraints gradually removed; for Protein Data Bank structure 2KNE, the final stage was 3000 steps of the adopted basis Newton-Raphson method with no constraints. Dynamics for structure 2KNE alone were begun by heating for 6 ps using a step size of 1 fs, the leapfrog integrator, a starting temperature of 200 K, and a final temperature of 310 K. Heating was done every 100 steps, with velocities scaled using a Gaussian distribution. Equilibration was done twice, first with Langevin dynamics for 20 ps, with the temperature bath at 310 K. Then the system was equilibrated for another 20 ps with constant pressure/temperature dynamics, with a reference temperature of 310 K. This double equilibration was found to produce a stable TMD run. The same 2KNE restart file was used for all of the TMD runs. Because a number of different target conformations were tested, it was necessary to prepare a minimized set of coordinates for each. The first structure determined by NMR for free Ca2+-CaM (code 1X02) was visualized in Swiss-PdbViewer (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-Pdb Viewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1714-1723Crossref Scopus (9560) Google Scholar), and C28 in the appropriate conformation was manually added at a distance of ∼200 Å from the CaM. This target structure was minimized with a final stage of 100 steps of the adopted basis Newton-Raphson method. It was not necessary to do any dynamics on these minimized structures because they were just used as targets. Production runs of TMD were performed for 30,000 steps using the same settings with constant pressure/temperature dynamics, with a reference temperature of 310 K and coordinates written every 1000 steps. For this method, the 2KNE structure was heated and equilibrated as described for the first equilibration of the TMD method, but it was not necessary to switch to constant pressure/temperature dynamics and the production runs were done using Langevin dynamics. Once the system was equilibrated, random number generators were used to select 1) a direction for pushing the C28 molecule and 2) three Cα atoms from adjoining residues to push upon. The Cα atoms for pushing were chosen to be between Ile-1091 and Phe-1110. The force of pushing was set at 2 nanonewtons. After 20 steps of dynamics, the change in the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the three Cα atoms from their neighbors in CaM was estimated. If this was <0.03 Å, a new set of Cα atoms and a new direction were chosen for the next round; otherwise, the next round of dynamics was on the same atoms and in the same direction as before. The run was continued until 2000 groups of 20 steps each had been run (total number of 40,000). Although the steps correspond to 2 fs, the presence of the pushing force in both TMD and REMD means that the system moves much faster than an actual system would, i.e. the progress time of these MD simulations cannot be directly compared with the time frame of the measured fluorescence changes in kinetic experiments. The governing factor in this procedure is the magnitude of the pushing force. If a smaller pushing force was used, more steps were required, but the results were essentially the same. The fluorescence changes in TA-CaM during binding of C28 to CaM were reported previously and showed that the binding is moderately rapid and characterized by an initial fast fluorescence increase, followed by a slower two-phase decrease (13Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Caride A.J. Kinetic analysis of the calmodulin-binding region of the plasma membrane calcium pump isoform 4b.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2009-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that this could be explained by a three-step mechanism corresponding to a rapid initial association, followed by two steps stabilizing the complex (10Penheiter A.R. Bajzer Z. Filoteo A.G. Thorogate R. Török K. Caride A.J.

Fig. 1 shows the Trp fluorescence changes during binding of C28 to CaM at two different CaM concentrations (2 and 4 μm). The Trp fluorescence reflects a different aspect of the reaction from that revealed by the TA-CaM fluorescence because it reports the change in the environment of the Trp residue on C28 (corresponding to Trp-1093) rather than of the fluorescence label on CaM. The observed decrease in fluorescence intensity showed two components, a fast one and a slower one. The rapid first step may represent the initial contact of Trp-1093 with the hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal lobe of CaM, followed by a slightly slower stabilization in the pocket. Such a multistep interaction of CaM with its target peptide upon binding has previously been rationalized by Wand and co-workers (19Kranz J.K. Flynn P.F. Fuentes E.J. Wand A.J. Dissection of the pathway of molecular recognition by calmodulin.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2599-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to reflect the initial formation of a low affinity complex, followed by conformational rearrangements resulting in the final high affinity complex. This result also fits well with the mechanism proposed earlier for the binding of C28 to CaM, in which Trp-1093 binds to the C-terminal lobe of CaM, followed by the wrapping of CaM around C28, with the N-terminal lobe of CaM binding to Phe-1110 (12Juranic N. Atanasova E. Filoteo A.G. Macura S. Prendergast F.G. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. Calmodulin wraps around its binding domain in the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump anchored by a novel 18-1 motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4015-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The rapid change in the Trp fluorescence reflects the initial binding of C28 to CaM, whereas the more complex change in TA-CaM fluorescence reflects all steps of the reaction. The TA-CaM fluorescence during the dissociation of C28 is shown in Fig. 2A. As expected, the dissociation was very slow (20Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. Tryptophan 1093 is largely responsible for the slow off rate of calmodulin from plasma membrane Ca2+ pump 4b.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17728-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, the fluorescence of Trp during dissociation changed much more quickly than that of TA-CaM (Fig. 2B). The speed with which the fluorescence of Trp-1093 changed during the dissociation was unexpected because it indicated that the preferred dissociation process proceeds by a quite different pathway than association, resulting in a branched model (Fig. 2C) for the association/dissociation of CaM and C28. In particular, this result indicates that the extended intermediate with Trp-1093 embedded in a pocket in the C-terminal lobe of CaM (represented by Protein Data Bank NMR structure 1CFF) occurs preferentially during the initial binding of CaM to its target on PMCA, but may not be the major conformer during dissociation. We next turned to MD to simulate the dissociation process to better understand the possible mechanism underlying these findings. Analysis of the structure of the complex of CaM-C28 (Protein Data Bank code 2KNE) showed that C28 is much more accessible to solvent on one of its sides. Fig. 3 shows the complex oriented so that its top or open face is upward, facing the +z direction, and the bottom or closed face is down. In the complex, Trp-1093, with its large side chain, has more close interactions with CaM residues than does Phe-1110. The binding pockets of these two anchor residues were defined as the atoms within 6.0 Å of the side chain. Table 1 lists these atoms.TABLE 1Sequences of CaM and C28 (upper) and residues (and atoms) defining the binding pockets for Trp-1093 and Phe-1110 (lower)Calmodulin sequence110203040ADQLTEEQIAEFKEAFSLFDKDGDGTITTKELGTVMRSLGQNPTEAELQ5060708090DMINEVDADGNGTIDFPEFLTMMARKMKDTDSEEEIREAFRVFDKDGNGY100110120130140ISAAELRHVMTNLGEKLTDEEVDEMIREADIDGDGQVNYEEFVQMMTAKC28 sequence|1090|1100|1110LRRGQILWFRGLNRIQTQIKVVKAFHSSBinding pocket for Trp-1093 (total of 12 residues and 52 atoms)Phe-92Cγ-Cδ1-Cϵ1-Cζ-Cδ2-Cϵ2Ile-100Cγ2-CδLeu-105Cβ-Cγ-Cδ1-Cδ2Glu-123C-OMet-124N-Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Sδ-Cϵ-C-OIle-125N-Cα-C-OGlu-127CAla-128N-Cα-Cβ-CVal-136Cβ-Cγ1-Cγ2Phe-141Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ1-Cϵ1-Cζ-Cδ2-Cϵ2-C-OMet-144Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Sδ-Cϵ-C-OMet-145NBinding pocket for Phe-1110 (total of 9 residues and 35 atoms)Phe-19Cγ-Cϵ1-Cζ-Cδ2-Cϵ2Ile-27Cβ-Cγ2-Cγ1-CδLeu-32Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ1-Cδ2-C-OVal-35Cβ-Cγ1-Cγ2Met-36Cγ-SδMet-51Cγ-Sδ-CϵIle-63Cβ-Cγ2-Cγ1-CδPhe-68Cγ-Cζ-Cδ2-Cϵ2Met-71Cγ-Sδ-Cϵ Open table in a new tab Because MD calculations are too slow to simulate the dissociation of C28, we first used TMD to simulate the process. Normally, this method is used when both the initial and final (target) conformations of the molecules are known. Starting from the initial conformation, a small force is applied in the direction of the target. This force is added to the normal force fields employed in MD calculations, allowing the molecule to reach its target conformation in a usable amount of calculation time. The presence of this force means that each MD step, which would normally correspond to 2 fs, now would correspond to a longer time. Good results have been obtained by this method in a number of cases (21Swift R.V. McCammon J.A. Catalytically requisite conformational dynamics in the mRNA-capping enzyme probed by targeted molecular dynamics.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4102-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Provasi D. Murcia M. Coller B.S. Filizola M. Targeted molecular dynamics reveals overall common conformational changes upon hybrid domain swing-out in β3 integrins.Proteins. 2009; 77: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our case, we know the initial conformations of the CaM-C28 complex and the final free Ca2+-CaM, but the final conformation of C28 is not known. This is of little consequence, however, because we were primarily interested in whether the environment of Trp-1093 changed rapidly in the initial steps of the dissociation. Our results bore out this assumption about the conformation of C28, but we found that the placement of C28 in space influenced the results. When the target C28 was placed in the +z direction, opposite the open face of CaM-C28, Trp-1093 came out of its pocket long before Phe-1110, as shown in Fig. 4 (left panel). In this panel, the increase in the average distance of Trp-1093 from the atoms making up its initial pocket is plotted as a function of the number of steps of MD. The conformation of C28 and its orientation were not important factors in these results. Helical and extended target C28 molecules were oriented parallel, antiparallel, and perpendicular to the starting C28 helix. In Fig. 4, all of these conformations and orientations are averaged together, with the small error bars reflecting the variations caused by the different runs. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the r.m.s.d. for CaM as the system moves from its starting point toward the target. The targets were all set with the target CaM (Protein Data Bank code 1X02) oriented so that it had the minimum r.m.s.d. from the initial CaM structure in the C28 complex. This r.m.s.d. was 11.44 Å for all of the backbone atoms. As the targeted MD run proceeded, the r.m.s.d. of the CaM at any given time gradually increased; if it reached the target conformation, it would have a value of 11.44 Å. Thus, the r.m.s.d. shown in Fig. 4 is a measure of how closely CaM (not including C28) approached its target conformation during the run. In Fig. 4 (left panel), the changes in the CaM conformation shown by the r.m.s.d. are quite modest as Trp-1093 comes out of its pocket. When the target C28 was placed below the starting CaM-C28 complex (in the −z direction), Phe-1110 came out of its pocket before Trp-1093 (Fig. 4, right panel). However, in order for this to happen, CaM had to move about half-way toward its target conformation, as shown by its r.m.s.d. changes. Only after that had happened did Phe-1110 begin to leave its pocket, whereas Trp-1093 stayed near its original pocket atoms. The experimental data show that Trp fluorescence changed much more rapidly than CaM conformation (as represented by TA-CaM fluorescence) during the dissociation of the complex. The results of TMD agree with this when the target C28 was placed in the +z direction, but not when it was placed in the −z direction. Thus, taken together, the results can only be explained if C28 actually leaves the CaM-C28 complex in the +z direction. Current TMD simulations are known to have a bias in that the larger movements in a transition path tend to happen early in the run and the smaller movements late (23Ovchinnikov V. Karplus M.

B. 2012; dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp212634zCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because of this and to obtain a more consistent picture of how C28 dissociates, we turned to another variant of MD, REMD (24Carlsson P. Burendahl S. Nilsson L.

Instead of adding a force directed toward a target, our method added a randomly oriented force, which pushed on three adjacent Cα atoms of C28 for a score of steps before the result was assessed.

https://openalex.org/W1969118190,"Thioredoxins (Trxs), which play a key role in maintaining a redox environment in the cell, are found in almost all organisms. Trxs act as potential reducing agents of disulfide bonds and contain two vicinal cysteines in a CXXC motif at the active site. Trx is also known to activate the DNA binding activity of NF-κB, an important transcription factor. Previously, Trx-related protein 16 from Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda (Cr-TRP16), a 16-kDa Trx-like protein that contains a WCPPC motif, was reported. Here we present the NMR structure of the reduced form of Cr-TRP16, along with its regulation of NF-κB activity. Unlike other 16-kDa Trx-like proteins, Cr-TRP16 contains an additional Cys residue (Cys-15, at the N terminus), through which it forms a homodimer. Moreover, we have explored the molecular basis of Cr-TRP16-mediated activation of NF-κB and showed that Cr-TRP16 exists as a dimer under physiological conditions, and only the dimeric form binds to NF-κB and enhances its DNA binding activity by directly reducing the cysteines in the DNA-binding motif of NF-κB. The C15S mutant of Cr-TRP16 was unable to dimerize and hence does not bind to NF-κB. Based on our finding and combined with the literature, we propose a model of how Cr-TRP16 is likely to bind to NF-κB. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB activation is regulated through Cr-TRP16."

A phosphoryl transfer protein of the PTS, NPr, homologous to HPr, functions to regulate nitrogen metabolism and shows virtually no enzymatic cross-reactivity with HPr. Here we describe the genetic engineering of a ""chimeric"" HPr/NPr protein, termed CPr14 because 14 amino acid residues of the interface were replaced. CPr14 shows decreased activity with most PTS permeases relative to HPr, but increases activity with the broad specificity mannose permease. The results lead to the proposal that HPr is not optimal for most PTS permeases but instead represents a compromise with suboptimal activity for most PTS permeases. The evolutionary implications are discussed."
